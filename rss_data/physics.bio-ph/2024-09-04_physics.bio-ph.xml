      <title>Internal Representations in Spiking Neural Networks, criticality and the Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal information processing in peripheral sensory systems has been associated in several examples to the signature of a critical or near critical state. Furthermore, cortical systems have also been described to be in a critical state in both wake and anesthetized experimental models, both {\it in vitro} and {\it in vivo}. We investigate whether a similar signature characterizes the internal representations (IR) of a multilayer (deep) spiking artificial neural network performing computationally simple but meaningful cognitive tasks, using a methodology inspired in the biological setup, with cortical implanted electrodes in rats, either freely behaving or under different levels of anesthesia. The increase of the characteristic time of the decay of the correlation of fluctuations of the IR, found when the network input changes, are indications of a broad-tailed distribution of IR fluctuations. The broad tails are present even when the network is not yet capable of performing the classification tasks, either due to partial training or to the effect of a low dose of anesthesia in a simple model. However, we don't find enough evidence of power law distributions of avalanche size and duration. We interpret the results from a renormalization group perspective to point out that despite having broad tails, this is not related to a critical transition but rather similar to fluctuations driven by the reversal of the magnetic field in a ferromagnetic system. Another example of persistent correlation of fluctuations of a non critical system is constructed, where a particle undergoes Brownian motion on a slowly varying potential.</description>

      <title>Computational Methods to Investigate Intrinsically Disordered Proteins and their Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1999 Wright and Dyson highlighted the fact that large sections of the proteome of all organisms are comprised of protein sequences that lack globular folded structures under physiological conditions. Since then the biophysics community has made significant strides in unraveling the intricate structural and dynamic characteristics of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). Unlike crystallographic beamlines and their role in streamlining acquisition of structures for folded proteins, an integrated experimental and computational approach aimed at IDPs/IDRs has emerged. In this Perspective we aim to provide a robust overview of current computational tools for IDPs and IDRs, and most recently their complexes and phase separated states, including statistical models, physics-based approaches, and machine learning methods that permit structural ensemble generation and validation against many solution experimental data types.</description>

      <title>A model for contractile stress fibers embedded in bulk actomyosin networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contractile cytoskeletal structures such as fine actomyosin meshworks and stress fibers are essential force-generators for mechanical phenomena in live cells, including motility, morphogenesis, and mechanosensing. While there have been many studies on the rheology and assembly of individual stress fibers, few mathematical models have explicitly modeled the bulk actomyosin network in which stress fibers are embedded, particularly not in the case of high actin turnover. Generally the extent of the interplay between embedded stress fibers and contractile bulk networks is still not well understood. To address this gap, we design a model of stress fibers embedded in bulk actomyosin networks which utilizes the immersed boundary method, allowing one to consider various stress fiber rheologies in the context of an approximately viscous, compressible, contractile bulk network. We characterize the dynamics of bulk actomyosin networks with and without embedded stress fibers, and simulate a laser ablation experiment to demonstrate the effective long-range interactions between stress fibers as well as how perturbations of stress fibers can result in symmetry breaking of the bulk actomyosin network.</description>

      <title>Phase changes of the flow rate in the vertebral artery caused by debranching thoracic endovascular aortic repair: effects of flow path and local vessel stiffness on vertebral arterial pulsation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite numerous studies on cerebral arterial blood flow, there has not yet been a comprehensive description of hemodynamics in patients undergoing debranching thoracic endovascular aortic repair (dTEVAR), a promising surgical option for aortic arch aneurysms. A phase delay of the flow rate in the left vertebral artery (LVA) in patients after dTEVAR compared to those before was experimentally observed, while the phase in the right vertebral artery (RVA) remained almost the same before and after surgery. Since this surgical intervention included stent graft implantation and extra-anatomical bypass, it was expected that the intracranial hemodynamic changes due to dTEVAR were coupled with fluid flow and pulse waves in cerebral arteries. To clarify this issue, A one-dimensional model (1D) was used to numerically investigate the relative contribution (i.e., local vessel stiffness and flow path changes) of the VA flow rate to the phase difference. The numerical results demonstrated a phase delay of flow rate in the LVA but not the RVA in postoperative patients undergoing dTEVAR relative to preoperative patients. The results further showed that the primary factor affecting the phase delay of the flow rate in the LVA after surgery compared to that before was the bypass, i.e., alteration of flow path, rather than stent grafting, i.e., the change in local vessel stiffness. The numerical results provide insights into hemodynamics in postoperative patients undergoing dTEVAR, as well as knowledge about therapeutic decisions.</description>

      <title>Waveform distortion for temperature compensation and synchronization in circadian rhythms: An approach based on the renormalization group method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous biological processes accelerate as temperatures increase, but the period of circadian rhythms remains constant, known as temperature compensation, while synchronizing with the 24h light-dark cycle. We theoretically explores the possible relevance of waveform distortions in circadian gene-protein dynamics to the temperature compensation and synchronization. Our analysis of the Goodwin model provides a coherent explanation of most of temperature compensation hypotheses. Using the renormalization group method, we analytically demonstrate that the decreasing phase of circadian protein oscillations should lengthen with increasing temperature, leading to waveform distortions to maintain a stable period. This waveform-period correlation also occurs in other oscillators like Lotka-Volterra and van der Pol models. A reanalysis of known data nicely confirms our findings on waveform distortion and its impact on synchronization range. Thus we conclude that circadian rhythm waveforms are fundamental to both temperature compensation and synchronization.</description>

      <title>UNC-104 transport properties are robust and independent of changes in its cargo binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cargo distribution within eukaryotic cells relies on the active transport mechanisms driven by molecular motors. Despite their critical role, the intricate relationship between motor transport properties and cargo binding - and its impact on motor distribution - remains inadequately understood. Additionally, improper regulation of ubiquitination, a pivotal post-translational modification that affects protein degradation, activation, and localization, is associated with several neurodegenerative diseases. Recent data showed that ubiquitination can alter motor-cargo binding of the Kinesin-3 motor UNC-104 / KIF1A that transports synaptic vesicles. To investigate how ubiquitin-like modifications affect motor protein function, particularly cargo binding, transport properties, and distribution, we utilize the PLM neuron of C. elegans as a model system. Using fluorescent microscopy, we assess the distribution of cargo-bound UNC-104 motors along the axon and probe their dynamics using FRAP experiments. We model cargo binding kinetics with a Master equation and motor density dynamics using a Fokker-Planck approach. Our combined experimental and theoretical analysis reveals that ubiquitin-like knockdowns enhance UNC-104's cooperative binding to its cargo. However, these modifications do not affect UNC-104's transport properties, such as processivity and diffusivity. Thus, while ubiquitin-like modifications significantly impact the cargo-binding of UNC-104, they do not alter its transport dynamics, keeping the homeostatic distribution of UNC-104 unchanged.</description>

      <title>Hydromechanical field theory of plant morphogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of plants is a hydromechanical phenomenon in which cells enlarge by absorbing water, while their walls expand and remodel under turgor-induced tension. In multicellular tissues, where cells are mechanically interconnected, morphogenesis results from the combined effect of local cell growths, which reflects the action of heterogeneous mechanical, physical, and chemical fields, each exerting varying degrees of nonlocal influence within the tissue. To describe this process, we propose a physical field theory of plant growth. This theory treats the tissue as a poromorphoelastic body, namely a growing poroelastic medium, where growth arises from pressure-induced deformations and osmotically-driven imbibition of the tissue. From this perspective, growing regions correspond to hydraulic sinks, leading to the possibility of complex non-local regulations, such as water competition and growth-induced water potential gradients. More in general, this work aims to establish foundations for a mechanistic, mechanical field theory of morphogenesis in plants, where growth arises from the interplay of multiple physical fields, and where biochemical regulations are integrated through specific physical parameters.</description>

      <title>Segregation in binary mixture with differential contraction among active rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell cortex contraction is essential for shaping cells, enabling movement, ensuring proper division, maintaining tissue integrity, guiding development, and responding to mechanical signals - all critical for the life and health of multicellular organisms. Differential contractions in cell membranes, particularly when cells of different types interact, play a crucial role in the emergence of segregation. In this study, we introduce a model where rings composed of active particles interact through differential membrane contraction within a specified cutoff distance. We demonstrate that segregation arises solely from differential contraction, with the activity of the rings functioning similarly to an effective temperature. Additionally, we observed that segregation involves cluster fusion-diffusion process. However, the decay exponent of the segregation parameter we found is close to $\lambda \sim -1/3$, which differs from the $\lambda \sim -1/4$ predicted by previous theoretical approaches and simulations.</description>

      <title>Margination of artificially stiffened red blood cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Margination, a fundamental process in which leukocytes migrate from the flowing blood to the vessel wall, is well-documented in physiology. However, it is still an open question on how the differences in cell size and stiffness of white and red cells contribute to this phenomenon. To investigate the specific influence of cell stiffness, we conduct experimental and numerical studies on the segregation of a binary mixture of artificially stiffened red blood cells within a suspension of healthy cells. The resulting distribution of stiffened cells within the channel is found to depend on the channel geometry, as demonstrated with slit, rectangular, and cylindrical cross-sections. Notably, an unexpected central peak in the distribution of stiffened RBCs, accompanied by fourfold peaks at the corners, emerges in agreement with simulations. Our results unveil a non-monotonic variation in segregation/margination concerning hematocrit and flow rate, challenging the prevailing belief that higher flow rates lead to enhanced margination.</description>

      <title>Possibilities for methanogenic and acetogenic life in molecular cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to panspermia, life on Earth may have originated from life forms transported through space from elsewhere. These life forms could have passed through molecular clouds, where the process of methanogenesis could have provided enough energy to sustain living organisms. In this study, we have calculated the Gibbs free energy released from synthesizing hydrocarbons for methanogenic (acetogenic) life in a molecular cloud, with methane (acetic acid) as the final metabolic product. Our calculations demonstrate that the chemical reactions during methanogenesis can release enough free energy to support living organisms. The methanogenic life may have served as the ancestor of life on Earth, and there is some preliminary evidence from various molecular biology studies to support this idea. Furthermore, we propose a potential distinguishing signal to test our model.</description>

      <title>From Substrate Dissipation to Internal Dissipation Vertex Model Dynamics: Generating Sustained Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex tissue flows in epithelia are driven by intra- and inter-cellular processes that generate, maintain, and coordinate mechanical forces. There has been growing evidence that cell shape anisotropy, manifested as nematic order, plays an important role in this process. Here we extend an active nematic vertex model by replacing substrate friction with internal viscous dissipation, dominant in epithelia not supported by a substrate or the extracellular matrix, which are found in many early-stage embryos. When coupled to cell shape anisotropy, the internal viscous dissipation allows for long-range velocity correlations and thus enables the spontaneous emergence of flows with a large degree of spatiotemporal organisation. We demonstrate sustained flow in epithelial sheets confined to a channel, providing a link between the cell-level vertex model of tissue dynamics and continuum active nematics, whose behaviour in a channel is theoretically understood and experimentally realisable. Our findings also show a simple mechanism that could account for collective cell migration correlated over distances large compared to the cell size, as observed during morphogenesis.</description>

      <title>Boundary geometry controls a topological defect transition that determines lumen nucleation in embryonic development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological defects determine the collective properties of anisotropic materials. How their configurations are controlled is not well understood however, especially in 3D. In living matter moreover, 2D defects have been linked to biological functions, but the role of 3D polar defects is unclear. Combining computational and experimental approaches, we investigate how confinement geometry controls surface-aligned polar fluids, and what biological role 3D polar defects play in tissues interacting with extracellular boundaries. We discover a charge-preserving transition between 3D defect configurations driven by boundary geometry and independent of material parameters, and show that defect positions predict the locations where fluid-filled lumina -- structures essential for development -- form within the confined polar tissue of the mouse embryo. Experimentally perturbing embryo shape beyond the transition point, we moreover create additional lumina at predicted defect locations. Our work reveals how boundary geometry controls polar defects, and how embryos use this mechanism for shape-dependent lumen formation. We expect this defect control principle to apply broadly to systems with orientational order.</description>
