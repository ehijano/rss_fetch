      <title>Discrete Electron Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of space-charge effects on electron emission typically makes some assumption of continuity and smoothness, whether this is continuity of charge as in the classical derivation of the Child-Langmuir current, or the mean-field approximation used in particle-in-cell simulations. However, when studying the physics of electron emission and propagation at the mesoscale it becomes necessary to consider the discrete nature of electronic charge to account for the space-charge effect of each individual point charge. In this paper we give an extensive analysis of some previous work on the distribution of electrons under space-charge limited conditions. We examine the spacing of electrons as they are emitted from a planar surface, We present simplified models for analysis of such conditions to derive scaling laws for emission and compare them to computer simulations.</description>

      <title>Precise control of high-frequency ultrasounds in thin crystals for the development of tunable narrowband and directional gamma-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a complete methodology for the precise characterization of the acoustic field inside crystal-based devices driven by high-frequency ultrasounds towards the generation of tunable narrowband and directional gamma radiation via undulation of ultra-relativistic charged particles. Such gamma-ray sources have long been anticipated by the scientific community, as they promise new powerful tools for the study of high-energy physical phenomena and the development of novel nuclear technologies. In such devices, a piezoelectric transducer induces tens of MHz harmonic waves inside a silicon monocrystal. Ultra-relativistic charged particles traversing the crystal get trapped within the channels formed by the extremely strong electric fields of the acoustically modulated lattice planes, undergoing undulation and emitting gamma radiation. Precise characterization of the acoustic field in the crystal is crucial for the determination of the expected characteristics of the secondarily generated gamma rays. For this purpose, fast laser refraction imaging is used here to image the acoustic waves by exploiting the spatial redistribution of a laser beam optical intensity caused by the acoustic field. A dedicated computational model is developed for the estimation of the spatial distribution of the pressure and lattice deformation inside the crystal. This methodology provides a framework for future novel gamma-ray sources in high-energy facilities.</description>

      <title>A Collimation System Baseline Design for the Electron Storage Ring at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the baseline design of the electron ring collimation system for the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). The system addresses beam losses in a high-current electron storage ring with superconducting (SC) final-focus magnets and sensitive detectors, where uncontrolled losses can generate heat loads, radiation, and detector backgrounds and damage. The proposed collimation insertion localizes halo particle losses through reducing interaction region beam losses from beam-gas and Touschek scattering by several orders of magnitude while keeping detector backgrounds and cryostat heat loads within acceptable limits. Multi-turn particle tracking simulations show that the collimators do not significantly impact machine acceptance or beam lifetime, and their positions and apertures can be re-optimized for future lattice configurations. Ongoing work includes incorporating crab cavities and solenoid fields into simulations, refining vacuum conditions, and optimizing collimator geometry and materials. This design establishes a robust baseline for the EIC electron ring collimation system and supports continued lattice optimization for machine operations.</description>

      <title>From Natural Language to Control Signals: A Conceptual Framework for Semantic Channel Finding in Complex Experimental Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern experimental platforms such as particle accelerators, fusion devices, telescopes, and industrial process control systems expose tens to hundreds of thousands of control and diagnostic channels accumulated over decades of evolution. Operators and AI systems rely on informal expert knowledge, inconsistent naming conventions, and fragmented documentation to locate signals for monitoring, troubleshooting, and automated control, creating a persistent bottleneck for reliability, scalability, and language-model-driven interfaces. We formalize semantic channel finding-mapping natural-language intent to concrete control-system signals-as a general problem in complex experimental infrastructure, and introduce a four-paradigm framework to guide architecture selection across facility-specific data regimes. The paradigms span (i) direct in-context lookup over curated channel dictionaries, (ii) constrained hierarchical navigation through structured trees, (iii) interactive agent exploration using iterative reasoning and tool-based database queries, and (iv) ontology-grounded semantic search that decouples channel meaning from facility-specific naming conventions. We demonstrate each paradigm through proof-of-concept implementations at four operational facilities spanning two orders of magnitude in scale-from compact free-electron lasers to large synchrotron light sources-and diverse control-system architectures, from clean hierarchies to legacy environments. These implementations achieve 90-97% accuracy on expert-curated operational queries.</description>

      <title>Optical parametric free-electron--photon quantum interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical parametric processes underpin quantum photonics, while free-electron--photon interactions offer agile pathways to generate nontrivial quantum photonic states. These threads have so far largely progressed independently, whereas placing free electrons in a driven nonlinear system can potentially activate coherent parametric interaction channels for joint state engineering of both types of particles. Here we unify these paradigms by developing a general theoretical framework for parametric free-electron--photon interactions in a nonlinear optical system driven by degenerate parametric down-conversion. Unlike free electrons in a linear bath, here they can couple to Bogoliubov quasiparticles through two detuned phase-matching channels, where the parametric process and free-electron interactions can quantum amplify each other. Seeding the interaction with squeezed vacuum yields gain-only or loss-only electron energy spectra, and enables electron-heralded squeezed Fock states; with bare vacuum, postselecting electron energy sidebands generates high-fidelity Schr\"odinger cat states. Our results show how optical parametric interactions can quantum shape free electrons and photons, potentially enabling a quantum parametric dielectric laser accelerator that mitigates the need for temporal phase synchronization, thereby allowing acceleration probabilities to approach unity even for phase-random electrons.</description>

      <title>Generation of near GeV protons by tightly focused laser interacting with down-ramp density plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing proton energy is of great importance in laser-driven proton acceleration with finite laser energy for applications such as cancer therapy. We demonstrate an unusual acceleration scheme that achieves higher proton energies at lower laser energies by reducing the focal spot size. Through particle-in-cell simulations and theoretical modeling, we find that at small spot sizes (0.8 {\mu}m), the proton energy is enhanced by 83.5%, much higher than that under conventional spot sizes (3 {\mu}m). This is because the proton acceleration is dominated by electrons driven by an enhanced ponderomotive force at small spot sizes, generating stronger charge-separation fields that propagate faster. To further improve the proton energy, we analytically derive an optimal electron density profile, which enables phase-stable proton acceleration with an energy increased by 60%. These results are robust across parameter variations, suggesting that advanced focusing techniques and optimal plasma profiles could loose the requirement of laser energy, potentially reducing the dependence on large-scale laser facilities for medical and scientific applications.</description>

      <title>Classical and quantum beam dynamics simulation of the RF photoinjector test bench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present beam-dynamics simulations for an S-band RF photoinjector test bench under development at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research. The facility is intended to produce high-quality electron beams and to enable future generation of relativistic vortex electrons carrying quantized orbital angular momentum (OAM). Simulations of a 1.5-cell RF photogun operating at the currently available accelerating gradient of 45 MV/m demonstrate stable bunch formation at low bunch charge (Q = 0.63 pC), where space-charge effects are weak and the transverse emittance is primarily determined by RF-induced correlations. Optimization of the injection phase and the cathode-region solenoid field results in a robust emittance-compensated regime, yielding a final normalized emittance of 3.2 pi mm mrad. To evaluate the prospects for accelerating vortex electron beams, we further model the quantum evolution of single-electron Laguerre-Gaussian wave packets. The simulations show that acceleration to the multi-MeV energy range significantly suppresses free-space wave-packet spreading and preserves the initial OAM structure, indicating that the proposed test bench provides suitable conditions for forthcoming experimental studies of relativistic vortex electrons.</description>

      <title>A data-driven method to estimate contamination from light ion beam transmutation at colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collisions of relativistic light ions such as oxygen, neon, and magnesium, have been proposed as a way to examine the system-size dependence of dynamics typically associated with the quark-gluon plasma produced in collisions of heavier ions such as xenon, gold, or lead. Recent efforts at both the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have produced large datasets of proton-oxygen, oxygen-oxygen, and neon-neon collisions, catalyzing intense interest in experimental backgrounds associated with light ion collisions. In particular, electromagnetic dissociation of light ions while they are circulating in a collider can result in beam contamination that is difficult to simulate precisely. Here we propose a data-driven method for evaluating the potential impact of beam contaminants on physics analyses. The method exploits the time-dependence and smaller size of contaminant ion species to define control regions that can be used to quantify potential contamination effects. A simple model is used to illustrate the method and to study its robustness. This method can inform studies of recent LHC and RHIC data and could also be useful for future light ion programs at the LHC and beyond.</description>
