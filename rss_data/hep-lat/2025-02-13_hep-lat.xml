      <title>Scale Setting and Strong Coupling Determination in the Gradient Flow Scheme for 2+1 Flavor Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a scale determination, scale setting, and determination of the strong coupling in the gradient flow scheme using the $N_f=2+1$ highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) ensembles generated by the HotQCD Collaboration for bare gauge couplings ranging from $\beta = 7.030$ to $8.400$. The gradient flow scales we obtain in this work are $\sqrt{t_0} = 0.14229(98)$~fm and $w_0 = 0.17190(140)$~fm. Using the decay constants of the kaon and $\eta_s$, as well as the bottomonium mass splitting from the literature, we also calculate the potential scale $r_1$, obtaining $r_1 = 0.3072(22)$~fm. We fit the flow scales to an Allton-type ansatz as a function of $\beta$, providing a polynomial expression that allows for the prediction of lattice spacings at new $beta$ values. As a secondary result, we make an attempt to determine $\Lambda_{\overline{\mathrm{MS}}}$ and use it to estimate the strong coupling in the $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize the status of lattice QCD ensemble generation efforts and their data management characteristics. Namely, these proceedings combine the contributions to a dedicated parallel session during the 41st International Symposium on Lattice Field Theory (Lattice 2024), during which representatives of 16 lattice QCD collaborations provided details on their simulation program, with focus on plans for publication, data management, and storage requirements. The parallel session was organized by the International Lattice Data Grid (ILDG), following an open call to the lattice QCD community for participation in the session.</description>

      <title>Investigating non-local contributions in $B_{s} \to \phi \bar{\ell} \ell$ including higher-twist effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the impact of higher-twist three-particle $B_s$-meson light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) on the non-local form factors for the $B_s\to \phi \bar{\ell} \ell$ transition focusing on the 'charm-loop' contribution within the light-cone sum rule (LCSR) framework. To analytically continue these charm-loop contributions into the kinematically allowed region of the decay, we employ a hadronic dispersion relation that incorporates intermediate resonant states such as the $\phi$, $J/\Psi$ and $\psi(2S)$ mesons. Here, the LCSR predictions serve as inputs, supplemented by experimental data from two-body decays $B_s \to \phi$ $+$ resonance states. Our results indicate that the inclusion of twist-5 and twist-6 LCDAs enhances the non-local form factors$-$by approximately an order of magnitude$-$compared to previous estimates, due to partial disruption of cancellation among different twist contributions. This leads to a dilepton invariant mass-squared ($q^2-$)dependent correction to the Wilson coefficient $C_9$, which is higher than, but still consistent with the Standard Model prediction within uncertainties. Additionally, we update the local form factors to include contributions from higher-twist three-particle $B_s-$meson LCDAs. The phenomenological implications, particularly for the differential branching fraction and angular observables, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Entanglement entropy by tensor renormalization group approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on tensor renormalization group calculations of entanglement entropy in one-dimensional quantum systems. The reduced density matrix of a Gibbs state can be represented as a $1 + 1$-dimensional tensor network, which is analogous to the tensor network representation of the partition function. The HOTRG method is used to approximate the reduced density matrix for arbitrary subsystem sizes, from which we obtain the entanglement entropy. We test our method in the quantum Ising model and obtain the entanglement entropy of the ground state by taking the size of time direction to infinity. The central charge $c$ is obtained as $c = 0.49997(8)$ for a bond dimension $D=96$, which agrees with the theoretical value $c=1/2$ within the error.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Truncation Crafted for UV-divergent QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop the theory of Hamiltonian Truncation (HT) to systematically study RG flows that require the renormalization of coupling constants. This is a necessary step towards making HT a fully general method for QFT calculations. We apply this theory to a number of QFTs defined as relevant deformations of $d=1+1$ CFTs. We investigated three examples of increasing complexity: the deformed Ising, Tricritical-Ising, and non-unitary minimal model $M(3,7)$. The first two examples provide a crosscheck of our methodologies against well established characteristics of these theories. The $M(3,7)$ CFT deformed by its $Z_2$-even operators shows an intricate phase diagram that we clarify. At a boundary of this phase diagram we show that this theory flows, in the IR, to the $M(3,5)$ CFT.</description>

      <title>Perturbative stability and error correction thresholds of quantum codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topologically-ordered phases are stable to local perturbations, and topological quantum error-correcting codes enjoy thresholds to local errors. We connect the two notions of stability by constructing classical statistical mechanics models for decoding general CSS codes and classical linear codes. Our construction encodes correction success probabilities under uncorrelated bit-flip and phase-flip errors, and simultaneously describes a generalized Z2 lattice gauge theory with quenched disorder. We observe that the clean limit of the latter is precisely the discretized imaginary time path integral of the corresponding quantum code Hamiltonian when the errors are turned into a perturbative X or Z magnetic field. Motivated by error correction considerations, we define general order parameters for all such generalized Z2 lattice gauge theories, and show that they are generally lower bounded by success probabilities of error correction. For CSS codes satisfying the LDPC condition and with a sufficiently large code distance, we prove the existence of a low temperature ordered phase of the corresponding lattice gauge theories, particularly for those lacking Euclidean spatial locality and/or when there is a nonzero code rate. We further argue that these results provide evidence to stable phases in the corresponding perturbed quantum Hamiltonians, obtained in the limit of continuous imaginary time. To do so, we distinguish space- and time-like defects in the lattice gauge theory. A high free-energy cost of space-like defects corresponds to a successful "memory experiment" and suppresses the energy splitting among the ground states, while a high free-energy cost of time-like defects corresponds to a successful "stability experiment" and points to a nonzero gap to local excitations.</description>

      <title>Exotic phases in finite-density $\mathbb{Z}_3$ theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lattice $\mathbb{Z}_3$ theories with complex actions share many key features with finite-density QCD including a sign problem and $CK$ symmetry. Complex $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin and gauge models exhibit a generalized Kramers-Wannier duality mapping them onto chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin and gauge models, which are simulatable with standard lattice methods in large regions of parameter space. The Migdal-Kadanoff real-space renormalization group (RG) preserves this duality, and we use it to compute the approximate phase diagram of both spin and gauge $\mathbb{Z}_3$ models in dimensions one through four. Chiral $\mathbb{Z}_3$ spin models are known to exhibit a Devil's Flower phase structure, with inhomogeneous phases which can be thought of as $\mathbb{Z}_3$ analogues of chiral spirals. Out of the large class of models we study, we find that only chiral spin models and their duals have a Devil's Flower structure with an infinite set of inhomogeneous phases, a result we attribute to Elitzur's theorem. We also find that different forms of the Migdal-Kadanoff RG produce different numbers of phases, a violation of the expectation for universal behavior from a real-space RG. We discuss extensions of our work to $\mathbb{Z}_N$ models, SU($N$) models and nonzero temperature.</description>

      <title>Complete dispersive evaluation of the hadronic light-by-light contribution to muon $g-2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hadronic light-by-light (HLbL) scattering defines one of the critical contributions in the Standard-Model prediction of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. In this Letter, we present a complete evaluation using a dispersive formalism, in which the HLbL tensor is reconstructed from its discontinuities, expressed in terms of simpler hadronic matrix elements that can be extracted from experiment. Profiting from recent developments in the determination of axial-vector transition form factors, short-distance constraints for the HLbL tensor, and the vector-vector-axial-vector correlator, we obtain $a_\mu^\text{HLbL}=101.9(7.9)\times 10^{-11}$, which meets the precision requirements set by the final result of the Fermilab experiment.</description>
