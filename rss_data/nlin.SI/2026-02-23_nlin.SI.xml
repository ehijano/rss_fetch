      <title>Subalgebras of integrals, commutants, and superintegrable deformations of Lotka-Volterra systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Lie-algebraic notion of commutant in the setting of Poisson algebra. This provides a framework for deforming Hamiltonian differential equations. By taking a subalgebra of the algebra of integrals, and considering the set of functions that Poisson commute with that subalgebra, the Hamiltonian can be deformed, while retaining integrability. We deform Liouville integrable and superintegrable Lotka-Volterra systems studied in [19]. We present different explicit constructions considering Abelian and non-Abelian subalgebras of integrals. We obtain superintegrable systems for specific dimensions, and in arbitrary dimension. Polynomial systems are deformed to rational systems, some of which have non-rational integrals. Superintegrability seems to be preserved in this approach.</description>

      <title>Twisted symmetric exclusion processes and set-theoretical $R$-matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate periodic integrable Markov models, constructed from set-theoretical solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. We first focus on the simplest class of solutions, called Lyubashenko solutions. We show that the resulting models are equivalent to some twisted Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process (SSEP), which are usual periodic SSEP models where a twist is added on a bond of the ring. We also provide various possible interpretations for these Markov models. Then, we study the long time dynamics of the twisted SSEP, characterising its different stationary states and counting them. Allowing the twist to vary, we examine the possible transitions between the different stationary states. Finally, we extend our construction of Markov models to set-theoretical solutions that are more general than Lyubashenko solutions and show that such models are not equivalent to a twisted SSEP in general.</description>

      <title>On differential equations invariant under a projective transformation group: integrability and reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09800v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a projective transformation and establish the invariants for this transformation group up to order seven. We use the obtained invariants to construct a class of nonlinear evolution equations and identify some symmetry-integrable equations in this class. Notably, the only symmetry-integrable evolution equation of order three in this class is a fully-nonlinear equation for which we find the recursion operator and its connection to the Schwarzian KdV. We furthermore establish that higher-order symmetry-integrable equations in this class belong to the hierarchy of the fully-nonlinear 3rd-order equation and prove this for the 5th-order case as well as for the quasi-linear 7th-order case. We list all symmetry reductions of this 3rd-order fully-nonlinear symmetry-integrable evolution equation to ordinary differential equations by exploiting the 1-dimensional optimal Lie symmetry subalgebras of the transformation group. We also identify the ordinary differential equations that are invariant under this projective transformation and reduce the order of these equations.</description>
