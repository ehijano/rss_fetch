      <title>Random sampling and polynomial-free interpolation by Generalized MultiQuadrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that interpolation matrices for Generalized MultiQuadrics (GMQ) of order greater than one are almost surely nonsingular without polynomial addition, in any dimension and with any continuous random distribution of sampling points. We also include a new class of generalized MultiQuadrics recently proposed by Buhmann and Ortmann.</description>

      <title>Numerical methods for solving the linearized model of a hinged-free reduced plate arising in flow structure interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of partially hinged and partially free rectangular plate that aims to represent a suspension bridge subject to some external forces (for example the wind) is considered in order to model and simulate the unstable end behavior.
  Such a problem can be modeled by a plate evolution equation, which is nonlinear with a nonlocal stretching effect in the spanwise direction.
  The external forces are periodic in time and cause the vortex shedding on the structure (on the surface of the plate) and thus it may cause damage to the material.
  Numerical study of the behavior of steady state solutions for different values of the force velocity are provided with two finite element methods of different type.</description>

      <title>New Asymptotic Preserving, Hybrid Discontinuous Galerkin Methods the Radiation Transport Equation with Isotropic Scattering and Diffusive Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) methods are widely adopted to discretize the radiation transport equation (RTE) with diffusive scalings. One of the most important advantages of the DG methods for RTE is their asymptotic preserving (AP) property, in the sense that they preserve the diffusive limits of the equation in the discrete setting, without requiring excessive refinement of the discretization. However, compared to finite element methods or finite volume methods, the employment of DG methods also increases the number of unknowns, which requires more memory and computational time to solve the problems. In this paper, when the spherical harmonic method is applied for the angular discretization, we perform an asymptotic analysis which shows that to retain the uniform convergence, it is only necessary to employ non-constant elements for the degree zero moment only in the DG spatial discretization. Based on this observation, we propose a heterogeneous DG method that employs polynomial spaces of different degrees for the degree zero and remaining moments respectively. To improve the convergence order, we further develop a spherical harmonics hybrid DG finite volume method, which preserves the AP property and convergence rate while tremendously reducing the number of unknowns. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>On $\tau$-preconditioners for a quasi-compact difference scheme to Riesz fractional diffusion equations with variable coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present study, we consider the numerical method for Toeplitz-like linear systems arising from the $d$-dimensional Riesz space fractional diffusion equations (RSFDEs). We apply the Crank-Nicolson (CN) technique to discretize the temporal derivative and apply a quasi-compact finite difference method to discretize the Riesz space fractional derivatives. For the $d$-dimensional problem, the corresponding coefficient matrix is the sum of a product of a (block) tridiagonal matrix multiplying a diagonal matrix and a $d$-level Toeplitz matrix. We develop a sine transform based preconditioner to accelerate the convergence of the GMRES method. Theoretical analyses show that the upper bound of relative residual norm of the preconditioned GMRES method with the proposed preconditioner is mesh-independent, which leads to a linear convergence rate. Numerical results are presented to confirm the theoretical results regarding the preconditioned matrix and to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed preconditioner.</description>

      <title>A novel interpretation of Nesterov's acceleration via variable step-size linear multistep methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nesterov's acceleration in continuous optimization can be understood in a novel way when Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG) method is considered as a linear multistep (LM) method for gradient flow. Although the NAG method for strongly convex functions (NAG-sc) has been fully discussed, the NAG method for $L$-smooth convex functions (NAG-c) has not. To fill this gap, we show that the existing NAG-c method can be interpreted as a variable step size LM (VLM) for the gradient flow. Surprisingly, the VLM allows linearly increasing step sizes, which explains the acceleration in the convex case. Here, we introduce a novel technique for analyzing the absolute stability of VLMs. Subsequently, we prove that NAG-c is optimal in a certain natural class of VLMs. Finally, we construct a new broader class of VLMs by optimizing the parameters in the VLM for ill-conditioned problems. According to numerical experiments, the proposed method outperforms the NAG-c method in ill-conditioned cases. These results imply that the numerical analysis perspective of the NAG is a promising working environment, and considering a broader class of VLMs could further reveal novel methods.</description>

      <title>An adaptive Euler-Maruyama scheme for SDDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an adaptive numerical method for stochastic delay differential equations (SDDEs) with a non-global Lipschitz drift term and a non-constant delay, building upon the work of Wei Fang and others. The method adapts the step size based on the growth of the drift term. Differing slightly from the conventional Euler-Maruyama format, this paper addresses the estimation of the delay term by substituting it with the numerically obtained solution closest to the left endpoint.This approach overcomes the challenge of numerical nodes not falling within the nodes after subtracting the delay. The paper proves the convergence of the numerical method for a class of non-global Lipschitz continuous SDDEs under the assumption that the step size function satisfies certain conditions.</description>

      <title>Optimal complexity solution of space-time finite element systems for state-based parabolic distributed optimal control problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a distributed optimal control problem subject to a parabolic evolution equation as constraint. The control will be considered in the energy norm of the anisotropic Sobolev space $[H_{0;,0}^{1,1/2}(Q)]^\ast$, such that the state equation of the partial differential equation defines an isomorphism onto $H^{1,1/2}_{0;0,}(Q)$. Thus, we can eliminate the control from the tracking type functional to be minimized, to derive the optimality system in order to determine the state. Since the appearing operator induces an equivalent norm in $H_{0;0,}^{1,1/2}(Q)$, we will replace it by a computable realization of the anisotropic Sobolev norm, using a modified Hilbert transformation. We are then able to link the cost or regularization parameter $\varrho&gt;0$ to the distance of the state and the desired target, solely depending on the regularity of the target. For a conforming space-time finite element discretization, this behavior carries over to the discrete setting, leading to an optimal choice $\varrho = h_x^2$ of the regularization parameter $\varrho$ to the spatial finite element mesh size $h_x$. Using a space-time tensor product mesh, error estimates for the distance of the computable state to the desired target are derived. The main advantage of this new approach is, that applying sparse factorization techniques, a solver of optimal, i.e., almost linear, complexity is proposed and analyzed. The theoretical results are complemented by numerical examples, including discontinuous and less regular targets. Moreover, this approach can be applied also to optimal control problems subject to non-linear state equations.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a confining ring potential with a Gaussian profile. By introducing a rotating sinusoidal perturbation, we numerically highlight the nucleation of quantum vortices in a particular regime throughout the dynamics. Numerical computations are made via a Strang splitting time integration and a two-point flux approximation Finite Volume scheme based on a particular admissible triangulation.

      <description>arXiv:2404.10391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the spectral difference method based on the p-th order Raviart~-- Thomas space (p=1,2,3) on regular triangular meshes for the scalar transport equation. The solution converges with the order p if the transport velocity is parallel to a family of mesh edges and with the order p+1 otherwise. We prove this fact for p=1 and show it for p=1,2,3 in numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: New differential-recurrence relations for B-spline basis functions are given. Using these relations, a recursive method for finding the Bernstein-B\'{e}zier coefficients of B-spline basis functions over a single knot span is proposed. The algorithm works for any knot sequence which guarantees that all B-spline functions are at least $C^0$-continuous. It has good numerical behavior and has an asymptotically optimal computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of a Null Field Method-Surface Equivalence Principle Approach for Scattering by Dielectric Cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The null-field method (NFM) and the method of auxiliary sources (MAS) have been both used extensively for the numerical solution of boundary-value problems arising in diverse applications involving propagation and scattering of waves. It has been shown that, under certain conditions, the applicabil- ity of MAS may be restricted by issues concerning the divergence of the auxiliary currents, manifested by the appearance of exponentially large os- cillations. In this work, we combine the NFM with the surface equivalence principle (SEP) and investigate analytically the convergence properties of the combined NFM-SEP with reference to the problem of (internal or external) line-source excitation of a dielectric cylinder. Our main purpose is to prove that (contrary to the MAS) the discrete NFM-SEP currents, when prop- erly normalized, always converge to the corresponding continuous current densities, and thus no divergence and oscillations phenomena appear. The theoretical analysis of the NFM-SEP is accompanied by detailed comparisons with the MAS as well as with representative numerical results illustrating the conclusions.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Based Optimization Workflow for Tuning Numerical Settings of Differential Equation Solvers for Boundary Value Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several numerical differential equation solvers have been employed effectively over the years as an alternative to analytical solvers to quickly and conveniently solve differential equations. One category of these is boundary value solvers, which are used to solve real-world problems formulated as differential equations with boundary conditions. These solvers require certain numerical settings to solve the differential equations that affect their solvability and performance. A systematic fine-tuning of these settings is required to obtain the desired solution and performance. Currently, these settings are either selected by trial and error or require domain expertise. In this paper, we propose a machine learning-based optimization workflow for fine-tuning the numerical settings to reduce the time and domain expertise required in the process. In the evaluation section, we discuss the scalability, stability, and reliability of the proposed workflow. We demonstrate our workflow on a numerical boundary value problem solver.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the 2D acoustic system with the Gaussian pulse as the initial data. This case was proposed at the first Workshop on benchmark problems in computational aeroacoustics, and it is commonly used for the verification of numerical methods. We construct an efficient algorithm to evaluate the exact solution for a given time t and distance r. For a precision eps, it takes c*ln(1/eps) operations (the evaluation of a Bessel function counts as one operation) where c does not depend on t and r. This becomes possible by using three different integral representations and an asymptotic series depending on t and r.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel certified model order reduction (MOR) algorithm for switched descriptor systems applicable to large-scale systems. Our algorithm combines the idea of [Hossain \&amp; Trenn, Technical report, 2023] to reformulate the switched descriptor system as a switched ordinary differential equation with jumps and an extension of the balanced truncation for switched ODE from [Pontes Duff et al., IEEE Trans.~Automat.~Control, 2020]. Besides being the first MOR method for switched descriptor systems applicable to the large-scale setting, we give a detailed numerical analysis by incorporating the error in the computation of the system Gramians in the a-priori error bound for the output of the reduced system. In more detail, we demonstrate, theoretically and numerically, that the standard error bound is not applicable, and a certificate must account for the numerical approximation errors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mass-conservative high-order unfitted finite element method for convection-diffusion equations in evolving domains is proposed. The space-time method presented in [P. Hansbo, M. G. Larson, S. Zahedi, Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Engrg. 307 (2016)] is extended to naturally achieve mass conservation by utilizing Reynold's transport theorem. Furthermore, by partitioning the time-dependent domain into macroelements, a more efficient stabilization procedure for the cut finite element method in time-dependent domains is presented. Numerical experiments illustrate that the method fulfills mass conservation, attains high-order convergence, and the condition number of the resulting system matrix is controlled while sparsity is increased. Problems in bulk domains as well as coupled bulk-surface problems are considered.</description>

      <title>Finite-dimensional approximations of push-forwards on locally analytic functionals and truncation of least-squares polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a theoretical framework for investigating analytic maps from finite discrete data, elucidating mathematical machinery underlying the polynomial approximation with least-squares in multivariate situations. Our approach is to consider the push-forward on the space of locally analytic functionals, instead of directly handling the analytic map itself. We establish a methodology enabling appropriate finite-dimensional approximation of the push-forward from finite discrete data, through the theory of the Fourier--Borel transform and the Fock space. Moreover, we prove a rigorous convergence result with a convergence rate. As an application, we prove that it is not the least-squares polynomial, but the polynomial obtained by truncating its higher-degree terms, that approximates analytic functions and further allows for approximation beyond the support of the data distribution. One advantage of our theory is that it enables us to apply linear algebraic operations to the finite-dimensional approximation of the push-forward. Utilizing this, we prove the convergence of a method for approximating an analytic vector field from finite data of the flow map of an ordinary differential equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove the well-posedness of weak entropy solutions of a scalar non-local traffic flow model with time delay. Existence is obtained by convergence of finite volume approximate solutions constructed by Lax-Friedrich and Hilliges-Weidlich schemes, while the L1 stability with respect to the initial data and the delay parameter relies on a Kruzkov-type doubling of variable technique.Numerical tests are provided to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed schemes, as well as the solution dependence on the delay and look-ahead parameters.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a new dispersed Haar-like filter for efficiently detection face. The basic idea for finding the filter is maximising between-class and minimising within-class variance. The proposed filters can be considered as an optimal configuration dispersed Haar-like filters; filters with disjoint black and white parts.</description>

      <title>Flow-Acoustics: Theory and Benchmarking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The urgent need for transitioning to green energy solutions, particularly in the context of house heating and urban redensification, has brought the issue of fan noise aeroacoustics investigations to the forefront. As societies worldwide strive to mitigate climate change and reduce carbon emissions, adopting sustainable heating technologies such as air heat pumps has gained significant traction. In Germany, renowned for its commitment to environmental sustainability, the "TA L\"arm" regulations, derived from the "Bundes-Immissionsschutzgesetz," impose stringent limits on noise levels both inside and outside buildings across various applications. These regulations delineate permissible noise levels during daytime (6 AM to 10 PM) and nighttime (10 PM to 6 AM), with particular emphasis on protecting residential areas with low noise limits. Moreover, the noise limits prescribed for indoor environments are even more stringent. Given the necessity of maintaining acoustic comfort and quality of life, compliance with these regulations necessitates meticulous attention to noise generation sources, especially those associated with heating and ventilation systems. Consequently, understanding and mitigating fan noise through aeroacoustic investigations is essential to ensure the successful adoption and integration of green energy solutions in residential and urban settings. In the following, an experimental benchmark for a low-pressure rise axial fan (FAN-01) is presented, and several prediction methods of the sound pressure and sound power are evaluated.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Interpolation in Unisolvent Nodes -- Lifting the Curse of Dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.10824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.10824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend Newton and Lagrange interpolation to arbitrary dimensions. The core contribution that enables this is a generalized notion of non-tensorial unisolvent nodes, i.e., nodes on which the multivariate polynomial interpolant of a function is unique. By validation, we reach the optimal exponential Trefethen rates for a class of analytic functions, we term Trefethen functions. The number of interpolation nodes required for computing the optimal interpolant depends sub-exponentially on the dimension, hence resisting the curse of dimensionality. Based on these results, we propose an algorithm to efficiently and numerically stably solve arbitrary-dimensional interpolation problems, with at most quadratic runtime and linear memory requirement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06624v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel stepsize based on \BB method for solving some challenging optimization problems efficiently, named regularized \BB (RBB) stepsize. We indicate that RBB stepsize is the close solution to a $\ell_{2}^{2}$-regularized least squares problem. When the regularized item vanishes, the RBB stepsize reduces to the original \BB stepsize. RBB stepsize includes a class of valid stepsizes, such as another version of \BB stepsize. The global convergence of the corresponding RBB algorithm is proved in solving convex quadratic optimization problems. One scheme for adaptively generating regularization parameters was proposed, named adaptive two-step parameter. An enhanced RBB stepsize is used for solving quadratic and general optimization problems more efficiently. RBB stepsize could overcome the instability of BB stepsize in many ill-conditioned optimization problems. Moreover, RBB stepsize is more robust than BB stepsize in numerical experiments. Numerical examples show the advantage of using the proposed stepsize to solve some challenging optimization problems vividly.</description>

      <title>On the accuracy of Prony's method for recovery of exponential sums with closely spaced exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we establish accuracy bounds of Prony's method (PM) for recovery of sparse measures from incomplete and noisy frequency measurements, or the so-called problem of super-resolution, when the minimal separation between the points in the support of the measure may be much smaller than the Rayleigh limit. In particular, we show that PM is optimal with respect to the previously established min-max bound for the problem, in the setting when the measurement bandwidth is constant, with the minimal separation going to zero. Our main technical contribution is an accurate analysis of the inter-relations between the different errors in each step of PM, resulting in previously unnoticed cancellations. We also prove that PM is numerically stable in finite-precision arithmetic. We believe our analysis will pave the way to providing accurate analysis of known algorithms for the super-resolution problem in full generality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12377v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a partial-differential-equation-based optimal path-planning framework for curvature constrained motion, with application to vehicles in 2- and 3-spatial-dimensions. This formulation relies on optimal control theory, dynamic programming, and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. We develop efficient and scalable algorithms for solutions of high dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi equations which can solve these types of path-planning problems efficiently, even in high dimensions, while maintaining the Hamilton-Jacobi formulation. Because our method is rooted in optimal control theory and has no black box components, it has solid interpretability, and thus averts the tradeoff between interpretability and efficiency for high-dimensional path-planning problems. We demonstrate our method with several examples.</description>

      <title>Growth factors of orthogonal matrices and local behavior of Gaussian elimination with partial and complete pivoting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian elimination (GE) is the most used dense linear solver. Error analysis of GE with selected pivoting strategies on well-conditioned systems can focus on studying the behavior of growth factors. Although exponential growth is possible with GE with partial pivoting (GEPP), growth tends to stay much smaller in practice. Support for this behavior was provided recently by Huang and Tikhomirov's average-case analysis of GEPP, which showed GEPP growth factors for Gaussian matrices stay at most polynomial with very high probability. GE with complete pivoting (GECP) has also seen a lot of recent interest, with improvements to both lower and upper bounds on worst-case GECP growth provided by Bisain, Edelman and Urschel in 2023. We are interested in studying how GEPP and GECP behave on the same linear systems as well as studying large growth on particular subclasses of matrices, including orthogonal matrices. Moreover, as a means to better address the question of why large growth is rarely encountered, we further study matrices with a large difference in growth between using GEPP and GECP, and we explore how the smaller growth strategy dominates behavior in a small neighborhood of the initial matrix.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the kinetic chemotaxis kernel using macroscopic data: well-posedness and ill-posedness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bacterial motion is guided by external stimuli (chemotaxis), and the motion described on the mesoscopic scale is uniquely determined by a parameter $K$ that models velocity change response from the bacteria. This parameter is termed chemotaxis kernel. In a practical setting, experimental data was collected to infer this kernel. In this article, a PDE-constrained optimization framework is deployed to perform this reconstruction using velocity-averaged, localized data taken in the interior of the domain. The problem can be well-posed or ill-posed depending on the data preparation and the experimental setup. In particular, we propose one specific design that guarantees numerical reconstructability and local convergence. This design is adapted to the discretization of $K$ in space and decouples the reconstruction of local values of $K$ into smaller cell problems, opening up parallelization opportunities. Numerical evidences support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new fractional Laplacian for bounded domains, expressed as a conservation law and thus particularly suited to finite-volume schemes. Our approach permits the direct prescription of no-flux boundary conditions. We first show the well-posedness theory for the fractional heat equation. We also develop a numerical scheme, which correctly captures the action of the fractional Laplacian and its anomalous diffusion effect. We benchmark numerical solutions for the L\'evy-Fokker-Planck equation against known analytical solutions. We conclude by numerically exploring properties of these equations with respect to their stationary states and long-time asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Robust Methods for Multiscale Coarse Approximations of Diffusion Models in Perforated Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15669v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the Poisson equation posed in a domain containing a large number of polygonal perforations, we propose a low-dimensional coarse approximation space based on a coarse polygonal partitioning of the domain. Similarly to other multiscale numerical methods, this coarse space is spanned by locally discrete harmonic basis functions. Along the subdomain boundaries, the basis functions are piecewise polynomial. The main contribution of this article is an error estimate regarding the H1-projection over the coarse space which depends only on the regularity of the solution over the edges of the coarse partitioning. For a specific edge refinement procedure, the error analysis establishes superconvergence of the method even if the true solution has a low general regularity. Combined with domain decomposition (DD) methods, the coarse space leads to an efficient two-level iterative linear solver which reaches the fine-scale finite element error in few iterations. It also bodes well as a preconditioner for Krylov methods and provides scalability with respect to the number of subdomains. Numerical experiments showcase the increased precision of the coarse approximation as well as the efficiency and scalability of the coarse space as a component of a DD algorithm.</description>

      <title>Residual Based Error Estimator for Chemical-Mechanically Coupled Battery Active Particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive finite element methods are a powerful tool to obtain numerical simulation results in a reasonable time. Due to complex chemical and mechanical couplings in lithium-ion batteries, numerical simulations are very helpful to investigate promising new battery active materials such as amorphous silicon featuring a higher energy density than graphite. Based on a thermodynamically consistent continuum model with large deformation and chemo-mechanically coupled approach, we compare three different spatial adaptive refinement strategies: Kelly-, gradient recovery- and residual based error estimation. For the residual based case, the strong formulation of the residual is explicitly derived. With amorphous silicon as example material, we investigate two 3D representative host particle geometries, reduced with symmetry assumptions to a 1D unit interval and a 2D elliptical domain. Our numerical studies show that the Kelly estimator overestimates the error, whereas the gradient recovery estimator leads to lower refinement levels and a good capture of the change of the lithium flux. The residual based error estimator reveals a strong dependency on the cell error part which can be improved by a more suitable choice of constants to be more efficient. In a 2D domain, the concentration has a larger influence on the mesh distribution than the Cauchy stress.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-term dynamics of particles involved in an incompressible flow with a small viscosity ($\epsilon&gt;0$) and slow chemical reactions, is depicted by a class of stochastic reaction-diffusion-advection (RDA) equations with a fast advection term of magnitude $1/\epsilon$. It has been shown in [7] the fast advection asymptotics of stochastic RDA equation in $\mathbb{R}^2$ can be characterized through a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) on the graph associated with certain Hamiltonian. To simulate such fast advection asymptotics, we introduce and study an asymptotic-preserving (AP) exponential Euler approximation for the multiscale stochastic RDA equation. There are three key ingredients in proving asymptotic-preserving property of the proposed approximation. First, a strong error estimate, which depends on $1/\epsilon$ linearly, is obtained via a variational argument. Second, we prove the consistency of exponential Euler approximations on the fast advection asymptotics between the original problem and the SPDE on graph. Last, a graph weighted space is introduced to quantify the approximation error for SPDE on graph, which avoids the possible singularity near the vertices. Numerical experiments are carried out to support the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a new numerical method for the minimization under constraints of a discrete energy modeling multicomponents rotating Bose-Einstein condensates in the regime of strong confinement and with rotation. Moreover, we consider both segregation and coexistence regimes between the components. The method includes a discretization of a continuous energy in space dimension 2 and a gradient algorithm with adaptive time step and projection for the minimization. It is well known that, depending on the regime, the minimizers may display different structures, sometimes with vorticity (from singly quantized vortices, to vortex sheets and giant holes). In order to study numerically the structures of the minimizers, we introduce in this paper a numerical algorithm for the computation of the indices of the vortices, as well as an algorithm for the computation of the indices of vortex sheets. Several computations are carried out, to illustrate the efficiency of the method, to cover different physical cases, to validate recent theoretical results as well as to support conjectures. Moreover, we compare this method with an alternative method from the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The limited memory steepest descent method (Fletcher, 2012) for unconstrained optimization problems stores a few past gradients to compute multiple stepsizes at once. We review this method and propose new variants. For strictly convex quadratic objective functions, we study the numerical behavior of different techniques to compute new stepsizes. In particular, we introduce a method to improve the use of harmonic Ritz values. We also show the existence of a secant condition associated with LMSD, where the approximating Hessian is projected onto a low-dimensional space. In the general nonlinear case, we propose two new alternatives to Fletcher's method: first, the addition of symmetry constraints to the secant condition valid for the quadratic case; second, a perturbation of the last differences between consecutive gradients, to satisfy multiple secant equations simultaneously. We show that Fletcher's method can also be interpreted from this viewpoint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the pivotal tasks in scientific machine learning is to represent underlying dynamical systems from time series data. Many methods for such dynamics learning explicitly require the derivatives of state data, which are not directly available and can be approximated conventionally by finite differences. However, the discrete approximations of time derivatives may result in poor estimations when state data are scarce and/or corrupted by noise, thus compromising the predictiveness of the learned dynamical models. To overcome this technical hurdle, we propose a new method that learns nonlinear dynamics through a Bayesian inference of characterizing model parameters. This method leverages a Gaussian process representation of states, and constructs a likelihood function using the correlation between state data and their derivatives, yet prevents explicit evaluations of time derivatives. Through a Bayesian scheme, a probabilistic estimate of the model parameters is given by the posterior distribution, and thus a quantification is facilitated for uncertainties from noisy state data and the learning process. Specifically, we will discuss the applicability of the proposed method to several typical scenarios for dynamical systems: identification and estimation with an affine parametrization, nonlinear parametric approximation without prior knowledge, and general parameter estimation for a given dynamical system.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-preserving finite difference method for partially dissipative hyperbolic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the preservation of asymptotic properties of partially dissipative hyperbolic systems when switching to a discrete setting. We prove that one of the simplest consistent and unconditionally stable numerical methods - the central finite difference scheme - preserves both the asymptotic behaviour and the parabolic relaxation limit of one-dimensional partially dissipative hyperbolic systems which satisfy the Kalman rank condition.
  The large time asymptotic-preserving property is achieved by conceiving time-weighted perturbed energy functionals in the spirit of the hypocoercivity theory. For the relaxation-preserving property, drawing inspiration from the observation that solutions in the continuous case exhibit distinct behaviours in low and high frequencies, we introduce a novel discrete Littlewood-Paley theory tailored to the central finite difference scheme. This allows us to prove Bernstein-type estimates for discrete differential operators and leads to a new relaxation result: the strong convergence of the discrete linearized compressible Euler system with damping towards the discrete heat equation, uniformly with respect to the mesh parameter.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we primarily focus on analyzing the stability property of phase retrieval by examining the bi-Lipschitz property of the map $\Phi_{\boldsymbol{A}}(\boldsymbol{x})=|\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{x}|\in \mathbb{R}_+^m$, where $\boldsymbol{x}\in \mathbb{H}^d$ and $\boldsymbol{A}\in \mathbb{H}^{m\times d}$ is the measurement matrix for $\mathbb{H}\in\{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}\}$. We define the condition number $\beta_{\boldsymbol{A}}=\frac{U_{\boldsymbol{A}}}{L_{\boldsymbol{A}}}$, where $L_{\boldsymbol{A}}$ and $U_{\boldsymbol{A}}$ represent the optimal lower and upper Lipschitz constants, respectively. We establish the first universal lower bound on $\beta_{\boldsymbol{A}}$ by demonstrating that for any ${\boldsymbol{A}}\in\mathbb{H}^{m\times d}$, \begin{equation*} \beta_{\boldsymbol{A}}\geq \beta_0^{\mathbb{H}}=\begin{cases} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\pi-2}}\,\,\approx\,\, 1.659 &amp; \text{if $\mathbb{H}=\mathbb{R}$,}\\ \sqrt{\frac{4}{4-\pi}}\,\,\approx\,\, 2.159 &amp; \text{if $\mathbb{H}=\mathbb{C}$.} \end{cases} \end{equation*} We prove that the condition number of a standard Gaussian matrix in $\mathbb{H}^{m\times d}$ asymptotically matches the lower bound $\beta_0^{\mathbb{H}}$ for both real and complex cases. This result indicates that the constant lower bound $\beta_0^{\mathbb{H}}$ is asymptotically tight, holding true for both the real and complex scenarios. As an application of this result, we utilize it to investigate the performance of quadratic models for phase retrieval. Lastly, we establish that for any odd integer $m\geq 3$, the harmonic frame $\boldsymbol{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times 2}$ possesses the minimum condition number among all $\boldsymbol{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times 2}$. We are confident that these findings carry substantial implications for enhancing our understanding of phase retrieval.</description>
