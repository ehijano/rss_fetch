      <title>Applications of Deep Learning parameterization of Ocean Momentum Forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mesoscale eddies are of utmost importance in understanding ocean dynamics and the transport of heat, salt, and nutrients. Accurate representation of these eddies in ocean models is essential for improving model predictions. However, accurately representing these mesoscale features in numerical models is challenging due to their relatively small size. In this study, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) that combines data-driven techniques with physical principles to develop a robust and interpretable parameterization scheme for mesoscale eddies in ocean modeling. We first analyze a high-resolution reanalysis dataset to extract subgrid eddy momentum and use machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and correlations. To ensure physical consistency, we have introduced conservation of momentum constraints in our CNN parameterization scheme through soft and hard constraints. The interpretability analysis illustrate that the pre-trained CNN parameterization shows promising results in accurately solving the resolved mean velocity at the local scale and effectively capturing the representation of unresolved subgrid turbulence processes at the global scale. Furthermore, to validate the CNN parameterization scheme offline, we conduct simulations using the MITgcm ocean model. A series of experiments is conducted to compare the performance of the model with the CNN parameterization scheme and high-resolution simulations. The offline validation using MITgcm simulations demonstrates the effectiveness of the CNN parameterization scheme in improving the representation of mesoscale eddies in the ocean model. Incorporating the CNN parameterization scheme leads to better agreement with high-resolution simulations and a more accurate representation of the kinetic energy spectra.</description>

      <title>Pi-fusion: Physics-informed diffusion model for learning fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-informed deep learning has been developed as a novel paradigm for learning physical dynamics recently. While general physics-informed deep learning methods have shown early promise in learning fluid dynamics, they are difficult to generalize in arbitrary time instants in real-world scenario, where the fluid motion can be considered as a time-variant trajectory involved large-scale particles. Inspired by the advantage of diffusion model in learning the distribution of data, we first propose Pi-fusion, a physics-informed diffusion model for predicting the temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field in fluid dynamics. Physics-informed guidance sampling is proposed in the inference procedure of Pi-fusion to improve the accuracy and interpretability of learning fluid dynamics. Furthermore, we introduce a training strategy based on reciprocal learning to learn the quasiperiodical pattern of fluid motion and thus improve the generalizability of the model. The proposed approach are then evaluated on both synthetic and real-world dataset, by comparing it with state-of-the-art physics-informed deep learning methods. Experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing methods for predicting temporal evolution of velocity and pressure field, confirming its strong generalization by drawing probabilistic inference of forward process and physics-informed guidance sampling. The proposed Pi-fusion can also be generalized in learning other physical dynamics governed by partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>Impact of ageostrophic dynamics on the predictability of Lagrangian trajectories in surface-ocean turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent flows at the surface of the ocean deviate from geostrophic equilibrium on scales smaller than about 10 km. These scales are associated with important vertical transport of active and passive tracers, and should play a prominent role in the heat transport at climatic scales and for plankton dynamics. Measuring velocity fields on such small scales is notoriously difficult but new, high-resolution satellite altimetry is starting to reveal them. However, the satellite-derived velocities essentially represent the geostrophic flow component, and the impact of unresolved ageostrophic motions on particle dispersion needs to be understood to properly characterize transport properties. Here, we investigate ocean fine-scale turbulence using a model that represents some of the processes due to ageostrophic dynamics. We take a Lagrangian approach and focus on the predictability of the particle dynamics, comparing trajectories advected by either the full flow or by its geostrophic component only. Our results indicate that, over long times, relative dispersion is marginally affected by the filtering of the ageostrophic component. Nevertheless, advection by the filtered flow leads to an overestimation of the typical pair-separation rate, and to a bias on trajectories (in terms of displacement from the actual ones), whose importance grows with the Rossby number. We further explore the intensity of the transient particle clustering induced by ageostrophic motions and find that it can be significant, even for small flow compressibility. Indeed, we show that clustering is here due to the interplay between compressibility and persistent flow structures that trap particles, enhancing their aggregation.</description>

      <title>An investigation of anisotropy in the bubbly turbulent flow via direct numerical simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the dynamics of dispersed bubbly turbulent flow in a channel using interface-resolved direct numerical simulation (DNS) with an efficient Coupled Level-Set Volume-of-Fluid (CLSVOF) solver. The influence of number of bubbles (96 and 192), flow direction, and Eotvos number was examined across eight distinct cases. The results indicate that in upward flows, bubbles tend to accumulate near the wall, with smaller Eotvos numbers bringing them closer to the wall and enhancing energy dissipation through increased turbulence and vorticity. This proximity causes the liquid phase velocity to attenuate, and the bubbles, being more spherical, induce more isotropic turbulence. Conversely, in downward flows, bubbles cluster in the middle of the channel and induce additional pseudo-turbulence in the channel center, which induce additional turbulent kinetic energy in the channel center. The study further examines budget of Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) and the exact balance equation for the Reynolds stresses, revealing that near-wall bubble motion generates substantial velocity gradients, particularly in the wall-normal direction, significantly impacting the turbulence structure.</description>

      <title>Microscale physics and macroscale convective heat transfer in supercritical fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by fundamental thermodynamic efficiency considerations, an emerging trend in the energy and propulsion systems is that the working fluid operates at a pressure above the critical pressure. Energy transport is thus accompanied by dramatic and strongly nonlinear variations of thermophysical properties, which cause abnormal heat transfer behavior and non-ideal gas effects. This situation raises a crucial challenge for the heat exchanger and turbomachinery design, overall energy and exergy efficiency. We aim to provide a multi-scale overview of the flow and thermal behavior of fluid above the critical point: microscopic physics and macroscopic transport. Microscopic physics, i.e. near-critical thermophysical properties, phase transition and fluid dynamics, are introduced. A particular focus will be on the supercritical pseudo boiling process, which is a generalization of classical liquid-vapor phase transitions to non-equilibrium supercritical states. These new perspectives lead to a revised view of the state space. Further, recent results demonstrated the possibility of stable supercritical fluid interfaces without surface tension. On the macroscale, recent progress on the modeling of turbulent flow and convective heat transfer of supercritical fluids are summarized. Direct numerical simulation is able to offer insights into the physics of thermal fluids. We start with a description of fundamental fluid mechanics problems related to supercritical fluids. In addition, the heat transfer deterioration in supercritical fluids is found to be closely connected to the flow relaminarization by the non-uniform body-force. Finally, various modeling approaches such as recently developed advanced Reynolds-averaged turbulence modeling as well as machine-learning methods are summarized.</description>

      <title>Early-time resonances in the three-dimensional wall-bounded axisymmetric Euler and related equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the complex-time analytic structure of solutions of the 3D-axisymmetric, wall-bounded, incompressible Euler equations, by starting with the initial data proposed in Luo and Hou (2014), to study a possible finite-time singularity. We use our pseudospectral Fourier-Chebyshev method, with quadruple-precision arithmetic, to compute the time-Taylor series coefficients of the flow fields, up to a high order. We show that the resulting approximations display early-time resonances; the initial spatial location of these structures is different from that for the tygers, which we have obtained in Kolluru et al. (2022). We then perform asymptotic analysis of the Taylor-series coefficients, by using generalised ratio methods, to extract the location and nature of the convergence-limiting singularities and demonstrate that these singularities are distributed around the origin, in the complex-t2 plane, along two curves that resemble the shape of an eye. We obtain similar results for the 1D wall-approximation (of the full 3D-axisymmetric Euler equation) called the 1D HL model, for which we use Fourier-pseudospectral methods to compute the time-Taylor series coefficients of the flow fields. Our work examines the link between tygers, in Galerkin-truncated pseudospectral studies, and early-time resonances, in truncated time-Taylor expansions of solutions of PDEs, such as those we consider.</description>

      <title>Estimated electric conductivities of thermal plasma for air-fuel combustion and oxy-fuel combustion with potassium or cesium seeding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A complete model for estimating the electric conductivity of combustion product gases, with added cesium (Cs) or potassium (K) vapor for ionization, is presented. Neutral carrier gases serve as the bulk fluid that carries the seed material, as well as the electrons generated by the partial thermal (equilibrium) ionization of the seed alkali metal. The model accounts for electron-neutral scattering, as well as electron-ion and electron-electron scattering. The model is tested through comparison with published data. The model is aimed at being utilized for the plasma within magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) channels, where direct power extraction from passing electrically conducting plasma gas enables electric power generation. The thermal ionization model is then used to estimate the electric conductivity of seeded combustion gases under complete combustion of three selected fuels, namely: hydrogen (H2), methane (CH4), and carbon (C). For each of these three fuels, two options for the oxidizer were applied, namely: air (21 % molecular oxygen, 79 % molecular nitrogen by mole), and pure oxygen (oxy-combustion). Two types of seeds (with 1 % mole fraction, based on the composition before ionization) were also applied for each of the six combinations of (fuel-oxidizer), leading to a total of 12 different MHD plasma cases. For each of these cases, the electric conductivity was computed for a range of temperatures from 2000 K to 3000 K. The smallest estimated electric conductivity was 0.35 S/m for oxy-hydrogen combustion at 2000 K, with potassium seeding. The largest estimated electric conductivity was 180.30 S/m for oxy-carbon combustion at 3000 K, with cesium seeding. At 2000 K, replacing potassium with cesium causes a gain in the electric conductivity by a multiplicative gain factor of about 3.6 regardless of the fuel and oxidizer. This gain factor declines to between 1.77 and 2.07 at 3000 K.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Graph U-Nets for Mesh-Agnostic Spatio-Temporal Flow Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to overcome the conventional deep-learning approaches based on convolutional neural networks, whose applicability to complex geometries and unstructured meshes is limited due to their inherent mesh dependency. We propose novel approaches to improve mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal prediction of transient flow fields using graph U-Nets, enabling accurate prediction on diverse mesh configurations. Key enhancements to the graph U-Net architecture, including the Gaussian mixture model convolutional operator and noise injection approaches, provide increased flexibility in modeling node dynamics: the former reduces prediction error by 95\% compared to conventional convolutional operators, while the latter improves long-term prediction robustness, resulting in an error reduction of 86\%. We also investigate transductive and inductive-learning perspectives of graph U-Nets with proposed improvements. In the transductive setting, they effectively predict quantities for unseen nodes within the trained graph. In the inductive setting, they successfully perform in mesh scenarios with different vortex-shedding periods, showing 98\% improvement in predicting the future flow fields compared to a model trained without the inductive settings. It is found that graph U-Nets without pooling operations, i.e. without reducing and restoring the node dimensionality of the graph data, perform better in inductive settings due to their ability to learn from the detailed structure of each graph. Meanwhile, we also discover that the choice of normalization technique significantly impacts graph U-Net performance.</description>

      <title>Parametric Intrusive Reduced Order Models enhanced with Machine Learning Correction Terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an equation-based parametric Reduced Order Model (ROM), whose accuracy is improved with data-driven terms added into the reduced equations. These additions have the aim of reintroducing contributions that in standard ROMs are not taken into account. In particular, in this work we consider two types of contributions: the turbulence modeling, added through a reduced-order approximation of the eddy viscosity field, and the correction model, aimed to re-introduce the contribution of the discarded modes. Both approaches have been investigated in previous works and the goal of this paper is to extend the model to a parametric setting making use of ad-hoc machine learning procedures. More in detail, we investigate different neural networks' architectures, from simple dense feed-forward to Long-Short Term Memory neural networks, in order to find the most suitable model for the re-introduced contributions. We tested the methods on two test cases with different behaviors: the periodic turbulent flow past a circular cylinder and the unsteady turbulent flow in a channel-driven cavity. In both cases, the parameter considered is the Reynolds number and the machine learning-enhanced ROM considerably improved the pressure and velocity accuracy with respect to the standard ROM.</description>

      <title>Self-propulsion of an elliptic phoretic disk emitting solute uniformly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-propulsion of chemically active droplet and phoretic disk has been widely studied; however, most research overlooks the influence of disk shape on swimming dynamics. Inspired by the experimentally observed prolate composite droplets and elliptic camphor disks, we employ simulations to investigate the phoretic dynamics of an elliptic disk that uniformly emits solutes in the creeping flow regime. By varying the disk's eccentricity $e$ and the P'eclet number $\Pe$, we distinguish five disk behaviors: stationary, steady, orbiting, periodic, and chaotic. We perform a global linear stability analysis (LSA) to predict the onset of instability and the most unstable eigenmode when a stationary disk spontaneously transitions to steady self-propulsion. In addition to the LSA, we use an alternative approach to determine the perturbation growth rate, offering valuable insights into the competing roles of advection and diffusion. The steady motion features a transition from a puller-type to a neutral-type swimmer as $\Pe$ increases, which occurs as a bimodal concentration profile at the disk surface shifts to a polarized solute distribution, driven by convective solute transport. An elliptic disk achieves an orbiting motion through a chiral symmetry-breaking instability, wherein it repeatedly follows a circular path while simultaneously rotating. The swinging periodic motion, emerging from a steady motion via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation, is characterized by a wave-like trajectory. We uncover a transition from normal diffusion to superdiffusion as eccentricity $e$ increases, corresponding to a random-walking circular disk and a ballistically swimming elliptic counterpart, respectively.</description>

      <title>A transformer-based neural operator for large-eddy simulation of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting the large-scale dynamics of three-dimensional (3D) turbulence is challenging for machine learning approaches. This paper introduces a transformer-based neural operator (TNO) to achieve precise and efficient predictions in the large-eddy simulation (LES) of 3D turbulence. The performance of the proposed TNO model is systematically tested and compared with LES using classical sub-grid scale (SGS) models, including the dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) and the dynamic mixed model (DMM), as well as the original Fourier neural operator (FNO) model, in homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) and free-shear turbulent mixing layer. The numerical simulations comprehensively evaluate the performance of these models on a variety of flow statistics, including the velocity spectrum, the probability density functions (PDFs) of vorticity, the PDFs of velocity increments, the evolution of turbulent kinetic energy, and the iso-surface of the Q-criterion. The results indicate that the accuracy of the TNO model is comparable to the LES with DSM model, and outperforms the FNO model and LES using DMM in HIT. In the free-shear turbulence, the TNO model exhibits superior accuracy compared to other models. Moreover, the TNO model has fewer parameters than the FNO model and enables long-term stable predictions, which the FNO model cannot achieve. The well-trained TNO model is significantly faster than traditional LES with DSM and DMM models, and can be generalized to higher Taylor-Reynolds number cases, indicating its strong potential for 3D nonlinear engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Flow stability and permeability in a nonrandom porous medium analog</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The estimation of the permeability of porous media to fluids is of fundamental importance in fields as diverse as oil and gas industry, agriculture, hydrology and medicine. Despite more than 150 years since the publication of Darcy's linear law for flow in porous media, several questions remain regarding the range of validity of this law, the constancy of the permeability coefficient and how to define the transition from Darcy flow to other flow regimes. This study is a numerical investigation of the permeability and flow stability in a nonrandom quasi-tridimensional porous medium analog. The effect of increasing pressure gradient on the velocity field and on the estimation of Darcy and Darcy-Forchheimer coefficients is investigated for three different obstacle's radiuses. The transition from Darcy flow to nonlinear behavior is associated with the formation of jets in the outlet of the porous medium and development of flow instabilities. Different representations of the Reynolds number proved adequate to detect deviation from the linear law. The instantaneous permeability calculated at each pressure gradient was sensitive to flow velocity, in agreement with previous studies stating that permeability cannot be conceptualized as a constant for real flows.</description>

Abstract: The impact of fluid drops on solid substrates has widespread interest in many industrial coating and spraying applications, such as ink-jet printing and agricultural pesticide sprays. Many of the fluids used in these applications are non-Newtonian, that is they contain particulate or polymeric additives that strongly modify their flow behaviour. While a large body of experimental and theoretical work has been done to understand the impact dynamics of Newtonian fluids, we as a community have much progress to make to understand how these dynamics are modified when the impact fluid has non-Newtonian rheology. In this review, we outline recent experimental, theoretical, and computational advances in the study of impact dynamics of complex fluids on solid surfaces. Here, we provide an overview of this field that is geared towards a multidisciplinary audience. Our discussion is segmented by two principal material constitutions: polymeric fluids and particulate suspensions. Throughout, we highlight promising future directions, as well as ongoing experimental and theoretical challenges in the field.</description>

Abstract: Investigating blood flow in the cardiovascular system is crucial for assessing cardiovascular health. Computational approaches offer some non-invasive alternatives to measure blood flow dynamics. Numerical simulations based on traditional methods such as finite-element and other numerical discretizations have been extensively studied and have yielded excellent results. However, adapting these methods to real-life simulations remains a complex task. In this paper, we propose a method that offers flexibility and can efficiently handle real-life simulations. We suggest utilizing the physics-informed neural network (PINN) to solve the Navier-Stokes equation in a deformable domain, specifically addressing the simulation of blood flow in elastic vessels. Our approach models blood flow using an incompressible, viscous Navier-Stokes equation in an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian form. The mechanical model for the vessel wall structure is formulated by an equation of Newton's second law of momentum and linear elasticity to the force exerted by the fluid flow. Our method is a mesh-free approach that eliminates the need for discretization and meshing of the computational domain. This makes it highly efficient in solving simulations involving complex geometries. Additionally, with the availability of well-developed open-source machine learning framework packages and parallel modules, our method can easily be accelerated through GPU computing and parallel computing. To evaluate our approach, we conducted experiments on regular cylinder vessels as well as vessels with plaque on their walls. We compared our results to a solution calculated by Finite Element Methods using a dense grid and small time steps, which we considered as the ground truth solution. We report the relative error and the time consumed to solve the problem, highlighting the advantages of our method.</description>

Abstract: Realistic computational simulations in different oceanic basins reveal prevalent prograde mean flows (i.e. in the direction of topographic Rossby wave propagation along isobaths; a.k.a. topostrophy) on topographic slopes in the deep ocean, consistent with the barotropic theory of eddy-driven mean flows. Attention is focused on the Western Mediterranean Sea with strong currents and steep topography. These prograde mean currents induce an opposing bottom drag stress and thus a turbulent boundary-layer mean flow in the downhill direction, evidenced by a near-bottom negative mean vertical velocity. The slope-normal profile of diapycnal buoyancy mixing results in down-slope mean advection near the bottom (a tendency to locally increase the mean buoyancy) and up-slope buoyancy mixing (a tendency to decrease buoyancy) with associated buoyancy fluxes across the mean isopycnal surfaces (diapycnal downwelling). In the upper part of the boundary layer and nearby interior, the diapycnal turbulent buoyancy flux divergence reverses sign (diapycnal upwelling), with upward Eulerian mean buoyancy advection across isopycnal surfaces. These near-slope tendencies abate with further distance from the boundary. An along-isobath mean momentum balance shows an advective acceleration and a bottom-drag retardation of the prograde flow. The eddy buoyancy advection is significant near the slope, and the associated eddy potential energy conversion is negative, consistent with mean vertical shear flow generation for the eddies. This cross-isobath flow structure differs from previous proposals, and a new one-dimensional model is constructed for a topostrophic, stratified, slope bottom boundary layer. The broader issue of the return pathways of the global thermohaline circulation remains open, but the abyssal slope region is likely to play a dominant role.</description>
