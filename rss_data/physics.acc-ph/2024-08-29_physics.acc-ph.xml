      <title>The Generation of Variable Polarization States in Terawatt X-Ray Free-Electron Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terawatt x-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) represent the frontier in further development of x-ray sources and require high current densities with strong transverse focusing. In this paper, we investigate the implications/potentialities of TW XFELs on the generation of harmonics at still shorter wavelengths and higher photon energies with variable polarization. The simulations indicate that significant power levels are possible at high harmonics of the XFEL resonance and that these XFELs can be an important coherent source of hard x-rays through the gamma ray spectrum. For this purpose, we use the MINERVA simulation code which self-consistently includes harmonic generation. Both helical and planar undulators are discussed in which the fundamental is at 1.5 {\AA} and study the associated harmonic generation. While tapered undulators are needed to reach TW powers at the fundamental, the taper does not enhance the harmonics because the taper must start before saturation of the fundamental, while the harmonics saturate before this point is reached. Nevertheless, the harmonics reach substantial powers. Simulations indicate that, for the parameters under consideration, peak powers of the order of 180 MW are possible at the fifth harmonic with a photon energy of about 41 keV and still high harmonics may also be generated at substantial powers. Such high harmonic powers are certain to enable a host of enhanced applications</description>

      <title>Surrogate Models studies for laser-plasma accelerator electron source design through numerical optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimisation of the plasma target design for high quality beam laser-driven plasma injector electron source relies on numerical parametric studies using Particle in Cell (PIC) codes. The common input parameters to explore are laser characteristics and plasma density profiles extracted from computational fluid dynamic studies compatible with experimental measurements of target plasma density profiles. We demonstrate the construction of surrogate models using machine learning technique for a laser-plasma injector (LPI) electron source based on more than 12000 simulations of a laser wakefield acceleration performed for sparsely spaced input parameters [1]. Surrogate models are very interesting for LPI design and optimisation because they are much faster than PIC simulations. We develop and compare the performance of three surrogate models, namely, Gaussian processes (GP), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and decision trees (DT). We then use the best surrogate model to quickly find optimal working points to get a selected electron beam energy, charge and energy spread using different methods, namely random search, Bayesian optimisation and multi-objective Bayesian optimisation</description>
