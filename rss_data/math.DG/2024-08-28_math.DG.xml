      <title>Hypercomplex structures on special linear groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this article is twofold. First, we prove that the $8$-dimensional Lie group $\operatorname{SL}(3,\mathbb{R})$ does not admit a left-invariant hypercomplex structure. To accomplish this we revise the classification of left-invariant complex structures on $\operatorname{SL}(3,\mathbb{R})$ due to Sasaki. Second, we exhibit a left-invariant hypercomplex structure on $\operatorname{SL}(2n+1,\mathbb{C})$, which arises from a complex product structure on $\operatorname{SL}(2n+1,\mathbb{R})$, for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$. We then show that there are no HKT metrics compatible with this hypercomplex structure. Additionally, we determine the associated Obata connection and we compute explicitly its holonomy group, providing thus a new example of an Obata holonomy group properly contained in $\operatorname{GL}(m,\mathbb{H})$ and not contained in $\operatorname{SL}(m,\mathbb{H})$, where $4m=\dim_\mathbb{R} \operatorname{SL}(2n+1,\mathbb{C})$.</description>

      <title>On left-invariant semi-K\"{a}hler structures on six-dimensional nilpotent nonsymplectic Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that there are 34 classes of six-dimensional nilpotent Lie groups, many of which admit left-invariant symplectic and complex structures. Among them there are three classes of groups on which there are no left-invariant symplectic structures, but there are complex structures. In this work, semi-K\"{a}hler and almost para-semi-K\"{a}hler structures are defined on such Lie groups and their geometric properties are studied.</description>

      <title>Gradient estimates for $\Delta_b u + au^{p+1} = 0$ on pseudo-Hermitian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the gradient estimates for the positive solutions of the equation $\Delta_b u + au^{p+1} = 0$ on complete noncompact pseudo-Hermitian manifolds, where $a &gt; 0$ and $p \leq 0$ or $a &lt; 0$ and $p &gt; 0$ are two constants. As an application, we will obtain a Liouville-type theorem when the manifolds are Sasakian-type with nonnegative pseudo-Hermitian Ricci curvature.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian surplusection phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a broad class of phenomena which appear when you intersect a given Lagrangian submanifold $K$ with a family of Lagrangian submanifolds $L_t$ (all Hamiltonian isotopic to one another). We establish that this phenomenon occurs in a particular situation, which lets us give a lower bound for the volume of any Lagrangian torus in $\mathbb{CP}^2$ which is Hamiltonian isotopic to the Chekanov torus. The rest of the paper is a discussion of why we should expect these phenomena to be very common, motivated by Oh's conjecture on the volume-minimising property of the Clifford torus and the concurrent normals conjecture in convex geometry. We pose many open questions.</description>

      <title>Toda lattice and Riemann type minimal surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toda lattice and minimal surfaces are related to each other through Allen-Cahn equation. In view of the structure of the solutions of the Toda lattice, we find new balancing configuration using techniques of integrable systems. This allows us to construct new singly periodic minimal surfaces. The genus of these minimal surfaces equals $j(j+1)/2-1$. They are natural generalization of the Riemann minimal surfaces, which have genus zero.</description>

      <title>Relative Equilibria for Scaling Symmetries and Central Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore scaling symmetries within the framework of symplectic geometry. We focus on the action $\Phi$ of the multiplicative group $G = \mathbb{R}^+$ on exact symplectic manifolds $(M, \omega,\theta)$, with $\omega = -d\theta$, where $ \theta $ is a given primitive one-form. Extending established results in symplectic geometry and Hamiltonian dynamics, we introduce conformally symplectic maps, conformally Hamiltonian systems, conformally symplectic group actions, and the notion of conformal invariance. This framework allows us to generalize the momentum map to the conformal momentum map, which is crucial for understanding scaling symmetries. Additionally, we provide a generalized Hamiltonian Noether's theorem for these symmetries.
  We introduce the (conformal) augmented Hamiltonian $H_{\xi}$ and prove that the relative equilibria of scaling symmetries are solutions to equations involving $ H _{ \xi } $ and the primitive one-form $\theta$. We derive their main properties, emphasizing the differences from relative equilibria in traditional symplectic actions.
  For cotangent bundles, we define a scaled cotangent lifted action and derive explicit formulas for the conformal momentum map. We also provide a general definition of central configurations for Hamiltonian systems on cotangent bundles that admit scaling symmetries. Applying these results to simple mechanical systems, we introduce the augmented potential $U_{\xi}$ and show that the relative equilibria of scaling symmetries are solutions to an equation involving $ U _{ \xi } $ and the Lagrangian one-form $\theta_L$.
  Finally, we apply our general theory to the Newtonian $n$-body problem, recovering the classical equations for central configurations.</description>

      <title>Lorentz polarisation and isoperimetric inequality in Minkowski spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03301v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove an isoperimetric inequality for the domain of dependence of a finite lightcone in the Minkowski spacetime of dimension greater than or equal to 3. The inequality involves two quantities: the volume of the domain of dependence, and the perimeter of the finite lightcone. It states that among all finite lightcones with the same perimeter, the maximal volume of the domain of dependence is achieved by the spacelike hyperplane truncated finite lightcone. A novelty of this isoperimetric inequality is the codimension 2 comparison feature. We introduce the Lorentz polarisation to prove the isoperimetric inequality by studying the corresponding variational problem. A key observation is the monotonicity of the domain of dependence of a finite lightcone under the Lorentz polarisation. We show that any finite lightcone can be transformed by Lorentz polarisations to approximate a spacelike hyperplane truncated finite lightcone with an equal or less perimeter. As further applications of the method of Lorentz polarisation, we prove the following isoperimetric type inequalities: a) For a set with the given perimeter in the hyperboloid in the Minkowski spacetime, the geodesic ball in the hyperboloid has the maximal volume of the domain of dependence of the set; b) For an achronal hypersurface with boundary in the lightcone (or the hyperboloid), given the perimeter of the boundary fixed, the spacelike hyperplane disk has the maximal area.</description>

      <title>Hypertoric varieties, $W$-Hilbert schemes, and Coulomb branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08125v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study transverse equivariant Hilbert schemes of affine hypertoric varieties equipped with a symplectic action of a Weyl group. In particular, we show that the Coulomb branches of Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima can be obtained either as such Hilbert schemes or Hamiltonian reductions thereof. Furthermore, we propose that the Coulomb branches for representations of non-cotangent type are also obtained in this way. We also investigate the putative complete hyperk\"ahler metrics on these objects. We describe their twistor spaces and, in the case when the symplectic quotient construction of the hypertoric variety is $W$-equivariant (which includes Coulomb branches of cotangent type), we show that the hyperk\"ahler metric can be described as the natural $L^2$-metric on a moduli space of solutions to modified Nahm's equations on an interval with poles at both ends and a discontinuity in the middle, with the latter described by a new object: a hyperspherical variety canonically associated to a hypertoric variety.</description>

      <title>From Combinatorics to Geometry: The Dynamics of Graph Gradient Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08311v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a link between graph theory and geometry that arises when considering graph dynamical systems with odd interactions. The equilibrium set in such systems is not a collection of isolated points, but rather a union of manifolds, which may intersect creating singularities and may vary in dimension. We prove that geometry and stability of such manifolds are governed by combinatorial properties of the underlying graph. In particular, we derive an upper bound on the dimension of the equilibrium set using graph homology and a lower bound using graph coverings. Moreover, we show how graph automorphisms relate to geometric singularities and prove that the decomposition of a graph into $2$-vertex-connected components induces a decomposition of the equilibrium set that preserves three notions of stability.</description>
