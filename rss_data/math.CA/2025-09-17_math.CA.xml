      <title>On high dimensional maximal functions associated to Gaussians, balls, and spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for each $p\in (1,\infty),$ the norms on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ of the maximal functions associated to Gaussians (heat semigroup), balls (Hardy-Littlewood averages), and spheres (spherical averages) converge, as the dimension $d\to \infty,$ to the same quantity $\lambda(p)$. This is derived from the fact that the norms on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ of the maximal functions corresponding to the differences of Gaussian, ball, and spherical averages converge to zero with the dimension $d.$ The fact is proved with the aid of estimates for Fourier multiplier symbols corresponding to these averages, a general principle that allows us to control the norm of a maximal function corresponding to a Fourier multiplier operator by the norm of the multiplier operator itself, and concentration properties of high dimensional Gaussian random vectors. Moreover, relying on the properties of the $d$-dimensional maximal function for the heat semigroup $\mathcal{G}_\ast^d$, we show that $\lambda(p)$ satisfies $$ \frac25\frac{p}{p-1}\le\|\mathcal{G}_\ast^1\|_{L^p(\mathbb{R})\rightarrow L^p(\mathbb{R})}\le \lambda(p)\le \frac{p}{p-1}. $$ In particular, to obtain the middle inequality we show that the norms on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$ of the maximal function for the heat semigroup are non-decreasing in $d.$</description>

      <title>Generalized $f$-Eulerian polynomials: zeros and hypergeometric representations with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore (slightly generalized) $f$-Eulerian polynomials introduced by Stanley and frequently appearing in combinatorics. Notable special cases include the classical Eulerian polynomials, the generating polynomials of order polynomials for certain labeled posets, and the $d$-Narayana polynomials. We establish simple sufficient conditions for the reality (and sign) of their zeros and present implications for total positivity of sequences generated by values of polynomials at integers. We further relate these polynomials to generalized Euler's transformations for the generalized hypergeometric functions with integral parameter differences. Exploiting this and other hypergeometric connections, we provide purely hypergeometric proofs for various known and some new properties of $d$-Narayana polynomials. Another family encompassed by our definition of the generalized $f$-Eulerian polynomials is that of Jacobi-Pi\~neiro type II multiple orthogonal polynomials. Their zero location can thus be analyzed, for both canonical and non-canonical parameter values, without invoking orthogonality. Finally, we present several connection formulas relating $d$-Narayana polynomials to particular Jacobi-Pi\~neiro polynomials.</description>

      <title>An improved lower bound for Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1959, Erd\H{o}s and Szekeres posed a series of problems concerning the size of polynomials of the form $$ P_n(z) = \prod_{j=1}^n (1 - z^{s_j}), $$ where $s_1, \dots, s_n$ are positive integers. Of particular interest is the quantity $$ f(n) = \inf_{s_1,\dots,s_n\ge 1} \max_{|z|=1} |P_n(z)|. $$They proved that $\lim_{n\to\infty} f(n)^{1/n} = 1$, and also established the classical lower bound $f(n) \ge \sqrt{2n}$. However, despite extensive effort over more than six decades, no stronger general lower bound had been established.
  In this paper, we obtain the new bound $$ f(n) \ge 2\sqrt{n}. $$This gives the first improvement of the classical lower bound for the Erd\H{o}s--Szekeres problem in the general case since 1959.</description>

      <title>Bernstein-Szeg\H{o} measures in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14383v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a class of Bernstein-Szeg\H{o} measures on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and we establish their spectral properties, providing a natural extension of the one-dimensional theory. We also derive conditions involving finitely many moments, which are new in the two-dimensional setting, and which completely characterize these measures. A key ingredient in the theory on the real line stems from the fact that a measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}$ determines a unique sequence of orthonormal polynomials which gives a simple formula for $d\mu/dx $ in the Bernstein-Szeg\H{o} family. Since there is no canonical way to introduce orthonormal polynomials in the plane, our extension is based on a new identity which connects a Fej\'er-Riesz factorization of the weight to a polynomial depending on three variables associated with $\mu$. Using recent results in the bivariate trigonometric Fej\'er-Riesz factorization problem, we define a nontrivial two-dimensional extension of the Szeg\H{o} mapping which provides explicit orthonormal bases of the spaces associated with Bernstein-Szeg\H{o} measures on $\mathbb{R}^2$. An important part of the paper is devoted to a self-contained development of the Bernstein-Szeg\H{o} theory for matrix-valued functionals. The proofs combine techniques from real analysis, complex analysis and algebra.</description>

      <title>Limiting behavior of principal eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for a class of elliptic operators with degenerate large advection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study, both numerically and analytically, the asymptotic behavior of the principal eigenfunction of \eqref{1.1}, normalized by \eqref{1.2}, as $s\uparrow +\infty$. Based on the numerical computations of this paper, we can prove that, under condition (Hm) bellow, $\varphi_s$ approximates $1$ and $\varphi_s'$ approximates $0$, uniformly in $[-1,1]$, as $s\uparrow +\infty$. As a byproduct of this result, we can derive the asymptotic behavior of the principal eigenvalue in a one-dimensional situation not previously covered by \cite{ChLo} and \cite{PeZh}, as we are working under minimal regularity assumptions on $m(x)$. A recent result of \cite{BWZ} shows that the principal eigenvalue might oscillate as $s\uparrow +\infty$ if $m(x)$ is highly oscillatory. Thus, the oscillatory and regularity properties of $m(x)$ might severely affect the asymptotic behavior of $(\lambda_s,\varphi_s)$ as $s\uparrow +\infty$.</description>
