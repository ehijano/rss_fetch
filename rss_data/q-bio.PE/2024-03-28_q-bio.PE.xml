      <title>Emergent predictability in microbial ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microbial ecosystems carry out essential functions for global climate, human health, and industry. These complex communities exhibit a surprising amount of functionally relevant diversity at all levels of taxonomic resolution, presenting a significant challenge for most modeling frameworks. A long-standing hope of theoretical ecology is that some patterns might persist despite community complexity -- or perhaps even emerge because of it. A deeper understanding of such "emergent simplicity" could enable new approaches for predicting the behaviors of the complex ecosystems in nature. However, most examples described so far afford limited predictive power, as they focused on reproducibility rather than prediction. Here, we propose an information-theoretic framework for defining, nuancing and quantifying emergent simplicity in empirical data based on the ability of simple models to predict community-level functional properties. Applying this framework to two published datasets, we demonstrate that the majority of properties measured across both experiments exhibit robust evidence of emergent predictability: surprisingly, as community richness increases, simple compositional descriptions become more predictive. We show that this behavior is not typical within the standard modeling frameworks of theoretical ecology, and argue that improving our ability to predict and control natural microbial communities will require a shift of focus: away from complexity of _ecosystems_, and towards prediction complexity of _properties_ of ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Possible counter-intuitive impact of local vaccine mandates for vaccine-preventable infectious diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the impact of local vaccine mandates on the spread of vaccine-preventable infectious diseases, which in the absence of vaccines will mainly affect children. Examples of such diseases are measles, rubella, mumps and pertussis. To model the spread of the pathogen, we use a stochastic SIR (Susceptible, Infectious, Recovered) model with two levels of mixing in a closed population, often referred to as the household model. In this model individuals make local contacts within a specific small subgroup of the population (e.g.\ within a household or a school class), while they also make global contacts with random people in the population at a much lower rate than the rate of local contacts.
  We consider what happens if schools are given freedom to impose vaccine mandates on all of their pupils, except for the pupils that are exempt from vaccination because of medical reasons. We investigate how such a mandate affects the probability of an outbreak of a disease and the probability that a pupil that is medically exempt from vaccination, gets infected during an outbreak. We show that if the population vaccine coverage is close to the herd-immunity level then both probabilities may increase if local vaccine mandates are implemented. This is caused by unvaccinated pupils moving to schools without mandates.</description>

      <title>Optimization hardness constrains ecological transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living systems operate far from equilibrium, yet few general frameworks provide global bounds on biological transients. Here, we frame equilibration in complex ecosystems as the process of solving an analogue optimization problem. We show that functional redundancies among species in a complex foodweb lead to harder ill-conditioned problems, manifesting as slow modes on a nearly-degenerate solution landscape. Common dimensionality reduction methods precondition ecological dynamics, by isolating fast relaxation from slow solving timescales that exhibit transient chaos for harder problem instances. In evolutionary simulations, we show that selection for steady-state diversity produces ill-conditioning, an effect quantifiable using complexity bounds for constrained optimization. Our results demonstrate the physical toll of computational constraints on biological dynamics.</description>

      <title>Predicting Species Occurrence Patterns from Partial Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To address the interlinked biodiversity and climate crises, we need an understanding of where species occur and how these patterns are changing. However, observational data on most species remains very limited, and the amount of data available varies greatly between taxonomic groups. We introduce the problem of predicting species occurrence patterns given (a) satellite imagery, and (b) known information on the occurrence of other species. To evaluate algorithms on this task, we introduce SatButterfly, a dataset of satellite images, environmental data and observational data for butterflies, which is designed to pair with the existing SatBird dataset of bird observational data. To address this task, we propose a general model, R-Tran, for predicting species occurrence patterns that enables the use of partial observational data wherever found. We find that R-Tran outperforms other methods in predicting species encounter rates with partial information both within a taxon (birds) and across taxa (birds and butterflies). Our approach opens new perspectives to leveraging insights from species with abundant data to other species with scarce data, by modelling the ecosystems in which they co-occur.</description>
