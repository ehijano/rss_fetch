      <title>The Impact of the Virtualization of Scholarly Conferences on the Gender Structure of Conference Contributors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates whether the virtualization of academic conferences in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic changed the gender structure of conference participants. We explored this question utilizing authorship data from the Web of Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index for 180 conferences in 30 conference series held between 2017 and 2023. At least one edition of each analyzed conference series was launched in a virtual or hybrid form. This sample enables a comparison of differences in the gender participation of conference authors while controlling for heterogeneity among conference series. Using linear and logistic regression models, we identified a positive difference in women's involvement in virtual and hybrid conferences compared to onsite events. However, this effect was due less to the increased participation of women in virtual and hybrid conferences than to the decreased participation of women in the onsite editions of the analyzed conference series.</description>

      <title>Automated and Connected Driving: State-of-the-Art and Implications for Future Scenario Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated driving can have a huge impact on the transport system in passenger, as well as freight applications; however, market and technological development are difficult to foresee. Therefore, a systems analysis is called for to answer the question: What is the impact of automated driving on the techno-economic performance of transport systems? It is important to quantify the potential impacts not only on a local scale and for specific use cases but for entire transport systems at large. Here, we provide an overview of the current state of automated driving, including academic research in addition to industrial development. For industrial development, we find that it will take at least until 2030-2040 for automated vehicles to be widely available for passenger transport. For freight transport on the other hand, automated vehicles might already be used within the next years at least on motorways. For academic research, we find that most studies on passenger transport consider shared automated vehicles separated from other transport modes and consider specific regions only. For freight transport we find that operational strategies and usage potentials for level 4 and 5 trucks lack alignment with real-life use cases and driving profiles. Based on this, we develop an analytical framework for future research. This includes a mode choice model for passenger transport demand calculations, a total cost of ownership model for freight trucks, transport statistics for freight flows, a microscopic traffic simulation to assess the impact of automated vehicles on traffic flow, and a road network analysis.</description>

      <title>Application of dual-sensitive decision mechanism based on queuing theory in airport taxi management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of economy and global trade, flying has increasingly become the main way for people to travel, and taxi is the main transfer tool of the airport, especially in the airport with wide passenger sources and large passenger flow. However, at present, many large airports have the phenomenon of low taxi load rate, unbalanced income and long waiting time for passengers. Therefore, how can drivers make decisions to maximize their benefits, and how can management departments allocate resources and formulate management systems to improve ride efficiency and balance drivers' benefits have become urgent problems to be solved. This paper solves the above problems by establishing the taxi driver dual-sensitive decision model, the longitudinal taxi queuing model and the short-distance passenger re-return forced M/M/1 queuing model.</description>

      <title>Spline tie-decay temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing amounts of data are available on temporal, or time-varying, networks. There have been various representations of temporal network data each of which has different advantages for downstream tasks such as mathematical analysis, visualizations, agent-based and other dynamical simulations on the temporal network, and discovery of useful structure. The tie-decay network is a representation of temporal networks whose advantages include the capability of generating continuous-time networks from discrete time-stamped contact event data with mathematical tractability and a low computational cost. However, the current framework of tie-decay networks is limited in terms of how each discrete contact event can affect the time-dependent tie strength (which we call the kernel). Here we extend the tie-decay network model in terms of the kernel. Specifically, we use a cubic spline function for modeling short-term behavior of the kernel and an exponential decay function for long-term behavior, and graft them together. This spline version of tie-decay network enables delayed and $C^1$-continuous interaction rates between two nodes while it only marginally increases the computational and memory burden relative to the conventional tie-decay network. We show mathematical properties of the spline tie-decay network and numerically showcase it with three tasks: network embedding, a deterministic opinion dynamics model, and a stochastic epidemic spreading model.</description>

      <title>An evidence-accumulating drift-diffusion model of competing information spread on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an agent-based model of information spread, grounded on psychological insights on the formation and spread of beliefs. In our model, we consider a network of individuals who share two opposing types of information on a specific topic (e.g., pro- vs. anti-vaccine stances), and the accumulation of evidence supporting either type of information is modelled by means of a drift-diffusion process. After formalising the model, we put forward a campaign of Monte Carlo simulations to identify population-wide behaviours emerging from agents' exposure to different sources of information, investigating the impact of the number and persistence of such sources, and the role of the network structure through which the individuals interact. We find similar emergent behaviours for all network structures considered. When there is a single type of information, the main observed emergent behaviour is consensus. When there are opposing information sources, both consensus or polarisation can result; the latter occurs if the number and persistence of the sources exceeds some threshold values. Importantly, we find the emergent behaviour is mainly influenced by how long the information sources are present for, as opposed to how many sources there are.</description>

      <title>The impact of climate and wealth on energy consumption in small tropical islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anthropic activities have a significant causal effect on climatic change but climate has also major impact on human societies. Population vulnerability to natural hazards and limited natural resources are deemed problematic, particularly on small tropical islands. Lifestyles and activities are heavily reliant on energy consumption. The relationship between climatic variations and energy consumption must be clearly understood. We demonstrate that it is possible to determine the impact of climate change on energy consumption. In small tropical islands, the relationship between climate and energy consumption is primarily driven by air conditioner electricity consumption during hotter months. Temperatures above 26{\deg}C correlate with increased electricity consumption. Energy consumption is sensitive to: (1) climatic seasonal fluctuations, (2) cyclonic activity, (3) temperature warming over the last 20 years. On small tropical islands, demographic and wealth variations also have a significant impact on energy consumption. The relationship between climate and energy consumption suggests reconsidering the production and consumption of carbon-based energy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Causal Discovery in Financial Networks with Piecewise Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial networks can be constructed using statistical dependencies found within the price series of speculative assets. Across the various methods used to infer these networks, there is a general reliance on predictive modelling to capture cross-correlation effects. These methods usually model the flow of mean-response information, or the propagation of volatility and risk within the market. Such techniques, though insightful, don't fully capture the broader distribution-level causality that is possible within speculative markets. This paper introduces a novel approach, combining quantile regression with a piecewise linear embedding scheme - allowing us to construct causality networks that identify the complex tail interactions inherent to financial markets. Applying this method to 260 cryptocurrency return series, we uncover significant tail-tail causal effects and substantial causal asymmetry. We identify a propensity for coins to be self-influencing, with comparatively sparse cross variable effects. Assessing all link types in conjunction, Bitcoin stands out as the primary influencer - a nuance that is missed in conventional linear mean-response analyses. Our findings introduce a comprehensive framework for modelling distributional causality, paving the way towards more holistic representations of causality in financial markets.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Attrition in Science: A Cohort-Based, Longitudinal Study of Scientists in 38 OECD Countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09425v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how members of the scientific community leave academic science and how attrition (defined as ceasing to publish) differs across genders, academic disciplines, and over time. Our approach is cohort-based and longitudinal: We track individual male and female scientists over time and quantify the phenomenon traditionally referred to as 'leaving science.' Using publication metadata from Scopus - a global bibliometric database of publications and citations - we follow the details of the publishing careers of scientists from 38 OECD countries who started publishing in 2000 (N = 142,776) and 2010 (N = 232,843). Our study is restricted to 16 STEMM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine), and we track the individual scholarly output of the two cohorts until 2022. We use survival analysis to compare attrition of men and women scientists. With more women in science and more women within cohorts, attrition is becoming ever less gendered. In addition to the combined aggregated changes at the level of all STEMM disciplines, widely nuanced changes were found to occur at the discipline level and over time. Attrition in science means different things for men versus women depending on the discipline; moreover, it means different things for scientists from different cohorts entering the scientific workforce. Finally, global bibliometric datasets were tested in the current study, opening new opportunities to explore gender and disciplinary differences in attrition.</description>

      <title>A stochastic model of discussion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the duration of discussions in face-to-face contacts and propose a stochastic model to describe it. It is based on the points of a Levy flight where the duration of each contact corresponds to the size of the clusters produced during the walk. When confronting it to the data measured from proximity sensors, we show that several datasets obtained in different environments, are precisely reproduced by the model fixing a single parameter, the Levy index, to 1.15. We analyze the dynamics of the cluster formation during the walk and compute analytically the cluster size distribution. We find that discussions are first driven by a maximum-entropy geometric distribution and then by a rich-get-richer mechanism reminiscent of preferential-attachment (the more a discussion lasts, the more it is likely to continue). In this model, conversations may be viewed as an aggregation process with a characteristic scale fixed by the mean interaction time between the two individuals.</description>

      <title>Graph Simplification Solutions to the Street Intersection Miscount Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Street intersection counts and densities are fundamental measures in transport geography and urban planning. Conventional street network data and analysis tools often lead to significant overcounting of these measures. This study investigates the causes of such overcounting and proposes remedies. It introduces algorithms to streamline urban street network models through edge simplification and node consolidation, which enhance computational efficiency and improve accuracy in network measures like intersection counts, street segment lengths, and node degrees. The algorithms are validated and subjected to a global empirical assessment to evaluate the extent of count bias. These findings highlight the prevalence of this bias and underscore the necessity for better methods to mitigate inaccuracies in intersection representation.</description>
