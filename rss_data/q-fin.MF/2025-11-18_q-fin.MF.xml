      <title>Modeling and Stabilizing Financial Systemic Risk Using Optimal Control Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical model of systemic-risk propagation of financial market is analyzed for stability. The state equation is an unsteady diffusion equation with a nonlinear logistic growth term, where the diffusion process captures the spread of default stress between interconnected financial entities and the reaction term captures the local procyclicality of financial stress. The stabilizing controller synthesis includes three steps: First, the algebraic Riccati equation is derived for the linearized system equation, the solution of which provides an exponentially stabilizing controller. Second, the nonlinear system is treated as a linear system with the nonlinear term as its forcing term. Based on estimation of the solutions for linearized equations and the contraction mapping theorem, unique existence of the solution for the nonlinear system equation is proved. Third, local asymptotic stability of the nonlinear system is obtained by considering the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In both the linearized and nonlinear systems, the resulting controllers ensure that the $H^{\infty}$ norms of the mappings from disturbance to the output are less than a predefined constant. Stabilizing conditions provide a new framework of achieving system-level financial risk managing goals via the synergy of decentralized components, which offers policy-relevant insights for governments, regulators and central banks to mitigate financial crises.</description>

      <title>Infinite-Horizon Optimal Control of Jump-Diffusion Models for Pollution-Dependent Disasters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper develops a unified framework for stochastic growth models with environmental risk, in which rare but catastrophic shocks interact with capital accumulation and pollution. The analysis begins with a Poisson process formulation, leading to a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with jump terms that admits closed-form candidate solutions and yields a composite state variable capturing exposure to rare shocks. The framework is then extended by endogenizing disaster intensity via a nonhomogeneous Poisson process, showing how environmental degradation amplifies macroeconomic risk and strengthens incentives for abatement. A further extension introduces pollution diffusion alongside state-dependent jump intensity, yielding a tractable jump-diffusion HJB that decomposes naturally into capital and pollution components under power-type value functions. Finally, a formulation in terms of Poisson random measures unifies the dynamics, makes arrivals and compensators explicit, and accommodates state-dependent magnitudes. Together, these results establish rigorous verification theorems, highlight how vulnerability emerges endogenously from the joint evolution of capital and pollution, and show that the prospect of rare, state-dependent disasters fundamentally reshapes optimal intertemporal trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Cross-Currency Basis Swaps Referencing Backward-Looking Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The financial industry has undergone a significant transition from the London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBORs) to Risk Free Rates (RFRs) such as, e.g., the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) in the U.S. and the Cash Rate (AONIA) in Australia, as primary benchmark rates for borrowing costs. The paper examines the pricing and hedging method for financial products in a cross-currency framework with the special emphasis on the Compound SOFR vs Average AONIA cross-currency basis swap (CCBS) where both reference rates are backward-looking and the swap is collateralized. While the SOFR and AONIA are used as particular instances of RFRs in a cross-currency basis swap, the proposed approach is able to handle backward-looking rates for any two currencies. We give explicit pricing and hedging results for a constant notional cross-currency basis swap with either domestic or foreign collateralization using interest rate futures and currency futures as hedging instruments within an arbitrage-free cross-currency multi-curve setting.</description>

      <title>Complex discontinuities of the square root of Fredholm determinants in the Volterra Stein-Stein model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fourier-based methods are central to option pricing and hedging when the Fourier-Laplace transform of the log-price and integrated variance is available semi-explicitly. This is the case for the Volterra Stein-Stein stochastic volatility model, where the characteristic function is known analytically. However, naive evaluation of this formula can produce discontinuities due to the complex square root of a Fredholm determinant, particularly when the determinant crosses the negative real axis, leading to severe numerical instabilities. We analyze this phenomenon by characterizing the determinant's crossing behavior for the joint Fourier-Laplace transform of integrated variance and log-price. We then derive an expression for the transform to account for such crossings and develop efficient algorithms to detect and handle them. Applied to Fourier-based pricing in the rough Stein-Stein model, our approach significantly improves accuracy while drastically reducing computational cost relative to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Portfolio selection with exogenous and endogenous transaction costs under a two-factor stochastic volatility model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a portfolio selection problem with transaction costs under a two-factor stochastic volatility structure, where volatility follows a mean-reverting process with a stochastic mean-reversion level. The model incorporates both proportional exogenous transaction costs and endogenous costs modeled by a stochastic liquidity risk process. Using an option-implied approach, we extract an S-shaped utility function that reflects investor behavior and apply its concave envelope transformation to handle the non-concavity. The resulting problem reduces to solving a five-dimensional nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We employ a deep learning-based policy iteration scheme to numerically compute the value function and the optimal policy. Numerical experiments are conducted to analyze how both types of transaction costs and stochastic volatility affect optimal investment decisions.</description>

      <title>Global universal approximation of functional input maps on weighted spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03303v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce so-called functional input neural networks defined on a possibly infinite dimensional weighted space with values also in a possibly infinite dimensional output space. To this end, we use an additive family to map the input weighted space to the hidden layer, on which a non-linear scalar activation function is applied to each neuron, and finally return the output via some linear readouts. Relying on Stone-Weierstrass theorems on weighted spaces, we can prove a global universal approximation result on weighted spaces for continuous functions going beyond the usual approximation on compact sets. This then applies in particular to approximation of (non-anticipative) path space functionals via functional input neural networks. As a further application of the weighted Stone-Weierstrass theorem we prove a global universal approximation result for linear functions of the signature. We also introduce the viewpoint of Gaussian process regression in this setting and emphasize that the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of the signature kernels are Cameron-Martin spaces of certain Gaussian processes. This paves a way towards uncertainty quantification for signature kernel regression.</description>

      <title>Smile asymptotic for Bachelier Implied Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the Implied Volatility in the Bachelier setting, extending the framework introduced by Benaim and Friz for the Black-Scholes setting. Exploiting the theory of regular variation, we derive explicit expressions for the Bachelier Implied Volatility in the wings of the smile, linking these to the tail behaviour of the underlying's returns' distribution. Furthermore, we establish a direct connection between the analyticity strip of the returns' characteristic function and the asymptotic formula for the Implied Volatility smile at extreme moneyness.</description>
