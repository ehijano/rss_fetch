      <title>Structure-Preference Enabled Graph Embedding Generation under Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph embedding generation techniques aim to learn low-dimensional vectors for each node in a graph and have recently gained increasing research attention. Publishing low-dimensional node vectors enables various graph analysis tasks, such as structural equivalence and link prediction. Yet, improper publication opens a backdoor to malicious attackers, who can infer sensitive information of individuals from the low-dimensional node vectors. Existing methods tackle this issue by developing deep graph learning models with differential privacy (DP). However, they often suffer from large noise injections and cannot provide structural preferences consistent with mining objectives. Recently, skip-gram based graph embedding generation techniques are widely used due to their ability to extract customizable structures. Based on skip-gram, we present SE-PrivGEmb, a structure-preference enabled graph embedding generation under DP. For arbitrary structure preferences, we design a unified noise tolerance mechanism via perturbing non-zero vectors. This mechanism mitigates utility degradation caused by high sensitivity. By carefully designing negative sampling probabilities in skip-gram, we theoretically demonstrate that skip-gram can preserve arbitrary proximities, which quantify structural features in graphs. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods under structural equivalence and link prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Class-Balance Bias in Regularized Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regularized models are often sensitive to the scales of the features in the data and it has therefore become standard practice to normalize (center and scale) the features before fitting the model. But there are many different ways to normalize the features and the choice may have dramatic effects on the resulting model. In spite of this, there has so far been no research on this topic. In this paper, we begin to bridge this knowledge gap by studying normalization in the context of lasso, ridge, and elastic net regression. We focus on normal and binary features and show that the class balances of binary features directly influences the regression coefficients and that this effect depends on the combination of normalization and regularization methods used. We demonstrate that this effect can be mitigated by scaling binary features with their variance in the case of the lasso and standard deviation in the case of ridge regression, but that this comes at the cost of increased variance. For the elastic net, we show that scaling the penalty weights, rather than the features, can achieve the same effect. Finally, we also tackle mixes of binary and normal features as well as interactions and provide some initial results on how to normalize features in these cases.</description>

      <title>Coupled Hierarchical Structure Learning using Tree-Wasserstein Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many applications, both data samples and features have underlying hierarchical structures. However, existing methods for learning these latent structures typically focus on either samples or features, ignoring possible coupling between them. In this paper, we introduce a coupled hierarchical structure learning method using tree-Wasserstein distance (TWD). Our method jointly computes TWDs for samples and features, representing their latent hierarchies as trees. We propose an iterative, unsupervised procedure to build these sample and feature trees based on diffusion geometry, hyperbolic geometry, and wavelet filters. We show that this iterative procedure converges and empirically improves the quality of the constructed trees. The method is also computationally efficient and scales well in high-dimensional settings. Our method can be seamlessly integrated with hyperbolic graph convolutional networks (HGCN). We demonstrate that our method outperforms competing approaches in sparse approximation and unsupervised Wasserstein distance learning on several word-document and single-cell RNA-sequencing datasets. In addition, integrating our method into HGCN enhances performance in link prediction and node classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Deep Networks are Reproducing Kernel Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying an appropriate function space for deep neural networks remains a key open question. While shallow neural networks are naturally associated with Reproducing Kernel Banach Spaces (RKBS), deep networks present unique challenges. In this work, we extend RKBS to chain RKBS (cRKBS), a new framework that composes kernels rather than functions, preserving the desirable properties of RKBS. We prove that any deep neural network function is a neural cRKBS function, and conversely, any neural cRKBS function defined on a finite dataset corresponds to a deep neural network. This approach provides a sparse solution to the empirical risk minimization problem, requiring no more than $N$ neurons per layer, where $N$ is the number of data points.</description>

      <title>Symmetry and Generalisation in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is about understanding the impact of invariance and equivariance on generalisation in supervised learning. We use the perspective afforded by an averaging operator to show that for any predictor that is not equivariant, there is an equivariant predictor with strictly lower test risk on all regression problems where the equivariance is correctly specified. This constitutes a rigorous proof that symmetry, in the form of invariance or equivariance, is a useful inductive bias.
  We apply these ideas to equivariance and invariance in random design least squares and kernel ridge regression respectively. This allows us to specify the reduction in expected test risk in more concrete settings and express it in terms of properties of the group, the model and the data.
  Along the way, we give examples and additional results to demonstrate the utility of the averaging operator approach in analysing equivariant predictors. In addition, we adopt an alternative perspective and formalise the common intuition that learning with invariant models reduces to a problem in terms of orbit representatives. The formalism extends naturally to a similar intuition for equivariant models. We conclude by connecting the two perspectives and giving some ideas for future work.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Parameter Estimation with Sequential Linear Simulation-based Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop the framework of Linear Simulation-based Inference (LSBI), an application of simulation-based inference where the likelihood is approximated by a Gaussian linear function of its parameters. We obtain analytical expressions for the posterior distributions of hyper-parameters of the linear likelihood in terms of samples drawn from a simulator, for both uniform and conjugate priors. This method is applied sequentially to several toy-models and tested on emulated datasets for the Cosmic Microwave Background temperature power spectrum. We find that convergence is achieved after four or five rounds of $\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ simulations, which is competitive with state-of-the-art neural density estimation methods. Therefore, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain significant information gain and generate posteriors that agree with the underlying parameters while maintaining explainability and intellectual oversight.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data for Portfolios: A Throw of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation methods have always been instrumental in finance, and data-driven methods with minimal model specification, commonly referred to as generative models, have attracted increasing attention, especially after the success of deep learning in a broad range of fields. However, the adoption of these models in financial applications has not kept pace with the growing interest, probably due to the unique complexities and challenges of financial markets. This paper aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the limitations of generative models, particularly in portfolio and risk management. To this end, we begin by presenting theoretical results on the importance of initial sample size, and point out the potential pitfalls of generating far more data than originally available. We then highlight the inseparable nature of model development and the desired use case by touching on a paradox: generic generative models inherently care less about what is important for constructing portfolios (in particular the long-short ones). Based on these findings, we propose a pipeline for the generation of multivariate returns that meets conventional evaluation standards on a large universe of US equities while being compliant with stylized facts observed in asset returns and turning around the pitfalls we previously identified. Moreover, we insist on the need for more delicate evaluation methods, and suggest, through an example of mean-reversion strategies, a method designed to identify poor models for a given application based on regurgitative training, i.e. retraining the model using the data it has itself generated, which is commonly referred to in statistics as identifiability.</description>

      <title>WAPTS: A Weighted Allocation Probability Adjusted Thompson Sampling Algorithm for High-Dimensional and Sparse Experiment Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aiming for more effective experiment design, such as in video content advertising where different content options compete for user engagement, these scenarios can be modeled as multi-arm bandit problems. In cases where limited interactions are available due to external factors, such as the cost of conducting experiments, recommenders often face constraints due to the small number of user interactions. In addition, there is a trade-off between selecting the best treatment and the ability to personalize and contextualize based on individual factors. A popular solution to this dilemma is the Contextual Bandit framework. It aims to maximize outcomes while incorporating personalization (contextual) factors, customizing treatments such as a user's profile to individual preferences. Despite their advantages, Contextual Bandit algorithms face challenges like measurement bias and the 'curse of dimensionality.' These issues complicate the management of numerous interventions and often lead to data sparsity through participant segmentation. To address these problems, we introduce the Weighted Allocation Probability Adjusted Thompson Sampling (WAPTS) algorithm. WAPTS builds on the contextual Thompson Sampling method by using a dynamic weighting parameter. This improves the allocation process for interventions and enables rapid optimization in data-sparse environments. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on different numbers of arms and effect sizes.</description>

      <title>Efficient Generative Modeling via Penalized Optimal Transport Network</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The generation of synthetic data with distributions that faithfully emulate the underlying data-generating mechanism holds paramount significance. Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs) have emerged as a prominent tool for this task; however, due to the delicate equilibrium of the minimax formulation and the instability of Wasserstein distance in high dimensions, WGAN often manifests the pathological phenomenon of mode collapse. This results in generated samples that converge to a restricted set of outputs and fail to adequately capture the tail behaviors of the true distribution. Such limitations can lead to serious downstream consequences. To this end, we propose the Penalized Optimal Transport Network (POTNet), a versatile deep generative model based on the marginally-penalized Wasserstein (MPW) distance. Through the MPW distance, POTNet effectively leverages low-dimensional marginal information to guide the overall alignment of joint distributions. Furthermore, our primal-based framework enables direct evaluation of the MPW distance, thus eliminating the need for a critic network. This formulation circumvents training instabilities inherent in adversarial approaches and avoids the need for extensive parameter tuning. We derive a non-asymptotic bound on the generalization error of the MPW loss and establish convergence rates of the generative distribution learned by POTNet. Our theoretical analysis together with extensive empirical evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of POTNet in accurately capturing underlying data structures, including their tail behaviors and minor modalities. Moreover, our model achieves orders of magnitude speedup during the sampling stage compared to state-of-the-art alternatives, which enables computationally efficient large-scale synthetic data generation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Neural Network Symmetrisation in Markov Categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11814v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of symmetrising a neural network along a group homomorphism: given a homomorphism $\varphi : H \to G$, we would like a procedure that converts $H$-equivariant neural networks to $G$-equivariant ones. We formulate this in terms of Markov categories, which allows us to consider neural networks whose outputs may be stochastic, but with measure-theoretic details abstracted away. We obtain a flexible and compositional framework for symmetrisation that relies on minimal assumptions about the structure of the group and the underlying neural network architecture. Our approach recovers existing canonicalisation and averaging techniques for symmetrising deterministic models, and extends to provide a novel methodology for symmetrising stochastic models also. Beyond this, our findings also demonstrate the utility of Markov categories for addressing complex problems in machine learning in a conceptually clear yet mathematically precise way.</description>

      <title>Statistical Error Bounds for GANs with Nonlinear Objective Functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are unsupervised learning methods for training a generator distribution to produce samples that approximate those drawn from a target distribution. Many such methods can be formulated as minimization of a metric or divergence between probability distributions. Recent works have derived statistical error bounds for GANs that are based on integral probability metrics (IPMs), e.g., WGAN which is based on the 1-Wasserstein metric. In general, IPMs are defined by optimizing a linear functional (difference of expectations) over a space of discriminators. A much larger class of GANs, which we here call $(f,\Gamma)$-GANs, can be constructed using $f$-divergences (e.g., Jensen-Shannon, KL, or $\alpha$-divergences) together with a regularizing discriminator space $\Gamma$ (e.g., $1$-Lipschitz functions). These GANs have nonlinear objective functions, depending on the choice of $f$, and have been shown to exhibit improved performance in a number of applications. In this work we derive statistical error bounds for $(f,\Gamma)$-GANs for general classes of $f$ and $\Gamma$ in the form of finite-sample concentration inequalities. These results prove the statistical consistency of $(f,\Gamma)$-GANs and reduce to the known results for IPM-GANs in the appropriate limit. Finally, our results also give new insight into the performance of GANs for distributions with unbounded support.</description>

      <title>ALTBI: Constructing Improved Outlier Detection Models via Optimization of Inlier-Memorization Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Outlier detection (OD) is the task of identifying unusual observations (or outliers) from a given or upcoming data by learning unique patterns of normal observations (or inliers). Recently, a study introduced a powerful unsupervised OD (UOD) solver based on a new observation of deep generative models, called inlier-memorization (IM) effect, which suggests that generative models memorize inliers before outliers in early learning stages. In this study, we aim to develop a theoretically principled method to address UOD tasks by maximally utilizing the IM effect. We begin by observing that the IM effect is observed more clearly when the given training data contain fewer outliers. This finding indicates a potential for enhancing the IM effect in UOD regimes if we can effectively exclude outliers from mini-batches when designing the loss function. To this end, we introduce two main techniques: 1) increasing the mini-batch size as the model training proceeds and 2) using an adaptive threshold to calculate the truncated loss function. We theoretically show that these two techniques effectively filter out outliers from the truncated loss function, allowing us to utilize the IM effect to the fullest. Coupled with an additional ensemble strategy, we propose our method and term it Adaptive Loss Truncation with Batch Increment (ALTBI). We provide extensive experimental results to demonstrate that ALTBI achieves state-of-the-art performance in identifying outliers compared to other recent methods, even with significantly lower computation costs. Additionally, we show that our method yields robust performances when combined with privacy-preserving algorithms.</description>

      <title>Dataset-Free Weight-Initialization on Restricted Boltzmann Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In feed-forward neural networks, dataset-free weight-initialization methods such as LeCun, Xavier (or Glorot), and He initializations have been developed. These methods randomly determine the initial values of weight parameters based on specific distributions (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distributions) without using training datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a dataset-free weight-initialization method is yet to be developed for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which are probabilistic neural networks consisting of two layers. In this study, we derive a dataset-free weight-initialization method for Bernoulli--Bernoulli RBMs based on statistical mechanical analysis. In the proposed weight-initialization method, the weight parameters are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is optimized based on our hypothesis that a standard deviation providing a larger layer correlation (LC) between the two layers improves the learning efficiency. The expression of the LC is derived based on a statistical mechanical analysis. The optimal value of the standard deviation corresponds to the maximum point of the LC. The proposed weight-initialization method is identical to Xavier initialization in a specific case (i.e., when the sizes of the two layers are the same, the random variables of the layers are $\{-1,1\}$-binary, and all bias parameters are zero). The validity of the proposed weight-initialization method is demonstrated in numerical experiments using a toy and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Manifolds, Random Matrices and Spectral Gaps: The geometric phases of generative diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05898v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the latent geometry of generative diffusion models under the manifold hypothesis. For this purpose, we analyze the spectrum of eigenvalues (and singular values) of the Jacobian of the score function, whose discontinuities (gaps) reveal the presence and dimensionality of distinct sub-manifolds. Using a statistical physics approach, we derive the spectral distributions and formulas for the spectral gaps under several distributional assumptions, and we compare these theoretical predictions with the spectra estimated from trained networks. Our analysis reveals the existence of three distinct qualitative phases during the generative process: a trivial phase; a manifold coverage phase where the diffusion process fits the distribution internal to the manifold; a consolidation phase where the score becomes orthogonal to the manifold and all particles are projected on the support of the data. This `division of labor' between different timescales provides an elegant explanation of why generative diffusion models are not affected by the manifold overfitting phenomenon that plagues likelihood-based models, since the internal distribution and the manifold geometry are produced at different time points during generation.</description>

      <title>Constrained Sampling with Primal-Dual Langevin Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work considers the problem of sampling from a probability distribution known up to a normalization constant while satisfying a set of statistical constraints specified by the expected values of general nonlinear functions. This problem finds applications in, e.g., Bayesian inference, where it can constrain moments to evaluate counterfactual scenarios or enforce desiderata such as prediction fairness. Methods developed to handle support constraints, such as those based on mirror maps, barriers, and penalties, are not suited for this task. This work therefore relies on gradient descent-ascent dynamics in Wasserstein space to put forward a discrete-time primal-dual Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm (PD-LMC) that simultaneously constrains the target distribution and samples from it. We analyze the convergence of PD-LMC under standard assumptions on the target distribution and constraints, namely (strong) convexity and log-Sobolev inequalities. To do so, we bring classical optimization arguments for saddle-point algorithms to the geometry of Wasserstein space. We illustrate the relevance and effectiveness of PD-LMC in several applications.</description>

      <title>Probability-density-aware Semi-supervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) assumes that neighbor points lie in the same category (neighbor assumption), and points in different clusters belong to various categories (cluster assumption). Existing methods usually rely on similarity measures to retrieve the similar neighbor points, ignoring cluster assumption, which may not utilize unlabeled information sufficiently and effectively. This paper first provides a systematical investigation into the significant role of probability density in SSL and lays a solid theoretical foundation for cluster assumption. To this end, we introduce a Probability-Density-Aware Measure (PM) to discern the similarity between neighbor points. To further improve Label Propagation, we also design a Probability-Density-Aware Measure Label Propagation (PMLP) algorithm to fully consider the cluster assumption in label propagation. Last but not least, we prove that traditional pseudo-labeling could be viewed as a particular case of PMLP, which provides a comprehensive theoretical understanding of PMLP's superior performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PMLP achieves outstanding performance compared with other recent methods.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning via Regularized Linear Discriminant Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02411v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear discriminant analysis is a widely used method for classification. However, the high dimensionality of predictors combined with small sample sizes often results in large classification errors. To address this challenge, it is crucial to leverage data from related source models to enhance the classification performance of a target model. We propose to address this problem in the framework of transfer learning.
  In this paper, we present novel transfer learning methods via regularized random-effects linear discriminant analysis, where the discriminant direction is estimated as a weighted combination of ridge estimates obtained from both the target and source models. Multiple strategies for determining these weights are introduced and evaluated, including one that minimizes the estimation risk of the discriminant vector and another that minimizes the classification error. Utilizing results from random matrix theory, we explicitly derive the asymptotic values of these weights and the associated classification error rates in the high-dimensional setting, where $p/n \rightarrow \gamma$, with $p$ representing the predictor dimension and $n$ the sample size. We also provide geometric interpretations of various weights and a guidance on which weights to choose. Extensive numerical studies, including simulations and analysis of proteomics-based 10-year cardiovascular disease risk classification, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>On Penalty-based Bilevel Gradient Descent Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05185v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization enjoys a wide range of applications in emerging machine learning and signal processing problems such as hyper-parameter optimization, image reconstruction, meta-learning, adversarial training, and reinforcement learning. However, bilevel optimization problems are traditionally known to be difficult to solve. Recent progress on bilevel algorithms mainly focuses on bilevel optimization problems through the lens of the implicit-gradient method, where the lower-level objective is either strongly convex or unconstrained. In this work, we tackle a challenging class of bilevel problems through the lens of the penalty method. We show that under certain conditions, the penalty reformulation recovers the (local) solutions of the original bilevel problem. Further, we propose the penalty-based bilevel gradient descent (PBGD) algorithm and establish its finite-time convergence for the constrained bilevel problem with lower-level constraints yet without lower-level strong convexity. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets showcase the efficiency of the proposed PBGD algorithm.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Improvements to Expected Improvement for Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20708v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Expected Improvement (EI) is arguably the most popular acquisition function in Bayesian optimization and has found countless successful applications, but its performance is often exceeded by that of more recent methods. Notably, EI and its variants, including for the parallel and multi-objective settings, are challenging to optimize because their acquisition values vanish numerically in many regions. This difficulty generally increases as the number of observations, dimensionality of the search space, or the number of constraints grow, resulting in performance that is inconsistent across the literature and most often sub-optimal. Herein, we propose LogEI, a new family of acquisition functions whose members either have identical or approximately equal optima as their canonical counterparts, but are substantially easier to optimize numerically. We demonstrate that numerical pathologies manifest themselves in "classic" analytic EI, Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI), as well as their constrained, noisy, and parallel variants, and propose corresponding reformulations that remedy these pathologies. Our empirical results show that members of the LogEI family of acquisition functions substantially improve on the optimization performance of their canonical counterparts and surprisingly, are on par with or exceed the performance of recent state-of-the-art acquisition functions, highlighting the understated role of numerical optimization in the literature.</description>

      <title>Partial-Label Learning with a Reject Option</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00592v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world applications, one often encounters ambiguously labeled data, where different annotators assign conflicting class labels. Partial-label learning allows training classifiers in this weakly supervised setting, where state-of-the-art methods already show good predictive performance. However, even the best algorithms give incorrect predictions, which can have severe consequences when they impact actions or decisions. We propose a novel risk-consistent nearest-neighbor-based partial-label learning algorithm with a reject option, that is, the algorithm can reject unsure predictions. Extensive experiments on artificial and real-world datasets show that our method provides the best trade-off between the number and accuracy of non-rejected predictions when compared to our competitors, which use confidence thresholds for rejecting unsure predictions. When evaluated without the reject option, our nearest-neighbor-based approach also achieves competitive prediction performance.</description>

      <title>Stability and Generalization in Free Adversarial Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While adversarial training methods have significantly improved the robustness of deep neural networks against norm-bounded adversarial perturbations, the generalization gap between their performance on training and test data is considerably greater than that of standard empirical risk minimization. Recent studies have aimed to connect the generalization properties of adversarially trained classifiers to the min-max optimization algorithm used in their training. In this work, we analyze the interconnections between generalization and optimization in adversarial training using the algorithmic stability framework. Specifically, our goal is to compare the generalization gap of neural networks trained using the vanilla adversarial training method, which fully optimizes perturbations at every iteration, with the free adversarial training method, which simultaneously optimizes norm-bounded perturbations and classifier parameters. We prove bounds on the generalization error of these methods, indicating that the free adversarial training method may exhibit a lower generalization gap between training and test samples due to its simultaneous min-max optimization of classifier weights and perturbation variables. We conduct several numerical experiments to evaluate the train-to-test generalization gap in vanilla and free adversarial training methods. Our empirical findings also suggest that the free adversarial training method could lead to a smaller generalization gap over a similar number of training iterations.

      <title>On the Mode-Seeking Properties of Langevin Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Langevin Dynamics framework, which aims to generate samples from the score function of a probability distribution, is widely used for analyzing and interpreting score-based generative modeling. While the convergence behavior of Langevin Dynamics under unimodal distributions has been extensively studied in the literature, in practice the data distribution could consist of multiple distinct modes. In this work, we investigate Langevin Dynamics in producing samples from multimodal distributions and theoretically study its mode-seeking properties. We prove that under a variety of sub-Gaussian mixtures, Langevin Dynamics is unlikely to find all mixture components within a sub-exponential number of steps in the data dimension. To reduce the mode-seeking tendencies of Langevin Dynamics, we propose \emph{Chained Langevin Dynamics}, which divides the data vector into patches of constant size and generates every patch sequentially conditioned on the previous patches. We perform a theoretical analysis of Chained Langevin Dynamics by reducing it to sampling from a constant-dimensional distribution. We present the results of several numerical experiments on synthetic and real image datasets, supporting our theoretical results on the iteration complexities of sample generation from mixture distributions using the chained and vanilla Langevin Dynamics. The code is available at https://github.com/Xiwei-Cheng/Chained_LD.</description>

      <title>DistPred: A Distribution-Free Probabilistic Inference Method for Regression and Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional regression and prediction tasks often only provide deterministic point estimates. To estimate the distribution or uncertainty of the response variable, traditional methods either assume that the posterior distribution of samples follows a Gaussian process or require thousands of forward passes for sample generation. We propose a novel approach called DistPred for regression and forecasting tasks, which overcomes the limitations of existing methods while remaining simple and powerful. Specifically, we transform proper scoring rules that measure the discrepancy between the predicted distribution and the target distribution into a differentiable discrete form and use it as a loss function to train the model end-to-end. This allows the model to sample numerous samples in a single forward pass to estimate the potential distribution of the response variable. We have compared our method with several existing approaches on multiple datasets and achieved state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, our method significantly improves computational efficiency. For example, compared to state-of-the-art models, DistPred has a 180x faster inference speed Experimental results can be reproduced through https://github.com/Anoise/DistPred.</description>

      <title>BoRA: Bayesian Hierarchical Low-Rank Adaption for Multi-Task Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15857v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Bayesian Hierarchical Low-Rank Adaption (BoRA), a novel method for finetuning multi-task Large Language Models (LLMs). Current finetuning approaches, such as Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA), perform exeptionally well in reducing training parameters and memory usage but face limitations when applied to multiple similar tasks. Practitioners usually have to choose between training separate models for each task or a single model for all tasks, both of which come with trade-offs in specialization and data utilization. BoRA addresses these trade-offs by leveraging a Bayesian hierarchical model that allows tasks to share information through global hierarchical priors. This enables tasks with limited data to benefit from the overall structure derived from related tasks while allowing tasks with more data to specialize. Our experimental results show that BoRA outperforms both individual and unified model approaches, achieving lower perplexity and better generalization across tasks. This method provides a scalable and efficient solution for multi-task LLM finetuning, with significant practical implications for diverse applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08861v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical generative models that produce samples through an iterative process, such as Flow Matching and denoising diffusion models, have seen widespread use, but there have not been many theoretically-sound methods for improving these models with reward fine-tuning. In this work, we cast reward fine-tuning as stochastic optimal control (SOC). Critically, we prove that a very specific memoryless noise schedule must be enforced during fine-tuning, in order to account for the dependency between the noise variable and the generated samples. We also propose a new algorithm named Adjoint Matching which outperforms existing SOC algorithms, by casting SOC problems as a regression problem. We find that our approach significantly improves over existing methods for reward fine-tuning, achieving better consistency, realism, and generalization to unseen human preference reward models, while retaining sample diversity.</description>

Abstract: We study how representation learning can improve the learning efficiency of contextual bandit problems. We study the setting where we play T contextual linear bandits with dimension d simultaneously, and these T bandit tasks collectively share a common linear representation with a dimensionality of r much smaller than d. We present a new algorithm based on alternating projected gradient descent (GD) and minimization estimator to recover a low-rank feature matrix. Using the proposed estimator, we present a multi-task learning algorithm for linear contextual bandits and prove the regret bound of our algorithm. We presented experiments and compared the performance of our algorithm against benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>Robust Gaussian Processes via Relevance Pursuit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.24222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are non-parametric probabilistic regression models that are popular due to their flexibility, data efficiency, and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. However, standard GP models assume homoskedastic Gaussian noise, while many real-world applications are subject to non-Gaussian corruptions. Variants of GPs that are more robust to alternative noise models have been proposed, and entail significant trade-offs between accuracy and robustness, and between computational requirements and theoretical guarantees. In this work, we propose and study a GP model that achieves robustness against sparse outliers by inferring data-point-specific noise levels with a sequential selection procedure maximizing the log marginal likelihood that we refer to as relevance pursuit. We show, surprisingly, that the model can be parameterized such that the associated log marginal likelihood is strongly concave in the data-point-specific noise variances, a property rarely found in either robust regression objectives or GP marginal likelihoods. This in turn implies the weak submodularity of the corresponding subset selection problem, and thereby proves approximation guarantees for the proposed algorithm. We compare the model's performance relative to other approaches on diverse regression and Bayesian optimization tasks, including the challenging but common setting of sparse corruptions of the labels within or close to the function range.</description>

      <title>Abstracted Shapes as Tokens -- A Generalizable and Interpretable Model for Time-series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01006v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In time-series analysis, many recent works seek to provide a unified view and representation for time-series across multiple domains, leading to the development of foundation models for time-series data. Despite diverse modeling techniques, existing models are black boxes and fail to provide insights and explanations about their representations. In this paper, we present VQShape, a pre-trained, generalizable, and interpretable model for time-series representation learning and classification. By introducing a novel representation for time-series data, we forge a connection between the latent space of VQShape and shape-level features. Using vector quantization, we show that time-series from different domains can be described using a unified set of low-dimensional codes, where each code can be represented as an abstracted shape in the time domain. On classification tasks, we show that the representations of VQShape can be utilized to build interpretable classifiers, achieving comparable performance to specialist models. Additionally, in zero-shot learning, VQShape and its codebook can generalize to previously unseen datasets and domains that are not included in the pre-training process. The code and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/YunshiWen/VQShape.</description>

      <title>A Review of Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Probabilistic Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16370v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in image segmentation play an integral role within the broad scope of Deep Learning-based Computer Vision. Furthermore, their widespread applicability in critical real-world tasks has resulted in challenges related to the reliability of such algorithms. Hence, uncertainty quantification has been extensively studied within this context, enabling the expression of model ignorance (epistemic uncertainty) or data ambiguity (aleatoric uncertainty) to prevent uninformed decision-making. Due to the rapid adoption of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based segmentation models in high-stake applications, a substantial body of research has been published on this very topic, causing its swift expansion into a distinct field. This work provides a comprehensive overview of probabilistic segmentation, by discussing fundamental concepts of uncertainty quantification, governing advancements in the field as well as the application to various tasks. Moreover, literature on both types of uncertainties trace back to four key applications: (1) to quantify statistical inconsistencies in the annotation process due ambiguous images, (2) correlating prediction error with uncertainty, (3) expanding the model hypothesis space for better generalization, and (4) Active Learning. An extensive discussion follows that includes an overview of utilized datasets for each of the applications and evaluation of the available methods. We also highlight challenges related to architectures, uncertainty quantification methods, standardization and benchmarking, and finally end with recommendations for future work such as methods based on single forward passes and models that appropriately leverage volumetric data.</description>

      <title>Gradient descent inference in empirical risk minimization</title>

Abstract: Gradient descent is one of the most widely used iterative algorithms in modern statistical learning. However, its precise algorithmic dynamics in high-dimensional settings remain only partially understood, which has therefore limited its broader potential for statistical inference applications.
  This paper provides a precise, non-asymptotic distributional characterization of gradient descent iterates in a broad class of empirical risk minimization problems, in the so-called mean-field regime where the sample size is proportional to the signal dimension. Our non-asymptotic state evolution theory holds for both general non-convex loss functions and non-Gaussian data, and reveals the central role of two Onsager correction matrices that precisely characterize the non-trivial dependence among all gradient descent iterates in the mean-field regime.
  Although the Onsager correction matrices are typically analytically intractable, our state evolution theory facilitates a generic gradient descent inference algorithm that consistently estimates these matrices across a broad class of models. Leveraging this algorithm, we show that the state evolution can be inverted to construct (i) data-driven estimators for the generalization error of gradient descent iterates and (ii) debiased gradient descent iterates for inference of the unknown signal. Detailed applications to two canonical models--linear regression and (generalized) logistic regression--are worked out to illustrate model-specific features of our general theory and inference methods.</description>

      <title>Fast data inversion for high-dimensional dynamical systems from noisy measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a scalable approach for a flexible latent factor model for high-dimensional dynamical systems. Each latent factor process has its own correlation and variance parameters, and the orthogonal factor loading matrix can be either fixed or estimated. We utilize an orthogonal factor loading matrix that avoids computing the inversion of the posterior covariance matrix at each time of the Kalman filter, and derive closed-form expressions in an expectation-maximization algorithm for parameter estimation, which substantially reduces the computational complexity without approximation. Our study is motivated by inversely estimating slow slip events from geodetic data, such as continuous GPS measurements. Extensive simulated studies illustrate higher accuracy and scalability of our approach compared to alternatives. By applying our method to geodetic measurements in the Cascadia region, our estimated slip better agrees with independently measured seismic data of tremor events. The substantial acceleration from our method enables the use of massive noisy data for geological hazard quantification and other applications.</description>
