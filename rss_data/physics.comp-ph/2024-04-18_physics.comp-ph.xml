      <title>Numerical methods and improvements for simulating quasi-static elastoplastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypo-elastoplasticity is a framework suitable for modeling the mechanics of many hard materials that have small elastic deformation and large plastic deformation. In most laboratory tests for these materials the Cauchy stress is in quasi-static equilibrium. Rycroft et al. discovered a mathematical correspondence between this physical system and the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, and developed a projection method similar to Chorin's projection method (1968) for incompressible Newtonian fluids. Here, we improve the original projection method to simulate quasi-static hypo-elastoplasticity, by making three improvements. First, drawing inspiration from the second-order projection method for incompressible Newtonian fluids, we formulate a second-order in time numerical scheme for quasi-static hypo-elastoplasticity. Second, we implement a finite element method for solving the elliptic equations in the projection step, which provides both numerical benefits and flexibility. Third, we develop an adaptive global time-stepping scheme, which can compute accurate solutions in fewer timesteps. Our numerical tests use an example physical model of a bulk metallic glass based on the shear transformation zone theory, but the numerical methods can be applied to any elastoplastic material.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Methods for Colloidal Silver Nanoparticle Concentration and Size Distribution Determination from UV-Vis Extinction Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron microscopy, while reliable, is an expensive, slow, and inefficient technique for thorough size distribution characterization of both mono- and polydisperse colloidal nanoparticles. If rapid in-situ characterization of colloid samples is to be achieved, a different approach, based on fast, widely accessible, and inexpensive optical measurements such as UV-Vis spectroscopy in combination with spectra interpretation related to Mie scattering theory, is needed. In this article, we present a tandem deep neural network (DNN) for the size distribution and concentration prediction of close to spherical silver colloidal nanoparticle batches synthesized via the seeded growth method. The first DNN identified the dipole component of the localized surface plasmon resonance and the second one determined the size distribution from the isolated spectral component. The training data was engineered to be bias-free and generated numerically. High prediction accuracy with typical root mean square percentage error of mean size ca. 1.2% was maintained, spanning the entire prediction range up to 150 nm in radius, suggesting the possible extension limits of the effective medium theory used for simulating the spectra. The DNN-predicted nanoparticle concentrations also were very close to the ones expected based on synthesis precursor contents as well as measured by atomic absorption spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>AI-equipped scanning probe microscopy for autonomous site-specific atomic-level characterization at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an advanced scanning probe microscopy system enhanced with artificial intelligence (AI-SPM) designed for self-driving atomic-scale measurements. This system expertly identifies and manipulates atomic positions with high precision, autonomously performing tasks such as spectroscopic data acquisition and atomic adjustment. An outstanding feature of AI-SPM is its ability to detect and adapt to surface defects, targeting or avoiding them as necessary. It's also engineered to address typical challenges such as positional drift and tip apex atomic variations due to the thermal effect, ensuring accurate, site-specific surface analyses. Our tests under the demanding conditions of room temperature have demonstrated the robustness of the system, successfully navigating thermal drift and tip fluctuations. During these tests on the Si(111)-(7x7) surface, AI-SPM autonomously identified defect-free regions and performed a large number of current-voltage spectroscopy measurements at different adatom sites, while autonomously compensating for thermal drift and monitoring probe health. These experiments produce extensive data sets that are critical for reliable materials characterization and demonstrate the potential of AI-SPM to significantly improve data acquisition. The integration of AI into SPM technologies represents a step toward more effective, precise and reliable atomic-level surface analysis, revolutionizing materials characterization methods.</description>

      <title>Mean field initialization of the Annealed Importance Sampling algorithm for an efficient evaluation of the Partition Function of Restricted Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic models in physics often require from the evaluation of normalized Boltzmann factors, which in turn implies the computation of the partition function Z. Getting the exact value of Z, though, becomes a forbiddingly expensive task as the system size increases. This problem is also present in probabilistic learning models such as the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), where the situation is even worse as the exact learning rules implies the computation of Z at each iteration. A possible way to tackle this problem is to use the Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS) algorithm, which provides a tool to stochastically estimate the partition function of the system. So far, the standard application of the AIS algorithm starts from the uniform probability distribution and uses a large number of Monte Carlo steps to obtain reliable estimations of Z following an annealing process. In this work we show that both the quality of the estimation and the cost of the computation can be significantly improved by using a properly selected mean-field starting probability distribution. We perform a systematic analysis of AIS in both small- and large-sized problems, and compare the results to exact values in problems where these are known. As a result of our systematic analysis, we propose two successful strategies that work well in all the problems analyzed. We conclude that these are good starting points to estimate the partition function with AIS with a relatively low computational cost.</description>

      <title>Molecular relaxation by reverse diffusion with time step prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular relaxation, finding the equilibrium state of a non-equilibrium structure, is an essential component of computational chemistry to understand reactivity. Classical force field methods often rely on insufficient local energy minimization, while neural network force field models require large labeled datasets encompassing both equilibrium and non-equilibrium structures. As a remedy, we propose MoreRed, molecular relaxation by reverse diffusion, a conceptually novel and purely statistical approach where non-equilibrium structures are treated as noisy instances of their corresponding equilibrium states. To enable the denoising of arbitrarily noisy inputs via a generative diffusion model, we further introduce a novel diffusion time step predictor. Notably, MoreRed learns a simpler pseudo potential energy surface instead of the complex physical potential energy surface. It is trained on a significantly smaller, and thus computationally cheaper, dataset consisting of solely unlabeled equilibrium structures, avoiding the computation of non-equilibrium structures altogether. We compare MoreRed to classical force fields, equivariant neural network force fields trained on a large dataset of equilibrium and non-equilibrium data, as well as a semi-empirical tight-binding model. To assess this quantitatively, we evaluate the root-mean-square deviation between the found equilibrium structures and the reference equilibrium structures as well as their DFT energies.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised machine learning for the detection of exotic phases in skyrmion phase diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Undoubtedly, machine learning techniques are being increasingly applied to a wide range of situations in the field of condensed matter. Amongst these techniques, unsupervised techniques are especially attractive, since they imply the possibility of extracting information from the data without previous labeling. In this work, we resort to the technique known as anomaly detection to explore potential exotic phases in skyrmion phase diagrams, using two different algorithms: Principal Component Analysis and Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). First, we train these algorithms with an artificial dataset of skyrmion lattices constructed from an analytical parametrization, for different magnetizations, skyrmion lattice orientations, and skyrmion radii. We apply the trained algorithms to a set of snapshots obtained from Monte Carlo simulations for three ferromagnetic skyrmion models: two with in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DMI) in the triangular and kagome lattices, and one with an additional out of plane DMI in the kagome lattice. Then, we compare the root mean square error (RMSE) and the binary cross entropy between the input and output snapshots as a function of the external magnetic field and temperature. We find that the RMSE and its variance in the CAE case may be useful to not only detect exotic low temperature phases, but also to differentiate between the characteristic low temperature orderings of a skyrmion phase diagram (helical, skyrmions and ferromagnetic). Moreover, we apply the skyrmion trained CAE to two antiferromagnetic models in the triangular lattice, one that gives rise to antiferromagnetic skyrmions, and the pure exchange antiferromagnetic case. Despite the predictably larger RMSE, we find that, even in these cases, RMSE is also an indicator of different orderings and the emergence of particular features, such as the well-known pseudo-plateau in the pure exchange case.</description>

      <title>Texture tomography, a versatile framework to study crystalline texture in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The crystallographic texture is a key organization feature of many technical and biological materials. In these materials, especially hierarchically structured ones, the preferential alignment of the nano constituents is heavily influencing the macroscopic behaviour of the material. In order to study local crystallographic texture with both high spatial and angular resolution, we developed Texture tomography (TexTOM). This approach allows to model the diffraction data of polycrystalline materials by using the full reciprocal space of the ensemble of crystals and describe the texture in each voxel via a orientation distribution function. This means, it provides 3D reconstructions of the local texture by measuring the probabilities of all crystal orientations. The TexTOM approach addresses limitations associated with existing models: It correlates the intensities from several Bragg reflections, thus reduces ambiguities resulting from symmetry. Further, it yields quantitative probability distributions of local real space crystal orientations without further assumptions on the sample structure. Finally, its efficient mathematical formulation enables reconstructions faster than the time-scale of the experiment. In this manuscript, we present the mathematical model, the inversion strategy and its current experimental implementation. We show characterizations of simulated data as well as experimental data obtained from a synthetic, inorganic model sample, the silica-witherite biomorph. In conclusion, Tex-TOM provides a versatile framework to reconstruct 3D quantitative texture information for polycrystalline samples. In this way, it opens the door for unprecedented insights into the nanostructural makeup of natural and technical materials.</description>

      <title>Six decades of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model: A guide through its spatio-temporal dynamics and influence across disciplines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo equation, originally conceived in neuroscience during the 1960s, became a key model providing a simplified view of excitable neuron cell behavior. Its applicability, however, extends beyond neuroscience into fields like cardiac physiology, cell division, population dynamics, electronics, and other natural phenomena. In this review spanning six decades of research, we discuss the diverse spatio-temporal dynamical behaviors described by the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation. These include dynamics like bistability, oscillations, and excitability, but it also addresses more complex phenomena such as traveling waves and extended patterns in coupled systems. The review serves as a guide for modelers aiming to utilize the strengths of the FitzHugh-Nagumo model to capture generic dynamical behavior. It not only catalogs known dynamical states and bifurcations, but also extends previous studies by providing stability and bifurcation analyses for coupled spatial systems.</description>

      <title>High-order meshless global stability analysis of Taylor-Couette flows in complex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, meshless methods have become popular in numerically solving partial differential equations and have been employed to solve equations governing fluid flows, heat transfer, and species transport. In the present study, a numerical solver is developed employing the meshless framework to efficiently compute the hydrodynamic stability of fluid flows in complex geometries. The developed method is tested on two cases of Taylor-Couette flows. The concentric case represents the parallel flow assumption incorporated in the Orr-Sommerfeld model and the eccentric Taylor-Couette flow incorporates a non-parallel base flow with separation bubbles. The method was validated against earlier works by Marcus [1], Oikawa et al. [2], Leclercq et al. [3], and Mittal et al. [4]. The results for the two cases and the effectiveness of the method are discussed in detail. The method is then applied to Taylor-Couette flow in an elliptical enclosure and the stability of the flow is investigated.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Transcorrelated Method enabling accurate Quantum Chemistry on near-term Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is emerging as a new computational paradigm with the potential to transform several research fields, including quantum chemistry. However, current hardware limitations (including limited coherence times, gate infidelities, and limited connectivity) hamper the straightforward implementation of most quantum algorithms and call for more noise-resilient solutions. In quantum chemistry, the limited number of available qubits and gate operations is particularly restrictive since, for each molecular orbital, one needs, in general, two qubits. In this study, we propose an explicitly correlated Ansatz based on the transcorrelated (TC) approach, which transfers -- without any approximation -- correlation from the wavefunction directly into the Hamiltonian, thus reducing the number of resources needed to achieve accurate results with noisy, near-term quantum devices. In particular, we show that the exact transcorrelated approach not only allows for more shallow circuits but also improves the convergence towards the so-called basis set limit, providing energies within chemical accuracy to experiment with smaller basis sets and, therefore, fewer qubits. We demonstrate our method by computing bond lengths, dissociation energies, and vibrational frequencies close to experimental results for the hydrogen dimer and lithium hydride using just 4 and 6 qubits, respectively. Conventional methods require at least ten times more qubits for the same accuracy.</description>

      <title>ANTN: Bridging Autoregressive Neural Networks and Tensor Networks for Quantum Many-Body Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body physics simulation has important impacts on understanding fundamental science and has applications to quantum materials design and quantum technology. However, due to the exponentially growing size of the Hilbert space with respect to the particle number, a direct simulation is intractable. While representing quantum states with tensor networks and neural networks are the two state-of-the-art methods for approximate simulations, each has its own limitations in terms of expressivity and inductive bias. To address these challenges, we develop a novel architecture, Autoregressive Neural TensorNet (ANTN), which bridges tensor networks and autoregressive neural networks. We show that Autoregressive Neural TensorNet parameterizes normalized wavefunctions, allows for exact sampling, generalizes the expressivity of tensor networks and autoregressive neural networks, and inherits a variety of symmetries from autoregressive neural networks. We demonstrate our approach on quantum state learning as well as finding the ground state of the challenging 2D $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model with different systems sizes and coupling parameters, outperforming both tensor networks and autoregressive neural networks. Our work opens up new opportunities for quantum many-body physics simulation, quantum technology design, and generative modeling in artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>SmoQyDQMC.jl: A flexible implementation of determinant quantum Monte Carlo for Hubbard and electron-phonon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09395v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the SmoQyDQMC.jl package, a Julia implementation of the determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. SmoQyDQMC.jl supports generalized tight-binding Hamiltonians with on-site Hubbard and generalized electron-phonon interactions, including non-linear $e$-ph coupling and anharmonic lattice potentials. Our implementations use hybrid Monte Carlo methods with exact forces for sampling the phonon fields, enabling efficient simulation of low-energy phonon branches, including acoustic phonons. The SmoQyDQMC.jl package also uses a flexible scripting interface, allowing users to adapt it to different workflows and interface with other software packages in the Julia ecosystem. The code for this package can be downloaded from our GitHub repository at https://github.com/SmoQySuite/SmoQyDQMC.jl or installed using the Julia package manager. The online documentation, including examples, can be obtained from our document page at https://smoqysuite.github.io/SmoQyDQMC.jl/stable/.</description>

      <title>Structural complexity of snapshots of 2D Fermi-Hubbard systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15618v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of quantum gas microscopy for two-dimensional optical lattices has provided an unparalleled tool to study the Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) with ultracold atoms. Spin-resolved projective measurements, or snapshots, have played a significant role in quantifying correlation functions which uncover underlying physical phenomena such as antiferromagnetism at commensurate filling on bipartite lattices, and other charge and spin correlations, as well as dynamical properties at various densities. However, in order to interpret these results and to establish temperature scales, comparison against theory is generally needed. Here, we employ a recent concept, the {\em multi-scale structural complexity}, and show that when computed for the snapshots (of either single spin species, local moments, or total density) it can provide a theory-free property, immediately accessible to experiments. Specifically, after benchmarking results for Ising and XY models, we study the structural complexity of snapshots of the repulsive FHM in the two-dimensional square lattice as a function of doping and temperature. We generate projective measurements using determinant quantum Monte Carlo and compare their complexities against those from the experiment. We demonstrate that these complexities are linked to relevant physical observables such as the entropy and double occupancy. Their behaviors capture the development of correlations and relevant length scales in the system. We provide an open-source code in Python which can be implemented into data analysis routines in experimental settings for the square lattice.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Quantum Computing for Quantum Chemistry: Reducing Circuit Complexity with Transcorrelated and Adaptive Ansatz Techniques</title>

Abstract: The near-term utility of quantum computers is hindered by hardware constraints in the form of noise. One path to achieving noise resilience in hybrid quantum algorithms is to decrease the required circuit depth -- the number of applied gates -- to solve a given problem. This work demonstrates how to reduce circuit depth by combining the transcorrelated (TC) approach with adaptive quantum ans\"atze and their implementations in the context of variational quantum imaginary time evolution (AVQITE). The combined TC-AVQITE method is used to calculate ground state energies across the potential energy surfaces of H$_4$, LiH, and H$_2$O. In particular, H$_4$ is a notoriously difficult case where unitary coupled cluster theory, including singles and doubles excitations, fails to provide accurate results. Adding TC yields energies close to the complete basis set (CBS) limit while reducing the number of necessary operators -- and thus circuit depth -- in the adaptive ans\"atze. The reduced circuit depth furthermore makes our algorithm more noise-resilient and accelerates convergence. Our study demonstrates that combining the TC method with adaptive ans\"atze yields compact, noise-resilient, and easy-to-optimize quantum circuits that yield accurate quantum chemistry results close to the CBS limit.</description>

      <title>A Novel Class of Phase Space Representations for the Exact Population Dynamics of Two-State Quantum Systems and the Relation to Triangle Window Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04868</link>

Abstract: Isomorphism of the two-state system is heuristic in understanding the dynamical or statistical behavior of the simplest yet most quantum system that has no classical counterpart. We use the constraint phase space developed in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 204105; 2019, 151, 024105 and J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2021, 12, 2496-2501, non-covariant phase space functions, time-dependent weight functions, and time-dependent normalization factors to construct a novel class of phase space representations of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system. The equations of motion of the trajectory on constraint phase space are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. The contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression for the population dynamics is always positive semi-definite. We also prove that the triangle window function approach, albeit proposed as a heuristic empirical model in J. Chem. Phys. 2016, 145, 144108, is related to a special case of the novel class and leads to an isomorphic representation of the exact population dynamics of the two-state quantum system.</description>
