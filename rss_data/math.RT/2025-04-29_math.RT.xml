      <title>Algorithm classifying roots of star-shaped Kac-Moody root systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a star-shaped Kac-Moody root system, we provide an effective algorithm to obtain representatives of the Weyl group orbits of roots with a given norm and implement it as a computer program. We also explain the relationship between these orbits and Fuchsian differential equations on the Riemann sphere, as well as higher-dimensional Painleve-type equations.</description>

      <title>On the relative Langlands duality for $\operatorname{Sp}_{2n} \backslash \operatorname{GL}_{2n+1}$ (with an appendix by Zeyu Wang)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We verify the relative Langlands duality conjecture proposed by Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis, Venkatesh for the hyperspherical Hamiltonian variety $T^*(\operatorname{Sp}_{2n}\backslash \operatorname{GL}_{2n+1})$. We provide numerical (over number fields and function fields) and geometric (in the \'{e}tale setting) evidence that its dual Hamiltonian variety should be $T^*(\operatorname{GL}_n \times \operatorname{GL}_{n+1} \backslash \operatorname{GL}_{2n+1})$ as is predicted by Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis, Venkatesh.</description>

      <title>Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for the cyclotomic Hecke algebra and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for irreducible characters of the cyclotomic Hecke algebra on certain standard elements, which fully determine their values. This work builds upon our recent multi-parameter Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for Macdonald polynomials. Our Murnaghan-Nakayama rule can be readily specialized to retrieve various existing rules, including those for the complex reflection group of type $G(m, 1, n)$ and the Iwahori-Hecke algebra in types $A$ and $B$. In a dual picture, we establish an iterative formula for the irreducible characters on upper multipartitions, utilizing the vertex operator realization of Schur functions.
  As applications we derive an Regev-type formula and an L\"ubeck-Prasad-Adin-Roichman-type formula for the cyclotomic Hecke algebra, thereby extending the corresponding formulas for the Iwahori-Hecke algebra in type $A$ and the complex reflection group of type $G(m,1,n)$ to the setting of the cyclotomic Hecke algebra, respectively. Finally, we introduce the notion of the multiple bitrace of the cyclotomic Hecke algebra to formulate the second orthogonal relation of the irreducible characters. We also provide a general combinatorial rule to compute the multiple bitrace.</description>

      <title>Kazhdan isomorphism over families and integrality under close local fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a split connected reductive group defined over $\mathbb{Z}$. Let $F$ be a locally compact non-Archimedean field with residue characteristic $p$. For a locally compact non-Archimedean field $F'$ that is sufficiently close to $F$, D.Kazhdan establishes an isomorphism between the Hecke algebras $\mathcal{H}(G(F),K_m)$ and $\mathcal{H}(G(F'),K_m')$ with coefficients in $\mathbb{C}$, where $K_m$ (resp. $K_m'$) is the $m$-th congruence subgroup of $G(F)$ (resp. $G(F')$). This result is generalised to arbitrary connected reductive algebraic groups by R.Ganapathy. In this article, we extend the result further where the coefficient ring of the Hecke algebras is considered to be more general, namely Noetherian $\mathbb{Z}_l$-algebras with $l\ne p$. Then we use this isomorphism to prove certain compatibility result in the context of $l$-adic representation theory.</description>

      <title>Divisibility of Character Values of Representations of Coxeter Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $d$ be a positive integer. We study the proportion of irreducible characters of infinite families of irreducible Coxeter groups whose values evaluated on a fixed element $g$ are divisible by $d$. For Coxeter groups of types $A_n, B_n$ and $D_n$, the proportion tends to $1$ as $n$ approaches infinity. For Dihedral groups, which are Coxeter groups of type $I_2(n)$, we compute the limit of the proportion.</description>

      <title>Generalised tree modules: Hom-sets and indecomposability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a zero-relation algebra over a field $\mathcal K$, Crawley-Boevey introduced the concept of a tree module and provided a combinatorial description of a basis for the space of homomorphisms between two tree modules--the basis elements are called graph maps. The indecomposability of tree modules is essentially due to Gabriel. We relax a condition in the definition of a tree module to define generalised tree modules and when $\mathrm{char}(\mathcal K)\neq2$, under a certain condition, provide a combinatorial description of a finite generating set for the space of homomorphisms between two such modules--we call the generators generalised graph maps. As an application, we provide a sufficient condition for the (in)decomposability of certain generalised tree modules. We also show that all indecomposable modules over a Dynkin quiver of type $\mathbf D$ can be viewed as generalised tree modules.</description>

      <title>Radial restriction of spherical functions on supergroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Hopf superalgebra structure of the enveloping algebra $U(\mathfrak g)$ of a Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak=\mathrm{Lie}(G)$, we give a purely algebraic treatment of $K$-bi-invariant functions on a Lie supergroup $G$, where $K$ is a sub-supergroup of $G$. We realize $K$-bi-invariant functions as a subalgebra $\mathcal A(\mathfrak g,\mathfrak k)$ of the dual of $U(\mathfrak g)$ whose elements vanish on the coideal $\mathcal I=\mathfrak kU(\mathfrak g)+U(\mathfrak g)\mathfrak k$, where $\mathfrak k=\mathrm{Lie}(K)$. Next, for a general class of supersymmetric pairs $(\mathfrak g,\mathfrak k)$, we define the radial restriction of elements of $\mathcal A(\mathfrak g,\mathfrak k)$ and prove that it is an injection into $S(\mathfrak a)^*$, where $\mathfrak a$ is the Cartan subspace of $(\mathfrak g,\mathfrak k)$. Finally, we compute a basis for $\mathcal I$ in the case of the pair $(\mathfrak{gl}(1|2), \mathfrak{osp}(1|2))$, and uncover a connection with the Bernoulli and Euler zigzag numbers.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetry for brane diagrams and bow varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide combinatorial and numerical criteria to characterize affine type A bow diagrams giving rise to a non-empty bow variety. The key idea is to prove that such diagrams correspond to supersymmetric brane systems in type IIB string theory, allowing us to reformulate the problem in purely combinatorial terms. To achieve this, we characterize supersymmetry for affine type A brane systems (and, by extension, for types B, C, and D) using Hanany--Witten transitions. This leads to a finite-step algorithm that decides whether a given affine type A bow or brane diagram is supersymmetric, which consists in checking a finite set of inequalities, so providing a numerical criterion for non-emptiness. Finally, we provide a different perspective by introducing a further criterion in terms of weights of affine Lie algebras. Along the way, we also prove that increasing dimension vectors between two consecutive x-points or arrows in a bow diagram (not necessarily of type A) preserves the properties of generating non-empty bow varieties.</description>

      <title>Characteristic polynomials and some combinatorics for finite Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $W$ be a finite Coxeter group with Coxeter generating set $S=\{s_1,\ldots,s_n\}$, and $\rho$ be a complex finite dimensional representation of $W$. The characteristic polynomial of $\rho$ is defined as
  \begin{equation*}
  d(S,\rho)=\det[x_0I+x_1\rho(s_1)+\cdots+x_n\rho(s_n)],
  \end{equation*}
  where $I$ is the identity operator. In this paper, we show the existence of a combinatorics structure within $W$, and thereby prove that for any two complex finite dimensional representations $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ of $W$, $d(S,\rho_1)=d(S,\rho_2)$ if and only if $\rho_1 \cong \rho_2$.</description>

      <title>Classification of coadjoint orbits for the maximal unipotent subgroup in the simple group of type F_4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let N be the maximal unipotent subgroup in the simple algebraic group of type {\Phi}. It naturally acts on the space dual to the Lie algebra n of N, and this action is called coadjoint. Such orbits play the key role in the orbit method of A.A. Kirillov. In this work, we classify the orbits of this action in the case of {\Phi} = F_4 in terms of supports of canonical forms. This means that we will present a set S of linear forms such that for any coadjoint orbit there exists a unique form from S belonging to that orbit. The set of canonical forms will be explicitly described in terms of supports.</description>

      <title>On the global dimension three endomorphism algebras of the minimal generator-cogenerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main goal of this paper is to study the class of algebras for which the global dimension of the endomorphism ring of the generator-cogenerator, given by the sum of the projective and injective modules, is equal to three. We will refer to these algebras as representation-hereditary algebras. We show that these algebras are torsionless-finite, as defined by Ringel. These algebras do not necessarily have finite global dimension; however, when there is no non-zero morphism from an injective to a projective module, they have global dimension less than or equal to two, with some additional homological properties. By utilizing the general framework provided by the study of the representation dimension of an algebra, we present further homological consequences. In the case where these algebras are tame quasi-tilted algebras, we prove that they belong to certain classes of tilted algebras. Although not all tilted algebras are representation-hereditary, we provide sufficient conditions for them to be representation-hereditary.</description>

      <title>Fourier and Helgason Fourier transforms for Vector Bundle-valued Differential Forms on Homogeneous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the perspective of the functional equation  satised by the classical Fourier transform to derive the Helgason  Fourier transform map $\Omega^{l}(G/K,W)\longrightarrow\Omega^{k}(G/K\times G/P,V[\chi]):f\longmapsto \widehat{f}:G/K\times G/P\mapsto V[\chi]:(x,b)\longmapsto\widehat{f}(x,b)$ (for $W-$valued differential forms $f\in \Omega^{l}(G/K,W)$) as the $G-$ invariant vector bundle-valued differential form $\widehat{f}$ on the product  space $G/K\times G/P$ whose image under the vector bundle-valued Poisson transform is the fibre convolution-integral $\varphi^{U^{\sigma,\nu}}_{\tau,l,k}* f$ on $G/K,$ where $\varphi^{U^{\sigma,\nu}}_{\tau,l,k}$ is the $W-$valued $\tau-$spherical $l-$form on $G/K.$ Explicitly, we prove that $$\widehat{f}_{l,k,\lambda}(x,b)=({\bf C_{o}(\lambda)}^{-1}\circ\beta^{V}(\lambda))\circ(\int_{G/K}\varphi^{U^{\sigma\nu},t}_{\tau,l,k}\wedge\pi^{*}_{K}f)(x),$$ where $b\in G/P$ is a consequence of the boundary map $\beta^{V}(\lambda)$ and ${\bf C_{o}(\lambda)}$ is the vector bundle-valued Harish-Chandra $c-$function. The Fourier transform map $\Omega^{l}(G/K,W)\longrightarrow\Omega^{k}(G/K\times G/P,W)$ $:f\mapsto f^{\triangle}$ $:(b,x)\longmapsto f^{\triangle}(b,x)$ is then established to be explicitly given as $f^{\triangle}_{l,k,\lambda}(b,x)=$ $$\int_{G/P}\phi_{k,l}\wedge\pi^{*}_{P}(({\bf C_{o}(\lambda)}^{-1}\circ\beta^{V}(\lambda))\circ(\int_{G/K}\varphi^{U^{\sigma\nu},t}_{\tau,l,k}\wedge\pi^{*}_{K}f)(x)).$$</description>

      <title>Color rules for cyclic wreath products and semigroup algebras from projective toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of "color rules" for computing class functions of $Z_k \wr S_n$, where $Z_k$ is the cyclic group of order $k$ and $S_n$ is the symmetric group on $n$ letters. Using a general sign-reversing involution and a map of order $k$, we give a combinatorial proof that the irreducible decomposition of these class functions is given by a weighted sum over semistandard tableaux in the colors. Since using two colors at once is also a color rule, we are consequently able to decompose arbitrary tensor products of representations whose characters can be computed via color rules. This method extends to class functions of $G \wr S_n$ where $G$ is a finite abelian group. We give a number of applications, including decomposing tensor powers of the defining representation, along with a combinatorial proof of the Murnaghan-Nakayama rule for $Z_k \wr S_n$.
  Our main application is to the study of the linear action of $Z_k \wr S_n$ on bigraded affine semigroup algebras arising from the product of projective toric varieties. In the case of the product of projective spaces, our methods give the decomposition of these bigraded characters into irreducible characters, thus deriving equivariant generalizations of Euler-Mahonian identities.</description>

      <title>Dual canonical bases of quantum groups and $\imath$quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\imath$quantum groups have two realizations: one via the $\imath$Hall algebras and the other via the quantum Grothendieck rings of quiver varieties, as developed by the first author and Wang. Perverse sheaves provide the dual canonical bases for $\imath$quantum groups of type ADE with integral and positive structure constants. In this paper, we present a new construction of the dual canonical bases in the setting of $\imath$Hall algebras. We also introduce Fourier transforms for both $\imath$Hall algebras and quantum Grothendieck rings, and prove the invariance of the dual canonical bases under braid group actions and Fourier transforms. Additionally, we establish the positivity of the transition matrix coefficients from the Hall basis (and PBW basis) to the dual canonical basis. As quantum groups can be regarded as $\imath$quantum groups of diagonal type, we demonstrate that the dual canonical bases of Drinfeld double quantum groups coincide with the double canonical bases defined by Berenstein and Greenstein, resolving several conjectures therein.</description>

      <title>Skew Generalized Power Series Rings With the McCoy Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring, $(S,\preceq)$ a strictly totally ordered monoid and suppose also $\omega:S\rightarrow \text{End}(R)$ is a monoid homomorphism. A skew generalized power series ring $R[[S,\omega,\preceq]]$ consists of all functions from a monoid $S$ to a coefficient ring $R$ whose support contains neither infinite descending chains nor infinite anti-chains, equipped with point-wise addition and with multiplication given by convolution twisted by an action $\omega$ of the monoid $S$ on the ring $R$.
  Special cases of the skew generalized power series ring construction are the skew polynomial rings, skew Laurent polynomial rings, skew power series rings, skew Laurent series rings, skew monoid rings, skew group rings, skew Malcev-Neumann series rings and generalized power series rings as well as the untwisted versions of all of these objects.
  In the present article, we study the so-termed $(S,\omega)$-McCoy condition on $R$, that is a generalization of the standard McCoy condition from polynomials to skew generalized power series, thus generalizing some of the existing results in the literature relevant to the subject.</description>

      <title>On dominant $\ell$--weights and maps between Weyl modules for quantum affine $A_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the set of dominant $\ell$--weights in the Weyl (or standard) modules for quantum affine $A_n$. We then prove that the space of homomorphisms between standard modules is at most one-dimensional and give a necessary and sufficient condition for equality to hold. We also describe the socle of the standard module and prove that the socle is simple for large $n$. Finally, we give applications of our results to mixed Weyl modules, calculating extensions in the category and identify new families of tensor subcategories of finite dimensional representations.</description>

      <title>On Lagrangianity of $p$-supports of holonomic D-modules and $q$-D-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M. Kontsevich conjectured and T. Bitoun proved that if M is a nonzero holonomic D-module then the p-support of a generic reduction of M to characteristic p&gt;0 is Lagrangian. We provide a new elementary proof of this theorem and also generalize it to q-D-modules. The proofs are based on Bernstein's theorem that any holonomic D-module can be transformed by an element of the symplectic group into a vector bundle with a flat connection, and a q-analog of this theorem.</description>

      <title>Filtrations of $\mathscr{D}$-modules along semi-invariant functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a smooth algebraic variety X with an action of a connected reductive linear algebraic group G, and an equivariant D-module M, we study the G-decompositions of the associated V-, Hodge, and weight filtrations.
  If M is the localization of a D-module S underlying a mixed twistor D-module (e.g. when S is simple) along a semi-invariant function, we determine the weight level of any element in an irreducible isotypic component of M in terms of multiplicities of roots of b-functions. In the case where S=O_X, we show that the Hodge level is governed by the degrees of another class of polynomials, also expressible in terms of b-functions.
  As an application, if X is an affine spherical variety, we describe these filtrations representation-theoretically in terms of roots of b-functions, and compute all higher multiplier and Hodge ideals associated with semi-invariant functions. Examples include the spaces of general, skew-symmetric, and symmetric matrices, as well as the Freudenthal cubic on the fundamental representation of E_6.</description>

      <title>Flat degenerations of flag supermanifolds for basic Lie superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by bases of representations compatible with the PBW filtration for basic Lie superalgebras by Kus and Fourier, we generalise the construction of degenerations of flag varieties via favourable modules to the super setup. In the classical setup, this method of degenerating flag varieties by Feigin, Fourier and, Littelmann relies on constructing bases of representations of Lie algebras such that in the coordinate ring of an embedded flag varietiy their multiplication can be identified with an affine semigroup modulo terms of higher degree. By killing off said terms of higher degree via a filtration construction, one gets a toric variety the embedded flag variety degenerates into. By adapting these techniques we provide a similar construction and discuss when one can get a degeneration into a toric supervariety, as defined by Jankowski</description>

      <title>Twisted super Yangians of type AIII and their representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the super analogue of the Molev-Ragoucy reflection algebras, which we call twisted super Yangians of type AIII, and classify their finite-dimensional irreducible representations under certain conditions. These superalgebras are coideal subalgebras of the super Yangian $\mathscr{Y}(\mathfrak{gl}_{m|n})$ and are associated with symmetric pairs of type AIII in Cartan's classification. We establish the Schur-Weyl type duality between degenerate affine Hecke algebras of type BC and twisted super Yangians.</description>

      <title>A reformulation of the conjecture of Prasad and Takloo-Bighash</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16393v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prasad and Takloo-Bighash proposed a conjecture which predicts a necessary condition in terms of epsilon factors for representations of $\mathrm{GL}_n(F)$ and its inner forms to have linear periods. In this rather expository article, we reformulate their conjecture in the following form: The distinguished members in each generic $L$-packet $\Pi_\phi$ are determined by the characters of the component group $S_\phi$ and local epsilon factors. We follow Aubert et al.\,for the definitions of the $L$-packets and the component groups.
  We observe that under some hypotheses, the reformulated conjecture follows from the conjectural multiplicity formula recently proposed by Chen Wan for general spherical varieties and the conjectural integral formula for epsilon factors which we propose in this article.</description>

      <title>Cluster structures on spinor helicity and momentum twistor varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14956v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the homogeneous coordinate rings of partial flag varieties and Grassmannians in their Pl\"ucker embeddings and exhibit an embedding of the former into the latter. Both rings are cluster algebras and the embedding respects the cluster algebra structures in the sense that there exists a seed for the Grassmannian that restricts to a seed for the partial flag variety (\textit{i.e.} it is obtained by freezing and deleting some cluster variables).
  The motivation for this project stems from the application of cluster algebras in scattering amplitudes: spinor helicity and momentum twistor varieties describe massless scattering without assuming dual conformal symmetry. Both may be obtained from Grassmanninas which model the dual conformal case. They are instances of partial flag varieties and their cluster structures reveal information for the scattering amplitudes. As an application of our main result we exhibit the relation between these cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>Koszul duality and Calabi-Yau structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Koszul duality between differential graded categories and pointed curved coalgebras interchanges smooth and proper Calabi-Yau structures. This result is a generalization and conceptual explanation of the following two applications. For a finite-dimensional Lie algebra a smooth Calabi-Yau structure on the universal enveloping algebra is equivalent to a proper Calabi-Yau structure on the Chevalley-Eilenberg chain coalgebra, which exists if and only if Poincare duality is satisfied. For a topological space X having the homotopy type of a finite complex we show an oriented Poincare duality structure (with local coefficients) on X is equivalent to a proper Calabi-Yau structure on the dg coalgebra of chains on X and to a smooth Calabi-Yau structure on the dg algebra of chains on the based loop space of X.</description>
