      <title>Measurement-Induced Phase Transition in a Disordered XX Spin Chain: A Real-Space Renormalization Group Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin chains with quenched disorder exhibit rich critical behavior, often captured by real-space renormalization group (RSRG) techniques. However, the physics of such systems in the presence of random measurements (i.e., non-Hermitian dephasing) remains largely unexplored. The interplay between measurements and unitary dynamics gives rise to novel phases and phase transitions in monitored quantum systems. In this work, we investigate the disordered XX spin chain subject to stochastic local measurements in the $X$ and $Y$ bases. By mapping the monitored chain to a non-Hermitian spin ladder with complex couplings, we propose an RSRG-for-excited-states (RSRG-X) approach for this open-system setting. Our analysis reveals a new class of strongly disordered fixed points that emerge due to non-unitarity, broadening the landscape of critical phenomena accessible via RSRG.</description>

      <title>Mobility rings in a non-Hermitian non-Abelian quasiperiodic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study localization and topological properties in spin-1/2 non-reciprocal Aubry-Andr\'{e} chain with SU(2) non-Abelian artificial gauge fields. The results reveal that, different from the Abelian case, mobility rings, will emerge in the non-Abelian case accompanied by the non-Hermitian topological phase transition. As the non-Hermitian extension of mobility edges, such mobility rings separate Anderson localized eigenstates from extended eigenstates in the complex energy plane under the periodic boundary condition. Based on the topological properties, we obtain the exact expression of the mobility rings. Furthermore, the corresponding indicators such as inverse participation rate, normalized participation ratio, winding number, non-Hermitian spectral structures and wave functions are numerically studied. The numerical results are in good agreement with the analytical expression, which confirms the emergence of mobility rings.</description>

      <title>Beyond-mean-field fluctuations for the solution of constraint satisfaction problems</title>

Abstract: Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs) lie at the heart of complexity theory and find application in a plethora of prominent tasks ranging from cryptography to genetics. Classical approaches use Hopfield networks to find approximate solutions while recently, modern machine-learning techniques like graph neural networks have become popular for this task. In this study, we employ the known mapping of MAX-2-SAT, a class of CSPs, to a spin-glass system from statistical physics, and use Glauber dynamics to approximately find its ground state, which corresponds to the optimal solution of the underlying problem. We show that Glauber dynamics outperforms the traditional Hopfield-network approach and can compete with state-of-the-art solvers. A systematic theoretical analysis uncovers the role of stochastic fluctuations in finding CSP solutions: even in the absense of thermal fluctuations at $T=0$ a significant portion of spins, which correspond to the CSP variables, attains an effective spin-dependent non-zero temperature. These spins form a subspace in which the stochastic Glauber dynamics continuously performs flips to eventually find better solutions. This is possible since the energy is degenerate, such that spin flips in this free-spin space do not require energy. Our theoretical analysis leads to new deterministic solvers that effectively account for such fluctuations, thereby reaching state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Critical spin models from holographic disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete models of holographic dualities, typically modeled by tensor networks on hyperbolic tilings, produce quantum states with a characteristic quasiperiodic disorder not present in continuum holography. In this work, we study the behavior of XXZ spin chains with such symmetries, showing that lessons learned from previous non-interacting (matchgate) tensor networks generalize to more generic Hamiltonians under holographic disorder: While the disorder breaks translation invariance, site-averaged correlations and entanglement of the disorder-free critical phase are preserved at a plateau of nonzero disorder even at large system sizes. In particular, we show numerically that the entanglement entropy curves in this disordered phase follow the expected scaling of a conformal field theory (CFT) in the continuum limit. This property is shown to be non-generic for other types of quasiperiodic disorder, only appearing when our boundary disorder ansatz is described by a "dual" bulk hyperbolic tiling. Our results therefore suggest the existence of a whole class of critical phases whose symmetries are derived from models of discrete holography.</description>
