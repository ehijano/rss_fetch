      <title>The roles of elasticity and dimension in liquid-gel phase separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare six elastic models for polymer networks in the context of phase separation within a gel, including a new model that combines the finite extensible Arruda-Boyce model and the slip tube model for entangled chains. We study incompressible uniaxial stretch and compression, and three volume-changing constrained-dimension deformations, in which the material can only deform in the designated dimensions(s) while the constrained direction(s) remain(s) the same. Each model responds differently to large deformations, and our proposed model successfully describes both strain softening and strain hardening, which are both present in well-entangled elastomers. When considering phase separation, we show that the commonly-used neo-Hookean model fails to admit a common tangent construction for phase coexistence for 3D deformations. This can be resolved by using a model with finite extension, such as the Arruda-Boyce model. In constrained-dimension deformations, where the gel's volume is allowed to change, for elastic models in which phase coexistence is possible, the critical temperatures increases and the critical concentration decreases with increasing deformation dimensions. This strong dependence of the phase diagram on spatial dimension and geometry distinguishes phase separation elastic media from conventional phase separation.</description>

      <title>Surface Excess Energy Governs the Non-Monotonic Behavior of Active Diffusivity with Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-propulsion of particles is typically explained by phoretic mechanisms driven by externally imposed chemical, electric, or thermal gradients. In contrast, chemical reactions can enhance particle diffusion even in the absence of such external gradients. We refer to this increase as active diffusivity, often attributed to self-diffusiophoresis or self-electrophoresis, although these mechanisms alone do not fully account for experimental observations. Here, we investigate active diffusivity in catalytic Janus particles immersed in reactive media without imposed gradients. We show that interfacial reactions generate excess surface energy and sustained interfacial stresses that supplement thermal energy, enabling diffusion beyond the classical thermal limit. We consistently quantify this contribution using both dissipative and non-dissipative approaches, assuming that the aqueous bath remains near equilibrium. Our framework reproduces experimentally observed trends in diffusivity versus activity, including the non-monotonic behaviors reported in some systems, and agrees with data for nanometric Janus particles catalyzing charged substrates as well as vesicles with membrane-embedded enzymes driven by ATP hydrolysis. These results demonstrate that chemical reactions can induce and sustain surface-tension gradients and surface excess energy, providing design principles for tuning mobility in synthetic active matter.</description>

      <title>Memory behavior of a randomly driven model glass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate by atomistic simulations the memory behavior a model glass subjected to random driving protocols. The training consists of a random walk of forward and/or backward shearing sequences bounded by a maximal shear strain of absolute value {\gamma}T . We show that such a stochastic training protocol is able to record the training amplitude. Different read-out protocols are also tested and are shown to be able to retrieve the training amplitude. We then emphasize the ten- sorial character of the memory encoded in the glass sample and then characterize the anisotropic mechanical behavior of the trained samples.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Choline Chloride based Deep Eutectic Solvents: Neutron Scattering Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the microscopic diffusion dynamics of choline chloride (ChCl) based deep eutectic solvents (DESs) to elucidate the influence of hydrogen bond donor (HBD) identity on the mobility of cholinium ions. The DES systems examined include ethaline, glyceline, and reline, comprising ChCl mixed with ethylene glycol, glycerol, and urea, respectively, in a 1:2 molar ratio. Quasielastic neutron scattering experiments was used to probe the self-diffusion of cholinium ions at molecular length and time scales. The dynamics were modelled as a combination of jump diffusion of the molecular center of mass and localized translation within transient hydrogen-bond cages. Among the three systems, ethaline consistently exhibited the highest cholinium self-diffusion coefficients across all investigated temperatures, attributed to shorter residence times and more frequent molecular jumps. In contrast, reline displayed longer residence times with significantly larger jump length, leading to a temperature-dependent dynamical crossover: While reline and glyceline exhibited comparable diffusivities at low temperatures, reline surpassed glyceline above 330 K. These findings highlight the crucial role of HBD identity in modulating microscopic diffusion and provide valuable molecular-level insights for the rational design of DESs for targeted applications.</description>

      <title>Phase Behavior of Thermo-Responsive Nanoplatelets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoplatelets open up a wide range of possibilities for building materials with novel properties linked to their shape anisotropy. A challenge consists of controlling dynamically the order of positioning and orientation in three dimensions by assembly to exploit the collective properties at the macroscale. While most studies to date have focused on hard platelets that cannot be stimulated by an external trigger, in the present work we tackle the case of core/shell platelets, composed of a mineral core (laponite) coated with a soft polymeric shell (PEO100-PPO65-PEO100 copolymer) whose swelling can be triggered by temperature variation. We identified unambiguously the signature associated with the different phases obtained as a function temperature and concentration by combining local (X-ray scattering, electron microscopy) and global (rheology, optical birefringence) methods of analysis. In this way, we obtained two main results. The first shows that the deposition of a soft layer onto laponite surface enables a phase transition from isotropic liquid towards liquid suspensions of random stacks which is not observed for bare laponite suspensions in the studied weight concentration range (\Phi &lt; 14 wt.). The second result shows that an increase of nanoplatelet effective volume fraction triggered by temperature (swelling of the polymer shell) induces a phase transition from liquid suspensions of random stacks towards birefringent gels of nematic stacks. Both results agree with numerically predicted phase sequences expected by variation in particle density under similar charge screening conditions, taking into account the contribution of the copolymer layer to the particle volume fraction. We believe that these results pave the way for the control of nanoplatelet self-assembly by external action.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic Mechanism of Colloidal Propulsion through Momentum Exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Propulsion of colloidal particles due to momentum transfer from localized surface reactions is investigated by solving the exact unsteady Stokes equation. We model the effect of surface reactions as either a {\it force dipole} acting on the fluid or a {\it pair force} acting on both the colloid and the fluid. Our analysis reveals that after a single reaction event the colloid's velocity initially decays as $\sim t^{-1/2}$, followed by a long-time tail decay $\sim t^{-5/2}$. This behavior is distinct from the $\sim t^{-3/2}$ decay seen for simple impulsively forced particles, a result of the force-free nature of the reaction mechanism. The velocity and transient dynamics are strongly controlled by the distance of the reaction from the colloid surface. For a colloid subject to periodic reactions, the theory predicts a steady-state velocity that is comparable to experimental results and previous simulations, suggesting that direct momentum transfer is a relevant mechanism for self-propulsion in systems like Janus particles. Finally, our study shows that fluid compressibility is not required for momentum transfer to produce colloidal propulsion.</description>

      <title>Actuation of Cell Sheets in 3D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The alignment of fibers and cells in living tissues affect their mechanical properties and functionality. In this context, one can draw an analogy between tissues and nematic liquid crystal elastomers. We explore this analogy by growing fibroblasts on 2D-patterned substrates and observing the contraction of cell sheets upon detachment from the substrates. When fibroblast sheets detach, they undergo an anisotropic contraction, with maximum contraction along the nematic director, like nematic elastomers do during phase transition. We quantify this anisotropy using substrates patterned with stripes to induce alignment, finding that cell sheets resemble nematic elastomers with negative Poisson ratio. Then, we apply design principles used for programming curvature in nematic elastomers to actuate 3D structures in the detached fibroblast layers, demonstrating an application of these principles and we support the results with simulations. This proof of concept shows the ability to control the 3D shape through 2D patterning in cell layers, leading to promising avenues to program tissues.</description>

      <title>3D pattern formation of a protein-membrane suspension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many essential cellular processes, including cell division and the establishment of cell polarity during embryogenesis, are regulated by pattern-forming proteins. These proteins often need to bind to a substrate, such as the cell membrane, onto which they interact and form two-dimensional (2D) patterns. It is unclear how the membrane's continuity and dimensionality impact pattern formation. Here, we address this gap using the MinDE system, a prototypical example of pattern-forming membrane proteins. We show that when the lipid substrate is fragmented into submicrometer-sized diffusive liposomes, ATP-driven protein-protein interactions generate three-dimensional (3D) spatially extended patterns, despite the complete loss of membrane continuity. Remarkably, these 3D patterns emerge at scales four orders of magnitude larger than the individual liposomes. By systematically varying protein concentration, liposome size, and density, we observed and characterized a variety of 3D dynamical patterns not seen on continuous 2D membranes, including traveling waves, dynamical spirals, and a coexistence phase. Simulations and linear stability analysis of a coarse-grained model revealed that the physical properties of the dispersed membrane effectively rescale both the protein-membrane binding rates and diffusion, two key parameters governing pattern formation and wavelength selection. These findings highlight the robustness of Min's pattern-forming ability, suggesting that protein-membrane suspensions could serve as an adaptable template for studying out-of-equilibrium self-organization in 3D, beyond in vivo contexts.</description>

      <title>Competition between shape anisotropy and deformation in the ordering and close packing properties of quasi-one-dimensional hard superellipse fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the orientational ordering and close-packing behavior of a quasi-one-dimensional (q1D) system
  of hard superellipses, where the centers of the particles are confined to a line, but they can rotate freely within a
  two-dimensional plane. The particle shape is tuned between an ellipse and a rectangle by varying the deformation
  parameter (n). The elongation of the particle is changed using the aspect ratio (k). The pressure ratio between
  freely rotating and parallel hard superellipses, which displays a single peak, serves as an effective marker for
  the continuous structural change from quasi-isotropic to nematic ordering. Our findings reveal a competition
  between the parameters k and n, with k promoting nematic alignment and n favoring tetratic ordering. Notably,
  in the close-packing regime, the packing properties become independent of k, as the relevant exponents depend
  solely on n. Furthermore, certain combinations of these exponents exhibit universality, remaining invariant with
  respect to particle shape</description>

      <title>Emergent interactions lead to collective frustration in robotic matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current artificial intelligence systems show near-human-level capabilities when deployed in isolation. Systems of a few collaborating intelligent agents are being engineered to perform tasks collectively. This raises the question of whether robotic matter, where many learning and intelligent agents interact, shows emergence of collective behaviour. And if so, which kind of phenomena would such systems exhibit? Here, we study a paradigmatic model for robotic matter: a stochastic many-particle system in which each particle is endowed with a deep neural network that predicts its transitions based on the particles' environments. For a one-dimensional model, we show that robotic matter exhibits complex emergent phenomena, including transitions between long-lived learning regimes, the emergence of particle species, and frustration. We also find a density-dependent phase transition with signatures of criticality. Using active matter theory, we show that this phase transition is a consequence of self-organisation mediated by emergent inter-particle interactions. Our simple model captures key features of more complex forms of robotic systems.</description>

      <title>ChromRec: Self-Assembly of Nucleosomes Driven by Directional Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding chromatin dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales requires models that reconcile biological specificity with physics-based interactions and computational tractability. We present a modular, recognition-enabled ultra-coarse-grained (UCG) framework that captures both histone-DNA and histone-histone interactions using site-specific, off-center "recognition" potentials. These recognition sites, combined with generic attractive and repulsive terms, encode directional and stoichiometrically faithful assembly rules. Benchmark simulations demonstrate that this scheme robustly drives the self-assembly of geometrically correct histone octamers and enables stable nucleosome formation. The model also supports tunable resolution, allowing simplification of intra-octamer, nucleosomal, or fiber-level structures depending on the biological question to be addressed. This flexibility is especially useful for exploring chromatin reorganization driven by epigenetic regulation. While developed with chromatin in mind, our framework generalizes to other multivalent assemblies governed by molecular recognition.</description>
