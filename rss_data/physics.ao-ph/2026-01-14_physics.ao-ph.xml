      <title>Modeling Cosmogenic 10Be During the Heliosphere's Encounter with an Interstellar Cold Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geologic records of cosmogenic 10Be are sensitive to changes in the radiation environment with time. Recent works suggest there are periods when the Sun encountered massive cold clouds which compressed the heliosphere to within Earth's orbit. This would expose Earth to increased galactic cosmic rays and MeV-energy particles of heliospheric origin. We model 10Be production in Earth's atmosphere during possible cold cloud encounters, and estimate their detectability in marine records of variable temporal resolution. We find that an AU-scale cold cloud encounter can be detected using ocean sediment measurements of 10Be if Earth spends time inside the compressed heliosphere. For typical relative speeds between the Sun and local interstellar clouds, this translates to a crossing time of ~100 years. A cloud must have an extension on the scale of parsecs to tens-of-parsecs (crossing time 0.1-1 Myr) to be detectable through 10Be measurements in iron-manganese crusts.</description>

      <title>Collapse of statistical equilibrium in large-scale hydroelastic turbulent waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: At scales larger than the forcing scale, some out-of-equilibrium turbulent systems (such as hydrodynamic turbulence, wave turbulence, and nonlinear optics) exhibit a state of statistical equilibrium where energy is equipartitioned among large-scale modes, in line with the Rayleigh-Jeans spectrum. Key open questions now pertain to either the emergence, decay, collapse, or other nonstationary evolutions from this state. Here, we experimentally investigate the free decay of large-scale hydroelastic turbulent waves, initially in a regime of statistical equilibrium. Using space- and time-resolved measurements, we show that the total energy of these large-scale tensional waves decays as a power law in time. We derive an energy decay law from the theoretical initial equilibrium spectrum and the linear viscous damping, as no net energy flux is carried. Our prediction then shows a good agreement with experimental data over nearly two decades in time, for various initial effective temperatures of the statistical equilibrium state. We further identify the dissipation mechanism and confirm it experimentally. Our approach could be applied to other decaying turbulence systems, with the large scales initially in statistical equilibrium.</description>

      <title>An AI-driven framework for the prediction of personalised health response to air pollution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Air pollution is a growing global health threat, exacerbated by climate change and linked to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. While personal sensing devices enable real-time physiological monitoring, their integration with environmental data for individualised health prediction remains underdeveloped. Here, we present a modular, cloud-based framework that predicts personalised physiological responses to pollution by combining wearable-derived data with real-time environmental exposures. At its core is an Adversarial Autoencoder (AAE), initially trained on high-resolution pollution-health data from the INHALE study and fine-tuned using smartwatch data via transfer learning to capture individual-specific patterns. Consistent with changes in pollution levels commonly observed in the real-world, simulated pollution spikes (+100%) revealed modest but measurable increases in vital signs (e.g., +2.5% heart rate, +3.5% breathing rate). To assess clinical relevance, we analysed U-BIOPRED data and found that individuals with such subclinical vital sign elevations had higher asthma burden scores or elevated Fractional Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO), supporting the physiological validity of these AI-predicted responses. This integrative approach demonstrates the feasibility of anticipatory, personalised health modelling in response to environmental challenges, offering a scalable and secure infrastructure for AI-driven environmental health monitoring.</description>

      <title>Global 3D Reconstruction of Clouds &amp; Tropical Cyclones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate forecasting of tropical cyclones (TCs) remains challenging due to limited satellite observations probing TC structure and difficulties in resolving cloud properties involved in TC intensification. Recent research has demonstrated the capabilities of machine learning methods for 3D cloud reconstruction from satellite observations. However, existing approaches have been restricted to regions where TCs are uncommon, and are poorly validated for intense storms. We introduce a new framework, based on a pre-training--fine-tuning pipeline, that learns from multiple satellites with global coverage to translate 2D satellite imagery into 3D cloud maps of relevant cloud properties. We apply our model to a custom-built TC dataset to evaluate performance in the most challenging and relevant conditions. We show that we can - for the first time - create global instantaneous 3D cloud maps and accurately reconstruct the 3D structure of intense storms. Our model not only extends available satellite observations but also provides estimates when observations are missing entirely. This is crucial for advancing our understanding of TC intensification and improving forecasts.</description>
