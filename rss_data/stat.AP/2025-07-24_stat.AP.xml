      <title>Analysing Models for Volatility Clustering with Subordinated Processes: VGSA and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores a comprehensive class of time-changed stochastic processes constructed by subordinating Brownian motion with Levy processes, where the subordination is further governed by stochastic arrival mechanisms such as the Cox Ingersoll Ross (CIR) and Chan Karolyi Longstaff Sanders (CKLS) processes. These models extend classical jump frameworks like the Variance Gamma (VG) and CGMY processes, allowing for more flexible modeling of market features such as jump clustering, heavy tails, and volatility persistence. We first revisit the theory of Levy subordinators and establish strong consistency results for the VG process under Gamma subordination. Building on this, we prove asymptotic normality for both the VG and VGSA (VG with stochastic arrival) processes when the arrival process follows CIR or CKLS dynamics. The analysis is then extended to the more general CGMY process under stochastic arrival, for which we derive analogous consistency and limit theorems under positivity and regularity conditions on the arrival process. A simulation study accompanies the theoretical work, confirming our results through Monte Carlo experiments, with visualizations and normality testing (via Shapiro-Wilk statistics) that show approximate Gaussian behavior even for processes driven by heavy-tailed jumps. This work provides a rigorous and unified probabilistic framework for analyzing subordinated models with stochastic time changes, with applications to financial modeling and inference under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Local graph estimation: Interpretable network discovery for complex data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large, complex datasets often include a small set of variables of primary interest, such as clinical outcomes or known biomarkers, whose relation to the broader system is the main focus of analysis. In these situations, exhaustively estimating the entire network may obscure insights into the scientific question at hand. To address this common scenario, we introduce local graph estimation, a statistical framework that focuses on inferring substructures around target variables rather than recovering the full network of inter-variable relationships. We show that traditional graph estimation methods often fail to recover local structure, and present pathwise feature selection (PFS) as an alternative approach. PFS estimates local subgraphs by iteratively applying feature selection and propagating uncertainty along network paths. We prove that PFS provides path discovery with finite-sample false discovery control and yields highly interpretable results, even in settings with mixed variable types and nonlinear dependencies. Applied to two cancer studies -- one analyzing county-level cancer incidence and mortality across the U.S., and another integrating gene, microRNA, protein, and clinical data from The Cancer Genome Atlas -- PFS uncovers biologically plausible networks that reveal both known and novel associations.</description>

      <title>Testing Against Tree Ordered Alternatives in One-way ANOVA</title>

Abstract: The likelihood ratio test against a tree ordered alternative in one-way heteroscedastic ANOVA is considered for the first time. Bootstrap is used to implement this and two multiple comparisons based tests and shown to have very good size and power performance.
  In this paper, the problem of testing the homogeneity of mean effects against the tree ordered alternative is considered in the heteroscedastic one-way ANOVA model. The likelihood ratio test and two multiple comparison-based tests - named Max-D and Min-D are proposed and implemented using the parametric bootstrap method. An extensive simulation study shows that these tests effectively control type-I error rates for various choices of sample sizes and error variances. Further, the likelihood ratio and Max-D tests achieve very good powers in all cases. The test Min-D is seen to perform better than the other two for some specific configurations of parameters. The robustness of these tests is investigated by implementing some non-normal distributions, viz., skew-normal, Laplace, exponential, mixture-normal, and t distributions. `R' packages are developed and shared on "Github" for the ease of users. The proposed tests are illustrated on a dataset of patients undergoing psychological treatments.</description>

      <title>Environmental Effects on Galaxy Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxies evolve within a web-like cosmic structure, and their properties are strongly shaped by their surrounding environments. We apply a nonparametric Bayesian two-sample test based on P\'olya tree priors to galaxy data from SDSS DR7 and DESI DR1 BGS to quantify the differences between galaxies in dense and sparse cosmic environments. Compared to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and parametric Bayesian test, our approach does not require strong assumptions about the underlying distributional form and provides a more sensitive and robust comparison of galaxy evolution across different environments. In particular, galaxies in VoidFinder voids tend to be fainter, less massive, and more star-forming compared to wall galaxies, while such contrasts are diminished under the V^2 REVOLVER pruning. These findings underscore the importance of both the statistical framework and the void classification algorithm in interpreting environmental effects on galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Interconnections between Corruption and Economic Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08132v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the dynamic relationship between corruption and economic growth through an approach based on a system of stochastic equations. In the context of globalization and economic interdependencies, corruption not only affects investment and distorts markets, but it can also, under certain conditions, temporarily boost economic activity. Using data from the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the Corruption Perception Index (CPI), we implement a time-series-based model to capture the interactions between these two variables. Through a coupled vector autoregressive equations system, our model identifies patterns of interdependence between economic fluctuations and perceptions of corruption at a global level. Employing graph theory and Granger causality, we build a network of interconnections that illustrates how corruption dynamics in one country can influence economic growth and corruption perception in others. The results provide a robust tool for analyzing international political-economic relationships and can serve as a basis for designing policies that promote transparency and sustainable development.</description>

      <title>Small area estimation of growing stock timber volume, basal area, mean stem diameter, and stem density for mountain forests in Austria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regression models were evaluated to estimate stand-level growing stock volume (GSV), quadratic mean diameter (QMD), basal area (BA), and stem density (N) in the Brixen im Thale forest district of Austria. Field measurements for GSV, QMD, and BA were collected on 146 inventory plots using a handheld mobile personal laser scanning system. Predictor variables were derived from airborne laser scanning (ALS)-derived normalized digital surface and terrain models. The objective was to generate stand-level estimates and associated uncertainty for GSV, QMD, BA, and N across 824 stands. A unit-level small area estimation framework was used to generate stand-level posterior predictive distributions by aggregating predictions from finer spatial scales. Both univariate and multivariate models, with and without spatially varying intercepts, were considered. Predictive performance was assessed via spatially blocked cross-validation, focusing on bias, accuracy, and precision. Despite exploratory analysis suggesting advantages of complex multivariate spatial models, simpler univariate spatial -- and in some cases, non-spatial -- models exhibited comparable predictive performance.</description>

      <title>Rank-adaptive covariance testing with applications to genomics and neuroimaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10284v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In biomedical studies, testing for differences in covariance offers scientific insights beyond mean differences, especially when differences are driven by complex joint behavior between features. However, when differences in joint behavior are weakly dispersed across many dimensions and arise from differences in low-rank structures within the data, as is often the case in genomics and neuroimaging, existing two-sample covariance testing methods may suffer from power loss. The Ky-Fan(k) norm, defined by the sum of the top Ky-Fan(k) singular values, is a simple and intuitive matrix norm able to capture signals caused by differences in low-rank structures between matrices, but its statistical properties in hypothesis testing have not been studied well. In this paper, we investigate the behavior of the Ky-Fan(k) norm in two-sample covariance testing. Ultimately, we propose a novel methodology, Rank-Adaptive Covariance Testing (RACT), which is able to leverage differences in low-rank structures found in the covariance matrices of two groups in order to maximize power. RACT uses permutation for statistical inference, ensuring an exact Type I error control. We validate RACT in simulation studies and evaluate its performance when testing for differences in gene expression networks between two types of lung cancer, as well as testing for covariance heterogeneity in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data taken on two different scanner types.</description>
