      <title>Spacetime Wavelet Method for Linear Boundary-Value Problems in Sylvester Matrix Equation Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-order spacetime numerical method for discretizing and solving linear initial-boundary value problems using wavelet-based techniques with user-prescribed error estimates. The spacetime wavelet discretization yields a system of algebraic equations resulting in a Sylvester matrix equation. We solve this system with a Global Generalized Minimal Residual (GMRES) method in conjunction with a wavelet-based recursive algorithm to improve convergence. We perform rigorous verification studies using linear partial differential equations (PDEs) with both convective and diffusive terms. The results of these simulations show the high-order convergence rates for the solution and derivative approximations predicted by wavelet theory. We demonstrate the utility of solving the Sylvester equation through comparisons to the commonly-used Kronecker product formulation. We show that our recursive wavelet-based algorithm that generates initial guesses for the iterative Global GMRES method improves the performance of the solver.</description>

      <title>Fast and Accurate SVD-Type Updating in Streaming Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a datastream, the change over a short interval is often of low rank. For high throughput information arranged in matrix format, recomputing an optimal SVD approximation after each step is typically prohibitive. Instead, incremental and truncated updating strategies are used, which may not scale for large truncation ranks. Therefore, we propose a set of efficient new algorithms that update a bidiagonal factorization, and which are similarly accurate as the SVD methods. In particular, we develop a compact Householder-type algorithm that decouples a sparse part from a low-rank update and has about half the memory requirements of standard bidiagonalization methods. A second algorithm based on Givens rotations has only about 10 flops per rotation and scales quadratically with the problem size, compared to a typical cubic scaling. The algorithm is therefore effective for processing high-throughput updates, as we demonstrate in tracking large subspaces of recommendation systems and networks, and when compared to well known software such as LAPACK or the incremental SVD.</description>

      <title>Generalized Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization for generalized saddle point systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the iterative solution of generalized saddle point systems. When the right bottom block is zero, Arioli [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 34 (2013), pp. 571--592] proposed a CRAIG algorithm based on generalized Golub-Kahan Bidiagonalization (GKB) for the augmented systems with the leading block being symmetric and positive definite (SPD), and then Dumitrasc et al. [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 46 (2025), pp. 370--392] extended the GKB for the case where the symmetry condition of the leading block no longer holds and then proposed nonsymmetric version of the CRAIG (nsCRAIG) algorithm. The CRAIG and nsCRAIG algorithms are theoretically equivalent to the Schur complement reduction (SCR) methods where the Conjugate Gradient (CG) method and the Full Orthogonalization Method (FOM) are applied to the associated Schur-complement equation, respectively. We extend the GKB and its nonsymmetric counterpart used separately in CRAIG and nsCRAIG algorithms for the case where the right bottom block of saddle point system is nonzero. On this basis, we propose CRAIG and nsCRAIG algorithms for the solution of the generalized saddle point problems with the leading block being SPD and nonsymmetric positive definite (NSPD), respectively. They are also theoretically equivalent to the SCR methods with inner CG and FOM iterations for the associated Schur-complement equation, respectively. Moreover, we give algorithm steps of the two new solvers and propose appropriate stopping criteria based on an estimate of the energy norm for the error and the residual norm. Numerical comparison with MINRES or GMRES highlights the advantages of our proposed strategies regarding its high computational efficiency and/or low memory requirements and the associated implications.</description>

      <title>Complex Scaling for the Junction of Semi-infinite Gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present and analyze an integral equation method for the scattering of a non-periodic source from a geometry consisting of two semi-infinite, periodic structures glued together in two dimensions. The two structures may involve a periodic wall, several layers of transmission surfaces with a shared period, or periodic sets of obstacles. This integral equation is posed on the infinite interface between the two periodic structures using kernels built out of the Green's function for each structure. To combat the slow decay of the Green's function, we also show that our integral equation can be analytically continued into the complex plane, where it can be truncated with exponential accuracy. A careful analysis of the domain Green's functions far from the periodic structure is then used to prove that the analytically continued equation is Fredholm index zero. Finally, we show that the solution we generate satisfies a radiation condition and demonstrate an efficient and high order solver for this problem.</description>

      <title>Convergence for adaptive resampling of random Fourier features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The machine learning random Fourier feature method for data in high dimension is computationally and theoretically attractive since the optimization is based on a convex standard least squares problem and independent sampling of Fourier frequencies. The challenge is to sample the Fourier frequencies well. This work proves convergence of a data adaptive method based on resampling the frequencies asymptotically optimally, as the number of nodes and amount of data tend to infinity. Numerical results based on resampling and adaptive random walk steps together with approximations of the least squares problem by conjugate gradient iterations confirm the analysis for regression and classification problems.</description>

      <title>Efficient QR-based Column Subset Selection through Randomized Sparse Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03198v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an efficient algorithm for column subset selection that combines the column-pivoted QR factorization with sparse subspace embeddings. The proposed method, SE-QRSC, is particularly effective for wide matrices with significantly more columns than rows. Starting from a matrix $A$, the algorithm selects $k$ columns from the sketched matrix $B = A \Omega^T$, where $\Omega$ is a sparse subspace embedding of $\mathrm{range}(A^T)$. The sparsity structure of $\Omega$ is then exploited to map the selected pivots back to the corresponding columns of $A$, which are then used to produce the final subset of selected columns. We prove that this procedure yields a factorization with strong rank-revealing properties, thus revealing the spectrum of $A$. The resulting bounds exhibit a reduced dependence on the number of columns of $A$ compared to those obtained from the strong rank-revealing QR factorization of $A$. Moreover, when the leverage scores are known, such as for orthogonal matrices, or can be efficiently approximated, the bounds become entirely independent of the column dimension. For general matrices, the algorithm can be extended by first applying an additional subspace embedding of $range(A)$.</description>

      <title>A New Approach to Direct Discretization of Wave Kinetic Equations with Application to a Nonlinear Schrodinger System in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave Kinetic Equations (WKEs) are often used to describe the evolution of ensemble averaged wave amplitudes for nonlinear wave systems. In the present manuscript we describe a new approach to direct numerical simulation of solutions to WKEs. This new method relies on a piecewise polynomial approximation of the resonant manifold, followed by numerical quadrature of the collision integral. The approach is general in nature, and is discussed in detail here for a particular nonlinear Schrodinger model in 2 spatial dimensions. Detailed convergence studies demonstrate 2nd-order accuracy for model collision integrals, and self-convergence studies for the WKE show near 2nd-order rates. Furthermore, comparison of the WKE approximation to ensemble averages of the NLS illustrate the efficacy of the method and the validity of the WKE, for both isotropic and an-isotropic solutions.</description>

      <title>Linear Relaxation Schemes with Asymptotically Compatible Energy Law for Time-Fractional Phase-Field Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a variable time-step linear relaxation scheme for time-fractional phase-field equations with a free energy density in general polynomial form. The $L1^{+}$-CN formula is used to discretize the fractional derivative, and an auxiliary variable is introduced to approximate the nonlinear term by directly solving algebraic equations rather than differential-algebraic equations as in the invariant energy quadratization (IEQ) and the scalar auxiliary variable (SAV) approaches. The developed semi-discrete scheme is second-order accurate in time, and the inconsistency between the auxiliary and the original variables does not deteriorate over time. Furthermore, we take the time-fractional volume-conserved Allen-Cahn equation, the time-fractional Cahn-Hilliard equation, and the time-fractional Swift-Hohenberg equation as examples to demonstrate that the constructed schemes are energy stable and that the discrete energy dissipation law is asymptotically compatible with the classical one when the fractional-order parameter $\alpha\rightarrow 1^{-}$. Several numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. In particular, numerical results confirm that the auxiliary variable remains well aligned with the original variable, and the error between them does not continue to increase over time before the system reaches steady state.</description>

      <title>Scale-Adaptive Generative Flows for Multiscale Scientific Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flow-based generative models can face significant challenges when modeling scientific data with multiscale Fourier spectra, often producing large errors in fine-scale features. We address this problem within the framework of stochastic interpolants, via principled design of noise distributions and interpolation schedules. The key insight is that the noise should not be smoother than the target data distribution -- measured by Fourier spectrum decay rates -- to ensure bounded drift fields near the initial time. For Gaussian and near-Gaussian distributions whose fine-scale structure is known, we show that spectrum-matched noise improves numerical efficiency compared to standard white-noise approaches. For complex non-Gaussian distributions, we develop scale-adaptive interpolation schedules that address the numerical ill-conditioning arising from rougher-than-data noise. Numerical experiments on synthetic Gaussian random fields and solutions to the stochastic Allen-Cahn and Navier-Stokes equations validate our approach and demonstrate its ability to generate high-fidelity samples at lower computational cost than traditional approaches.</description>

Abstract: Complex systems of interacting components often can be modeled by a simple graph $\mathcal{G}$ that consists of a set of $n$ nodes and a set of $m$ edges. Such a graph can be represented by an adjacency matrix $A\in\R^{n\times n}$, whose $(ij)$th entry is one if there is an edge pointing from node $i$ to node $j$, and is zero otherwise. The matrix $A$ and its positive integer powers reveal important properties of the graph and allow the construction of the path length matrix $L$ for the graph. The $(ij)$th entry of $L$ is the length of the shortest path from node $i$ to node $j$; if there is no path between these nodes, then the value of the entry is set to $\infty$. We are interested in how well information flows via shortest paths of the graph. This can be studied with the aid of the path length matrix. The path length matrix allows the definition of several measures of communication in the network defined by the graph such as the global $K$-efficiency, which considers shortest paths that are made up of at most $K$ edges for some $K&lt;n$, as well as the number of such shortest paths. Novel notions of connectivity introduced in this paper help us understand the importance of specific edges for the flow of information through the graph. This is of interest when seeking to simplify a network by removing selected edges or trying to assess the sensitivity of the flow of information to changes due to exterior causes such as a traffic stoppage on a road network.</description>

      <title>A novel approach to study the wellposedness of the 3D fluid-2D plate interaction PDE System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a certain fluid-structure interaction (FSI) system with a view of obtaining an alternative methodology for establishing its strongly continuous semigroup wellposedness. (Semigroup generation for this FSI was originally considered in Avalos-Clark (2014).) The FSI model under consideration describes the vibrations of an incompressible fluid within a 3D cavity as it interacts with the elastic membrane on the ``free" upper boundary of the cavity. Such coupled PDE systems appear in variety of natural settings such as biomedicine, aeroelasticity, and fluid dynamics.
  Our proof of $C_0$-semigroup wellposedness is based on a proper application of Lumer Phillips Theorem. In this regard, our main challenge is to show the maximality of the corresponding semigroup generator. To this end, we develop a ``nonstandard" inf-sup approach which avoids the use of technical nonlocal maps in the associated bilinear forms--unlike the earlier paper Avalos-Clark (2014)--and allows for the solution of the fluid and plate solution variables simultanously. Our new inf-sup strategy will lead to a more efficient mixed finite element method (FEM) for approximating solutions to the FSI problem, inasmuch our novel variational formulation avoids bilinear forms which are free from the computationally-intensive nonlocal solution operators invoked in Avalos-Clark (2014). We also perform numerical tests based on this formulation using a benchmark problem
  and present numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Single-seed generation of Brownian paths and integrals for adaptive and high order SDE solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06464v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the success of adaptive time-stepping in ODE simulation, it has so far seen few applications for Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). To simulate SDEs adaptively, methods such as the Virtual Brownian Tree (VBT) have been developed, which can generate Brownian motion (BM) non-chronologically. However, in most applications, knowing only the values of Brownian motion is not enough to achieve a high order of convergence; for that, we must compute time-integrals of BM such as $\int_s^t W_r \, dr$. With the aim of using high order SDE solvers adaptively, we extend the VBT to generate these integrals of BM in addition to the Brownian increments. A JAX-based implementation of our construction is included in the popular Diffrax library (https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax).
  Since the entire Brownian path produced by VBT is uniquely determined by a single PRNG seed, previously generated samples need not be stored, which results in a constant memory footprint and enables experiment repeatability and strong error estimation. Based on binary search, the VBT's time complexity is logarithmic in the tolerance parameter $\varepsilon$. Unlike the original VBT algorithm, which was only precise at some dyadic times, we prove that our construction exactly matches the joint distribution of the Brownian motion and its time integrals at any query times, provided they are at least $\varepsilon$ apart.
  We present two applications of adaptive high order solvers enabled by our new VBT. Using adaptive solvers to simulate a high-volatility CIR model, we achieve more than twice the convergence order of constant stepping. We apply an adaptive third order underdamped or kinetic Langevin solver to an MCMC problem, where our approach outperforms the No U-Turn Sampler, while using only a tenth of its function evaluations.</description>

Abstract: We propose rigorous lower and upper bounds for neural network (NN) approximations to PDEs by efficiently computing the Riesz representations of suitable extension and restrictions of the NN residual towards geometrically simpler domains, which are either embedded or enveloping the original domain. Error bounds are proven and detailed for elliptic as well as parabolic problems. Numerical experiments show the good quantitative behaviour of the derived upper and lower error bounds.</description>

      <title>A filtered two-step variational integrator for charged-particle dynamics in a moderate or strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is concerned with a new filtered two-step variational integrator for solving the charged-particle dynamics in a mildly non-homogeneous moderate or strong magnetic field with a dimensionless parameter $\epsilon$ inversely proportional to the strength of the magnetic field. In the case of a moderate magnetic field ($\epsilon=1$), second-order error bounds and long time energy and momentum conservations are obtained. Moreover, the proof of the long-term analysis is accomplished by the backward error analysis. For the strong magnetic field ($0&lt;\epsilon \ll1$), this paper clarifies the behaviour of the filtered variational integrator for both a large stepsize $h^2 \geq C\epsilon$ and a smaller stepsize $ h \leq c\epsilon$. The approach to analysing the error bounds for these two stepsizes is based on comparing the modulated Fourier expansions of the exact and the numerical solutions. It is shown that the proposed integrator achieves a second-order accuracy $\mathcal{O}(h^2)$ in the position and in the parallel velocity for a large step size and an $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)$ accuracy for a smaller stepsize. This paper also yields the long time energy and magnetic moment conservations for the strong magnetic field by developing the modulated Fourier expansion of the proposed scheme. All the theoretical results of the error behaviour and long-term conservations are numerically demonstrated by four numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Correcting Auto-Differentiation in Neural-ODE Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Does the use of auto-differentiation yield reasonable updates for deep neural networks (DNNs)? Specifically, when DNNs are designed to adhere to neural ODE architectures, can we trust the gradients provided by auto-differentiation? Through mathematical analysis and numerical evidence, we demonstrate that when neural networks employ high-order methods, such as Linear Multistep Methods (LMM) or Explicit Runge-Kutta Methods (ERK), to approximate the underlying ODE flows, brute-force auto-differentiation often introduces artificial oscillations in the gradients that prevent convergence. In the case of Leapfrog and 2-stage ERK, we propose simple post-processing techniques that effectively eliminates these oscillations, correct the gradient computation and thus returns the accurate updates.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Stability and Consistency Guarantees for Physics-Informed Neural Networks via Coercive Operator Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified theoretical framework for analyzing the stability and consistency of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), grounded in operator coercivity, variational formulations, and non-asymptotic perturbation theory. PINNs approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) by minimizing residual losses over sampled collocation and boundary points. We formalize both operator-level and variational notions of consistency, proving that residual minimization in Sobolev norms leads to convergence in energy and uniform norms under mild regularity. Deterministic stability bounds quantify how bounded perturbations to the network outputs propagate through the full composite loss, while probabilistic concentration results via McDiarmid's inequality yield sample complexity guarantees for residual-based generalization. A unified generalization bound links residual consistency, projection error, and perturbation sensitivity. Empirical results on elliptic, parabolic, and nonlinear PDEs confirm the predictive accuracy of our theoretical bounds across regimes. The framework identifies key structural principles, such as operator coercivity, activation smoothness, and sampling admissibility, that underlie robust and generalizable PINN training, offering principled guidance for the design and analysis of PDE-informed learning systems.</description>

      <title>A generalized Hurwitz stability criterion via rectangular block Hankel matrices for nonmonic matrix polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14376v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a Hurwitz stability criterion for nonmonic matrix polynomials via column reduction, generalizing existing approaches constrained by the monic assumption, as well as Gantmacher's classical stability criterion via Markov parameters. Starting from redefining the associated Markov parameters through a column-wise adaptive splitting method, our framework constructs two structured matrices whose rectangular Hankel blocks are obtained via the extraction of these parameters. We establish an explicit interrelation between the inertias of column reduced matrix polynomials and the derived structured matrices. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hurwitz stability of column reduced matrix polynomials can be determined by the Hermitian positive definiteness of these rectangular block Hankel matrices.</description>
