      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo calculations in the nuclear shell model by the complex Langevin method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nuclear shell model is known to describe the properties of various nuclei extremely well. However, the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations cannot be applied to it with general interactions due to the sign problem. The model has therefore been investigated primarily by variational methods, where the accuracy of the results depends crucially on the ansatz for the wave function. Here we perform the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations in the case of small systems at finite temperature using the complex Langevin method (CLM), which has been successfully applied to various interesting systems with the sign problem over the decade. In particular, we show the existence of a parameter region in which the validity criterion for the CLM is satisfied and the expectation value of the energy obtained by exact diagonalization is correctly reproduced. Thus the CLM can be a complementary approach to the variational method for large systems.</description>

      <title>High-precision determination of radiative corrections to superallowed nuclear beta decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superallowed $0^+\rightarrow 0^+$ transitions between $T=1$ nuclei have been a perfect avenue avenue for determining the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $V_{ud}$, which imposes powerful constraints on physics beyond the Standard Model at low energies. For a long time, the precision of $V_{ud}$ has been limited by uncertainties in radiative corrections that arise from non-perturbative strong interaction physics at both the hadronic and nuclear levels. In this talk, I will describe some recent efforts to pin down these corrections by combining dispersive analysis with experimental data, lattice QCD, and nuclear many-body calculations.</description>

      <title>Training neural control variates using correlated configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07719v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural control variates (NCVs) have emerged as a powerful tool for variance reduction in Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, particularly in high-dimensional problems where traditional control variates are difficult to construct analytically. By training neural networks to learn auxiliary functions correlated with the target observable, NCVs can significantly reduce estimator variance while preserving unbiasedness. However, a critical but often overlooked aspect of NCV training is the role of autocorrelated samples generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). While such samples are typically discarded for error estimation due to their statistical redundancy, they may contain useful information about the structure of the underlying probability distribution that can benefit the training process. In this work, we systematically examine the effect of using correlated configurations in training neural control variates. We demonstrate, both conceptually and numerically, that training on correlated data can improve control variate performance, especially in settings with limited computational resources. Our analysis includes empirical results from $U(1)$ gauge theory and scalar field theory, illustrating when and how autocorrelated samples enhance NCV construction. These findings provide practical guidance for the efficient use of MCMC data in training neural networks.</description>
