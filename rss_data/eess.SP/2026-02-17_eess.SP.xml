      <title>SIM-assisted Secure Mobile Communications via Enhanced Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the development of sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication networks, the security challenges are becoming increasingly prominent, especially for mobile users (MUs). As a promising solution, physical layer security (PLS) technology leverages the inherent characteristics of wireless channels to provide security assurance. Particularly, stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) directly manipulates electromagnetic waves through their multilayer structures, offering significant potential for enhancing PLS performance in an energy efficient manner. Thus, in this work, we investigate an SIM-assisted secure communication system for MUs under the threat of an eavesdropper, addressing practical challenges such as channel uncertainty in mobile environments, multiple MU interference, and residual hardware impairments. Consequently, we formulate a joint power and phase shift optimization problem (JPPSOP), aiming at maximizing the achievable secrecy rate (ASR) of all MUs. Given the non-convexity and dynamic nature of this optimization problem, we propose an enhanced proximal policy optimization algorithm with a bidirectional long short-term memory mechanism, an off-policy data utilization mechanism, and a policy feedback mechanism (PPO-BOP). Through these mechanisms, the proposed algorithm can effectively capture short-term channel fading and long-term MU mobility, improve sample utilization efficiency, and enhance exploration capabilities. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that PPO-BOP significantly outperforms benchmark strategies and other deep reinforcement learning algorithms in terms of ASR.10.1109/TWC.2026.3658332</description>

      <title>Sample-level EEG-based Selective Auditory Attention Decoding with Markov Switching Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selective auditory attention decoding aims to identify the speaker of interest from listeners' neural signals, such as electroencephalography (EEG), in the presence of multiple concurrent speakers. Most existing methods operate at the window level, facing a trade-off between temporal resolution and decoding accuracy. Recent work has shown that hidden Markov model (HMM)-based post-processing can smooth window-level decoder outputs to improve this trade-off. Instead of using a separate smoothing step, we propose to integrate the decoding and smoothing components into a single probabilistic framework using a Markov switching model (MSM). It directly models the relationship between the EEG and speech envelopes under each attention state while incorporating the temporal dynamics of attention. This formulation enables sample-level attention decoding, with model parameters and attention states jointly estimated via the expectation-maximization algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that this integrated MSM formulation achieves comparable decoding accuracy to HMM post-processing while providing faster attention switch detection. The code for the proposed method is available at https://github.com/YYao-42/MSM.</description>

      <title>Towards Causality-Aware Modeling for Multimodal Brain-Muscle Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust characterization of dynamic causal interactions in multivariate biomedical signals is essential for advancing computational and algorithmic methods in biomedical imaging. Conventional approaches, such as Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs), often assume linear or simple statistical dependencies, while manifold based techniques like Convergent Cross Mapping (CCM) capture nonlinear, lagged interactions but lack probabilistic quantification and interventional modeling. We introduce a DBN informed CCM framework that integrates geometric manifold reconstruction with probabilistic temporal modeling. Applied to multimodal EEG-EMG recordings from dystonic and neurotypical children, the method quantifies uncertainty, supports interventional simulation, and reveals distinct frequency specific reorganization of corticomuscular pathways in dystonia. Experimental results show marked improvements in predictive consistency and causal stability as compared to baseline approaches, demonstrating the potential of causality aware multimodal modeling for developing quantitative biomarkers and guiding targeted neuromodulatory interventions.</description>

      <title>Blind Deconvolution Demixing using Modulated Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on solving a challenging problem of blind deconvolution demixing involving modulated inputs. Specifically, multiple input signals $s_n(t)$, each bandlimited to $B$ Hz, are modulated with known random sequences $r_n(t)$ that alter at rate $Q$. Each modulated signal is convolved with a different M tap channel of impulse response $h_n(t)$, and the outputs of each channel are added at a common receiver to give the observed signal $y(t)=\sum_{n=1}^N (r_n(t)\odot s_n(t))\circledast h_n(t)$, where $\odot$ is the point wise multiplication, and $\circledast$ is circular convolution. Given this observed signal $y(t)$, we are concerned with recovering $s_n(t)$ and $h_n(t)$. We employ deterministic subspace assumption for the input signal $s_n(t)$ and keep the channel impulse response $h_n(t)$ arbitrary. We show that if modulating sequence is altered at a rate $Q \geq N^2 (B+M)$ and sample complexity bound is obeyed then all the signals and the channels, $\{s_n(t),h_n(t)\}_{n=1}^N$, can be estimated from the observed mixture $y(t)$ using gradient descent algorithm. We have performed extensive simulations that show the robustness of our algorithm and used phase transitions to numerically investigate the theoretical guarantees provided by our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of simultaneous EEG-fMRI at 0.55 T: Recording, Denoising, and Functional Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simultaneous recording of electroencephalography (EEG) and functional MRI (fMRI) can provide a more complete view of brain function by merging high temporal and spatial resolutions. High-field ($\geq$3T) systems are standard, and require technical trade-offs, including artifacts in the EEG signal, reduced compatibility with metallic implants, high acoustic noise, and artifacts around high-susceptibility areas such as the optic nerve and nasal sinus. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneous EEG-fMRI at 0.55T in a visual task. We characterize the gradient and ballistocardiogram (BCG) artifacts inherent to this environment and observe reduced BCG magnitude consistent with the expected scaling of pulse-related artifacts with static magnetic field strength. This reduction shows promise for facilitating effective denoising while preserving the alpha rhythm and signal integrity. Furthermore, we tested a multimodal integration pipeline and demonstrated that the EEG power envelope corresponds with the hemodynamic BOLD response, supporting the potential to measure neurovascular coupling in this environment. We demonstrate that combined EEG-fMRI at 0.55T is feasible and represents a promising environment for multimodal neuroimaging.</description>

      <title>Sub Specie Aeternitatis: Fourier Transforms from the Theory of Heat to Musical Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13520v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: J. B. Fourier in his \emph{Th\'{e}orie Analytique de la Chaleur} of 1822 introduced, amongst other things, two ideas that have made a fundamental impact in fields as diverse as Mathematical Physics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Music. The first one of these, a method to find the coefficients for a trigonometric series describing an arbitrary function, was very early on picked up by G. Ohm and H. Helmholtz as the foundation for a theory of \emph{musical tones}. The second one, which is described by Fourier's double integral, became the basis for treating certain kinds of infinity in discontinuous functions, as shown by A. De Morgan in his 1842 \emph{The Differential and Integral Calculus}. Both make up the fundamental basis for what is now commonly known as the \emph{Fourier theorem}. With the help of P. A. M. Dirac's insights into the nature of these infinities, we can have a compact description of the frequency spectrum of a function of time, or conversely of a waveform corresponding to a given function of frequency. This paper, using solely primary sources, takes us from the physics of heat propagation to the modern theory of musical signals. It concludes with some considerations on the inherent duality of time and frequency emerging from Fourier's theorem.</description>

      <title>DopplerGLRTNet for Radar Off-Grid Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Off-grid targets whose Doppler (or angle) does not lie on the discrete processing grid can severely degrade classical normalized matched-filter (NMF) detectors: even at high SNR, the detection probability may saturate at operationally relevant low false-alarm rates. A principled remedy is the continuous-parameter GLRT, which maximizes a normalized correlation over the parameter domain; however, dense scanning increases test-time cost and remains sensitive to covariance mismatch through whitening. We propose DopplerGLRTNet, an amortized off-grid GLRT: a lightweight regressor predicts the continuous Doppler within a resolution cell from the whitened observation, and the detector outputs a single GLRT/NMF-like score given by the normalized matched-filter energy at the predicted Doppler. Monte Carlo simulations in Gaussian and compound-Gaussian clutter show that DopplerGLRTNet mitigates off-grid saturation, approaches dense-scan performance at a fraction of its cost, and improves robustness to covariance estimation at the same empirically calibrated Pfa.</description>

      <title>Twenty-five years of J-DSP Online Labs for Signal Processing Classes and Workforce Development Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the history of the online simulation program Java-DSP (J-DSP) and the most recent function development and deployment. J-DSP was created to support online laboratories in DSP classes and was first deployed in our ASU DSP class in 2000. The development of the program and its extensions was supported by several NSF grants including CCLI and IUSE. The web-based software was developed by our team in Java and later transitioned to the more secure HTML5 environment. J-DSP supports laboratory exercises on: digital filters and their design, the FFT and its utility in spectral analysis, machine learning for signal classification, and more recently online simulations with the Quantum Fourier Transform. Throughout the J-DSP development and deployment of this tool and its associated laboratory exercises, we documented evaluations. Mobile versions of the program for iOS and Android were also developed. J-DSP is used to this day in several universities, and specific functions of the program have been used in NSF REU, IRES and RET workforce development and high school outreach.</description>

      <title>Efficient Off-Grid Near-Field Cascade Channel Estimation for XL-IRS Systems via Tucker Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate cascaded channel state information is pivotal for extremely large-scale intelligent reflecting surfaces (XL-IRS) in next-generation wireless networks. However, the large XL-IRS aperture induces spherical wavefront propagation due to near-field (NF) effects, complicating cascaded channel estimation. Conventional dictionary-based methods suffer from cumulative quantization errors and high complexity, especially in uniform planar array (UPA) systems. To address these issues, we first propose a tensor modelization method for NF cascaded channels by exploiting the tensor product among the horizontal and vertical response vectors of the UPA-structured base station (BS) and the incident-reflective array response vector of the IRS. This structure leverages spatial characteristics, enabling independent estimation of factor matrices to improve efficiency. Meanwhile, to avoid quantization errors, we propose an off-grid cascaded channel estimation framework based on sparse Tucker decomposition. Specifically, we model the received signal as a Tucker tensor, where the sparse core tensor captures path gain-delay terms and three factor matrices are spanned by BS and NF IRS array responses. We then formulate a sparse core tensor minimization problem with tri-modal log-sum sparsity constraints to tackle the NP-hard challenge. Finally, the method is accelerated via higher-order singular value decomposition preprocessing, combined with majorization-minimization and a tailored tensor over-relaxation fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding technique. We derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound and conduct convergence analysis. Simulations show the proposed scheme achieves a 13.6 dB improvement in normalized mean square error over benchmarks with significantly reduced runtime.</description>

      <title>Lightweight Range-Angle Imaging Based Algorithm for Quasi-Static Human Detection on Low-Cost FMCW Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-static human activities such as lying, standing or sitting produce very low Doppler shifts and highly spread radar signatures, making them difficult to detect with conventional constant-false-alarm rate (CFAR) detectors tuned for point targets. Moreover, privacy concerns and low lighting conditions limit the use of cameras in long-term care (LTC) facilities. This paper proposes a lightweight, non-visual image-based method for robust quasi-static human presence detection using a low-cost 60 GHz FMCW radar. On a dataset covering five semi-static activities, the proposed method improves average detection accuracy from 68.3% for Cell-Averaging CFAR (CA-CFAR) and 78.8% for Order-Statistics CFAR (OS-CFAR) to 93.24% for Subject 1, from 51.3%, 68.3% to 92.3% for Subject 2, and 57.72%, 69.94% to 94.82% for Subject 3, respectively. Finally, we benchmarked all three detectors across all activities on a Raspberry Pi 4B using a shared Range-Angle (RA) preprocessing pipeline. The proposed algorithm obtains an average 8.2 ms per frame, resulting in over 120 frames per second (FPS) and a 74 times speed-up over OS-CFAR. These results demonstrate that simple image-based processing can provide robust and deployable quasi-static human sensing in cluttered indoor environments.</description>

      <title>Rethinking RSSI for WiFi Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is widely available on commodity WiFi devices but is commonly regarded as too coarse for fine-grained sensing. This paper revisits its sensing potential and presents WiRSSI, a bistatic WiFi sensing framework for passive human tracking using only RSSI measurements. WiRSSI adopts a 1Tx-3Rx configuration and is readily extensible to Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) deployments. We first reveal how CSI power implicitly encodes phase-related information and how this relationship carries over to RSSI, showing that RSSI preserves exploitable Doppler, Angle-of-Arrival (AoA), and delay cues associated with human motion. WiRSSI then extracts Doppler-AoA features via a 2D Fast Fourier Transform and infers delay from amplitude-only information in the absence of subcarrier-level phase. The estimated AoA and delay are then mapped to Cartesian coordinates and denoised to recover motion trajectories. Experiments in practical environments show that WiRSSI achieves median XY localization errors of 0.905 m, 0.784 m, and 0.785 m for elliptical, linear, and rectangular trajectories, respectively. In comparison, a representative CSI-based method attains median errors of 0.574 m, 0.599 m, and 0.514 m, corresponding to an average accuracy gap of 0.26 m. These results demonstrate that, despite its lower resolution, RSSI can support practical passive sensing and offers a low-cost alternative to CSI-based WiFi sensing.</description>

      <title>Extended Universal Joint Source-Channel Coding for Digital Semantic Communications: Improving Channel-Adaptability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning (DL)-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) have enabled efficient semantic communication in dynamic wireless environments. Among these approaches, vector quantization (VQ)-based JSCC effectively maps high-dimensional semantic feature vectors into compact codeword indices for digital modulation. However, existing methods, including universal JSCC (uJSCC), rely on fixed, modulation-specific encoders, decoders, and codebooks, limiting adaptability to fine-grained SNR variations. We propose an extended universal JSCC (euJSCC) framework that achieves SNR- and modulation-adaptive transmission within a single model. euJSCC employs a hypernetwork-based normalization layer for fine-grained feature vector normalization and a dynamic codebook generation (DCG) network that refines modulation-specific base codebooks according to block-wise SNR. To handle block fading channels, which consist of multiple coherence blocks, an inner-outer encoder-decoder architecture is adopted, where the outer encoder and decoder capture long-term channel statistics, and the inner encoder and decoder refine feature vectors to align with block-wise codebooks. A two-phase training strategy, i.e., pretraining on AWGN channels followed by finetuning on block fading channels, ensures stable convergence. Experiments on image transmission demonstrate that euJSCC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art channel-adaptive digital JSCC schemes under both block fading and AWGN channels.</description>

      <title>Convexity Meets Curvature: Lifted Near-Field Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extra-large apertures, high carrier frequencies, and integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) are pushing array processing into the Fresnel region, where spherical wavefronts induce a range-dependent phase across the aperture. This curvature breaks the Fourier/Vandermonde structure behind classical subspace methods, and it is especially limiting with hybrid front-ends that provide only a small number of pilot measurements. Consequently, practical systems need continuous angle resolution and joint angle-range inference where many near-field approaches still rely on costly 2D gridding. We show that convexity can meet curvature via a lifted, gridless superresolution framework for near-field measurements. The key is a Bessel-Vandermonde factorization of the Fresnel-phase manifold that exposes a hidden Vandermonde structure in angle while isolating the range dependence into a compact coefficient map. Building on this, we introduce a lifting that maps each range bin and continuous angle to a structured rank-one atom, converting the nonlinear near-field model into a linear inverse problem over a row-sparse matrix. Recovery is posed as atomic-norm minimization and an explicit dual characterization via bounded trigonometric polynomials yields certificate-based localization that super-resolves off-grid angles and identifies active range bins. Simulations with strongly undersampled hybrid observations validate reliable joint angle-range recovery for next-generation wireless and ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Wireless Physical Neural Networks (WPNNs): Opportunities and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless communication systems exhibit structural and functional similarities to neural networks: signals propagate through cascaded elements, interact with the environment, and undergo transformations. Building upon this perspective, we introduce a unified paradigm, termed \textit{wireless physical neural networks (WPNNs)}, in which components of a wireless network, such as transceivers, relays, backscatter, and intelligent surfaces, are interpreted as computational layers within a learning architecture. By treating the wireless propagation environment and network elements as differentiable operators, new opportunities arise for joint communication-computation designs, where system optimization can be achieved through learning-based methods applied directly to the physical network. This approach may operate independently of, or in conjunction with, conventional digital neural layers, enabling hybrid communication learning pipelines. In the article, we outline representative architectures that embody this viewpoint and discuss the algorithmic and training considerations required to leverage the wireless medium as a computational resource. Through numerical examples, we highlight the potential performance gains in processing, adaptability, efficiency, and end-to-end optimization, demonstrating the promise of reconfiguring wireless systems as learning networks in next-generation communication frameworks.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Bounds on Realizing Targeted MIMO Transfer Functions in Real-World Systems with Wave-Domain Programmability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key question for most applications involving reconfigurable linear wave systems is how accurately a desired linear operator can be realized by configuring the system's tunable elements. The relevance of this question spans from hybrid-MIMO analog combiners via computational meta-imagers to programmable wave-domain signal processing. Yet, no electromagnetically consistent bounds have been derived for the fidelity with which a desired operator can be realized in a real-world reconfigurable wave system. Here, we derive such bounds based on an electromagnetically consistent multiport-network model (capturing mutual coupling between tunable elements) and accounting for real-world hardware constraints (lossy, 1-bit-programmable elements). Specifically, we formulate the operator-synthesis task as a quadratically constrained fractional-quadratic problem and compute rigorous fidelity upper bounds based on semidefinite relaxation. We apply our technique to three distinct experimental setups. The first two setups are, respectively, a free-space and a rich-scattering $4\times 4$ MIMO channel at 2.45 GHz parameterized by a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) comprising 100 1-bit-programmable elements. The third setup is a $4\times 4$ MIMO channel at 19 GHz from four feeds of a dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA) to four users. We systematically study how the achievable fidelity scales with the number of tunable elements, and we probe the tightness of our bounds by trying to find optimized configurations approaching the bounds with standard discrete-optimization techniques. We observe a strong influence of the coupling strength between tunable elements on our fidelity bound. For the two RIS-based setups, our bound attests to insufficient wave-domain flexibility for the considered operator synthesis.</description>

      <title>Explainable Interictal Epileptiform Discharge Detection Method Based on Scalp EEG and Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) is crucial for the diagnosis of epilepsy, but automated methods often lack interpretability. This study proposes IED-RAG, an explainable multimodal framework for joint IED detection and report generation. Our approach employs a dual-encoder to extract electrophysiological and semantic features, aligned via contrastive learning in a shared EEG-text embedding space. During inference, clinically relevant EEG-text pairs are retrieved from a vector database as explicit evidence to condition a large language model (LLM) for the generation of evidence-based reports. Evaluated on a private dataset from Wuhan Children's Hospital and the public TUH EEG Events Corpus (TUEV), the framework achieved balanced accuracies of 89.17\% and 71.38\%, with BLEU scores of 89.61\% and 64.14\%, respectively. The results demonstrate that retrieval of explicit evidence enhances both diagnostic performance and clinical interpretability compared to standard black-box methods.</description>

      <title>Localization Exploiting Spatial Variations in the Magnetic Field: Principles and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal processing has played, and continues to play, a fundamental role in the evolution of modern localization technologies. Localization using spatial variations in the Earth's magnetic field is no exception. It relies on signal-processing methods for statistical state inference, magnetic-field modeling, and sensor calibration. Contemporary localization techniques based on spatial variations in the magnetic field can provide decimeter-level indoor localization accuracy and outdoor localization accuracy on par with strategic-grade inertial navigation systems. This article provides a broad, high-level overview of current signal-processing principles and open research challenges in localization using spatial variations in the Earth's magnetic field. The aim is to provide the reader with an understanding of the similarities and differences among existing key technologies from a statistical signal-processing perspective. To that end, existing key technologies will be presented within a common parametric signal-model framework compatible with well-established statistical inference methods.</description>

      <title>Robust SAC-Enabled UAV-RIS Assisted Secure MISO Systems With Untrusted EH Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates secure downlink transmission in a UAV-assisted reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-enabled multiuser multiple-input single-output network, where legitimate information-harvesting receivers coexist with untrusted energy-harvesting receivers (UEHRs) capable of eavesdropping. A UAV-mounted RIS provides blockage mitigation and passive beamforming, while the base station employs zero-forcing precoding for multiuser interference suppression. Due to limited feedback from UEHRs, their channel state information (CSI) is imperfect, leading to a worst-case secrecy energy efficiency (WCSEE) maximization problem. We jointly optimize the UAV horizontal position, RIS phase shifts, and transmit power allocation under both perfect and imperfect CSI, considering discrete RIS phases, UAV mobility, and energy-harvesting constraints. The resulting problem is highly nonconvex due to coupled channel geometry, robustness requirements, and discrete variables. To address this challenge, we propose a soft actor-critic (SAC)-based deep reinforcement learning framework that learns WCSEE-maximizing policies through interaction with the wireless environment. As a structured benchmark, a successive convex approximation (SCA) approach is developed for the perfect CSI case with continuous RIS phases. Simulation results show that the proposed SAC method achieves up to 28% and 16% secrecy energy efficiency gains over SCA and deep deterministic policy gradient baselines, respectively, while demonstrating superior robustness to CSI uncertainty and stable performance across varying transmit power levels and RIS sizes.</description>

      <title>Low-Cost Physical-Layer Security Design for IRS-Assisted mMIMO Systems with One-Bit DACs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems with intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS) presents a promising paradigm for enhancing physical-layer security (PLS) in wireless communications. However, deploying high-resolution quantizers in large-scale mMIMO arrays, along with numerous IRS elements, leads to substantial hardware complexity. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cost-effective PLS design for IRS-assisted mMIMO systems by employing one-bit digital-to-analog converters (DACs). The focus is on jointly optimizing one-bit quantized precoding at the transmitter and constant-modulus phase shifts at the IRS to maximize the secrecy rate. This leads to a highly non-convex fractional secrecy rate maximization (SRM) problem. To efficiently solve this problem, two algorithms are proposed: (1) the WMMSE-PDD algorithm, which reformulates the SRM problem into a sequence of non-fractional programs with auxiliary variables using the weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) method and solves them via the penalty dual decomposition (PDD) approach, achieving superior secrecy performance; and (2) the exact penalty product Riemannian gradient descent (EPPRGD) algorithm, which transforms the SRM problem into an unconstrained optimization over a product Riemannian manifold, eliminating auxiliary variables and enabling faster convergence with a slight trade-off in secrecy performance. Both algorithms provide analytical solutions at each iteration and are proven to converge to Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) points. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed methods and highlight their respective advantages.</description>

      <title>Online Architecture Search for Compressed Sensing based on Hypergradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AS-ISTA (Architecture Searched-Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm) and AS-FISTA (AS-Fast ISTA) are compressed sensing algorithms introducing structural parameters to ISTA and FISTA to enable architecture search within the iterative process. The structural parameters are determined using deep unfolding, but this approach requires training data and the large overhead of training time. In this paper, we propose HGD-AS-ISTA (Hypergradient Descent-AS-ISTA) and HGD-AS-FISTA that use hypergradient descent, which is an online hyperparameter optimization method, to determine the structural parameters. Experimental results show that the proposed method improves performance of the conventional ISTA/FISTA while avoiding the need for re-training when the environment changes.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces-assisted Positioning in Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of high-precision target localization in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, where the target is sensed via both a direct path and a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted reflection path. We first develop a sequential matched-filter estimator to acquire coarse angular parameters, followed by a range recovery process based on subcarrier phase differences. Subsequently, we formulate the target localization problem as a non-linear least squares optimization, using the coarse estimates to initialize the target's position coordinates. To solve this efficiently, we introduce a fast iterative refinement algorithm tailored for RIS-aided ISAC environments. Recognizing that the signal model involves both linear path gains and non-linear geometric dependencies, we exploit the separable least-squares structure to decouple these parameters. Furthermore, we propose a modified Levenberg algorithm with an approximation strategy, which enables low-cost parameter updates without necessitating repeated evaluations of the full non-linear model. Simulation results show that the proposed refinement method achieves accuracy comparable to conventional approaches, while significantly reducing algorithmic complexity.</description>

      <title>Cramer--Rao Bounds for Magneto-Inductive Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic induction (MI) enables communication in RF-denied environments (underground, underwater, in-body), where the medium conductivity imprints a deterministic signature on the channel. This letter derives a closed-form Cram\'{e}r--Rao bound (CRB) for the joint estimation of range and medium conductivity from MI pilot observations in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework. The Fisher information matrix reveals that the joint estimation penalty converges to 3\,dB in the near-field regime, meaning conductivity sensing adds at most a factor-of-two loss in ranging precision. Monte Carlo maximum-likelihood simulations confirm that the CRB is achievable under practical operating conditions.</description>

      <title>All-pole centroids in the Wasserstein metric with applications to clustering of spectral densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a method for computing centroids, or barycenters, in the spectral Wasserstein-2 metric for sets of power spectral densities, where the barycenters are restricted to belong to the set of all-pole spectra with a certain model order. This may be interpreted as finding an autoregressive representative for sets of second-order stationary Gaussian processes. While Wasserstein, or optimal transport, barycenters have been successfully used earlier in problems of spectral estimation and clustering, the resulting barycenters are non-parametric and the complexity of representing and storing them depends on, e.g., the choice of discretization grid. In contrast, the herein proposed method yields compact, low-dimensional, and interpretable spectral centroids that can be used in downstream tasks. Computing the all-pole centroids corresponds to solving a non-convex optimization problem in the model parameters, and we present a gradient descent scheme for addressing this. Although convergence to a globally optimal point cannot be guaranteed, the sub-optimality of the obtained centroids can be quantified. The proposed method is illustrated on a problem of phoneme classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dirac operator provides a unified framework for processing signals defined over different order topological domains, such as node and edge signals. Its eigenmodes define a spectral representation that inherently captures cross-domain interactions, in contrast to conventional Hodge-Laplacian eigenmodes that operate within a single topological dimension. In this paper, we compare the two alternatives in terms of the distortion/sparsity trade-off and we show how an overcomplete basis built concatenating the two dictionaries can provide better performance with respect to each approach. Then, we propose a parameterized nonredundant transform whose eigenmodes incorporate a mode-specific mass parameter that captures the interplay between node and edge modes. Interestingly, we show that learning the mass parameters from data makes the proposed transform able to achieve the best distortion-sparsity tradeoff with respect to both complete and overcomplete bases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While synthetic aperture radar is widely adopted to provide high-resolution imaging at long distances using small arrays, the concept of coherent synthetic aperture communication (SAC) has not yet been explored. This article introduces the principles of SAC for direct satellite-to-device uplink, showcasing precise direction-of-arrival estimation for user equipment (UE) devices, facilitating spatial signal separation, localization, and easing link budget constraints. Simulations for a low Earth orbit satellite at 600 km orbit and two UE devices performing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing-based transmission with polar coding at 3.5 GHz demonstrate block error rates below 0.1 with transmission powers as low as -10 dBm, even under strong interference when UE devices are resolved but fall on each other's strongest angular sidelobe. These results validate the ability of the proposed scheme to address mutual interference and stringent power limitations, paving the way for massive Internet of Things connectivity in non-terrestrial networks.</description>

      <title>RF-GPT: Teaching AI to See the Wireless World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and multimodal models have become powerful general-purpose reasoning systems. However, radio-frequency (RF) signals, which underpin wireless systems, are still not natively supported by these models. Existing LLM-based approaches for telecom focus mainly on text and structured data, while conventional RF deep-learning models are built separately for specific signal-processing tasks, highlighting a clear gap between RF perception and high-level reasoning. To bridge this gap, we introduce RF-GPT, a radio-frequency language model (RFLM) that utilizes the visual encoders of multimodal LLMs to process and understand RF spectrograms. In this framework, complex in-phase/quadrature (IQ) waveforms are mapped to time-frequency spectrograms and then passed to pretrained visual encoders. The resulting representations are injected as RF tokens into a decoder-only LLM, which generates RF-grounded answers, explanations, and structured outputs. To train RF-GPT, we perform supervised instruction fine-tuning of a pretrained multimodal LLM using a fully synthetic RF corpus. Standards-compliant waveform generators produce wideband scenes for six wireless technologies, from which we derive time-frequency spectrograms, exact configuration metadata, and dense captions. A text-only LLM then converts these captions into RF-grounded instruction-answer pairs, yielding roughly 12,000 RF scenes and 0.625 million instruction examples without any manual labeling. Across benchmarks for wideband modulation classification, overlap analysis, wireless-technology recognition, WLAN user counting, and 5G NR information extraction, RF-GPT achieves strong multi-task performance, whereas general-purpose VLMs with no RF grounding largely fail.</description>

      <title>Lattice XBAR Filters in Thin-Film Lithium Niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the demonstration of lattice filters based on laterally excited bulk acoustic resonators (XBARs). Two filter implementations, namely direct lattice and layout-balanced lattice topologies, are designed and fabricated in periodically poled piezoelectric film (P3F) thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN). By leveraging the strong electromechanical coupling of XBARs in P3F TFLN together with the inherently wideband nature of the lattice topology, 3-dB fractional bandwidths (FBWs) of 27.42\% and 39.11\% and low insertion losses (ILs) of 0.88 dB and 0.96 dB are achieved at approximately 20 GHz for the direct and layout-balanced lattice filters, respectively, under conjugate matching. Notably, all prototypes feature compact footprints smaller than 1.3 mm\textsuperscript{2}. These results highlight the potential of XBAR-based lattice architectures to enable low-loss, wideband acoustic filters for compact, high-performance RF front ends in next-generation wireless communication and sensing systems, while also identifying key challenges and directions for further optimization.</description>

      <title>Real-time Range-Angle Estimation and Tag Localization for Multi-static Backscatter Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-static backscatter networks (BNs) are strong candidates for joint communication and localization in the ambient IoT paradigm for 6G. Enabling real-time localization in large-scale multi-static deployments with thousands of devices require highly efficient algorithms for estimating key parameters such as range and angle of arrival (AoA), and for fusing these parameters into location estimates. We propose two low-complexity algorithms, Joint Range-Angle Clustering (JRAC) and Stage-wise Range-Angle Estimation (SRAE). Both deliver range and angle estimation accuracy comparable to FFT- and subspace-based baselines while significantly reducing the computation. We then introduce two real-time localization algorithms that fuse the estimated ranges and AoAs: a maximum-likelihood (ML) method solved via gradient search and an iterative re-weighted least squares (IRLS) method. Both achieve localization accuracy comparable to ML-based brute force search albeit with far lower complexity. Experiments on a real-world large-scale multi-static testbed with 4 illuminators, 1 multi-antenna receiver, and 100 tags show that JRAC and SRAE reduce runtime by up to 40X and IRLS achieves up to 500X reduction over ML-based brute force search without degrading localization accuracy. The proposed methods achieve 3 m median localization error across all 100 tags in a sub-6GHz band with 40 MHz bandwidth. These results demonstrate that multi-static range-angle estimation and localization algorithms can make real-time, scalable backscatter localization practical for next-generation ambient IoT networks.</description>

      <title>FUTON: Fourier Tensor Network for Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as powerful tools for encoding signals, yet dominant MLP-based designs often suffer from slow convergence, overfitting to noise, and poor extrapolation. We introduce FUTON (Fourier Tensor Network), which models signals as generalized Fourier series whose coefficients are parameterized by a low-rank tensor decomposition. FUTON implicitly expresses signals as weighted combinations of orthonormal, separable basis functions, combining complementary inductive biases: Fourier bases capture smoothness and periodicity, while the low-rank parameterization enforces low-dimensional spectral structure. We provide theoretical guarantees through a universal approximation theorem and derive an inference algorithm with complexity linear in the spectral resolution and the input dimension. On image and volume representation, FUTON consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MLP-based INRs while training 2--5$\times$ faster. On inverse problems such as image denoising and super-resolution, FUTON generalizes better and converges faster.</description>

      <title>End-to-End NOMA with Perfect and Quantized CSI Over Rayleigh Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An end-to-end autoencoder (AE) framework is developed for downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) over Rayleigh fading channels, which learns interference-aware and channel-adaptive super-constellations. While existing works either assume additive white Gaussian noise channels or treat fading channels without a fully end-to-end learning approach, our framework directly embeds the wireless channel into both training and inference. To account for practical channel state information (CSI), we further incorporate limited feedback via both uniform and Lloyd-Max quantization of channel gains and analyze their impact on AE training and bit error rate (BER) performance. Simulation results show that, with perfect CSI, the proposed AE outperforms the existing analytical NOMA schemes. In addition, Lloyd-Max quantization achieves superior BER performance compared to uniform quantization. These results demonstrate that end-to-end AEs trained directly over Rayleigh fading can effectively learn robust, interference-aware signaling strategies, paving the way for NOMA deployment in fading environments with realistic CSI constraints.</description>

      <title>Fast Swap-Based Element Selection for Multiplication-Free Dimension Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a fast algorithm for element selection, a multiplication-free form of dimension reduction that produces a dimension-reduced vector by simply selecting a subset of elements from the input. Dimension reduction is a fundamental technique for reducing unnecessary model parameters, mitigating overfitting, and accelerating training and inference. A standard approach is principal component analysis (PCA), but PCA relies on matrix multiplications; on resource-constrained systems, the multiplication count itself can become a bottleneck. Element selection eliminates this cost because the reduction consists only of selecting elements, and thus the key challenge is to determine which elements should be retained. We evaluate a candidate subset through the minimum mean-squared error of linear regression that predicts a target vector from the selected elements, where the target may be, for example, a one-hot label vector in classification. When an explicit target is unavailable, the input itself can be used as the target, yielding a reconstruction-based criterion. The resulting optimization is combinatorial, and exhaustive search is impractical. To address this, we derive an efficient formula for the objective change caused by swapping a selected and an unselected element, using the matrix inversion lemma, and we perform a swap-based local search that repeatedly applies objective-decreasing swaps until no further improvement is possible. Experiments on MNIST handwritten-digit images demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Space Generative AI Pipeline for Semantic Transmission of Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Discernment, a semantic communication system that transmits the meaning of physical signals (baseband radio and audio) over a technical channel using GenAI models operating in discrete spaces. Discernment dynamically adapts to channel impairments - modeled as erasure channels - by switching between an autoregressive or a diffusion-based generative algorithm, depending on the erasure pattern. Our results show that Discernment maintains semantic integrity even as channel capacity severely degrades, exhibiting very small and graceful performance decline in both classification accuracy and statistical fidelity of the reconstructed meaning. These findings demonstrate Discernment's ability to adjust to diverse physical channel conditions while maintaining spectral efficiency and low model complexity, making it well suited for IoT deployments and strongly motivating further research on this semantic channel paradigm.</description>

      <title>Optimized Certainty Equivalent Risk-Controlling Prediction Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In safety-critical applications such as medical image segmentation, prediction systems must provide reliability guarantees that extend beyond conventional expected loss control. While risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) offer probabilistic guarantees on the expected risk, they fail to capture tail behavior and worst-case scenarios that are crucial in high-stakes settings. This paper introduces optimized certainty equivalent RCPS (OCE-RCPS), a novel framework that provides high-probability guarantees on general optimized certainty equivalent (OCE) risk measures, including conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) and entropic risk. OCE-RCPS leverages upper confidence bounds to identify prediction set parameters that satisfy user-specified risk tolerance levels with provable reliability. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that OCE-RCPS satisfies the desired probabilistic constraint for loss functions such as miscoverage and false negative rate. Experiments on image segmentation demonstrate that OCE-RCPS consistently meets target satisfaction rates across various risk measures and reliability configurations, while OCE-CRC fails to provide probabilistic guarantees.</description>

      <title>A Deep Convolutional Network to Extract Real-Time Landmarks for UAV Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in satellite and communication technologies have significantly improved geographical information and monitoring systems. Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) technologies, which rely on electromagnetic signals transmitted from satellites and base stations, have long been utilized for geolocation applications. However, signal attenuation due to environmental conditions or intentional interference such as jamming may lead to severe degradation or complete loss of positioning capability. In such GNSS-denied environments, landmark extraction becomes critical for the navigation of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used in monitoring applications. By processing images captured from onboard UAV cameras, reliable visual landmarks can be identified to enable navigation without GNSS support. In this study, a convolution-based deep learning approach is proposed for the extraction of appropriate landmarks, and its effectiveness is examined.</description>

      <title>sleep2vec: Unified Cross-Modal Alignment for Heterogeneous Nocturnal Biosignals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tasks ranging from sleep staging to clinical diagnosis traditionally rely on standard polysomnography (PSG) devices, bedside monitors and wearable devices, which capture diverse nocturnal biosignals (e.g., EEG, EOG, ECG, SpO$_2$). However, heterogeneity across devices and frequent sensor dropout pose significant challenges for unified modelling of these multimodal signals. We present \texttt{sleep2vec}, a foundation model for diverse and incomplete nocturnal biosignals that learns a shared representation via cross-modal alignment. \texttt{sleep2vec} is contrastively pre-trained on 42,249 overnight recordings spanning nine modalities using a \textit{Demography, Age, Site \&amp; History-aware InfoNCE} objective that incorporates physiological and acquisition metadata (\textit{e.g.}, age, gender, recording site) to dynamically weight negatives and mitigate cohort-specific shortcuts. On downstream sleep staging and clinical outcome assessment, \texttt{sleep2vec} consistently outperforms strong baselines and remains robust to any subset of available modalities and sensor dropout. We further characterize, to our knowledge for the first time, scaling laws for nocturnal biosignals with respect to modality diversity and model capacity. Together, these results show that unified cross-modal alignment, coupled with principled scaling, enables label-efficient, general-purpose modelling of real-world nocturnal biosignals.</description>

      <title>Wideband Quantum Transduction for Rydberg Atomic Receivers Using Six-Wave Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic receivers hold extremely high sensitivity to electric fields, yet their effective 3-dB baseband bandwidth under conventional electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) is typically constrained to tens to a few hundreds of kilohertz, which hinders wideband wireless applications. To relax this bottleneck, we investigate a six-wave mixing (SWM)-based Rydberg atomic receiver as a wideband radio frequency (RF)-to-optical quantum transducer. Specifically, we develop an explicit baseband input-output model spanning from the probe input to the output light field. Based upon this model, a closed-form 3-dB bandwidth expression is derived to expose its dependence on key optical and RF parameters. We further quantify the linear dynamic range by employing the 1-dB compression point (P1dB) and the input-referred third-order intercept point (IIP3), unveiling a communication-compatible characterization of the bandwidth-linearity trade-off. Finally, our numerical results demonstrate that, given identical optical driving conditions, the SWM configuration increases the 3-dB baseband bandwidth by more than an order of magnitude compared to the EIT-based counterpart, while retaining comparable electric-field sensitivity and revealing a broad, tunable linear operating region.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Federated Learning With Energy Harvesting Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized federated learning (DFL) enables edge devices to collaboratively train models through local training and fully decentralized device-to-device (D2D) model exchanges. However, these energy-intensive operations often rapidly deplete limited device batteries, reducing their operational lifetime and degrading the learning performance. To address this limitation, we apply energy harvesting technique to DFL systems, allowing edge devices to extract ambient energy and operate sustainably. We first derive the convergence bound for wireless DFL with energy harvesting, showing that the convergence is influenced by partial device participation and transmission packet drops, both of which further depend on the available energy supply. To accelerate convergence, we formulate a joint device scheduling and power control problem and model it as a multi-agent Markov decision process (MDP). Traditional MDP algorithms (e.g., value or policy iteration) require a centralized coordinator with access to all device states and exhibit exponential complexity in the number of devices, making them impractical for large-scale decentralized networks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a fully decentralized policy iteration algorithm that leverages only local state information from two-hop neighboring devices, thereby substantially reducing both communication overhead and computational complexity. We further provide a theoretical analysis showing that the proposed decentralized algorithm achieves asymptotic optimality. Finally, comprehensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets are conducted to validate the theoretical results and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional Quantum Processor Interfacing by a 4-Kelvin Analog Signal Chain for Superconducting Qubit Control and Quantum State Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive cryogenic analog signal processing architecture designed for superconducting qubit control and quantum state readout operating at 4 Kelvin. The proposed system implements a complete bidirectional signal path bridging room-temperature digital controllers with quantum processors at millikelvin stages. The control path incorporates a Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) for stable local oscillator generation, In-phase/Quadrature (I/Q) modulation for precise qubit gate operations, and a cryogenic power amplifier for signal conditioning. The readout path features a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) with 14 dB gain and 8-Phase Shift Keying (8-PSK) demodulation for quantum state discrimination. All circuit blocks are designed and validated through SPICE simulations employing cryogenic MOSFET models at 180nm that account for carrier freeze-out, threshold voltage elevation, and enhanced mobility at 4 K. Simulation results demonstrate successful end-to-end signal integrity with I/Q phase error below 2{\deg}, image rejection ratio exceeding 35~dB, and symbol error rate below $10^{-6}$. This work provides a modular, simulation-validated framework for scalable cryogenic quantum control systems.</description>

      <title>Learnable Multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transforms for 3D Gaussian Splatting Frequency Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful approach for novel view synthesis. However, the number of Gaussian primitives often grows substantially during training as finer scene details are reconstructed, leading to increased memory and storage costs. Recent coarse-to-fine strategies regulate Gaussian growth by modulating the frequency content of the ground-truth images. In particular, AutoOpti3DGS employs the learnable Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enable data-adaptive frequency modulation. Nevertheless, its modulation depth is limited by the 1-level DWT, and jointly optimizing wavelet regularization with 3D reconstruction introduces gradient competition that promotes excessive Gaussian densification. In this paper, we propose a multi-level DWT-based frequency modulation framework for 3DGS. By recursively decomposing the low-frequency subband, we construct a deeper curriculum that provides progressively coarser supervision during early training, consistently reducing Gaussian counts. Furthermore, we show that the modulation can be performed using only a single scaling parameter, rather than learning the full 2-tap high-pass filter. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method further reduces Gaussian counts while maintaining competitive rendering quality.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficient Over-the-Air Federated Learning via Pinching Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pinching antennas systems (PASSs) have recently been proposed as a novel flexible-antenna technology. These systems are implemented by attaching low-cost pinching elements to dielectric waveguides. As the direct link is bypassed through waveguides, PASSs can effectively compensate large-scale effects of the wireless channel. This work explores the potential gains of employing PASSs for over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL). For a PASS-assisted server, we develop a low-complexity algorithmic approach, which jointly tunes the PASS parameters and schedules the mobile devices for minimal energy consumption in OTA-FL. We study the efficiency of the proposed design and compare it against the conventional OTA-FL setting with MIMO server. Numerical experiments demonstrate that using a single-waveguide PASS at the server within a moderately sized area, the required energy for model aggregation is drastically reduced as compared to the case with fully-digital MIMO server. This introduces PASS as a potential technology for energy-efficient distributed learning in next generations of wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Increasing ultrasound field-of-view with reduced element count arrays containing large elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several applications of medical ultrasound can benefit from a larger imaging field of view (FOV). This study is aimed at increasing the FOV of linear array probes by increasing the element size rather than the element count. To investigate larger FOV, this study used coupled elements to imitate a larger element size. The effects of coupling on array beam patterns are examined with Fourier transforms of elements. The effects of coupling on resolution, contrast, and speckle signal-to-noise ratio are examined through phantom images and in-vivo images of a rabbit tumor reconstructed with plane-wave compounding. Furthermore, a positioning system was used to acquire data from a virtual large aperture with 120 mm FOV and 128 elements, collected in sections with a single probe. This study also investigates the Null Subtraction Imaging (NSI), Sign Coherence Factor (SCF), and Minimum Variance (MV) beamformers for regaining resolution lost by an increased F-number with large elements. The MV beamformer, while the most computationally expensive, was best for improving resolution without increasing speckle variance, decreasing Full-Width at Half-Max (FWHM) estimates of wire targets from 0.78 mm with DAS on a 2.5 wavelength element size to 0.54 mm with MV on a 5 wavelength element size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a parameter-minimal neural architecture for solving differential equations by restricting the hypothesis class to Horner-factorized polynomials, yielding an implicit, differentiable trial solution with only a small set of learnable coefficients. Initial conditions are enforced exactly by construction by fixing the low-order polynomial degrees of freedom, so training focuses solely on matching the differential-equation residual at collocation points. To reduce approximation error without abandoning the low-parameter regime, we introduce a piecewise ("spline-like") extension that trains multiple small Horner models on subintervals while enforcing continuity (and first-derivative continuity) at segment boundaries. On illustrative ODE benchmarks and a heat-equation example, Horner networks with tens (or fewer) parameters accurately match the solution and its derivatives and outperform small MLP and sinusoidal-representation baselines under the same training settings, demonstrating a practical accuracy-parameter trade-off for resource-efficient scientific modeling.</description>

      <title>On Convergence Analysis of Network-GIANT: An approximate Hessian-based fully distributed optimization algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a detailed convergence analysis of a recently developed approximate Newton-type fully distributed optimization method for smooth, strongly convex local loss functions, called Network-GIANT, which has been empirically illustrated to show faster linear convergence properties while having the same communication complexity (per iteration) as its first order distributed counterparts. By using consensus based parameter updates, and a local Hessian based descent direction at the individual nodes with gradient tracking, we first explicitly characterize a global linear convergence rate for Network-GIANT, which can be computed as the spectral radius of a $3 \times 3$ matrix dependent on the Lipschitz continuity ($L$) and strong convexity ($\mu$) parameters of the objective functions, and the spectral norm ($\sigma$) of the underlying undirected graph represented by a doubly stochastic consensus matrix. We provide an explicit bound on the step size parameter $\eta$, below which this spectral radius is guaranteed to be less than $1$. Furthermore, we derive a mixed linear-quadratic inequality based upper bound for the optimality gap norm, which allows us to conclude that, under small step size values, asymptotically, as the algorithm approaches the global optimum, it achieves a locally linear convergence rate of $1-\eta(1 -\frac{\gamma}{\mu})$ for Network-GIANT, provided the Hessian approximation error $\gamma$ (between the harmonic mean of the local Hessians and the global hessian (the arithmetic mean of the local Hessians) is smaller than $\mu$. This asymptotically linear convergence rate of $\approx 1-\eta$ explains the faster convergence rate of Network-GIANT for the first time. Numerical experiments are carried out with a reduced CovType dataset for binary logistic regression over a variety of graphs to illustrate the above theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Properties of Near Field Focusing for Cylindrical Dipole Arrays in Enclosed Array Volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by large intelligent surface applications, the electric field properties of near field focusing using phase conjugation method are analyzed for cylindrical dipole arrays. Firstly, for the transmitting antennas featuring vertical polarization, the polarization characteristic is decomposed along the x, y, and z directions. Three typical cases are studied when the focal points are at (xf , 0, 0), (0, yf , 0), and (0, 0, zf ). When the length of the cylindrical dipole array is significantly larger compared to its radius, certain unique insights emerge. When the focal point is positioned along (0, 0, zf ), apart from the region on both sides, the ratio between Ez and Ex/Ey remains {\pi}/2. Additionally, When the focal point is located within the cylinder, the electric field of each polarization is approximately the same everywhere. In other words, beam focusing does not incur losses due to different positions. The focusing resolution of Ez is the same in the transverse and longitudinal directions. Different from the situation where the 3 - dB focal beam depth is much smaller than the focal beam width for the most of arrays, the resolution in the longitudinal can be improved, respectively. Through a comprehensive grasp of these design principles, we can gain a deeper understanding of the specific areas with significant potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Physical-Layer Authentication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven Physical-Layer Authentication (PLA), which focuses on achieving endogenous security and intelligent identity authentication, has attracted considerable interest. When compared with Discriminative AI (DAI), Generative AI (GAI) offers several advantages, such as fingerprint augmentation, reconstruction, and denoising. Inspired by these innovations, this paper provides a systematic exploration of GAI's integration with PLA. We commence with a concise review of identity authentication techniques and GAI models. Then, we contrast the limitations of DAI with the potential of GAI in addressing PLA challenges. Specifically, we introduce a structured taxonomy for GAI-enhanced PLA methodologies, encompassing three key stages: fingerprint collection, model training, and performance optimization within the PLA pipeline. Furthermore, we propose a novel PLA framework based on GAI and channel extrapolation for dynamic environments. To demonstrate GAI's efficacy in enhancing PLA robustness, we implement a case study using the Generative Diffusion Model (GDM). Finally, we outline potential future research directions for GAI-based PLA.</description>

      <title>Matched Filtering-Based Channel Estimation for AFDM Systems in Doubly Selective Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09268v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) has recently emerged as an excellent backward-compatible 6G waveform. In this paper, we study matched filtering (MF) assisted channel estimation (CE) for AFDM systems in complex doubly selective channels. By deriving the complete input-output relationship of the continuous-time signal, the inter-chirp-carrier interference, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), and the effective SINR loss of AFDM, are investigated in discrete affine Fourier transform (DAFT) domain. Further, we propose two low-complexity methods for constructing the channel matrix by taking advantage of its inherent discrete Fourier transform structure and the staircase structure of the piecewise functions in the channel matrix, respectively. It is shown that complexity reduction by at least two orders of magnitude can be achieved for a large number of chirp subcarriers. For the CE problem in doubly selective channels, we introduce an MF assisted CE scheme. This allows us to sequentially estimate the parameters of each path by exploiting the separability and approximate orthogonality of different paths in the DAFT domain, thus leading to significantly reduced complexity. Furthermore, based on generalized Fibonacci search (GFS), an MF-GFS scheme is proposed to avoid significantly redundant computation, which can be extended to typical wide-band systems. Extensive simulation results indicate that the proposed schemes offer superior advantages in terms of their improved communication performance and lower complexity.</description>

      <title>DMA-Aided MU-MISO Systems for Power Splitting SWIPT via Lorentzian-Constrained Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an optimal power splitting and beamforming design for co-located simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) users in Dynamic Metasurface Antenna (DMA)-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. The objective is to minimize transmit power while meeting users signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and energy harvesting (EH) requirements. The problem is solved via an alternating optimization framework based on semidefinite programming (SDP), where metasurface tunability follows Lorentzian-constrained holography (LCH). In contrast to traditional beamforming architectures, DMA-assisted architectures reduce the need for RF chains and phase shifters but require optimization under the Lorentzian constraint limiting the amplitude and phase optimizations. Hence, the proposed method integrates several LCH schemes, including the recently proposed adaptive-radius LCH (ARLCH), and evaluates nonlinear EH models and circuit noise effects. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly reduces transmit power compared with baseline methods, highlighting the efficiency of ARLCH and optimal power splitting in DMA-assisted SWIPT systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic and Static Energy Efficient Design of Pinching Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the energy efficiency of pinching-antenna systems (PASSs) by developing a consistent formulation for power distribution in these systems. The per-antenna power distribution in PASSs is not controlled explicitly by a power allocation policy, but rather implicitly through tuning of pinching couplings and locations. Both these factors are tunable: (i) pinching locations are tuned using movable elements, and (ii) couplings can be tuned by varying the effective coupling length of the pinching elements. While the former is feasible to be addressed dynamically in settings with low user mobility, the latter cannot be addressed at a high rate. We thus develop a class of hybrid dynamic-static algorithms, which maximize the energy efficiency by updating the system parameters at different rates. Our experimental results depict that dynamic tuning of pinching locations can significantly boost energy efficiency of PASSs.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Bounds on Parallel Imaging Implicit Data Crimes in an MRI Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) diagnoses and manages a wide range of diseases, yet long scan times drive high costs and limit accessibility. AI methods have demonstrated substantial potential for reducing scan times, but despite rapid progress, clinical translation of AI often fails. One particular class of failure modes, referred to as implicit data crimes, are a result of hidden biases introduced when MRI datasets incompletely model the MRI physics of the acquisition. Previous work identified data crimes resulting from algorithmic completion of k-space with parallel imaging and drew on simulation to demonstrate the resulting downstream biases. This work proposes a mathematical framework to re-characterize the problem as one of error reduction during interpolation between sets of evaluation coordinates. We establish a generalized matrix-based definition of the reconstruction error upper bound as a function of the input sampling pattern. Experiments on relevant sampling pattern structures demonstrate the relevance of the framework and suggest future directions for analysis of data crimes.</description>

      <title>Teager-Kaiser Energy Methods For EEG Feature Extraction In Biomedical Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals are inherently non-linear, non-stationary, and vulnerable to noise sources, making the extraction of discriminative features a long-standing challenge. In this work, we investigate the non-linear Teager-Kaiser Energy Operator (TKEO) for modeling the underlying energy dynamics of EEG in three representative tasks: motor imagery, emotion recognition, and epilepsy detection. To accommodate the narrowband nature of the operator, we employ Gabor filterbanks to isolate canonical frequency bands, followed by the Energy Separation Algorithm to decompose the TKEO output into amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency components. We then derive a set of energy descriptors based on this demodulation and compare their classification performance against established EEG features. The proposed TKEO-based pipeline offers an intuitive, physiologically grounded framework for capturing EEG signal dynamics, while remaining simple, training-free, and data-efficient. Our findings suggest that combining TKEO features with conventional ones improves Balanced Accuracy by approximately 15 percent in epilepsy detection, yields modest gains in motor imagery, and achieves on par performance in emotion recognition, reflecting the pipeline's ability to capture transient neural dynamics.</description>

      <title>RadarFuseNet: Complex-Valued Cross-Attention Fusion of Time-Frequency IQ Radar Features for Robust Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar has emerged as a compact and powerful sensing modality for advanced perception tasks that leverage machine learning. It is particularly effective in scenarios where vision-based sensors fail to capture reliable information, such as detecting occluded objects or distinguishing between different surface materials in indoor environments. Due to the nonlinear characteristics of mmWave radar signals, deep learning-based methods are well suited for extracting relevant information from in-phase and quadrature (IQ) data. However, the current state of the art in IQ signal-based occluded-object and material classification still offers substantial potential for further improvement. In this paper, we propose a bidirectional cross-attention fusion network that combines IQ signal and FFT-transformed radar features obtained by distinct complex-valued convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In our experiments, we achieve a material classification accuracy of 99.92% on samples collected at the same sensor distances used during training, and an accuracy of 65.56% on samples measured at previously unseen distances, demonstrating improved generalization across varying measurement conditions. Furthermore, our approach improves occluded object classification to 94.20%, outperforming all comparison and ablation models and underscoring the benefit of the proposed fusion strategy.</description>

      <title>Physics-Aware RIS Codebook Compilation for Near-Field Beam Focusing under Mutual Coupling and Specular Reflections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks are envisioned to achieve reliable, low-latency connectivity within environments characterized by strong multipath and severe channel variability. Programmable wireless environments (PWEs) address this challenge by enabling deterministic control of electromagnetic (EM) propagation through software-defined reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). However, effectively configuring RISs in real time remains a major bottleneck, particularly under near-field conditions where mutual coupling and specular reflections alter the intended response. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces MATCH, a physics-based codebook compilation algorithm that explicitly accounts for the EM coupling among RIS unit cells and the reflective interactions with surrounding structures, ensuring that the resulting codebooks remain consistent with the physical characteristics of the environment. Finally, MATCH is evaluated under a full-wave simulation framework incorporating mutual coupling and secondary reflections, demonstrating its ability to concentrate scattered energy within the focal region, confirming that physics-consistent, codebook-based optimization constitutes an effective approach for practical and efficient RIS configuration.</description>

      <title>Seeing Radio: From Zero RF Priors to Explainable Modulation Recognition with Vision Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current RF machine-learning pipelines rely on task-specific deep networks for modulation classification and related tasks, but these models require custom architectures and labeled datasets for each problem, generalize poorly across channel conditions and SNRs, and offer little interpretability. In contrast, modern multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can integrate heterogeneous visual and textual data and exhibit strong cross-domain generalization and explanation capabilities. Our goal in this work is to explore whether vision-language models (VLMs) can be adapted to directly perceive RF signals and reason about modulation patterns without redesigning their architectures or injecting RF-specific inductive biases. To achieve this, we convert complex IQ streams into time-series, spectrogram, and joint RF visualizations, build a 57-class RF visual question answering benchmark, and show that lightweight parameter-efficient fine-tuning can enhance the accuracy of a general-purpose VLM from around 10% to nearly 90%, while ensuring robustness to noise and out-of-vocabulary modulations and the ability to produce human-readable rationales. The obtained results show that combining RF-to-image conversion with promptable VLMs provides a scalable and practical foundation for RF-aware AI systems in future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Fuzzing for Vulnerability Assessment of 5G Traffic Steering Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traffic Steering (TS) dynamically allocates user traffic across cells to enhance Quality of Experience (QoE), load balance, and spectrum efficiency in 5G networks. However, TS algorithms remain vulnerable to adversarial conditions such as interference spikes, handover storms, and localized outages. To address this, an AI-driven fuzz testing framework based on the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) is proposed to systematically expose hidden vulnerabilities. Using NVIDIA Sionna, five TS algorithms are evaluated across six scenarios. Results show that AI-driven fuzzing detects 34.2% more total vulnerabilities and 5.8% more critical failures than traditional testing, achieving superior diversity and edge-case discovery. The observed variance in critical failure detection underscores the stochastic nature of rare vulnerabilities. These findings demonstrate that AI-driven fuzzing offers an effective and scalable validation approach for improving TS algorithm robustness and ensuring resilient 6G-ready networks.</description>

      <title>AFDM: Evolving OFDM Towards 6G+</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the standardization of sixth generation (6G) wireless systems accelerates, there is a growing consensus in favor of evolutionary waveforms that offer new features while maximizing compatibility with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), which underpins the 4G and 5G systems. This article presents affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) as a premier candidate for 6G, offering intrinsic robustness for both high-mobility communications and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in doubly dispersive channels, while maintaining a high degree of synergy with the legacy OFDM. To this end, we provide a comprehensive analysis of AFDM, starting with a generalized fractional-delay-fractional-Doppler (FDFD) channel model that accounts for practical pulse shaping filters and inter-sample coupling. We then detail the AFDM transceiver architecture, demonstrating that it reuses nearly the entire OFDM pipeline and requires only lightweight digital pre- and post-processing. We also analyze the impact of hardware impairments, such as phase noise and carrier frequency offset, and explore advanced functionalities enabled by the chirp-parameter domain, including index modulation and physical-layer security. By evaluating the reusability across the radio-frequency, physical, and higher layers, the article demonstrates that AFDM provides a low-risk, feature-rich, and efficient path toward achieving high-fidelity communications in the later versions of 6G and beyond (6G+).</description>

Abstract: This paper presents C-POD, a cloud-native framework that automates the deployment and management of edge pods for seamless remote access and sharing of wireless testbeds. C-POD leverages public cloud resources and edge pods to lower the barrier to over-the-air (OTA) experimentation, enabling researchers to share and access distributed testbeds without extensive local infrastructure. A supporting toolkit has been developed for C-POD to enable flexible and scalable experimental workflows, including containerized edge environments, persistent Secure Shell (SSH) tunnels, and stable graphical interfaces. We prototype and deploy C-POD on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) public cloud to demonstrate its key features, including cloud-assisted edge pod deployment automation, elastic computing resource management, and experiment observability, by integrating two wireless testbeds that focus on RF signal generation and 5G(B) communications, respectively.</description>

      <title>Continuous and Discrete-Time Filters: A Unified Operational Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Continuous time (CT) and discrete time (DT) linear time invariant (LTI) systems are commonly introduced through distinct mathematical formalisms, which can obscure their underlying dynamical equivalence. This tutorial presents a unified treatment of firstorder CT and DT systems, emphasizing their shared modal structure and stability properties. Beginning with transfer functions and pole zero representations in the Laplace domain, canonical first order low pass and high-pass dynamics are examined from an operational perspective. The discussion then transitions to discrete-time sequences and the Z transform, highlighting geometric sequences as eigenfunctions of DT systems and establishing the correspondence between the left half of the s plane and the interior of the unit circle in the z plane. Practical discretization and sampled data implementations are analyzed to illustrate how continuous time dynamics are reinterpreted through recursion and accumulation in discrete time realizations. By maintaining structural symmetry between domains, the manuscript consolidates established concepts into a coherent framework linking mathematical representation, physical realizability, and implementation.</description>

Abstract: The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has emerged as a mainstream generative model in generative AI. While sharp convergence guarantees have been established for the DDPM, the iteration complexity is, in general, proportional to the ambient data dimension, resulting in overly conservative theory that fails to explain its practical efficiency. This has motivated the recent work Li and Yan (2024a) to investigate how the DDPM can achieve sampling speed-ups through automatic exploitation of intrinsic low dimensionality of data. We strengthen this line of work by demonstrating, in some sense, optimal adaptivity to unknown low dimensionality. For a broad class of data distributions with intrinsic dimension $k$, we prove that the iteration complexity of the DDPM scales nearly linearly with $k$, which is optimal when using KL divergence to measure distributional discrepancy. Notably, our work is closely aligned with the independent concurrent work Potaptchik et al. (2024) -- posted two weeks prior to ours -- in establishing nearly linear-$k$ convergence guarantees for the DDPM.</description>

      <title>Regularized Top-$k$: A Bayesian Framework for Gradient Sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Error accumulation is effective for gradient sparsification in distributed settings: initially-unselected gradient entries are eventually selected as their accumulated error exceeds a certain level. The accumulation essentially behaves as a scaling of the learning rate for the selected entries. Although this property prevents the slow-down of lateral movements in distributed gradient descent, it can deteriorate convergence in some settings. This work proposes a novel sparsification scheme that controls the learning rate scaling of error accumulation. The development of this scheme follows two major steps: first, gradient sparsification is formulated as an inverse probability (inference) problem, and the Bayesian optimal sparsification mask is derived as a maximum-a-posteriori estimator. Using the prior distribution inherited from Top-k, we derive a new sparsification algorithm which can be interpreted as a regularized form of Top-k. We call this algorithm regularized Top-k (RegTop-k). It utilizes past aggregated gradients to evaluate posterior statistics of the next aggregation. It then prioritizes the local accumulated gradient entries based on these posterior statistics. We validate our derivation through various numerical experiments. In distributed linear regression, it is observed that while Top-k remains at a fixed distance from the global optimum, RegTop-k converges to the global optimum at significantly higher compression ratios. We further demonstrate the generalization of this observation by employing RegTop-k in distributed training of ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10, as well as fine-tuning of multiple computer vision models on the ImageNette dataset. Our numerical results confirm that as the compression ratio increases, RegTop-k sparsification noticeably outperforms Top-k.</description>

      <title>Wireless Communication for Low-Altitude Economy with UAV Swarm Enabled Two-Level Movable Antenna System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is regarded as a key enabling platform for low-altitude economy, due to its advantages such as 3D maneuverability, flexible deployment, and LoS air-to-air/ground communication links. In particular, the intrinsic high mobility renders UAV especially suitable for operating as a movable antenna (MA) from the sky. In this paper, by exploiting the flexible mobility of UAV swarm and antenna position adjustment of MA, we propose a novel UAV swarm enabled two-level MA system, where UAVs not only individually deploy a local MA array, but also form a larger-scale MA system with their individual MA arrays via swarm coordination. We formulate a general optimization problem to maximize the minimum achievable rate over all ground user equipments (UEs), by jointly optimizing the 3D UAV swarm placement positions, their individual MAs' positions, and receive beamforming for different UEs. To gain useful insights, we first consider the special case where each UAV has only one antenna, under different scenarios of one single UE, two UEs, and arbitrary number of UEs. In particular, for the two-UE case, we derive the optimal UAV swarm placement positions in closed-form that achieves IUI-free communication when the uniform plane wave (UPW) model holds, where the UAV swarm forms a uniform sparse array (USA) satisfying minimum safe distance constraint. While for the general case with arbitrary number of UEs, we propose an efficient alternating optimization algorithm to solve the formulated non-convex optimization problem. Then, we extend the results to the case where each UAV is equipped with multiple antennas. Numerical results verify that the proposed low-altitude UAV swarm enabled MA system significantly outperforms various benchmark schemes, thanks to the exploitation of two-level mobility to create more favorable channel conditions for multi-UE communications.</description>

      <title>On the Convergence of Decentralized Stochastic Gradient-Tracking with Finite-Time Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithms for decentralized optimization and learning rely on local optimization steps coupled with combination steps over a graph. Recent works have demonstrated that using a time-varying sequence of matrices that achieves finite-time consensus can improve the communication and iteration complexity of decentralized optimization algorithms based on gradient tracking. In practice, a sequence of matrices satisfying the exact finite-time consensus property may not be available due to imperfect knowledge of the network topology, a limit on the length of the sequence, or numerical instabilities. In this work, we quantify the impact of approximate finite-time consensus sequences on the convergence of a gradient-tracking based decentralized optimization algorithm. Our results hold for any periodic sequence of combination matrices. We clarify the interplay between approximation error of the finite-time consensus sequence and the length of the sequence as well as typical problem parameters such as smoothness and gradient noise.</description>

      <title>Synchro-Thermography: Monitoring ~10 mK Facial Temperature Changes with Heartbeat Referencing for Physiological Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04748v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Infrared thermography has gained interest as a tool for non-contact measurement of blood circulation and skin blood flow due to cardiac activity. Partiularly, blood vessels on the surface, such as on the back of the hand, are suited for visualization. However, standardized methodologies have not yet been established for areas such as the face and neck, where many blood vessels are lie deeper beneath the surface, and external stimulation for measurement could be harmful. Here we propose Synchro-Thermography for stable monitoring of facial temperature changes associated with heart rate variability. We conducted experiments with eight subjects and measured minute temperature changes with an amplitude of about \SI{10}{mK} on the forehead and chin. The proposed method improves the temperature resolution by a factor of 2 or more, and can stably measure skin temperature changes caused by blood flow. This skin temperature change could be applied to physiological sensing such as blood flow changes due to injury or disease, or as an indicator of stress.</description>

      <title>A Disentangled Representation Learning Framework for Low-altitude Network Coverage Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The expansion of the low-altitude economy has underscored the significance of Low-Altitude Network Coverage (LANC) prediction for designing aerial corridors. While accurate LANC forecasting hinges on the antenna beam patterns of Base Stations (BSs), these patterns are typically proprietary and not readily accessible. Operational parameters of BSs, which inherently contain beam information, offer an opportunity for data-driven low-altitude coverage prediction. However, collecting extensive low-altitude road test data is cost-prohibitive, often yielding only sparse samples per BS. This scarcity results in two primary challenges: imbalanced feature sampling due to limited variability in high-dimensional operational parameters against the backdrop of substantial changes in low-dimensional sampling locations, and diminished generalizability stemming from insufficient data samples. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce a dual strategy comprising expert knowledge-based feature compression and disentangled representation learning. The former reduces feature space complexity by leveraging communications expertise, while the latter enhances model generalizability through the integration of propagation models and distinct subnetworks that capture and aggregate the semantic representations of latent features. Experimental evaluation confirms the efficacy of our framework, yielding a 7% reduction in error compared to the best baseline algorithm. Real-network validations further attest to its reliability, achieving practical prediction accuracy with MAE errors at the 5dB level.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Domain Characterization of Load Demand from Electrified Highways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrified roadways (ER) equipped with dynamic wireless power transfer (DWPT) capabilities can patently extend the driving range and reduce the battery size of electric vehicles (EVs). However, due to the spatial arrangement of the transmitter coils in the ER, the DWPT load exhibits frequency content that could excite power system frequency dynamics. In this context, this work aims to study the spectrum of DWPT loads under different traffic conditions. Under simplifying assumptions, we develop statistical models to identify the location and relative magnitude of DWPT load harmonics. Our analysis reveals that the fundamental frequency depends on ER coil spacing and average EV speed. In the worst-case yet unlikely scenario that EVs move in a synchronized fashion, the amplitude of harmonics scales with the EV count. On the contrary, when EVs move freely, harmonics scale with the square root of the EV count. Platoon formations can accentuate harmonics. The spectral content around harmonics decreases in magnitude and increases in bandwidth with the harmonic index. The load of a single EV moving at a time-varying speed can be modeled as a frequency-modulated (FM) signal. Despite the simplifying assumptions, the derived models offer valuable insights for ER planners and grid operators. Dynamic simulations of a modified WECC model with DWPT loads synthesized from realistic EV trajectories and ER specifications corroborate some of these insights.</description>

      <title>Graph-Aware Learning Rates for Decentralized Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an adaptive step-size rule for decentralized optimization. Choosing a step-size that balances convergence and stability is challenging. This is amplified in the decentralized setting as agents observe only local (possibly stochastic) gradients and global information (like smoothness) is unavailable. We derive a step-size rule from first principles. The resulting formulation reduces to the well-known Polyak's rule in the single-agent setting, and is suitable for use with stochastic gradients. The method is parameter free, apart from requiring the optimal objective value, which is readily available in many applications. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the performance is comparable to the optimally fine-tuned step-size.</description>

      <title>What Can Be Recovered Under Sparse Adversarial Corruption? Assumption-Free Theory for Linear Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ be an arbitrary, known matrix and $e$ a $q$-sparse adversarial vector. Given $y = A x^\star + e$ and $q$, we seek the smallest robust solution set containing $x^\star$ that is uniformly recoverable from $y$ without knowing $e$. While exact recovery of $x^\star$ via strong (and often impractical) structural assumptions on $A$ or $x^\star$ (e.g., restricted isometry, sparsity) is well studied, recoverability for arbitrary $A$ and $x^\star$ remains open. Our main result shows that the smallest robust solution set is $x^\star + \ker(U)$, where $U$ is the unique projection matrix onto the intersection of rowspaces of all possible submatrices of $A$ obtained by deleting $2q$ rows. Moreover, we prove that every $x$ that minimizes the $\ell_0$-norm of $y - A x$ lies in $x^\star + \ker(U)$, which then gives a constructive approach to recover this set.</description>

      <title>Age of Job Completion Minimization with Stable Queues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a time-slotted job-assignment system with a central server, N users and a machine which changes its state according to a Markov chain (hence called a Markov machine). The users submit their jobs to the central server according to a stochastic job arrival process. For each user, the server has a dedicated job queue. Upon receiving a job from a user, the server stores that job in the corresponding queue. When the machine is not working on a job assigned by the server, the machine can be either in internally busy or in free state, and the dynamics of these states follow a binary symmetric Markov chain. Upon sampling the state information of the machine, if the server identifies that the machine is in the free state, it schedules a user and submits a job to the machine from the job queue of the scheduled user. To maximize the number of jobs completed per unit time, we introduce a new metric, referred to as the age of job completion. To minimize the age of job completion and the sampling cost, we propose two policies and numerically evaluate their performance. For both of these policies, we find sufficient conditions under which the job queues will remain stable.</description>

      <title>String-Level Ground Fault Localization for TN-Earthed Three-Phase Photovoltaic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The DC-side ground fault (GF) poses significant risks to three-phase TN-earthed photovoltaic (PV) systems, as the resulting high fault current can directly damage both PV inverters and PV modules. Once a fault occurs, locating the faulty string through manual string-by-string inspection is highly time-consuming and inefficient. This work presents a comprehensive analysis of GF characteristics through fault-current analysis and a simulation-based case study covering multiple fault locations. Building on these insights, we propose an edge-AI-based GF localization approach tailored for three-phase TN-earthed PV systems. A PLECS-based simulation model that incorporates PV hysteresis effects is developed to generate diverse GF scenarios, from which correlation-based features are extracted throughout the inverter's four-stage shutdown sequence. Using the simulated dataset, a lightweight Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB)-based localization model is designed and trained, achieving over 93% localization accuracy at typical sampling rates with low computational cost, demonstrating strong potential for deployment on resource-constrained PV inverters.</description>
