      <title>Dew harvesting grass: role of epicuticular wax in regulating condensation dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identification and characterization of natural dew collecting models is instrumental for the inspiration, design and development of engineered dew harvesting systems. Short low growing grass is one of the most ubiquitous and proficient examples of natural dew harvesting, owing to its large surface area, small thermal capacity, structured rough surface and proximity to ground level. Here, we provide a closer look at the formation, growth, and dynamics of microscale dew droplets on the surface of wheatgrass leaves, investigating the role of epicuticular wax. The wheatgrass leaf exhibits biphilic properties emerging from the hydrophilic lamina covered by hydrophobic wax microsculptures. As a result, the regulation of the dew formation and condensation dynamics is largely governed by the arrangement and density of epicuticular wax micromorphologies. At moderate subcooling levels (4-10 $^{\circ}$C below the dew point), we observe drop-wise condensation on the superhydrophobic adaxial side, while significant flooding and film condensation usually appear on abaxial surfaces with lower wax coverage. On the adaxial side of the leaves, the fairly uniform coverage of the hydrophobic epicuticular wax crystals on the hydrophilic background promotes drop-wise condensation nucleation while facilitating droplet mobility. Frequent coalescence of multiple droplets of 5 - 20 ${\mu}$m diameter results in self-propelled departure events, creating free potential sites for new nucleation. The findings of this study advance our understanding of dew formation on natural surfaces while providing inspiration and guidance for the development of sustainable functional microstructured coatings for various drop-wise condensation applications.</description>

      <title>Towards scientific machine learning for granular material simulations -- challenges and opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Micro-scale mechanisms, such as inter-particle and particle-fluid interactions, govern the behaviour of granular systems. While particle-scale simulations provide detailed insights into these interactions, their computational cost is often prohibitive. Attended by researchers from both the granular materials (GM) and machine learning (ML) communities, a recent Lorentz Center Workshop on "Machine Learning for Discrete Granular Media" brought the ML community up to date with GM challenges.
  This position paper emerged from the workshop discussions. We define granular materials and identify seven key challenges that characterise their distinctive behaviour across various scales and regimes, ranging from gas-like to fluid-like and solid-like. Addressing these challenges is essential for developing robust and efficient digital twins for granular systems in various industrial applications. To showcase the potential of ML to the GM community, we present classical and emerging machine/deep learning techniques that have been, or could be, applied to granular materials. We reviewed sequence-based learning models for path-dependent constitutive behaviour, followed by encoder-decoder type models for representing high-dimensional data. We then explore graph neural networks and recent advances in neural operator learning. Lastly, we discuss model-order reduction and probabilistic learning techniques for high-dimensional parameterised systems, which are crucial for quantifying uncertainties arising from physics-based and data-driven models.
  We present a workflow aimed at unifying data structures and modelling pipelines and guiding readers through the selection, training, and deployment of ML surrogates for granular material simulations. Finally, we illustrate the workflow's practical use with two representative examples, focusing on granular materials in solid-like and fluid-like regimes.</description>

      <title>Anomalous interference drives oscillatory dynamics in wave-dressed active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent surge of discoveries has sparked significant interest in active systems where a particle moves autonomously due to a resonant interaction with its self-generated wave field, leading to notable wave-mediated effects including new propulsion mechanisms, spontaneous oscillatory dynamics, and quantum-like phenomena. Drawing from an archetypical model of wave-dressed active particles, we unveil a wave-mediated non-local force driving their dynamics, arising from the particle's path memory and an unconventional form of wave interference near jerking points, locations where the particle's velocity changes rapidly. In contrast to the typical case of constructive interference at points of stationary phase, waves excited by the particle near jerking points avoid cancellation through rapid changes in frequency. Through an asymptotic analysis, we derive the wave force from jerking points, revealing it as an elusive but crucial remnant of the particle's past motion that allows us to rationalize mechanistically in-line speed oscillations, wave-like statistics in potential wells, and non-specular reflections. The results we derive follow from generic wave superposition principles, suggesting their applicability to a broad class of wave-dressed active particles.</description>

      <title>Imbibition of Oil in Dry and Prewetted Calcite Nanopores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid imbibition into porous media featuring nanopores is ubiquitous in applications such as oil recovery from unconventional reservoirs and material processing. While the imbibition of pure fluids has been extensively studied, the imbibition of fluid mixture is little explored. Here we report the molecular dynamics study of the imbibition of model crude oil into nanometer-wide mineral pores, both when pore walls are dry and prewetted by a residual water film. Results show the fastest imbibition and quickest propagation of molecularly thin precursor films ahead of the oil meniscus in the dry pore system. The presence of a thin water film on pore walls corresponding to an environmental relative humidity of 30% slows down but still allows the spontaneous imbibition of single-component oil. Introducing polar components into the oil slows down the imbibition into dry nanopores, due partly to the clogging of the pore entrance. Strong selectivity toward nonpolar oil is evident. The slowdown of imbibition by polar oil is less significant in the prewetted pores than in dry pores, but the selectivity toward nonpolar oil remains strong.</description>

      <title>Banana DNA derivatives as homeotropic alignment layers in optical devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from bananas was extracted and functionalized and used for the first time as a homeotropic alignment layer for liquid crystals (LCs). Our research was aimed at extracting and investigating DNA from bananas via the synthesis and study of DNA complexes with various surfactants to examine the usefulness of such a complex as an alignment layer in electro-optical transducers. We proposed a simple and eco-friendly synthesis of the DNA complexes isolated from bananas with surfactants, so we transformed the DNA isolated from bananas into a functionalized alignment layer. A biopolymer alignment layer like deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from a banana complexed with a cationic surfactant is an excellent alternative to a commonly used but toxic polyimide alignment layer. DNA-based materials are promising for photonic applications and biosensors because of their excellent optical and physical properties, biodegradability, and low production cost. The novelty of the research lies in the potential use of these materials as biodegradable biopolymer alignment layers for optical devices instead of conventional polymers, which are usually harmful for the environment.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Classical Nucleation Theory for Cavitation Inception in the Presence of Gaseous Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces an enhanced Classical Nucleation Theory model to predict the cavitation inception pressure and to describe the behavior of nanoscale gaseous nuclei during cavitation. Validation is achieved through molecular dynamics simulations. The findings highlight the significant role of nanoscale gaseous nuclei in lowering the tensile strength required for cavitation initiation. The results show that our enhanced CNT model predicts lower cavitation pressures than the Blake threshold, closely matching molecular dynamics simulations. Finally, our results illustrate that differences between cavitation pressures using the Van der Waals and ideal gas models are greatest for smaller nuclei and lower temperatures.</description>

      <title>PolyConf: Unlocking Polymer Conformation Generation through Hierarchical Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polymer conformation generation is a critical task that enables atomic-level studies of diverse polymer materials. While significant advances have been made in designing various conformation generation methods for small molecules and proteins, these methods struggle to generate polymer conformations due to polymers' unique structural characteristics. The scarcity of polymer conformation datasets further limits progress, making this promising area largely unexplored. In this work, we propose PolyConf, a pioneering tailored polymer conformation generation method that leverages hierarchical generative models to unlock new possibilities for this task. Specifically, we decompose the polymer conformation into a series of local conformations (i.e., the conformations of its repeating units), generating these local conformations through an autoregressive model. We then generate corresponding orientation transformations via a diffusion model to assemble these local conformations into the complete polymer conformation. Moreover, we develop the first benchmark with a high-quality polymer conformation dataset derived from molecular dynamics simulations to boost related research in this area. The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that PolyConf consistently generates high-quality polymer conformations, facilitating advancements in polymer modeling and simulation.</description>

      <title>Breaking better: Imperfections increase fracture resistance in architected lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Architected materials offer unique opportunities to tailor fracture properties through local structural modifications. In this study, we investigate how the failure of architected materials with triangular lattice topology is affected by the removal of individual struts, which represent well-controlled and localized imperfections. Using a combination of macroscopic mechanical testing and digital image correlation (DIC), we analyze both global response and local crack propagation. We observe that the designed imperfections do not alter the failure initiation site nor the peak tensile load but significantly increase the work to failure. DIC-based tracking reveals that this increase correlates with deviations in the crack path and may also involve mechanisms such as crack bridging or temporary pinning near defects. These results demonstrate that small, well-characterized imperfections, when properly mastered, can be harnessed to improve failure resistance and expand the design space of architected materials beyond regular, periodic structures.</description>

      <title>Worm-like emulsion droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forming an interface between immiscible fluids incurs a free-energy cost that usually favors minimizing the interfacial area. An emulsion droplet of fixed volume therefore tends to form a sphere, and pairs of droplets tend to coalesce. Surfactant molecules adsorbed to the droplets' surfaces stabilize emulsions by providing a kinetic barrier to coalescence. Here, we show that the bound surfactants' osmotic pressure also competes with the droplet's intrinsic surface tension and can reverse the sign of the overall surface free energy. The onset of negative surface tension favors maximizing surface area and therefore favors elongation into a worm-like morphology. Analyzing this system in the Gibbs grand canonical ensemble reveals a phase transition between spherical and worm-like emulsions that is governed by the chemical potential of surfactant molecules in solution. Predictions based on this model agree with the observed behavior of an experimental model system composed of lipid-stabilized silicone oil droplets in an aqueous surfactant solution.</description>

      <title>Density-driven segregation of binary granular mixtures in a vertically vibrating drum the role of filling fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of filling fraction on segregation patterns of binary granular mixtures in a vertically vibrating drum through experiments and simulations. Glass and stainless steel spherical grains, which differ in mass density, are used to form density-driven segregation. The results reveal four segregation patterns, including the Brazil-nut-effect (BNE) segregation, counterclockwise two-eye-like segregation, dumpling-like segregation, and clockwise two-eye-like segregation. The theoretical analysis demonstrates that grains predominantly exhibit counterclockwise convection at low filling fractions, while clockwise convection dominates at high filling fractions. The competition between buoyancy and convection forces determines the final stable segregation pattern. These findings provide valuable insights into controlling segregation in granular systems, which is crucial for optimizing industrial processes in fields such as pharmaceuticals and chemical engineering.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Interactions between Nanoscale Domains in Correlated Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of nanoscale domains (NDs) in correlated liquids and the emerging collective magnetic properties have been suggested as key mechanisms governing ion transport under external magnetic fields (eMFs). However, the molecular-level understanding of these magnetic field-driven phenomena and the interaction between these domains remain elusive. To this end, we introduce a simplified model of a solvated nanoparticle (NP) that consists of localized magnetic domains at their surfaces to represent groups of paramagnetic ions, forming NDs, whose effective magnetic dipole moments are at least one order of magnitude greater than the individual ions. We use classical density functional theory (cDFT) to estimate the effective interactions between these localized magnetic NPs (LMNPs). Our findings indicate that, unlike individual ions, magnetic dipole interactions of NDs in the LMNP model can indeed compete with the electrostatic, van der Waals, and hydration interactions. Depending on the direction of eMF, the cDFT effective interactions between two LMNPs turn out to become more attractive or repulsive, which may play a critical role in ion separation and nucleation processes. This indicates that the cDFT interaction barrier heights can be significantly affected by the magnetic dipole interactions and the barrier heights tend to increase as the size of LMNPs increases.</description>

      <title>Activity drives self-assembly of passive soft inclusions in active nematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active nematics are out-of-equilibrium systems in which energy injection at the microscale drives emergent collective behaviors, from spontaneous flows to active turbulence. While the dynamics of these systems have been extensively studied, their potential for controlling the organization of embedded soft particles remains largely unexplored. Here, we investigate how passive droplets suspended in an active nematic fluid self-organize under varying activity levels and packing fractions. Through numerical simulations, we uncover a rich phase diagram featuring dynamic clustering, activity-induced gelation, and a novel inverse motility-induced phase separation regime where activity stabilizes dense droplet assemblies. Crucially, we demonstrate that temporal modulation of activity enables precise control over structural morphological transitions. Our results suggest new routes to design adaptive smart materials with tunable microstructure and dynamics, bridging active nematics with applications in programmable colloidal assembly and bio-inspired material design.</description>

      <title>Stiffness, strength, energy dissipation and reusability in heterogeneous architected polycrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design, fabricate and test heterogeneous architected polycrystals, composed of hard plastomers and soft elastomers, which thus show outstanding mechanical resilience and energy dissipation simultaneously. Grain boundaries that separate randomly oriented single crystalline grains is carefully designed, first enabling coherent connectivity and strength in the grain boundary regions throughout the polycrystalline network. By combining experiments and numerical simulations on 3D-printed prototypes, we show that the interplay between grain interiors and grain boundaries is responsible for the grain-size effects emerging in these architected materials, analogous to those in their atomic or metallic counterparts. Furthermore, direct visualization of inter- and intra-grain deformation and failure mechanisms at the macroscopic scale reveals that crystallographic texture throughout the polycrystalline aggregates plays a fundamental role in the key mechanical features in our new heterogeneous polycrystals. Our results show that the engineered grain boundary and crystallographic texture not only modify the highly resilient yet dissipative global responses but also critically influence reusability in this new class of architected materials.</description>

      <title>A mechanical approach to facilitate the formation of dodecagonal quasicrystals and their approximants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conditions for forming quasicrystals and their approximants are stringent, normally requiring multiple length scales to stabilize the quasicrystalline order. Here we report an unexpected finding that the approximants and motifs of dodecagonal quasicrystals can be spontaneously formed in the simplest system of identical hard disks, utilizing the unstable feature of the initial square packing subject to mechanical perturbations. Because there is only one length scale involved, this finding challenges existing theories of quasicrystals and their approximants. By applying the same approach to a system known to form a dodecagonal quasicrystal, we develop decent quasicrystalline order in a purely mechanical manner. With the aid of thermal treatment, we achieve a significantly better quasicrystalline order than that from the direct self-assembly of the liquid state within the same period of time. In sufficiently low temperatures where the self-assembly of a liquid is significantly hindered, our approach still promotes the formation of quasicrystals. Our study thus opens a venue for high-efficiency search and formation of quasicrystals, and may have broader implications for the design and synthesis of quasicrystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Enhancement and Suppression of Active Particle Movement Due to Membrane Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microswimmers and active colloids often move in confined systems, including those involving interfaces. Such interfaces, especially at the microscale, may deform in response to the stresses of the flow created by the active particle. We develop a theoretical framework to analyze the effect of a nearby membrane due to the motion of an active particle whose flow fields are generated by force-free singularities. We demonstrate our result on a particle represented by a combination of a force dipole and a source dipole, while the membrane resists deformation due to tension and bending rigidity. We find that the deformation either enhances or suppresses the motion of the active particle, depending on its orientation and the relative strengths between the fundamental singularities that describe its flow. Furthermore, the deformation can generate motion in new directions.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Colloidal Dynamics under Stochastic Resetting: Competing Effects of Particle Interactions on the Steady State Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The random arrest of the diffusion of a single particle and its return to its origin has served as the paradigmatic example of a large variety of processes undergoing stochastic resetting. While the implications and applications of stochastic resetting for a single particle are well understood, less is known about resetting of many interacting particles. In this study, we experimentally and numerically investigate a system of six colloidal particles undergoing two types of stochastic resetting protocols: global resetting, where all particles are returned to their origin simultaneously, and local resetting, where particles are reset one at a time. Our particles interact mainly through hard-core repulsion and hydrodynamic flows. We find that the most substantial effect of interparticle interactions is observed for local resetting, specifically when particles are physically dragged to the origin. In this case, hard-core repulsion broadens the steady-state distribution, while hydrodynamic interactions significantly narrow the distribution. The combination results in a steady-state distribution that is wider compared to that of a single particle system both for global and local resetting protocols.</description>

      <title>Influence of packing protocol on fractal exponents in dense polydisperse packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fractal properties of a system of densely and randomly packed disks, obeying a power-law distribution of radii, which is generated by using various protocols: Delaunay triangulation (DT) with both zero and periodic boundary conditions and the constant pressure protocol with periodic boundary conditions. The power-law exponents of the mass-radius relation and structure factor are obtained numerically for various values of the size ratio of the distribution, defined as the largest-to-smallest radius ratio. It is shown that the size ratio is an important control parameter responsible for the consistency of the fractal properties of the system: the greater the ratio, the less the finite size effects are pronounced and the better the agreement between the exponents. For the DT protocol, the exponents of the mass-radius relation, structure factor, and power-law distribution coincide even at moderate values of the size ratio. By contrast, for the constant-pressure protocol, all three exponents are found to be different for both moderate (around 300) and large (around 1500) size ratios, which might indicate a biased rather than random spatial distribution of the disks. Nevertheless, there is a tendency for the exponents to converge as the size ratio increases, suggesting that all the exponents become equal in the limit of infinite size ratio.</description>

      <title>Preliminary experimental investigation on the interaction of a subaqueous dune like granular structure with a turbulent open channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interaction of a subaqueous dune like granular structure with a turbulent open channel flow experimentally using optical diagnostics in the Reynolds and Froude parameter space ($7.7{\times}10^3&lt;Re&lt;3.8{\times}10^4$, $0.1&lt;Fr&lt;0.4$). Interactions between the turbulent flow and the granular structure give rise to transient erosion-deposition dynamics leading to various types of particle transport. The subaqueous structures in the channel bed evolves due to shear-stress-induced erosion, gravity-driven deposition, and subsequent particle transport. We study the centroid motion and the granular structure shape evolution. At lower end of our $Re-Fr$ parameter space, we observe no erosion and the structure remains at rest. At intermediate values of $Re$ and $Fr$, we observe very slow erosion and the granular structure moves vere slowly as a rigid body without significant shape deformation. Higher values of $Re$ and $Fr$ causes vortex formation at the upstream of the dune resulting in stronger erosion, rapid shape deformation and relatively higher translation velocity of the centroid.</description>

      <title>Elastic displacements in wedge-shaped geometries with a straight edge: Green's functions for perpendicular forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edges are abundant when fluids are contained in vessels or elastic solids glide in guiding rails. We here address induced small-scale flows in viscous fluids or displacements in elastic solids in the vicinity of one such edge. For this purpose, we solve the underlying low-Reynolds-number flow equations for incompressible fluids and the elasticity equations for linearly elastic, possibly compressible solids. Technically speaking, we derive the associated Green's functions under confinement by two planar boundaries that meet at a straight edge. The two boundaries both feature no-slip or free-slip conditions, or one of these two conditions per boundary. Previously, we solved the simpler case of the force being oriented parallel to the straight edge. Here, we complement this solution by the more challenging case of the force pointing into a direction perpendicular to the edge. Together, these two cases provide the general solution. Specific situations in which our analysis may find application in terms of quantitative theoretical descriptions are particle motion in confined colloidal suspensions, dynamics of active microswimmers near edges, or actuated distortions of elastic materials due to activated contained functionalized particles.</description>

      <title>Performance of a Brownian information engine through potential profiling: Optimum output requisites, Heating-to-Refrigeration transition and their Re-entrance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian Information engine (BIE) harnesses the energy from a fluctuating environment by utilizing the associated information change in the presence of a single heat bath. The engine operates in a space-dependent confining potential and requires an appropriate feedback control mechanism. In general, the feedback controller has three different steps: measurement, feedback, and relaxation. The feedback step is related to a sudden change in the potential energy that is essential for a nonzero work output. BIE utilises the amount of information (surprise) acquired during the measurement step for the energy output. However, due to the relaxation process, a certain amount of acquired information is lost or becomes unavailable. So, controlling information loss during relaxation is crucial for the overall efficiency of the engine. The net (available) information, therefore, can be monitored by tuning the feedback controller and the shape of the confining potential. In this paper, we explore the effect of the shape modulation of the confining potential, which may have multiple stable valleys and unstable hills, on the net available information and, hence, the performance of a BIE that operates under an asymmetric feedback protocol. We examine the optimal performance requirements of the BIE and the amount of maximum work output under different potential profiling. For monostable trapping, a concave shape in confining potential results in a higher work output than a convex one. We also find that hills and valleys in the confining potential may lead to multiple good operating conditions. An appropriate shape modulation can create a heater-refrigerator transition and their reentrance due to non-trivial changes in information loss during the relaxation process.</description>

      <title>MIPS is a Maxwell fluid with an extended and non-monotonic crossover</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanical properties of active suspensions is crucial for their potential applications in materials engineering. Among the various phenomena in active matter that have no analogue in equilibrium systems, motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) in active colloidal suspensions is one of the most extensively studied. However, the mechanical properties of this fundamental active state of matter remain poorly understood. This study investigates the rheology of a suspension of active colloidal particles under constant and oscillatory shear. Systems consisting of pseudo-hard active Brownian particles exhibiting co-existence of dense and dilute phases behave as a viscoelastic Maxwell fluid at low and high frequencies, displaying exclusively shear thinning across a wide range of densities and activities. Remarkably, the cross-over point between the storage and loss moduli is non-monotonic, rising with activity before the MIPS transition but falling with activity after the transition, revealing the subtleties of how active forces and intrinsically out-of-equilibrium phases affect the mechanical properties of these systems.</description>

      <title>Bridging advection and diffusion in the encounter dynamics of sedimenting marine snow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sinking marine snow particles, composed primarily of organic matter, control the global export of photosynthetically fixed carbon from the ocean surface to depth. The fate of sedimenting marine snow particles is in part regulated by their encounters with suspended, micron-sized objects, which leads to mass accretion by the particles and potentially alters their buoyancy, and with bacteria that can colonize the particles and degrade them. Their collision rates are typically calculated using two types of models focusing either on direct (ballistic) interception with a finite interaction range, or advective-diffusive capture with a zero interaction range. Since the range of applicability of the two models is unknown, and many relevant marine encounter scenarios span across both regimes, quantifying such encounters remains challenging, because the two models yield asymptotically different predictions at high P\'{e}clet numbers. Here, we reconcile the two limiting approaches by quantifying the encounters in the general case using a combination of theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. Solving the advection-diffusion equation in Stokes flow around a sphere to model mass transfer to a large sinking particle by small yet finite-sized objects, we determine a new formula for the Sherwood number as a function of two dimensionless parameters: the P\'{e}clet number and the ratio of small to large particle sizes. We find that diffusion can play a significant role in generating encounters even at high Pe. At Pe as high as $10^6$, the direct interception model underestimates the encounter rate by up to two orders of magnitude. This overlooked contribution of diffusion to encounters suggests that important processes affecting the fate of marine snow, such as colonization by bacteria and plankton or accretion of neutrally buoyant gels, may proceed at a rate much faster than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Controlling Droplets at the Tips of Fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many complex wetting behaviors of fibrous materials are rooted in the behaviors of individual droplets attached to pairs of fibers. Here, we study the splitting of a droplet held between the tips of two cylindrical fibers. We discover a sharp transition between two post-rupture states, navigated by changing the angle between the rods, in agreement with our bifurcation analysis. Depinning of the bridge contact line can lead to a much larger asymmetry between the volume of liquid left on each rod. This second scenario enables the near-complete transfer of an aqueous glycerol droplet between two identical vinylpolysiloxane fibers. We leverage this response in a device that uses a ruck to pass a droplet along a train of fibers, a proof-of-concept for the geometric control of droplets on deformable, architected surfaces.</description>

      <title>Bending-compression coupling in extensible slender microswimmers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Undulatory slender objects have been a central theme in the hydrodynamics of swimming at low Reynolds number, where the slender body is usually assumed to be inextensible, although some microorganisms and artificial microrobots largely deform with compression and extension. Here, we theoretically study the coupling between the bending and compression/extension shape modes, using a geometrical formulation of microswimmer hydrodynamics to deal with the non-commutative effects between translation and rotation. By means of a coarse-grained minimal model and systematic perturbation expansions for small bending and compression/extension, we analytically derive the swimming velocities and report three main findings. First, we revisit the role of anisotropy in the drag ratio of the resistive force theory and generally demonstrate that no motion is possible for uniform compression with isotropic drag. We then find that the bending-compression/extension coupling generates lateral and rotational motion, which enhances the swimmer's manoeuvrability, as well as changes in progressive velocity at a higher order of expansion, while the coupling effects depend on the phase difference between the two modes. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of often-overlooked Lie bracket contributions in computing net locomotion from a deformation gait. Our study sheds light on compression as a forgotten degree of freedom in swimmer locomotion, with important implications for microswimmer hydrodynamics, including understanding of biological locomotion mechanisms and design of microrobots.</description>

      <title>Evaporative Refrigeration Effect in Evaporation and Condensation between Two Parallel Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that evaporation can lead to cooling. However, little is known that evaporation can actually create a refrigeration effect, i.e., the vapor phase temperature can drop below the temperature of the liquid-vapor interface. This possibility was recently pointed out via modeling based on a quasi-continuum approach. Experimental evidence for this effect has been scarce so far. Here, we examine evaporation and condensation between two parallel plates, including the liquid films on both sides, by coupling the solution of the Boltzmann transport equation in the vapor phase with the continuum treatments in both liquid films. Our solution shows that the vapor phase temperature at the evaporating side can be much lower than the coldest wall temperature at the condensing surface, i.e., the evaporative refrigeration effect. Our work not only re-affirms the refrigeration effect, but clarifies that this effect is caused by two mechanisms. At the interface, the asymmetry in the distribution between the outgoing and the incoming molecules creates a cooling effect, which is the dominant mechanism. Additional cooling occurs within the Knudsen layer due to the sudden expansion similar to the Joule-Thomson effect, although with subtle differences in that the interfacial expansion is not an isenthalpic process. Our work will motivate future experiments to further confirm this prediction and explore its potential applications in air-conditioning and refrigeration.</description>

      <title>Giant and anisotropic magnetostriction in $\beta$-O$_{2}$ at 110 T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetostriction is a crystal's deformation under magnetic fields, usually in the range of $10^{-6}$ - $10^{-3}$, where the lattice change occurs with the change of spin and orbital state through spin-lattice couplings. In strong magnetic fields beyond 100 T, the significant Zeeman energy competes with the lattice interactions, where one can expect considerable magnetostriction. However, directly observing magnetostriction above 100 T is challenging, because generating magnetic fields beyond 100 T accompanies the destruction of the coil with a single-shot $\mu$-second pulse. Here, we observed the giant and anisotropic magnetostriction of $\sim$1 % at 110 T in the spin-controlled crystal of $\beta$-O$_{2}$, by combining the single-shot diffraction of x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) and the state-of-the-art portable 100 T generator. The magnetostriction of $\sim$1 % is the largest class as a deformation of the unit cell. It is a response of the soft lattice of $\beta$-O$_{2}$ originating, not only in the competing van der Waals force and exchange interaction, but also the soft state of spin and lattice frustrated on the triangular network. Meanwhile, the anisotropy originates from the strong two-dimensionality of the spin system. Giant magnetostriction in crystals should become more ubiquitous and diverse beyond 100 T, where our XFEL experiment above 100 T opens a novel pathway for their exploration, providing fundamental insights into the roles of spin in stabilizing crystal structures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft materials are ubiquitous in technological applications that require deformability, for instance, in flexible, water-repellent coatings. However, the wetting properties of pre-strained soft materials are only beginning to be explored. Here we study the sliding dynamics of droplets on pre-strained soft silicone gels, both in tension and in compression. Intriguingly, in compression we find a non-monotonic strain dependence of the sliding speed: mild compressions decelerate the droplets, but stronger compressions lead again to faster droplet motion. Upon further compression, creases nucleate under the droplets until finally, the entire surface undergoes the creasing instability, causing a ``run-and-stop" motion. We quantitatively elucidate the speed modification for moderate pre-strains by incremental viscoelasticity, while the acceleration for larger pre-strains turns out to be linked to the solid pressure, presumably through a lubrication effect of expelled oligomers.</description>

Abstract: Soft valves serve to modulate and rectify flows in complex vasculatures across the tree of life, e.g. in the heart of every human reading this. Here we consider a minimal physical model of the heart mitral valve modeled as a flexible conical shell capable of flow rectification via collapse and coaptation in an impinging (reverse) flow. Our experiments show that the complex elastohydrodynamics of closure features a noise-activated rectification mechanism. A minimal theoretical model allows us to rationalize our observations while illuminating a dynamical bifurcation driven by stochastic hydrodynamic forces. Our theory also suggests a way to trigger the coaptation of soft valves on demand, which we corroborate using experiments, suggesting a design principle for their efficient operation.</description>

Abstract: We reconsider the classical problem of a freely joined chain of Brownian particles connected by elastic springs and study its conformational probability distribution function in the overdamped regime in the limit of infinite stiffness of constraints. We show that the well-known solution by Fixman [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 71, 3050 (1974)] is missing a shape-related term, later alluded to but not computed by Helfand [J. Chem. Phys 71, 5000 (1979)]. In our approach, the shape term, also termed zero-point energy, arises explicitly from a careful treatment of the distributional limit. We present a computationally feasible method for the calculation of the shape term and demonstrate its validity in a couple of examples.</description>

      <title>Thickness-dependent conductivity of nanometric semiconductor thin films</title>

Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices has led to the prominence, in technological applications, of semiconductor thin films that are only a few nanometers thick. In spite of intense research, the thickness-dependent resistivity or conductivity of semiconductor thin films is not understood at a fundamental physical level. We develop a theory based on quantum confinement which yields the dependence of the concentration of intrinsic carriers on the film thickness. The theory predicts that the resistivity $\rho$, in the 1-10 nm thickness range, increases exponentially as $\rho \sim \exp(const/L^{1/2})$ upon decreasing the film thickness $L$. This law is able to reproduce the remarkable increase in resistivity observed experimentally in Si thin films, whereas the effect of surface scattering (Fuchs-Sondheimer theory) alone cannot explain the data when the film thickness is lower than 10 nm.</description>

      <title>Geometric theory of (extended) time-reversal symmetries in stochastic processes -- Part II: field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the time-reversal properties of a generic Markovian stochastic field dynamics with Gaussian noise. We introduce a convenient functional geometric formalism that allows us to straightforwardly generalize known results from finite dimensional systems to the case of continuous fields. We give, at field level, full reversibility conditions for three notions of time-reversal defined in the first article of this two-part series, namely T-, MT-, and EMT-reversibility. When the noise correlator is invertible, these reversibility conditions do not make reference to any generically unknown function like the stationary probability, and can thus be verified systematically. Focusing on the simplest of these notions, where only the time variable is flipped upon time reversal, we show that time-reversal symmetry breaking is quantified by a single geometric object: the vorticity two-form, which is a two-form over the functional space $\mathbb{F}$ to which the field belongs. Reversibility then amounts to the cancellation of this vorticity two-form. This condition applies at distributional level and can thus be difficult to use in practice. For fields that are defined on a spatial domain of dimension $d=1$, we overcome this problem by building a basis of the space of two-forms $\Omega^2(\mathbb{F})$. Reversibility is then equivalent to the vanishing of the vorticity's coordinates in this basis, a criterion that is readily applicable to concrete examples. Furthermore, we show that this basis provides a natural direct-sum decomposition of $\Omega^2(\mathbb{F})$, each subspace of which is associated with a distinctive kind of phenomenology. This decomposition enables a classification of celebrated out-of-equilibrium phenomena, ranging from non-reciprocal (chaser/chased) interactions to the flocking of active agents, dynamical reaction-diffusion patterns, (...)</description>
