      <title>Di-nucleons do not form bound states at heavy pion mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a high-statistics lattice QCD calculation of the low-energy two-nucleon scattering amplitudes. In order to address discrepancies in the literature, the calculation is performed at a heavy pion mass in the limit that the light quark masses are equal to the physical strange quark mass, $m_\pi = m_K \simeq 714 $ MeV. Using a state-of-the-art momentum space method, we rule out the presence of a bound di-nucleon in both the isospin 0 (deuteron) and 1 (di-neutron) channels, in contrast with many previous results that made use of compact hexaquark creation operators. In order to diagnose the discrepancy, we add such hexaquark interpolating operators to our basis and find that they do not affect the determination of the two-nucleon finite volume spectrum, and thus they do not couple to deeply bound di-nucleons that are missed by the momentum-space operators. Further, we perform a high-statistics calculation of the HAL QCD potential on the same gauge ensembles and find qualitative agreement with our main results. We conclude that two-nucleons do not form bound states at heavy pion masses and that previous identification of deeply bound di-nucleons must have arisen from a misidentification of the spectrum from off-diagonal elements of a correlation function.</description>

      <title>Calculation of the axial-vector coupling constant $g_A$ to two loops in covariant chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the leading two-loop corrections to the axial-vector coupling constant $g_A$ in two covariant versions of two-flavor baryon chiral perturbation theory. Taking the low-energy constants from a combined analysis of elastic and inelastic pion-nucleon scattering, we find that these corrections are rather moderate.</description>

      <title>Discovering novel order parameters in the Potts model: A bridge between machine learning and critical phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models trained on Ising spin configurations have demonstrated surprising effectiveness in classifying phases of Potts models, even when processing severely reduced representations that retain only two spin states. To unravel this remarkable capability, we identify a family of novel alternative order parameters for the $q=3$ and $q=4$ Potts models on a square lattice, constructed from the occupancies of secondary and minimal spin states rather than the conventional dominant-state order parameter. Through systematic finite-size scaling analyses, we demonstrate that these observables, including a magnetization-like observable derived from a reduced spin representation, accurately capture critical behavior, yielding critical temperatures and exponents consistent with established theoretical predictions and numerical benchmarks. Furthermore, we rigorously establish the fundamental relationships between these alternative order parameters, demonstrating how they collectively encode criticality through different aspects of spin configurations. Our results provide a thermodynamic basis for ML's success in reduced representations. This work bridges data-driven ML approaches with fundamental statistical mechanics, showing that criticality in Potts systems can be encoded in more compact, non-traditional forms, and opens avenues for discovering analogous order parameters in broader spin systems.</description>

      <title>Exotics in the $\pi D$ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.15544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this proceedings we consider several states, namely the $D^*_{s0}(2317)$, $D_{s1}(2460)$, $D^*_{0}(2300)$ and $D_{1}(2430)$, which appear to defy description as simple quark-antiquark pairs. Theoretical input from unitarized chiral perturbation theory suggests they can be understood as emerging from Goldstone-Boson--$D$-meson scattering. We present results from an $SU(3)$ flavor-symmetric lattice QCD simulation at large pion masses suggesting that there exists a $\pi D$ bound state in the flavor-sextet representation that cannot emerge for quark-antiquark states, but that appears naturally from the multiquark states. Moreover, we find repulsion in the [15] representation, which establishes the pattern predicted for the interactions of Goldstone bosons with $D$ mesons. This suggests these states may have the structure of hadronic molecules.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of the Schwinger model via gauge-invariant VUMPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the lattice Schwinger model by combining the variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) algorithm with a gauge-invariant matrix product ansatz that locally enforces the Gauss law constraint. Both the continuum and lattice versions of the Schwinger model with $\theta=\pi$ are known to exhibit first-order phase transitions for the values of the fermion mass above a critical value, where a second-order phase transition occurs. Our algorithm enables a precise determination of the critical endpoint in the continuum theory. We further analyze the scaling in the simultaneous critical and continuum limits and confirm that the data collapse aligns with the Ising universality class to remarkable precision.</description>

      <title>Understanding thermalization in a non-Abelian gauge theory in terms of its soft modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the maximal Lyapunov exponent $\lambda_L$ of physical states in a SU(2) gauge theory consisting of soft momentum modes both in and out-of-thermal equilibrium conditions using ab-initio lattice techniques. We have implemented different algorithms to appropriately describe the dynamics of soft-modes for a wide range of temperatures and under non-equilibrium conditions. The non-equilibrium state has been realized starting from an over-occupied initial condition for low momentum soft gluons whereas the thermal state comprises of strongly interacting soft gluons at temperatures where these are well separated from the hard momentum modes. Spectra of positive Lyapunov exponents is observed in both these states, similar to a chaotic dynamical system. From the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy rate measured in terms of this spectrum, we estimate a typical time-scale of $\sim 0.50(3)$ fm/c to achieve thermalization at $T\sim 600$ MeV starting from the non-thermal state. We also measure, for the first time, the $\lambda_L$ for long wavelength critical modes of SU(2) using the out-of-time-ordered correlator of a classical $Z_2$ scalar field theory, which shares the same universal behavior with SU(2), near the deconfinement phase transition. The $\lambda_L$ is observed to maximize at the transition temperature.</description>

      <title>Confirmation of the existence of an exotic state in the $\pi D$ system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.15391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years many candidates for states beyond the most simple realization of the quark model were found in various experiments around the world. However, so far no consensus exists on their structure, although there is strong evidence that at least some of those are dynamically generated from meson-meson interactions. In this Letter we provide an important missing piece from the theoretical side to prove that the lightest open charm strange and non-strange scalars $D_{s0}^*(2317)$ and $D_0^*$ as well as their axial-vector partner states can all be understood as emerging from the interactions between Goldstone bosons stemming from the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry and the ground state charmed mesons. For that purpose we exploit the flavor multiplet structure of the lightest open-charm positive-parity scalar states in an SU(3) symmetric lattice QCD simulation at large pion masses to establish that there exists a bound state in the flavor-sextet representation, which cannot emerge for quark-antiquark states but appears naturally for four-quark configurations. Moreover, we find repulsion in the $[15]$ representation and thus no single-particle state in this representation exists, falsifying the expectation for tetraquark models. The findings establish the pattern predicted for the interactions of Goldstone bosons with $D$ mesons from chiral symmetry and the paradigm of the lowest-lying positive-parity charmed mesons as dynamically generated states.</description>
