      <title>Instantaneous Response and Quantum Geometry of Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the time-dependent Quantum Geometric Tensor (tQGT) as a comprehensive tool for capturing the geometric character of insulators observable within linear response. We show that tQGT describes the zero-point motion of bound electrons and acts as a generating function for generalized sum rules of electronic conductivity. Therefore, tQGT enables a systematic and basis-independent framework to compute the instantaneous response of insulators, including optical mass, orbital angular momentum, and the dielectric constant in low-energy effective theories. It allows for a consistent approximation across these quantities upon restricting the number of occupied and unoccupied states in an effective low-energy description of an infinite quantum system. We outline how quantum geometry can be generated in periodic systems by lattice interference and examine spectral weight transfer from small frequencies to high frequencies by creating geometrically frustrated flat bands.</description>

      <title>Orbital angular momentum of Bloch electrons: equilibrium formulation, magneto-electric phenomena, and the orbital Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The investigation of orbital angular momentum (OAM) of delocalised Bloch electrons has significantly advanced our understanding of magnetic, transport, and optical phenomena in crystals, drawing widespread interest across various materials science domains, from metals and semiconductors to topological and magnetic materials. Here, we review OAM dynamics in depth, mainly focusing on key concepts and non-equilibrium systems, laying the groundwork for the thriving field of {\it orbitronics}. We begin by dissecting the conventional understanding of equilibrium OAM and identify two primary contributions. The {\it atomic}-OAM contribution is rooted in the angular momentum of parent atomic orbitals and is prevalent in inversion-symmetric systems. The other {\it itinerant}-OAM contribution arises from the rotation of the electron wave packet around its center of mass and it is dominant in systems lacking inversion symmetry. Following this, we explore recent theoretical and experimental developments in out-of-equilibrium systems. We specifically focus on the generation of an OAM density via the orbital magneto-electric, or Edelstein effect, the generation of an OAM current via the orbital Hall effect, the orbital torque resulting from them, along with their reciprocal non-equilibrium counterparts -- the inverse orbital Edelstein and inverse orbital Hall effects, as well as OAM conservation. Beyond discussing the current excitement and challenges in this rapidly evolving field, we highlighted the future prospects of {\it orbitronics}.</description>

      <title>The quantum Hall effect under the influence of gravity and inertia: A unified approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Hall effect under the influence of gravity and inertia is studied in a unified way. We make use of an algebraic approach, as opposed to an analytic approach. We examine how both the integer and the fractional quantum Hall effects behave under a combined influence of gravity and inertia using a unified Hamiltonian. For that purpose, we first re-derive, using the purely algebraic method, the energy spectrum of charged particles moving in a plane perpendicular to a constant and uniform magnetic field either (i) under the influence of a nonlinear gravitational potential or (ii) under the influence of a constant rotation. The general Hamiltonian for describing the combined effect of gravity, rotation and inertia on the electrons of a Hall sample is then built and the eigenstates are obtained. The electrons mutual Coulomb interaction that gives rise to the familiar fractional quantum Hall effect is also discussed within a such a combination.</description>

      <title>Localized interfacial Phonon Modes at the Electronic Axion Domain Wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The most salient feature of electronic topological states of matter is the existence of exotic electronic modes localized at the surface or interface of a sample. In this work, in an electronic topological system, we demonstrate the existence of localized phonon modes at the domain wall between topologically trivial and non-trivial regions, in addition to the localized interfacial electronic states. In particular, we consider a theoretical model for the Dirac semimetal with a gap opened by external strains and study the phonon dynamics, which couples to electronic degrees of freedom via strong electron-phonon interaction. By treating the phonon modes as a pseudo-gauge field, we find that the axion type of terms for phonon dynamics can emerge in gapped Dirac semimetal model and lead to interfacial phonon modes localized at the domain wall between trivial and non-trivial regimes that possess the axion parameters 0 and {\pi}, respectively. We also discuss the physical properties and possible experimental probe of such interfacial phonon modes.</description>

      <title>Anomalous magnetic flux via junction twist-angle in a triplet-superconducting transmon qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting transmon qubits with strong anharmonicity and insensitivity to offset charge are highly desirable for low-error implementation. In this work we propose a c-axis junction, comprising triplet superconductors, and set at a relative twist angle. Invoking spin-orbit coupling and spin polarization, which are known to occur in the material platform of choice, we examine the resulting transmon Hamiltonian. This junction allows for direct control of the single and double Cooper pair tunneling strength, and most remarkably, an anomalous magnetic flux -- i.e. a phase offset equivalent to magnetic flux, yet in zero magnetic field. Having control over these three parameters -- single and double pair tunneling and anomalous flux -- allows for optimal design of the transmon qubit. Interestingly, in this architecture, the anomalous flux is determined by the twist angle of the junction, thereby offering a novel zero-field functionality. Our key results rely on symmetry arguments, for concreteness we demonstrate the implementation of our concept using a model of moir\'e graphene-based c-axis junctions.</description>

      <title>Spatially resolved random telegraph fluctuations of a single trap at the Si/SiO2 interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use electrostatic force microscopy to spatially resolve random telegraph noise at the Si/SiO$_2$ interface. Our measurements demonstrate that two-state fluctuations are localized at interfacial traps, with bias-dependent rates and amplitudes. These two-level systems lead to correlated carrier number and mobility fluctuations with a range of characteristic timescales; taken together as an ensemble, they give rise to a $1/f$ power spectral trend. Such individual defect fluctuations at the Si/SiO$_2$ interface impair the performance and reliability of nanoscale semiconductor devices, and will be a significant source of noise in semiconductor-based quantum sensors and computers. The fluctuations measured here are associated with a four-fold competition of rates, including slow two-state switching on the order of seconds and, in one state, fast switching on the order of nanoseconds which is associated with energy loss.</description>

      <title>Negative orbital Hall effect in Germanium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our investigation reveals a groundbreaking discovery of a negative inverse orbital Hall effect (IOHE) in Ge thin films. We employed the innovative orbital pumping technique where spin-orbital coupled current is injected into Ge films using YIG/Pt(2)/Ge($t_{Ge}$) and YIG/W(2)/Ge($t_{Ge}$) heterostructures. Through comprehensive analysis, we observe significant reductions in the signals generated by coherent (RF-driven) and incoherent (thermal-driven) spin-orbital pumping techniques. These reductions are attributed to the presence of a remarkable strong negative IOHE in Ge, showing its magnitude comparable to the spin-to-charge signal in Pt. Our findings reveal that although the spin-to-charge conversion in Ge is negligible, the orbital-to-charge conversion exhibits large magnitude. Our results are innovative and pioneering in the investigation of negative IOHE by the injection of spin-orbital currents.</description>

      <title>Lateral 2D superlattices in GaAs heterostructures with independent control of carrier density and modulation potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new double-layer design for 2D surface superlattice systems in GaAs-AlGaAs heterostructures. Unlike previous studies, our device (1) uses an in-situ gate, which allows very short period superlattice in high mobility, shallow heterostructures; (2) enables independent control of the carrier density and the superlattice modulation potential amplitude over a wide range. We characterise this device design using low-temperature magneto-transport measurements and show that the fabrication process caused minimal damage to the system. We demonstrate the tuning of potential modulation from weak (much smaller than Fermi energy) to strong (larger than the Fermi energy) regimes.</description>

      <title>Observation of room temperature gate tunable quantum confinement effect in photodoped junctionless MOSFET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of room temperature quantum hardware, our study introduces a gate voltage tunable quantum wire within a tri-gated n-type junctionless MOSFET. The application of gate voltage alters the parabolic potential well of the tri-gated junctionless MOSFET, enabling modification of the nanowire's potential well profile. In the presence of light, photogenerated electrons accumulate at the center of the junctionless nanowire, aligning with the modified potential well profile influenced by gate bias. These carriers at the center are far from interfaces and experience less interfacial noise. Therefore, such clean photo-doping shows clear, repeatable peaks in current for specific gate biases compared to the dark condition, considering different operating drain-to-source voltages at room temperature. We propose that photodoping-induced subband occupation of gate tunable potential well of the nanowire is the underlying phenomenon responsible for this kind of observation. This study reveals experimental findings demonstrating gate-induced switching from semi-classical to the quantum domain, followed by the optical occupancy of electronic sub-bands at room temperature. We developed a compact model based on the Nonequilibrium Green's function formalism to understand this phenomenon in our illuminated device better. This work reveals the survival of the quantum confinement effect at room temperature in such semi-classical transport.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion flow in periodically modulated channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, topologically stabilized chiral magnetic textures with particle-like properties have so far primarily been studied statically. Here, we experimentally investigate the dynamics of skyrmion ensembles in metallic thin film conduits where they behave as quasi-particle fluids. By exploiting our access to the full trajectories of all fluid particles by means of time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr microscopy, we demonstrate that boundary conditions of skyrmion fluids can be tuned by modulation of the channel geometry. We observe as a function of channel width deviations from classical flow profiles even into the no- or partial-slip regime. Unlike conventional colloids, the skyrmion Hall effect can also introduce transversal flow-asymmetries and even local motion of single skyrmions against the driving force which we explore with particle-based simulations, demonstrating the unique properties of skyrmion liquid flow that uniquely deviates from previously known behavior of other quasi-particles.</description>

      <title>Dual orthogonally-polarized lasing assisted by imaginary Fermi arcs in organic microcavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The polarization control of micro/nano lasers is an important topic in nanophotonics. Up to now, the simultaneous generation of two distinguishable orthogonally-polarized lasing modes from a single organic microlaser remains a critical challenge. Here, we demonstrate simultaneously orthogonally-polarized dual lasing from a microcavity filled with an organic single crystal exhibiting selective strong coupling. We show that the non-Hermiticity due to polarization-dependent losses leads to the formation of real and imaginary Fermi arcs with exceptional points. Simultaneous orthogonally-polarized lasing becomes possible thanks to the eigenstate mixing by the photonic spin-orbit coupling at the imaginary Fermi arcs. Our work provides a novel way to develop linearly-polarized lasers and paves the way for the future fundamental research in topological photonics, non-Hermitian optics, and other fields.</description>

      <title>Localization-Delocalization Transitions in Non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm Cages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A unique feature of non-Hermitian systems is the extreme sensitivity of the eigenspectrum to boundary conditions with the emergence of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE). A NHSE originates from the point-gap topology of complex eigenspectrum, where an extensive number of eigenstates are anomalously localized at the boundary driven by nonreciprocal dissipation. Two different approaches to create localization are disorder and flat-band spectrum, and their interplay can lead to the anomalous inverse Anderson localization, where the Bernoulli anti-symmetric disorder induce mobility in a full-flat band system in the presence of Aharonov-Bohm (AB) Cage. In this work, we study the localization-delocalization transitions due to the interplay of the point-gap topology, flat band and correlated disorder in the one-dimensional rhombic lattice, where both its Hermitian and non-Hermitian structures show AB cage in the presence of magnetic flux. Although it remains the coexistence of localization and delocalization for the Hermitian rhombic lattice in the presence of the random anti-symmetric disorder, it surprisingly becomes complete delocalization, accompanied by the emergence of NHSE. To further study the effects from the Bernoulli anti-symmetric disorder, we found the similar NHSE due to the interplay of the point-gap topology, correlated disorder and flat bands. Our anomalous localization-delocalization property can be experimentally tested in the classical physical platform, such as electrical circuit.</description>

      <title>Isolated nearly flat higher Chern band in monolayer transition metal trihalides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between non-trivial topology and strong electron interaction can generate a variety of exotic quantum matter. Here we theoretically propose that monolayer transition metal trihalides MoF$_3$ and WI$_3$ have isolated nearly flat band near the Fermi level with higher Chern number $\mathcal{C}=+3$ and $\mathcal{C}=-2$, respectively. The nontrivial topology of these flat Chern bands originates from the effective $sd^2$ hybridization of transition metal atom, which transform the apparent atomic $d$ orbitals on a hexagonal lattice into $(s, p_+, p_-)$ orbitals on a triangular lattice. Interestingly, the quantum geometry of flat Chern bands in both materials are comparable with those in moir\'e systems exhibiting fractional Chern insulator state. The Hofstadter butterfly of such flat Chern bands are further studied. These natural materials, if realized experimentally, could offer new platforms to explore correlated phenomena driven by flat Chern band with higher Chern number.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of strong t-e orbital hybridization and the effects of f orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has revealed that the Cr family perovskite ReCrO$_3$ exhibits intriguing magnetic coupling interactions within Cr pairs, which may not follow the Goodenough-Kanamori (GK) rules due to the t-e hybridization between Cr$^\mathrm{III}$ ions. We investigate the complex magnetism involving both t-e hybridization and Re-$f$ orbitals in the molecular analogue of perovskite [$\mathrm{Ce_2^{III}Ce^{IV}Cr_8^{III}O_8(O_2CPh)_{18}(HO_2CPh)}$] ($\mathrm{Ce_3Cr_8}$) using first-principles method. Our results have shown that distinct from the bulk ReCrO$_3$, the superexchange via Cr-$d$ and O-$p$ orbitals can exhibit a unexpected dominate ferromagnetic (FM) Cr-O-Cr superexchange interaction in $\mathrm{Ce_3Cr_8}$ due to the strong t-e hybridization originated from the distorted molecular structure. The great sensitivity of the t-e hybridization with respect to the molecular structure, e.g., the angle of Cr-O-Cr, can lead to a ground state transition from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic state with the changes in the angle of Cr-O-Cr. The Ce-$f$ orbitals near the Fermi level can reduce this sensitivity through interacting with the Cr-$d$ orbitals via the virtual charge transfer process. Our results are strongly supported by a modified superexchange model based on the t-e hybridization theory. These findings complete the theory of superexchange magnetism involving the t-e hybridization and $f$ orbitals, and in the meanwhile introduce a new avenue for fine-tuning the magnetic characteristics via Tm-d/Re-f interactions at nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Signatures of correlated defects in an ultra-clean Wigner crystal in the extreme quantum limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-disorder two-dimensional electron systems in the presence of a strong, perpendicular magnetic field terminate at very small Landau level filling factors in a Wigner crystal (WC), where the electrons form an ordered array to minimize the Coulomb repulsion. The nature of this exotic, many-body, quantum phase is yet to be fully understood and experimentally revealed. Here we probe one of WC's most fundamental parameters, namely the energy gap that determines its low-temperature conductivity, in record-mobility, ultra-high-purity, two-dimensional electrons confined to GaAs quantum wells. The WC domains in these samples contain $\simeq$ 1000 electrons. The measured gaps are a factor of three larger than previously reported for lower quality samples, and agree remarkably well with values predicted for the lowest-energy, intrinsic, hyper-corelated bubble defects in a WC made of flux-electron composite fermions, rather than bare electrons. The agreement is particularly noteworthy, given that the calculations are done for disorder-free composite fermion WCs, and there are no adjustable parameters. The results reflect the exceptionally high quality of the samples, and suggest that composite fermion WCs are indeed more stable compared to their electron counterparts.</description>

Abstract: The corona of a nanoparticle immersed in a biological fluid is of key importance to its eventual fate and bioactivity in the environment or inside live tissues. It is critical to have insight into both the underlying bionano interactions and the corona composition to ensure biocompatibility of novel engineered nanomaterials. A prediction of these properties in silico requires the successful spanning of multiple orders of magnitude of both time and physical dimensions to produce results in a reasonable amount of time, necessitating the development of a multiscale modelling approach. Here, we present the NPCoronaPredict open-source software package: a suite of software tools to enable this prediction for complex multi-component nanomaterials in essentially arbitrary biological fluids, or more generally any medium containing organic molecules. The package integrates several recent physics-based computational models and a library of both physics-based and data-driven parameterisations for nanomaterials and organic molecules. We describe the underlying theoretical background and the package functionality from the design of multi-component NPs through to the evaluation of the corona.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic magnons on a M\"obius strip: topology-induced symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a M\"obius strip comprising of two antiferromagnetically coupled spin chains. To satisfy the boundary condition, magnon excitations feature linear polarization of the N\'eel vector devoid of chirality, forming two non-degenerate branches of modes that can neither be smoothly connected to nor be decomposed by the circularly-polarized magnons of opposite chirality commonly found in antiferromagnets. Only one branch supports standing-wave formation on the M\"obius strip while the other does not, owing to its spectral shift incurred by the boundary condition. Our findings unravel the profound impact of topology-induced symmetry breaking on magnons.</description>

      <title>Minimal Fractional Topological Insulator in half-filled conjugate moir\'{e} Chern bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a "minimal" fractional topological insulator (mFTI), motivated by the recent experimental report on the signatures of FTI at total filling factor $\nu_{\rm tot} = 3$ in a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moir\'{e} system. The observed FTI at $\nu_{\rm tot} = 3$ is likely given by a topological state living in a pair of half-filled conjugate Chern bands with Chern numbers $C=\pm 1$ on top of another pair of fully-filled conjugate Chern bands. We propose the mFTI as a strong candidate topological state in the half-filled conjugate Chern bands. The mFTI is characterized by the following features: (1) It is a fully gapped topological order with 32 Abelian anyons (including the electron); (2) the minimally-charged anyon carries electric charge $e^\ast = e/2$, together with the spin-Hall conductivity, implying that the mFTI's robust edge state remains gapless whenever time-reversal symmetry and charge conversation are present; (3) the mFTI is "minimal" in the sense that it has the smallest total quantum dimension (a metric for the topological order's complexity) within all the topological orders that can potentially be realized at the same electron filling of the system and with the same Hall transports; (4) the mFTI is the common descendant of multiple valley-decoupled "product topological orders" with larger quantum dimensions. It is also a symmetry-enriched topological order promoted from multiple symmetry-protected topological states, after gauging part of their symmetries.</description>

      <title>Multimode-cavity picture of non-Markovian waveguide QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a picture to describe and intrepret waveguide-QED problems in the non-Markovian regime of long photonic retardation times resulting in delayed coherent feedback. The framework is based on an intuitive spatial decomposition of the waveguide into blocks. Among these, the block directly coupled to the atoms embodies an effective lossy multimode cavity leaking into the rest of the waveguide, in turn embodying an effective white-noise bath. The dynamics can be approximated by retaining only a finite number of cavity modes that yet eventually grows with the time delay. This description captures the atomic as well as the field's dynamics, even with many excitations, in both emission and scattering processes. As an application, we show that the recently identified non-Markovian steady states can be understood by retaining very few or even only one cavity modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-terminal device consisting of an s-wave superconductor coupled to an altermagnet, to generate highly correlated spin currents via Cooper pair splitting. Remarkably, we find that the correlated spin currents are induced by specular Andreev reflections in the altermagnet, an effect that has up to now been predicted to occur only in a very limited number of systems, e.g., Dirac/Weyl materials coupled to superconductors. We demonstrate that positive non-local charge currents and positive noise cross-correlations are unambiguous fingerprints of the specular Andreev reflections in our proposed device.</description>

      <title>Water Isotope Separation using Deep Learning and a Catalytically Active Ultrathin Membrane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Water isotope separation, specifically separating heavy from light water, is a socially significant issue due to the usage of heavy water in applications such as nuclear magnetic resonance, nuclear power, and spectroscopy. Separation of heavy water from light water is difficult due to very similar physical and chemical properties between the isotopes. We show that a catalytically active ultrathin membrane (e.g., a nanopore in MoS2) can enable chemical exchange processes and physicochemical mechanisms that lead to efficient separation of deuterium from hydrogen, quantified as the D2O and deuterium separation ratio of 4.5 and 1.73, respectively. The separation process is inherently multiscale in nature with the shorter times representing chemical exchange processes and the longer timescales representing the transport phenomena. To bridge the timescales, we employ a deep learning methodology which uses short time scale ab-initio molecular dynamics data for training and extends the timescales to classical molecular dynamics regime to demonstrate isotope separation and reveal the underlying complex physicochemical processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In topological photonics, artificial photonic structures are constructed for realizing nontrivial unidirectional propagation of photonic information. On the other hand, moir\'e superlattices are emerging as an important avenue for engineering quantum materials with novel properties. In this paper, we combine these two aspects and demonstrate theoretically that moir\'e superlattices of small-angle twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene provide a natural platform for valley protected plasmons. Particularly, a complete plasmonic bandgap appears stemming from the distinct optical conductivities of the ABA and ABC stacked triangular domains. Moreover, the plasmonic crystals exhibit nonzero valley Chern numbers and unidirectional transport of plasmonic edge states protected from inter-valley scattering is presented.</description>

      <title>Stability of Anomalous Hall Crystals in multilayer rhombohedral graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent experiments showing an integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in pentalayer rhombohedral graphene have been interpreted in terms of a valley-polarized interaction-induced Chern band. The resulting many-body state can be viewed as an Anomalous Hall Crystal (AHC), with a further coupling to a weak moir\'e potential. We explain the origin of the Chern band and the corresponding AHC in the pentalayer system. We propose a simplified model that focuses on the physics near high symmetry Brillouin zone points to describe the competition between AHC and Wigner Crystal (WC) phases. We discuss the possible role of the moir\'e potential. We emphasize that even if in the moir\'e-less limit, the AHC is not favored over a correlated Fermi liquid, the moir\'e potential will push the system into a `moir\'e-enabled AHC'. We also suggest that there is a range of alignment angles between R5G and hBN where a $C = 2$ insulator may be found at integer filling.</description>

      <title>Topological Superconductivity by Engineering Noncollinear Magnetism in Magnet/ Superconductor Heterostructures: A Realistic Prescription for 2D Kitaev Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a realistic and rather general scheme where noncollinear magnetic textures proximitized with the most common $s$-wave superconductor can appear as the alternative to $p$-wave superconductor{--}the prime proposal to realize two-dimensional (2D) Kitaev model for topological superconductors (TSCs) hosting Majorana flat edge mode (MFEM). A general minimal Hamiltonian suitable for magnet/superconductor heterostructures reveals robust MFEM within the gap of Shiba bands due to the emergence of an effective ``$p_x+p_y$"-type $p$-wave pairing, spatially localized at the edges of a 2D magnetic domain of spin-spiral. We finally verify this concept by considering Mn (Cr) monolayer grown on a $s$-wave superconducting substrate, Nb(110) under strain (Nb(001)). In both 2D cases, the antiferromagnetic spin-spiral solutions exhibit robust MFEM at certain domain edges that is beyond the scope of the trivial extension of 1D spin-chain model in 2D. This approach, particularly when the MFEM appears in the TSC phase for such heterostructure materials, offers a perspective to extend the realm of the TSC in 2D.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.14923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the magneto-optical conductivity (and related magnitudes like transmittance and Faraday rotation of the irradiated polarized light) of some elemental two-dimensional Dirac materials of group IV (graphene analogues, buckled honeycomb lattices, like silicene, germanene, stannane, etc.), group V (phosphorene), and zincblende heterostructures (like HgTe/CdTe quantum wells) near the Dirac and gamma points, under out-of-plane magnetic and electric fields, to characterize topological-band insulator phase transitions and their critical points. We provide plots of the Faraday angle and transmittance as a function of the polarized light frequency, for different external electric and magnetic fields, chemical potential, HgTe layer thickness and temperature, to tune the material magneto-optical properties. We have shown that absortance/transmittance acquires extremal values at the critical point, where the Faraday angle changes sign, thus providing fine markers of the topological phase transition. In the case of non-topological materials as phosphorene, a minimum of the transmittance is also observed due to the energy gap closing by an external electric field.</description>

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dots operated dynamically are the basis of many quantum technologies such as quantum sensors and computers. Hence, modelling their electrical properties at microwave frequencies becomes essential to simulate their performance in larger electronic circuits. Here, we develop a self-consistent quantum master equation formalism to obtain the admittance of a quantum dot tunnel-coupled to a charge reservoir under the effect of a coherent photon bath. We find a general expression for the admittance that captures the well-known semiclassical (thermal) limit, along with the transition to lifetime and power broadening regimes due to the increased coupling to the reservoir and amplitude of the photonic drive, respectively. Furthermore, we describe two new photon-mediated regimes: Floquet broadening, determined by the dressing of the QD states, and broadening determined by photon loss in the system. Our results provide a method to simulate the high-frequency behaviour of QDs in a wide range of limits, describe past experiments, and propose novel explorations of QD-photon interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.11607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current proposals for topological quantum computation (TQC) based on Majorana zero modes (MZM) have mostly been focused on coupled-wire architecture which can be challenging to implement experimentally. To explore alternative building blocks of TQC, in this work we study the possibility of obtaining robust MZM at the corners of triangular superconducting islands, which often appear spontaneously in epitaxial growth. We first show that a minimal three-site triangle model of spinless $p$-wave superconductor allows MZM to appear at different pairs of vertices controlled by a staggered vector potential, which may be realized using coupled quantum dots and can already demonstrate braiding. For systems with less fine-tuned parameters, we suggest an alternative structure of a "hollow" triangle subject to uniform supercurrents or vector potentials, in which MZM generally appear when two of the edges are in a different topological phase from the third. We also discuss the feasibility of constructing the triangles using existing candidate MZM systems and of braiding more MZM in networks of such triangles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study scanning gate microscopy (SGM) of electron and hole trajectories in a quantum point contact (QPC) embedded in a normal-superconductor (NS) junction. At zero voltage bias, the electrons and holes transported through the QPC form angular lobes and are subject to self-interference, which marks the SGM conductance maps with interference fringes analogously as in normal systems. We predict that for an NS junction at non-zero bias a beating pattern is to occur in the conductance probed with the use of the SGM technique owing to a mismatch of the Fermi wavevectors of electrons and holes. Moreover, the SGM technique exposes a pronounced disturbance in the angular conductance pattern, as the retroreflected hole does not retrace the electron path due to wavevector difference.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Waves in a variety of fields in physics, such as mechanics, optics, spintronics, and nonlinear systems, obey generalized eigenvalue equations. To study non-Hermitian physics of those systems, in this paper, we construct a non-Bloch band theory of generalized eigenvalue problems. Specifically, we show that eigenvalues of a transfer matrix lead to a certain condition imposed on the generalized Brillouin zone, which allows us to develop a theory to calculate the continuum bands. As a concrete example, we examine the non-Hermitian skin effect of photonic crystals composed of chiral metamaterials by invoking our theoretical framework. When the medium has circularly polarized eigenmodes, we find that each eigenmode localizes at either of the edges, depending on whether it is left- or right-circularly polarized. In contrast, when the medium only has linearly polarized eigenmodes, every eigenmode localizes to the edge of the same side independent of its polarization. We demonstrate that the localization lengths of those eigenmodes can be determined from the chiral parameters and eigenfrequencies of the photonic crystal.</description>

Abstract: Quantum information transfer is fundamental for scalable quantum computing in any potential platform and architecture. Hole spin qubits, owing to their intrinsic spin-orbit interaction (SOI), promise fast quantum operations which are fundamental for the implementation of quantum gates. Yet, the influence of SOI in quantum transfer protocols remains an open question. Here, we investigate hole flying qubits using shortcuts to adiabaticity protocols, i.e., the long-range transfer of hole spin states and the quantum distribution of entangled pairs in semiconductor quantum dot arrays. We show that electric field manipulation allows dynamical control of the SOI, enabling simultaneously the implementation of quantum gates during the transfer, with the potential to significantly accelerate quantum algorithms. By harnessing the ability to perform quantum gates in parallel with the transfer, we employ dynamical decoupling schemes to focus and preserve the spin state, leading to higher transfer fidelity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent experiment [R. Nakajima, et al., Nature 613, 479 (2023)] has reported a pair of oppositely polarized spins under an alternating electric current in a superconductor with a chiral structure. However, these behaviors cannot be explained by the conventional Edelstein effect and require a new mechanism. In this Letter, we propose a mechanism of spin current generation under an external electric field due to chiral phonons in a chiral-structure superconductor based on the Bogoliubov de Gennes and the Boltzmann equations. In our mechanism, chiral phonons are induced by electric field due to inversion symmetry breaking and electron-phonon interaction. They work as an effective Zeeman field and hence spin-polarize Bogoliubov quasiparticles in the superconductor. As a result, the spin current carried by quasiparticles flows along the screw axis and shows a quadratic dependence on the electric field at the low-field range, leading to a nonreciprocal spin transport. The spin current also shows a nonmonotonic temperature dependence and has a maximum at around the superconducting transition temperature.</description>

Abstract: AB oscillation in weak magnetic field (B&lt;1.5kG) is observed in QPC due to interference between electrons propagating along different QPC channels. We also investigate photo-induced magnetoresistance oscillation in open-regime split-gate QPC under MW irradiation. It is attributed to EMPs interfering in the QPC region. The influence of MW power, frequency and split gate voltage is discussed thoroughly. We unify the result of photoconductance at B=0 with EMP theories.</description>

      <title>A discrete formulation for three-dimensional winding number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a smooth map $g\colon X \to U(N)$, where $X$ is a three-dimensional, oriented, and closed manifold, the winding number or the map's degree is defined by $W_3 = \frac{1}{24\pi^2} \int_{X} \mathrm{Tr}\left[(g^{-1}dg)^3\right]$. We introduce a method to compute $W_3$ using a discrete approximation of $X$ so that the result is manifestly quantized.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Hall effect from long-lived valley-polarizing relaxons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect has attracted much attention due to the famous, widely adopted interpretation in terms of the Berry curvature dipole in momentum space. Using ab initio Boltzmann transport equations, we find a 60% enhancement in the nonlinear Hall effect of p-doped GeTe and its noticeable frequency dependence, qualitatively different from the predictions based on the Berry curvature dipole. The origin of these differences is long-lived valley polarization in the electron distribution arising from electron-phonon scattering. Our findings await immediate experimental confirmation.</description>

Abstract: The density of quasiparticles typically observed in superconducting qubits exceeds the value expected in equilibrium by many orders of magnitude. Can this out-of-equilibrium quasiparticle density still possess an energy distribution in equilibrium with the phonon bath? Here, we answer this question affirmatively by measuring the thermal activation of charge-parity switching in a transmon qubit with a difference in superconducting gap on the two sides of the Josephson junction. We then demonstrate how the gap asymmetry of the device can be exploited to manipulate its parity.</description>

      <title>Tomasch Oscillations as Above-Gap Signature of Topological Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The identification of topological superconductors usually involves searching for in-gap modes that are protected by topology. However, in the current experimental settings, the smoking-gun evidence of these in-gap modes is still lacking. In this work, we propose to distinguish between two-dimensional conventional s-wave and topological p-wave superconductors by above-gap transport signatures. Our method utilizes the emergence of Tomasch oscillations of quasiparticles in a junction consisting of a superconductor sandwiched between two metallic leads. We demonstrate that the behavior of the oscillations in conductance as a function of the interface barriers provides a distinctive signature for s-wave and p-wave superconductors. Specifically, the oscillations become weaker as the barrier strength increases in s-wave superconductors, while they become more pronounced in p-wave superconductors, which we prove to be a direct manifestation of the pairing symmetries. Our method opens a new route for identifying topological superconductors through above-gap transport.</description>

      <title>Topological Signature of Stratospheric Poincare -- Gravity Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12191v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The rotation of the earth breaks time-reversal and reflection symmetries in an opposite sense north and south of the equator, leading to a topological origin for certain atmospheric and oceanic equatorial waves. Away from the equator the rotating shallow water and stably stratified primitive equations exhibit Poincare inertio-gravity waves that have nontrivial topology as evidenced by their strict superinertial timescale and a phase singularity in frequency-wavevector space. This non-trivial topology then predicts, via the principle of bulk-interface correspondence, the existence of two equatorial waves along the equatorial interface, the Kelvin and Yanai waves. To directly test the nontrivial topology of Poincare-gravity waves in observations, we examine ERA5 reanalysis data and study cross-correlations between the wind velocity and geopotential height of the mid-latitude stratosphere at the 50 hPa height. We find the predicted vortex and anti-vortex in the relative phase of the geopotential height and velocity at the high frequencies of the waves. By contrast, lower-frequency planetary waves are found to have trivial topology also as expected from theory. These results demonstrate a new way to understand stratospheric waves, and provide a new qualitative tool for the investigation of waves in other components of the climate system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the appearance of an unconventional Majorana zero mode whose wave function splits into multiple parts located at different ends of different topological superconductors, hereinafter referred to as a multi-locational Majorana zero mode. Specifically, we discuss the multi-locational Majorana zero modes in a three-terminal Josephson junction consisting of topological superconductors, which forms an elemental qubit of fault-tolerant topological quantum computers. We also demonstrate anomalously long-ranged nonlocal resonant transport phenomena caused by the multi-locational Majorana zero mode.</description>

      <title>Spectral Density Classification For Environment Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00831v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral densities encode the relevant information characterising the system-environment interaction in an open-quantum system problem. Such information is key to determining the system's dynamics. In this work, we leverage the potential of machine learning techniques to reconstruct the features of the environment. Specifically, we show that the time evolution of a system observable can be used by an artificial neural network to infer the main features of the spectral density. In particular, for relevant examples of spin-boson models, we can classify with high accuracy the Ohmicity parameter of the environment as either Ohmic, sub-Ohmic or super-Ohmic, thereby distinguishing between different forms of dissipation.</description>

      <title>Non-local transport measurements in hybrid quantum Hall - superconducting devices</title>

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in hybrid quantum Hall (QH) superconductor devices, driven by the prospect to realize exotic ground states and excitations with non-abelian exchange statistics. While the existing experiments clearly demonstrate Andreev coupling between the edge states and the superconductors, the question remains whether the quantum coherence could propagate between several superconducting contacts via chiral channels. To answer this question, we have first extended the Landauer-B\"uttiker (LB) formalism to samples with one superconducting contact and found a remarkable agreement within a series of measurements related to each other via LB-type formulae. We have then switched to the case of multiple superconducting contacts, and found that we can describe the measurements self-consistently if we neglect the superconducting phase coherence between multiple contacts. We interpret this result as a negative answer to the question posed above: the phase correlations between multiple superconducting contacts are not established via micron-long quantum Hall edge states. Looking forward, our approach may find applications in the broader field of topological superconductivity and proximal structures. Possible violations of the self-consistency tests presented here may be used as an indication that superconducting phase coherence is induced in the quantum Hall edges.</description>

      <title>Lorentz invariance violation and the CPT-odd electromagnetic response of a tilted anisotropic Weyl semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07791v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the electromagnetic response of a particular fermionic sector in the minimal QED contribution to the Standard Model Extension (SME), which can be physically realized in terms of a model describing a tilted and anisotropic Weyl semimetal (WSM). The contact is made through the identification of the Dirac-like Hamiltonian resulting from the SME with that corresponding to the WSM in the linearized tight-binding approximation. We first calculate the effective action by computing the non-perturbative vacuum polarization tensor using thermal field theory techniques, focusing upon the corrections at finite chemical potential and zero temperature. Next, we confirm our results by a direct calculation of the anomalous Hall current within a chiral kinetic theory approach.
  In an ideal Dirac cone picture of the WSM (isotropic and non-tilted) such response is known to be governed by axion electrodynamics, with the space-time dependent axion angle $\Theta (\mathbf{r},t) = 2 (\mathbf{b} \cdot \mathbf{r} - b _{0} t)$, being $2 \mathbf{b}$ and $2b _{0}$ the separation of the Weyl nodes in momentum and energy, respectively. In this paper we demonstrate that the node tilting and the anisotropies induce novel corrections at a finite density which however preserve the structure of the axionic field theory. We apply our results to the ideal Weyl semimetal $\mathrm{EuCd}_{2}\mathrm{As}_{2}$ and to the highly anisotropic and tilted monopnictide $\mathrm{TaAs}$.</description>
