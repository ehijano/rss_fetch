      <title>Reimagining Voltage-Controlled Cryogenic Boolean Logic Paradigm with Quantum-Enhanced Josephson Junction FETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for ultra low power computing and the emergence of quantum technologies have intensified interest in cryogenic electronics, particularly superconducting devices.Despite their promise, current controlled superconducting components face fundamental challenges in cascadability, limiting their effectiveness in complex logic architectures.To overcome this, recent efforts have focused on developing gate tunable superconducting devices, such as Josephson Junction Field Effect Transistors (JJFETs).However, achieving robust control and sufficient supercurrent gain, both critical for transistor-like performance in logic circuits remains a key challenge.A recent advancement in JJFET design, based on InAs and GaSb heterostructures, demonstrates enhanced gain and favorable device characteristics suitable for circuit integration.Building on this innovation, we propose and analyze fundamental voltage controlled logic topologies using the quantum enhanced JJFET. We develop a Verilog A based circuit compatible compact model of the quantum enhanced JJFET which accurately captures the experimentally observed device characteristics.To ensure cascadability, our logic circuits incorporate the multilayered Heater Nanocryotron (nTron), a superconducting nanowire-based thermal switch.Through simulation based analysis, we demonstrate the successful implementation of fundamental logic gates, including NOT, NAND, and NOR. Furthermore, we design a 3 input majority gate, which plays a pivotal role in quantum and reversible computing due to its universality.Finally, to demonstrate the cascadability of our proposed logic topology, we demonstrate the operation of a 2 input XOR gate based on our designed JJFET based NOT, NAND, and NOR gate.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Biology meets Neuromorphic Computing: Towards a bio-inspired Olfactory Perception System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore how the combination of synthetic biology, neuroscience modeling, and neuromorphic electronic systems offers a new approach to creating an artificial system that mimics the natural sense of smell. We argue that a co-design approach offers significant advantages in replicating the complex dynamics of odor sensing and processing. We propose a hybrid system of synthetic sensory neurons that provides three key features: (a) receptor-gated ion channels, (b) interface between synthetic biology and semiconductors and (c) event-based encoding and computing based on spiking networks. Our approach is validated using simulation-based modeling of the complete sensing and processing pipeline. This research seeks to develop a platform for ultra-sensitive, specific, and energy-efficient odor detection, with potential implications for environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, and security.</description>

      <title>Lattice Surgery Compilation Beyond the Surface Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation requires compiling logical circuits into physical operations tailored to a given architecture. Prior work addressing this challenge has mostly focused on the surface code and lattice surgery schemes. In this work, we broaden the scope by considering lattice surgery compilation for topological codes beyond the surface code. We begin by defining a code substrate - a blueprint for implementing topological codes and lattice surgery. We then abstract from the microscopic details and rephrase the compilation task as a mapping and routing problem on a macroscopic routing graph, potentially subject to substrate-specific constraints. We explore specific substrates and codes, including the color code and the folded surface code, providing detailed microscopic constructions. For the color code, we present numerical simulations analyzing how design choices at the microscopic and macroscopic levels affect the depth of compiled logical $\mathrm{CNOT}+\mathrm{T}$ circuits. An open-source code is available on GitHub https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qecc.</description>

      <title>Breaking the mould of Social Mixed Reality - State-of-the-Art and Glossary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article explores a critical gap in Mixed Reality (MR) technology: while advances have been made, MR still struggles to authentically replicate human embodiment and socio-motor interaction. For MR to enable truly meaningful social experiences, it needs to incorporate multi-modal data streams and multi-agent interaction capabilities. To address this challenge, we present a comprehensive glossary covering key topics such as Virtual Characters and Autonomisation, Responsible AI, Ethics by Design, and the Scientific Challenges of Social MR within Neuroscience, Embodiment, and Technology. Our aim is to drive the transformative evolution of MR technologies that prioritize human-centric innovation, fostering richer digital connections. We advocate for MR systems that enhance social interaction and collaboration between humans and virtual autonomous agents, ensuring inclusivity, ethical design and psychological safety in the process.</description>
