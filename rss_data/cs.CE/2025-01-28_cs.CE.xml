      <title>A cluster mean approach for topology optimization of natural frequencies and bandgaps with simple/multiple eigenfrequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel approach utilizing cluster means to address the non-differentiability issue arising from multiple eigenvalues in eigenfrequency and bandgap optimization. By constructing symmetric functions of repeated eigenvalues -- including cluster mean, p-norm and KS functions -- the study confirms their differentiability when all repeated eigenvalues are included, i.e., clusters are complete. Numerical sensitivity analyses indicate that, under some symmetry conditions, multiple eigenvalues may also be differentiable w.r.t the symmetric design variables. Notably, regardless of enforced symmetry, the cluster mean approach guarantees differentiability of multiple eigenvalues, offering a reliable solution strategy in eigenfrequency topology optimization. Optimization schemes are proposed to maximize eigenfrequencies and bandgaps by integrating cluster means with the bound formulations. The efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical examples on 2D and 3D solids and plate structures. All optimization results demonstrate smooth convergence under simple/multiple eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>HECLIP: Histology-Enhanced Contrastive Learning for Imputation of Transcriptomics Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Histopathology, particularly hematoxylin and eosin (H\&amp;E) staining, plays a critical role in diagnosing and characterizing pathological conditions by highlighting tissue morphology. However, H\&amp;E-stained images inherently lack molecular information, requiring costly and resource-intensive methods like spatial transcriptomics to map gene expression with spatial resolution. To address these challenges, we introduce HECLIP (Histology-Enhanced Contrastive Learning for Imputation of Profiles), an innovative deep learning framework that bridges the gap between histological imaging and molecular profiling. HECLIP is specifically designed to infer gene expression profiles directly from H\&amp;E-stained images, eliminating the need for expensive spatial transcriptomics assays. HECLIP leverages an advanced image-centric contrastive loss function to optimize image representation learning, ensuring that critical morphological patterns in histology images are effectively captured and translated into accurate gene expression profiles. This design enhances the predictive power of the image modality while minimizing reliance on gene expression data. Through extensive benchmarking on publicly available datasets, HECLIP demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches, delivering robust and biologically meaningful predictions. Detailed ablation studies further underscore its effectiveness in extracting molecular insights from histology images. Additionally, HECLIP's scalable and cost-efficient approach positions it as a transformative tool for both research and clinical applications, driving advancements in precision medicine. The source code for HECLIP is openly available at https://github.com/QSong-github/HECLIP.</description>

      <title>Finite Strain Robust Topology Optimization Considering Multiple Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a computational framework for the robust stiffness design of hyperelastic structures at finite deformations subject to various uncertain sources. In particular, the loading, material properties, and geometry uncertainties are incorporated within the topology optimization framework and are modeled by random vectors or random fields. A stochastic perturbation method is adopted to quantify uncertainties, and analytical adjoint sensitivities are derived for efficient gradient-based optimization. Moreover, the mesh distortion of low-density elements under finite deformations is handled by an adaptive linear energy interpolation scheme. The proposed robust topology optimization framework is applied to several examples, and the effects of different uncertain sources on the optimized topologies are systematically investigated. As demonstrated, robust designs are less sensitive to the variation of target uncertain sources than deterministic designs. Finally, it is shown that incorporating symmetry-breaking uncertainties in the topology optimization framework promotes stable designs compared to the deterministic counterpart, where -- when no stability constraint is included -- can lead to unstable designs.</description>

      <title>Structural Symmetry, Multiplicity, and Differentiability of Eigenfrequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the multiplicity and differentiability of eigenfrequencies in structures with various symmetries. In particular, the study explores how the geometric and design variable symmetries affect the distribution of eigenvalues, distinguishing between simple and multiple eigenvalues in 3-D trusses. Moreover, this article also examines the differentiability of multiple eigenvalues under various symmetry conditions, which is crucial for gradient-based optimization. The results presented in this study show that while full symmetry ensures the differentiability of all eigenvalues, increased symmetry in optimized design, such as accidental symmetry, may lead to non-differentiable eigenvalues. Additionally, the study presents solutions using symmetric functions, demonstrating their effectiveness in ensuring differentiability in scenarios where multiple eigenvalues are non-differentiable. The study also highlights a critical insight into the differentiability criterion of symmetric functions, i.e., the completeness of eigen-clusters, which is necessary to ensure the differentiability of such functions.</description>

      <title>A Token-FCM based risk assessment method for complex engineering designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Engineering design risks could cause unaffordable losses, and thus risk assessment plays a critical role in engineering design. On the other hand, the high complexity of modern engineering designs makes it difficult to assess risks effectively and accurately due to the complex two-way, dynamic causal-effect risk relations in engineering designs. To address this problem, this paper proposes a new risk assessment method called token fuzzy cognitive map (Token-FCM). Its basic idea is to model the two-way causal-risk relations with the FCM method, and then augment FCM with a token mechanism to model the dynamics in causal-effect risk relations. Furthermore, the fuzzy sets and the group decision-making method are introduced to initialize the Token-FCM method so that comprehensive and accurate risk assessments can be attained. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been demonstrated by a real example of engine design for a horizontal directional drilling machine.</description>

      <title>PhoTorch: A robust and generalized biochemical photosynthesis model fitting package based on PyTorch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have greatly benefited plant phenotyping and predictive modeling. However, unrealized opportunities exist in leveraging AI advancements in model parameter optimization for parameter fitting in complex biophysical models. This work developed novel software, PhoTorch, for fitting parameters of the Farquhar, von Caemmerer, and Berry (FvCB) biochemical photosynthesis model based the parameter optimization components of the popular AI framework PyTorch. The primary novelty of the software lies in its computational efficiency, robustness of parameter estimation, and flexibility in handling different types of response curves and sub-model functional forms. PhoTorch can fit both steady-state and non-steady-state gas exchange data with high efficiency and accuracy. Its flexibility allows for optional fitting of temperature and light response parameters, and can simultaneously fit light response curves and standard A/Ci curves. These features are not available within presently available A/Ci curve fitting packages. Results illustrated the robustness and efficiency of PhoTorch in fitting A/Ci curves with high variability and some level of artifacts and noise. PhoTorch is more than four times faster than benchmark software, which may be relevant when processing many non-steady-state A/Ci curves with hundreds of data points per curve. PhoTorch provides researchers from various fields with a reliable and efficient tool for analyzing photosynthetic data. The Python package is openly accessible from the repository: https://github.com/GEMINI-Breeding/photorch.</description>

      <title>CREATOR Case: PMSM and IM Electric Machine Data for Validation and Benchmarking of Simulation and Modeling Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the complete sets of data of two different machines, a PMSM and an IM, that are made available to the public for modeling and simulation validation and benchmarking. For both machines, not only the complete sets of design parameters, i.e., motor geometry, electrical parameters, material properties, and winding schemes as well as the measured low-frequency equivalent circuit parameters are provided, but also comprehensive measurement results on six different drive cycles to allow for transient investigations. The data packages provide all the required information in terms of design parameters and measurement results that facilitate modeling and simulation validation and benchmarking results for verification of different modeling approaches. The paper serves as the key reference user manual for the extensive and comprehensive sets of data made available. It is therefore recommended to follow up on the reading of the paper by a study of the data packages themselves. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first time that the complete sets of machine data of two different machines are published, allowing for benchmarking of modeling and simulation projects, and reproducibility and reusability following the FAIR data principle of analyses based on these data.</description>

      <title>Controllable Protein Sequence Generation with LLM Preference Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing proteins with specific attributes offers an important solution to address biomedical challenges. Pre-trained protein large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results on protein sequence generation. However, to control sequence generation for specific attributes, existing work still exhibits poor functionality and structural stability. In this paper, we propose a novel controllable protein design method called CtrlProt. We finetune a protein LLM with a new multi-listwise preference optimization strategy to improve generation quality and support multi-attribute controllable generation. Experiments demonstrate that CtrlProt can meet functionality and structural stability requirements effectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both single-attribute and multi-attribute protein sequence generation.</description>

      <title>Transient Finite Element Simulation of Accelerator Magnets Using Thermal Thin Shell Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal transient responses of superconducting magnets can be simulated using the finite element (FE) method. Some accelerator magnets use cables whose electric insulation is significantly thinner than the bare electric conductor. The FE discretisation of such geometries with high-quality meshes leads to many degrees of freedom. This increases the computational time, particularly since non-linear material properties are involved. In this work, we propose to use a thermal thin-shell approximation (TSA) to improve the computational efficiency when solving the heat diffusion equation in two dimensions. We apply the method to compute the thermal transient response of superconducting accelerator magnets used for CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and High-Luminosity LHC. The TSA collapses thin electrical insulation layers into lines while accurately representing the thermal gradient across the insulation's thickness. The TSA is implemented in the multipole module of the open-source Finite Element Quench Simulator (FiQuS), which can generate the multipole magnet models programmatically from input text files. First, the TSA approach is verified by comparison to classical FE simulations with meshed surface insulation regions for a simple block of four cables and a detailed model of the MBH dipole. The results show that the TSA approach reduces the computational time significantly while preserving the accuracy of the solution. Second, the quench heater (QH) delay computed with the TSA method is compared to measurements for the MBH magnet. To this end, the thermal transient simulation is coupled to a magnetostatic solution to account for magneto-resistive effects. Third, the TSA's full capabilities are showcased in non-linear magneto-thermal simulations of several LHC and HL-LHC superconducting magnet models. The full source code, including all input files, is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Inverse Reinforcement Learning via Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) problem, where an unknown reward function of some Markov decision process is estimated based on observed expert demonstrations. In most existing approaches, IRL is formulated and solved as a nonconvex optimization problem, posing challenges in scenarios where robustness and reproducibility are critical. We discuss a convex formulation of the IRL problem (CIRL) initially proposed by Ng and Russel, and reformulate the problem such that the domain-specific language CVXPY can be applied directly to specify and solve the convex problem. We also extend the CIRL problem to scenarios where the expert policy is not given analytically but by trajectory as state-action pairs, which can be strongly inconsistent with optimality, by augmenting some of the constraints. Theoretical analysis and practical implementation for hyperparameter auto-selection are introduced. This note helps the users to easily apply CIRL for their problems, without background knowledge on convex optimization.</description>

      <title>An Air-Gap Element for the Isogeometric Space-Time-Simulation of Electric Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-time methods promise more efficient time-domain simulations, in particular of electrical machines. However, most approaches require the motion to be known in advance so that it can be included in the space-time mesh. To overcome this problem, this paper proposes to use the well-known air-gap element for the rotor-stator coupling of an isogeometric machine model. First, we derive the solution in the air-gap region and then employ it to couple the rotor and stator. This coupling is angle dependent and we show how to efficiently update the coupling matrices to a different angle, avoiding expensive quadrature. Finally, the resulting time-dependent problem is solved in a space-time setting. The spatial discretization using isogeometric analysis is particularly suitable for coupling via the air-gap element, as NURBS can exactly represent the geometry of the air-gap. Furthermore, the model including the air-gap element can be seamlessly transferred to the space-time setting. However, the air-gap element is well known in the literature. The originality of this work is the application to isogeometric analysis and space-time.</description>

      <title>Computational Protein Science in the Era of Large Language Models (LLMs)</title>

Abstract: Considering the significance of proteins, computational protein science has always been a critical scientific field, dedicated to revealing knowledge and developing applications within the protein sequence-structure-function paradigm. In the last few decades, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made significant impacts in computational protein science, leading to notable successes in specific protein modeling tasks. However, those previous AI models still meet limitations, such as the difficulty in comprehending the semantics of protein sequences, and the inability to generalize across a wide range of protein modeling tasks. Recently, LLMs have emerged as a milestone in AI due to their unprecedented language processing &amp; generalization capability. They can promote comprehensive progress in fields rather than solving individual tasks. As a result, researchers have actively introduced LLM techniques in computational protein science, developing protein Language Models (pLMs) that skillfully grasp the foundational knowledge of proteins and can be effectively generalized to solve a diversity of sequence-structure-function reasoning problems. While witnessing prosperous developments, it's necessary to present a systematic overview of computational protein science empowered by LLM techniques. First, we summarize existing pLMs into categories based on their mastered protein knowledge, i.e., underlying sequence patterns, explicit structural and functional information, and external scientific languages. Second, we introduce the utilization and adaptation of pLMs, highlighting their remarkable achievements in promoting protein structure prediction, protein function prediction, and protein design studies. Then, we describe the practical application of pLMs in antibody design, enzyme design, and drug discovery. Finally, we specifically discuss the promising future directions in this fast-growing field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has experienced significant advancement over the past decade, prompting a growing interest in applications within finance. This survey critically evaluates 167 publications, exploring diverse RL applications and frameworks in finance. Financial markets, marked by their complexity, multi-agent nature, information asymmetry, and inherent randomness, serve as an intriguing test-bed for RL. Traditional finance offers certain solutions, and RL advances these with a more dynamic approach, incorporating machine learning methods, including transfer learning, meta-learning, and multi-agent solutions. This survey dissects key RL components through the lens of Quantitative Finance. We uncover emerging themes, propose areas for future research, and critique the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods.</description>

      <title>SINDyG: Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-Structured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04463v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combination of machine learning (ML) and sparsity-promoting techniques is enabling direct extraction of governing equations from data, revolutionizing computational modeling in diverse fields of science and engineering. The discovered dynamical models could be used to address challenges in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, epidemiology, and beyond. However, most existing sparse identification methods for discovering dynamical systems treat the whole system as one without considering the interactions between subsystems. As a result, such models are not able to capture small changes in the emergent system behavior. To address this issue, we developed a new method called Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-structured data (SINDyG), which incorporates the network structure into sparse regression to identify model parameters that explain the underlying network dynamics. We showcase the application of our proposed method using several case studies of neuronal dynamics, where we model the macroscopic oscillation of a population of neurons using the extended Stuart-Landau (SL) equation and utilize the SINDyG method to identify the underlying nonlinear dynamics. Our extensive computational experiments validate the improved accuracy and simplicity of discovered network dynamics when compared to the original SINDy approach.</description>

Abstract: The emerging field of DNA storage employs strands of DNA bases (A/T/C/G) as a storage medium for digital information to enable massive density and durability. The DNA storage pipeline includes: (1) encoding the raw data into sequences of DNA bases; (2) synthesizing the sequences as DNA \textit{strands} that are stored over time as an unordered set; (3) sequencing the DNA strands to generate DNA \textit{reads}; and (4) deducing the original data. The DNA synthesis and sequencing stages each generate several independent error-prone duplicates of each strand which are then utilized in the final stage to reconstruct the best estimate for the original strand. Specifically, the reads are first \textit{clustered} into groups likely originating from the same strand (based on their similarity to each other), and then each group approximates the strand that led to the reads of that group. This work improves the DNA clustering stage by embedding it as part of the DNA sequencing. Traditional DNA storage solutions begin after the DNA sequencing process generates discrete DNA reads (A/T/C/G), yet we identify that there is untapped potential in using the raw signals generated by the Nanopore DNA sequencing machine before they are discretized into bases, a process known as \textit{basecalling}, which is done using a deep neural network. We propose a deep neural network that clusters these signals directly, demonstrating superior accuracy, and reduced computation times compared to current approaches that cluster after basecalling.</description>
