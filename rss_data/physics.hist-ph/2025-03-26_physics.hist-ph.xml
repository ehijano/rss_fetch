      <title>Weak Particle Presence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of presence has been extensively explored in philosophy, yet the notion of particle presence within quantum theory remains under-examined. In this article, we explore particle presence through an analysis of a paradox arising from weak measurements. We show that the classical intuition about particle presence involves an erroneous logical combination of propositions from single-time weak values, leading to inconsistencies that result in the deduction of discontinuous trajectories. Instead, we argue that by treating presence as a property defined across time by measuring sequential weak values, the discontinuity paradox is resolved, providing a coherent, non-classical account of particle presence. We discuss some advantages and drawbacks of this account, and consider applications to other cases of trajectory discontinuity.</description>

      <title>Reframing the Free Will Debate: The Universe is Not Deterministic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free will discourse is primarily centred around the thesis of determinism. Much of the literature takes determinism as its starting premise, assuming it true for the sake of discussion, and then proceeds to present arguments for why, if determinism is true, free will would be either possible or impossible. This is reflected in the theoretical terrain of the debate, with the primary distinction currently being between compatibilists and incompatibilists and not, as one might expect, between free will realists and skeptics. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, we argue that there is no reason to accept such a framing. We show that, on the basis of modern physics, there is no good evidence that physical determinism of any variety provides an accurate description of our universe and lots of evidence against such a view. Moreover, we show that this analysis extends equally to the sort of indeterministic worldviews endorsed by many libertarian philosophers and their skeptics, a worldview which we refer to as determinism plus randomness. The papers secondary aim is therefore to present an alternative conception of indeterminism, which is more in line with the empirical evidence from physics. It is this indeterministic worldview, we suggest, that ought to be the central focus of a reframed philosophy of free will.</description>
