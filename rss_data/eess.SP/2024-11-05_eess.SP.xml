      <title>Precoded faster-than-Nyquist signaling using optimal power allocation for OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precoded orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation scheme relying on faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) transmission over doubly selective fading channels is {proposed}, which enhances the spectral efficiency and improves the Doppler resilience. We derive the input-output relationship of the FTN signaling in the delay-Doppler domain. Eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) is used for eliminating both the effects of inter-symbol interference and correlated additive noise encountered in the delay-Doppler domain to enable efficient symbol-by-symbol demodulation. Furthermore, the power allocation coefficients of individual frames are optimized for maximizing the mutual information under the constraint of the derived total transmit power. Our performance results demonstrate that the proposed FTN-based OTFS scheme can enhance the information rate while achieving a comparable BER performance to that of its conventional Nyquist-based OTFS counterpart that employs the same root-raised-cosine shaping filter.</description>

      <title>Measurement-based Characterization of ISAC Channels with Distributed Beamforming at Dual mmWave Bands and with Human Body Scattering and Blockage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce our millimeter-wave (mmWave) radio channel measurement for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenarios with distributed links at dual bands in an indoor cavity; we also characterize the channel in delay and azimuth-angular domains for the scenarios with the presence of 1 person with varying locations and facing orientations. In our setting of distributed links with two transmitters and two receivers where each transceiver operates at two bands, we can measure two links whose each transmitter faces to one receiver and thus capable of line-of-sight (LOS) communication; these two links have crossing Fresnel zones. We have another two links capable of capturing the reflectivity from the target presenting in the test area (as well as the background). The numerical results in this paper focus on analyzing the channel with the presence of one person. It is evident that not only the human location, but also the human facing orientation, shall be taken into account when modeling the ISAC channel.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning for Trajectory and Phase Shift Optimization of Aerial RIS in CoMP-NOMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential of aerial reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ARIS) to enhance coordinated multi-point non-orthogonal multiple access (CoMP-NOMA) networks. We consider a system model where a UAV-mounted RIS assists in serving multiple users through NOMA while coordinating with multiple base stations. The optimization of UAV trajectory, RIS phase shifts, and NOMA power control constitutes a complex problem due to the hybrid nature of the parameters, involving both continuous and discrete values. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel framework utilizing the multi-output proximal policy optimization (MO-PPO) algorithm. MO-PPO effectively handles the diverse nature of these optimization parameters, and through extensive simulations, we demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving near-optimal performance and adapting to dynamic environments. Our findings highlight the benefits of integrating ARIS in CoMP-NOMA networks for improved spectral efficiency and coverage in future wireless networks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we pave the way to six-generation (6G) by investigating the outage probability (OP) of fluid antenna system (FAS)-active reconfigurable intelligent surface (ARIS) communication systems. We consider a FAS-ARIS setup consisting of a base station (BS) with a single fixed-position antenna and a receiver equipped with a fluid antenna (FA). Utilizing the block-correlation model, we derive a closed-form expression for the OP. Our analysis, supported by numerical results, confirms the accuracy and effectiveness of the derivation. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that the FAS-ARIS system significantly outperforms other configurations in terms of OP, highlighting its potential to enhance communication performance and reliability in future 6G networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the security of fluid antenna system (FAS)-reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) communication systems. The base station (BS) employs a single fixed-position antenna, while both the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper are equipped with fluid antennas. By utilizing the block-correlation model and the central limit theorem (CLT), we derive approximate expressions for the average secrecy capacity and secrecy outage probability (SOP). Our analysis, validated by simulation results, demonstrates the effectiveness of the block-correlation model in accurately assessing the security performance. Moreover, simulation results reveal that FAS-RIS system significantly outperforms other systems in terms of security, further underscoring its potential in secure communication applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing LMMSE Performance with Modest Complexity Increase via Neural Network Equalizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BCJR algorithm is renowned for its optimal equalization, minimizing bit error rate (BER) over intersymbol interference (ISI) channels. However, its complexity grows exponentially with the channel memory, posing a significant computational burden. In contrast, the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) equalizer offers a notably simpler solution, albeit with reduced performance compared to the BCJR. Recently, Neural Network (NN) based equalizers have emerged as promising alternatives. Trained to map observations to the original transmitted symbols, these NNs demonstrate performance similar to the BCJR algorithm. However, they often entail a high number of learnable parameters, resulting in complexities comparable to or even larger than the BCJR. This paper explores the potential of NN-based equalization with a reduced number of learnable parameters and low complexity. We introduce a NN equalizer with complexity comparable to LMMSE, surpassing LMMSE performance and achieving a modest performance gap from the BCJR equalizer. A significant challenge with NNs featuring a limited parameter count is their susceptibility to converging to local minima, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel NN equalizer architecture with a unique initialization approach based on LMMSE. This innovative method effectively overcomes optimization challenges and enhances LMMSE performance, applicable both with and without turbo decoding.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Localization With Coprime Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-aperture coprime arrays (CAs) are expected to achieve higher sensing resolution than conventional dense arrays (DAs), yet with lower hardware and energy cost. However, existing CA far-field localization methods cannot be directly applied to near-field scenarios due to channel model mismatch. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose an efficient near-field localization method for CAs. Specifically, we first construct an effective covariance matrix, which allows to decouple the target angle-and-range estimation. Then, a customized two-phase multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm for CAs is proposed, which first detects all possible targets' angles by using an angular-domain MUSIC algorithm, followed by the second phase to resolve the true targets' angles and ranges by devising a range-domain MUSIC algorithm. Finally, we show that the proposed method is able to locate more targets than the subarray-based method as well as achieve lower root mean square error (RMSE) than DAs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A low-power integer-N frequency synthesizer for flexible on-chip clock generation has been designed in 65 nm CMOS technology. The circuit can be programmed to generate two independent low-jitter clocks between 30 MHz and 3 GHz that are locked a 10-50 MHz reference input. The design uses a phase-locked loop (PLL) with a dual-tuned LC voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), programmable feedback divider, and dual output dividers. The total power consumption from 1.2 V and 0.8 V supplies is 4.0 mW. Experimental results confirm the functionality of the proposed synthesizer over a wide range of output frequencies.</description>

      <title>Online Graph Learning via Time-Vertex Adaptive Filters: From Theory to Cardiac Fibrillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Signal Processing (GSP) provides a powerful framework for analysing complex, interconnected systems by modelling data as signals on graphs. Recent advances in GSP have enabled the learning of graph structures from observed signals, but these methods often struggle with time-varying systems and real-time applications. Adaptive filtering techniques, while effective for online learning, have seen limited application in graph topology estimation from a GSP perspective. To this end, we introduce AdaCGP, an online algorithm for adaptive estimation of the Graph Shift Operator (GSO) from multivariate time series. The GSO is estimated from an adaptive time-vertex autoregressive model through recursive update formulae designed to address sparsity, shift-invariance and bias. Through simulations, we show that AdaCGP performs consistently well across various graph topologies, and achieves improvements in excess of 82% for GSO estimation compared to baseline adaptive vector autoregressive models. In addition, our online variable splitting approach for enforcing sparsity enables near-perfect precision in identifying causal connections while maintaining low false positive rates upon optimisation of the forecast error. Finally, AdaCGP's ability to track changes in graph structure is demonstrated on recordings of ventricular fibrillation dynamics in response to an anti-arrhythmic drug. AdaCGP is shown to be able to identify the stability of critical conduction patterns that may be maintaining the arrhythmia in an intuitive way, together with its potential to support diagnosis and treatment strategies.</description>

      <title>BiT-MamSleep: Bidirectional Temporal Mamba for EEG Sleep Staging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenges in automatic sleep stage classification, particularly the high computational cost, inadequate modeling of bidirectional temporal dependencies, and class imbalance issues faced by Transformer-based models. To address these limitations, we propose BiT-MamSleep, a novel architecture that integrates the Triple-Resolution CNN (TRCNN) for efficient multi-scale feature extraction with the Bidirectional Mamba (BiMamba) mechanism, which models both short- and long-term temporal dependencies through bidirectional processing of EEG data. Additionally, BiT-MamSleep incorporates an Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR) module and a temporal enhancement block to dynamically refine feature importance, optimizing classification accuracy without increasing computational complexity. To further improve robustness, we apply optimization techniques such as Focal Loss and SMOTE to mitigate class imbalance. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that BiT-MamSleep significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in handling long EEG sequences and addressing class imbalance, leading to more accurate and scalable sleep stage classification.</description>

      <title>Target Handover in Distributed Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of 6G distributed integrated sensing and communications (DISAC) builds upon the functionality of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) by integrating distributed architectures, significantly enhancing both sensing and communication coverage and performance. In 6G DISAC systems, tracking target trajectories requires base stations (BSs) to hand over their tracked targets to neighboring BSs. Determining what information to share, where, how, and when is critical to effective handover. This paper addresses the target handover challenge in DISAC systems and introduces a method enabling BSs to share essential target trajectory information at appropriate time steps, facilitating seamless handovers to other BSs. The target tracking problem is tackled using the standard trajectory Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (TPMBM) filter, enhanced with the proposed handover algorithm. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the implemented tracking solution.</description>

      <title>User Activity Detection with Delay-Calibration for Asynchronous Massive Random Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work considers an uplink asynchronous massive random access scenario in which a large number of users asynchronously access a base station equipped with multiple receive antennas. The objective is to alleviate the problem of massive collision due to the limited number of orthogonal preambles of an access scheme in which user activity detection is performed. We propose a user activity detection with delay-calibration (UAD-DC) algorithm and investigate the benefits of oversampling for the estimation of continuous time delays at the receiver. The proposed algorithm iteratively estimates time delays and detects active users by noting that the collided users can be identified through accurate estimation of time delays. Due to the sporadic user activity patterns, the user activity detection problem can be formulated as a compressive sensing (CS) problem, which can be solved by a modified Turbo-CS algorithm under the consideration of correlated noise samples resulting from oversampling. A sliding-window technique is applied in the proposed algorithm to reduce the overall computational complexity. Moreover, we propose a new design of the pulse shaping filter by minimizing the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao bound of the detection problem under the constraint of limited spectral bandwidth. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in terms of the normalized mean squared error of the estimated channel, the probability of misdetection and the successful detection ratio.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Trustworthy Semantic Communication for Audio-Visual Event Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth in wireless data traffic, driven by the proliferation of mobile devices and smart applications, poses significant challenges for modern communication systems. Ensuring the secure and reliable transmission of multimodal semantic information is increasingly critical, particularly for tasks like Audio-Visual Event (AVE) localization. This letter introduces MMTrustSC, a novel framework designed to address these challenges by enhancing the security and reliability of multimodal communication. MMTrustSC incorporates advanced semantic encoding techniques to safeguard data integrity and privacy. It features a two-level coding scheme that combines error-correcting codes with conventional encoders to improve the accuracy and reliability of multimodal data transmission. Additionally, MMTrustSC employs hybrid encryption, integrating both asymmetric and symmetric encryption methods, to secure semantic information and ensure its confidentiality and integrity across potentially hostile networks. Simulation results validate MMTrustSC's effectiveness, demonstrating substantial improvements in data transmission accuracy and reliability for AVE localization tasks. This framework represents a significant advancement in managing intermodal information complementarity and mitigating physical noise, thus enhancing overall system performance.</description>

      <title>From Theory to Reality: A Design Framework for Integrated Communication and Computing Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel flexible and scalable framework to design integrated communication and computing (ICC) -- a.k.a. over-the-air computing (AirComp) -- receivers. To elaborate, while related literature so far has generally focused either on theoretical aspects of ICC or on the design of beamforming (BF) algorithms for AirComp, we propose a framework to design receivers capable of simultaneously detecting communication symbols and extracting the output of the AirComp operation, in a manner that can: a) be systematically generalized to any nomographic function, b) scaled to a massive number of user equipments (UEs) and edge devices (EDs), and c) support the multiple computation streams. For the sake of illustration, we demonstrate the proposed method under a setting consisting of the uplink from multiple single-antenna UEs/EDs simultaneously transmitting communication and computing signals to a single multiple-antenna base station (BS)/access point (AP). The receiver, which seeks to detect all communication symbols and minimize the distortion over the computing signals, requires that only a fraction of the transmit power be allocated to the latter, therefore coming close to the ideal (but unattainable) condition that computing is achieved "for free", without taking resources from the communication system. The design leverages the Gaussian belief propagation (GaBP) framework relying only on element-wise scalar operations, which allows for its use in massive settings, as demonstrated by simulation results incorporating up to 200 antennas and 200 UEs/EDs. They also demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method under all various loading conditions, with the performance of the scheme approaching fundamental limiting bounds in the under/fully loaded cases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the investigation of the bistatic MIMO radar for estimating various multitarget parameters of interest in the presence of clutter and noise. The parameters of interest include Direction of Departure (DOD), Direction of Arrival (DOA), range and velocity and a novel algorithm is proposed for estimating these target parameters based on the concepts of the "array manifold" and "manifold extenders". The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using Monte Carlo simulation studies.</description>

      <title>A proposed signal discovery method in interstellar communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments conducted since 2018, using three geographically spaced synchronized radio telescopes, and a radio interferometer, indicate the presence of anomalous narrow bandwidth pulse pairs, conjectured to be sourced from a celestial direction near the star Rigel. Many explanatory hypotheses are possible. In the current work, a measurement method is proposed and implemented to attempt to provide high levels of statistical power of narrowband pulse pair observations, while minimizing interferometer instrument adjustments that might bias the experiment. Using the proposed method, twenty pulse pairs having statistical power at 5 to 10 standard deviations, and one pulse pair at 22 standard deviations of mean shift of pulse pair count, were observed in the prior celestial direction range, while using other celestial directions as an experimental comparison group. High levels of standard deviations of pulse pair count mean shift, observed in this 92 day experiment, imply the falsification of a Gaussian noise hypothesis. Alternate and auxiliary hypotheses, and further experiments, are sought to try to explain the narrow bandwidth pulsed signals.</description>

      <title>Cooperative and Collaborative Multi-Task Semantic Communication for Distributed Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a multi-task semantic communication (SemCom) system for distributed sources, extending the existing focus on collaborative single-task execution. We build on the cooperative multi-task processing introduced in [1], which divides the encoder into a common unit (CU) and multiple specific units (SUs). While earlier studies in multi-task SemCom focused on full observation settings, our research explores a more realistic case where only distributed partial observations are available, such as in a production line monitored by multiple sensing nodes. To address this, we propose an SemCom system that supports multi-task processing through cooperation on the transmitter side via split structure and collaboration on the receiver side. We have used an information-theoretic perspective with variational approximations for our end-to-end data-driven approach. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed cooperative and collaborative multi-task (CCMT) SemCom system significantly improves task execution accuracy, particularly in complex datasets, if the noise introduced from the communication channel is not limiting the task performance too much. Our findings contribute to a more general SemCom framework capable of handling distributed sources and multiple tasks simultaneously, advancing the applicability of SemCom systems in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Bilinear Precoder Based Efficient Rate Splitting Method in FDD Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a low-cost rate splitting (RS) technique for a multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) system operating in frequency division duplex (FDD) mode. The proposed iterative optimisation algorithm only depends on the second-order statistical channel knowledge and the pilot training matrix. Additionally, it offers a closed-form solution in each update step. This reduces the design complexity of the system drastically as we only need to optimise the precoding filters in every coherence interval of the covariance matrices, instead of doing that in every channel state information (CSI) coherence interval. Moreover, since the algorithm is based on closed-form solutions, there is no need for interior point solvers like CVX, which are typically required in most state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Multi-UAV Collaborative Sensing Data Collection: A Hybrid TDMA-NOMA-Cooperative Transmission in Cell-Free MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates a collaborative sensing and data collection system in which multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) sense an area of interest and transmit images to a cloud server (CS) for processing. To accelerate the completion of sensing missions, including data transmission, the sensing task is divided into individual private sensing tasks for each UAV and a common sensing task that is executed by all UAVs to enable cooperative transmission. Unlike existing studies, we explore the use of an advanced cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network, which effectively manages inter-UAV interference. To further optimize wireless channel utilization, we propose a hybrid transmission strategy that combines time-division multiple access (TDMA), non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA), and cooperative transmission. The problem of jointly optimizing task splitting ratios and the hybrid TDMA-NOMA-cooperative transmission strategy is formulated with the objective of minimizing mission completion time. Extensive numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed task allocation and hybrid transmission scheme in accelerating the completion of sensing missions.</description>

      <title>Blind Time-of-Flight Imaging: Sparse Deconvolution on the Continuum with Unknown Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, computational Time-of-Flight (ToF) imaging has emerged as an exciting and a novel imaging modality that offers new and powerful interpretations of natural scenes, with applications extending to 3D, light-in-flight, and non-line-of-sight imaging. Mathematically, ToF imaging relies on algorithmic super-resolution, as the back-scattered sparse light echoes lie on a finer time resolution than what digital devices can capture. Traditional methods necessitate knowledge of the emitted light pulses or kernels and employ sparse deconvolution to recover scenes. Unlike previous approaches, this paper introduces a novel, blind ToF imaging technique that does not require kernel calibration and recovers sparse spikes on a continuum, rather than a discrete grid. By studying the shared characteristics of various ToF modalities, we capitalize on the fact that most physical pulses approximately satisfy the Strang-Fix conditions from approximation theory. This leads to a new mathematical formulation for sparse super-resolution. Our recovery approach uses an optimization method that is pivoted on an alternating minimization strategy. We benchmark our blind ToF method against traditional kernel calibration methods, which serve as the baseline. Extensive hardware experiments across different ToF modalities demonstrate the algorithmic advantages, flexibility and empirical robustness of our approach. We show that our work facilitates super-resolution in scenarios where distinguishing between closely spaced objects is challenging, while maintaining performance comparable to known kernel situations. Examples of light-in-flight imaging and light-sweep videos highlight the practical benefits of our blind super-resolution method in enhancing the understanding of natural scenes.</description>

      <title>Scalable AI Framework for Defect Detection in Metal Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Additive Manufacturing (AM) is transforming the manufacturing sector by enabling efficient production of intricately designed products and small-batch components. However, metal parts produced via AM can include flaws that cause inferior mechanical properties, including reduced fatigue response, yield strength, and fracture toughness. To address this issue, we leverage convolutional neural networks (CNN) to analyze thermal images of printed layers, automatically identifying anomalies that impact these properties. We also investigate various synthetic data generation techniques to address limited and imbalanced AM training data. Our models' defect detection capabilities were assessed using images of Nickel alloy 718 layers produced on a laser powder bed fusion AM machine and synthetic datasets with and without added noise. Our results show significant accuracy improvements with synthetic data, emphasizing the importance of expanding training sets for reliable defect detection. Specifically, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)-generated datasets streamlined data preparation by eliminating human intervention while maintaining high performance, thereby enhancing defect detection capabilities. Additionally, our denoising approach effectively improves image quality, ensuring reliable defect detection. Finally, our work integrates these models in the CLoud ADditive MAnufacturing (CLADMA) module, a user-friendly interface, to enhance their accessibility and practicality for AM applications. This integration supports broader adoption and practical implementation of advanced defect detection in AM processes.</description>

      <title>An incremental algorithm based on multichannel non-negative matrix partial co-factorization for ambient denoising in auscultation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this study is to implement a method to remove ambient noise in biomedical sounds captured in auscultation. We propose an incremental approach based on multichannel non-negative matrix partial co-factorization (NMPCF) for ambient denoising focusing on high noisy environment with a Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) &lt;= -5 dB. The first contribution applies NMPCF assuming that ambient noise can be modelled as repetitive sound events simultaneously found in two single-channel inputs captured by means of different recording devices. The second contribution proposes an incremental algorithm, based on the previous multichannel NMPCF, that refines the estimated biomedical spectrogram throughout a set of incremental stages by eliminating most of the ambient noise that was not removed in the previous stage at the expense of preserving most of the biomedical spectral content. The ambient denoising performance of the proposed method, compared to some of the most relevant state-of-the-art methods, has been evaluated using a set of recordings composed of biomedical sounds mixed with ambient noise that typically surrounds a medical consultation room to simulate high noisy environments with a SNR from -20 dB to -5 dB. Experimental results report that: (i) the performance drop suffered by the proposed method is lower compared to MSS and NLMS; (ii) unlike what happens with MSS and NLMS, the proposed method shows a stable trend of the average SDR and SIR results regardless of the type of ambient noise and the SNR level evaluated; and (iii) a remarkable advantage is the high robustness of the estimated biomedical sounds when the two single-channel inputs suffer from a delay between them.</description>

      <title>Convolutional Filtering with RKHS Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a generalized theory of convolutional signal processing and neural networks for Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). Leveraging the theory of algebraic signal processing (ASP), we show that any RKHS allows the formal definition of multiple algebraic convolutional models. We show that any RKHS induces algebras whose elements determine convolutional operators acting on RKHS elements. This approach allows us to achieve scalable filtering and learning as a byproduct of the convolutional model, and simultaneously take advantage of the well-known benefits of processing information in an RKHS. To emphasize the generality and usefulness of our approach, we show how algebraic RKHS can be used to define convolutional signal models on groups, graphons, and traditional Euclidean signal spaces. Furthermore, using algebraic RKHS models, we build convolutional networks, formally defining the notion of pointwise nonlinearities and deriving explicit expressions for the training. Such derivations are obtained in terms of the algebraic representation of the RKHS. We present a set of numerical experiments on real data in which wireless coverage is predicted from measurements captured by unmaned aerial vehicles. This particular real-life scenario emphasizes the benefits of the convolutional RKHS models in neural networks compared to fully connected and standard convolutional operators.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel iterative detection and decoding (IDD) scheme for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-assisted multiuser multiple-antenna systems. The proposed approach introduces a joint iterative detection strategy that integrates Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes, RIS processing and iterative detection and decoding. In particular, we employ a minimum mean square error receive filter that performs truncation at the RIS and soft interference cancelation at the receiver. Simulation results evaluate the system's overall capacity and bit error rate, and demonstrate substantial improvements in bit error rate across block-fading channels.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Glucose Level Prediction of ICU Patients through Irregular Time-Series Analysis and Integrated Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting blood glucose (BG) levels of ICU patients is critical, as both hypoglycemia (BG &lt; 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (BG &gt; 180 mg/dL) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. We develop the Multi-source Irregular Time-Series Transformer (MITST), a novel machine learning-based model to forecast the next BG level, classifying it into hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, or euglycemia (70-180 mg/dL). The irregularity and complexity of Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, spanning multiple heterogeneous clinical sources like lab results, medications, and vital signs, pose significant challenges for prediction tasks. MITST addresses these using hierarchical Transformer architectures, which include a feature-level, a timestamp-level, and a source-level Transformer. This design captures fine-grained temporal dynamics and allows learning-based data integration instead of traditional predefined aggregation. In a large-scale evaluation using the eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals), MITST achieves an average improvement of 1.7% (p &lt; 0.001) in AUROC and 1.8% (p &lt; 0.001) in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art baseline. For hypoglycemia, MITST achieves an AUROC of 0.915 and an AUPRC of 0.247, both significantly higher than the baseline's AUROC of 0.862 and AUPRC of 0.208 (p &lt; 0.001). The flexible architecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without retraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability in clinical decision support. Although this study focuses on predicting BG levels, MITST can easily be extended to other critical event prediction tasks in ICU settings, offering a robust solution for analyzing complex, multi-source, irregular time-series data.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Resource Allocation Algorithms for Vehicle Platoons over 5G eV2X Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicle platooning is a cooperative driving technology that can be supported by 5G enhanced Vehicle-to-Everything (eV2X) communication to improve road safety, traffic efficiency, and reduce fuel consumption. eV2X communication among the platoon vehicles involves the periodic exchange of Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) containing vehicle information under strict latency and reliability requirements. These requirements can be maintained by administering the assignment of resources, in terms of time slots and frequency bands, for CAM exchanges in a platoon, with the help of a resource allocation mechanism. State-of-the-art on control and communication design for vehicle platoons either consider a simplified platoon model with a detailed communication architecture or consider a simplified communication delay model with a detailed platoon control system. Departing from existing works, we have developed a comprehensive vehicle platoon communication and control framework using OMNET++, the benchmarking network simulation tool. We have carried out an inclusive and comparative study of three different platoon Information Flow Topologies (IFTs), namely Car-to-Server, Multi-Hop, and One-Hop over 5G using the Predecessor-leader following platoon control law to arrive at the best-suited IFT for platooning. Secondly, for the best-suited 5G eV2X platooning IFT selected, we have analyzed the performance of three different resource allocation algorithms, namely Maximum of Carrier to Interference Ratio (MaxC/I), Proportional Fair (PF), and Deficit Round Robin (DRR). Exhaustive system-level simulations show that the One-Hop information flow strategy along with the MaxC/I resource allocation yields the best Quality of Service (QoS) performance, in terms of latency, reliability, Age of Information (AoI), and throughput.</description>

      <title>FilterNet: Harnessing Frequency Filters for Time Series Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While numerous forecasters have been proposed using different network architectures, the Transformer-based models have state-of-the-art performance in time series forecasting. However, forecasters based on Transformers are still suffering from vulnerability to high-frequency signals, efficiency in computation, and bottleneck in full-spectrum utilization, which essentially are the cornerstones for accurately predicting time series with thousands of points. In this paper, we explore a novel perspective of enlightening signal processing for deep time series forecasting. Inspired by the filtering process, we introduce one simple yet effective network, namely FilterNet, built upon our proposed learnable frequency filters to extract key informative temporal patterns by selectively passing or attenuating certain components of time series signals. Concretely, we propose two kinds of learnable filters in the FilterNet: (i) Plain shaping filter, that adopts a universal frequency kernel for signal filtering and temporal modeling; (ii) Contextual shaping filter, that utilizes filtered frequencies examined in terms of its compatibility with input signals for dependency learning. Equipped with the two filters, FilterNet can approximately surrogate the linear and attention mappings widely adopted in time series literature, while enjoying superb abilities in handling high-frequency noises and utilizing the whole frequency spectrum that is beneficial for forecasting. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on eight time series forecasting benchmarks, and experimental results have demonstrated our superior performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Show, Don't Tell: Learning Reward Machines from Demonstrations for Reinforcement Learning-Based Cardiac Pacemaker Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An (artificial cardiac) pacemaker is an implantable electronic device that sends electrical impulses to the heart to regulate the heartbeat. As the number of pacemaker users continues to rise, so does the demand for features with additional sensors, adaptability, and improved battery performance. Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently been proposed as a performant algorithm for creative design space exploration, adaptation, and statistical verification of cardiac pacemakers. The design of correct reward functions, expressed as a reward machine, is a key programming activity in this process. In 2007, Boston Scientific published a detailed description of their pacemaker specifications. This document has since formed the basis for several formal characterizations of pacemaker specifications using real-time automata and logic. However, because these translations are done manually, they are challenging to verify. Moreover, capturing requirements in automata or logic is notoriously difficult. We posit that it is significantly easier for domain experts, such as electrophysiologists, to observe and identify abnormalities in electrocardiograms that correspond to patient-pacemaker interactions. Therefore, we explore the possibility of learning correctness specifications from such labeled demonstrations in the form of a reward machine and training an RL agent to synthesize a cardiac pacemaker based on the resulting reward machine. We leverage advances in machine learning to extract signals from labeled demonstrations as reward machines using recurrent neural networks and transformer architectures. These reward machines are then used to design a simple pacemaker with RL. Finally, we validate the resulting pacemaker using properties extracted from the Boston Scientific document.</description>

      <title>On Energy Efficiency of Hybrid NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to prove the significant superiority of hybrid non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) over orthog onal multiple access (OMA) in terms of energy efficiency. In particular, a novel hybrid NOMA scheme is proposed in which a user can transmit signals not only by using its own time slot but also by using the time slots of other users. The data rate maximization problem is studied by optimizing the power allocation, where closed-form solutions are obtained. Further more, the conditions under which hybrid NOMA can achieve a higher instantaneous data rate with less power consumption than OMA are obtained. It is proved that the probability that hybrid NOMA can achieve a higher instantaneous data rate with less power consumption than OMA approaches one in the high SNR regime, indicating the superiority of hybrid NOMA in terms of power efficiency. Numerical results are also provided to verify the developed analysis and also to demonstrate the superior performance of hybrid NOMA.</description>

      <title>Rician Channel Modelling for Super Wideband MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology include packing a large number of antenna elements in a compact array to access the bandwidth benefits provided by higher mutual coupling (MC). The resulting super-wideband (SW) systems require a circuit-theoretic framework to handle the MC and channel models which span extremely large bands. Hence, in this paper, we make two key contributions. First, we develop a physically-consistent Rician channel model for use with SW systems. Secondly, we express the circuit-theoretic models in terms of a standard MIMO model, so that insights into the effects of antenna layouts, MC, and bandwidth can be made using standard communication theory. For example, we show the bandwidth widening resulting from the new channel model. In addition, we show that MC distorts line-of-sight paths which has beamforming implications. We also highlight the interaction between spatial correlation and MC and show that tight coupling reduces spatial correlations at low frequencies.</description>

      <title>Fair Beam Synthesis and Suppression via Transmissive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing phase optimization methods in reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) face significant challenges in achieving flexible beam synthesis, especially for directional beam suppression. This paper introduces a Max-min criterion incorporating non-linear constraints, utilizing optimization techniques to enable multi-beam enhancement and suppression via transmissive RISs. A realistic model grounded in geometrical optics is first presented to characterize the input/output behavior of transmissive RIS, effectively linking explicit beam-forming operations with practical implementation. Subsequently, a highly efficient bisection-based algorithm for constrained Max-min optimization involving quadratic forms is developed, utilizing an auxiliary variable and Moreau envelope to iteratively reach the optimal solution. This approach demonstrates excellent extensibility and is applicable to a wide range of constrained Max-min problems. Numerical simulations validate the proposed methods, confirming that the framework enables beam enhancement or suppression at designated spatial positions.</description>

      <title>Supervised Transfer Learning Framework for Fault Diagnosis in Wind Turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common challenges in fault diagnosis include the lack of labeled data and the need to build models for each domain, resulting in many models that require supervision. Transfer learning can help tackle these challenges by learning cross-domain knowledge. Many approaches still require at least some labeled data in the target domain, and often provide unexplainable results. To this end, we propose a supervised transfer learning framework for fault diagnosis in wind turbines that operates in an Anomaly-Space. This space was created using SCADA data and vibration data and was built and provided to us by our research partner. Data within the Anomaly-Space can be interpreted as anomaly scores for each component in the wind turbine, making each value intuitive to understand. We conducted cross-domain evaluation on the train set using popular supervised classifiers like Random Forest, Light-Gradient-Boosting-Machines and Multilayer Perceptron as metamodels for the diagnosis of bearing and sensor faults. The Multilayer Perceptron achieved the highest classification performance. This model was then used for a final evaluation in our test set. The results show, that the proposed framework is able to detect cross-domain faults in the test set with a high degree of accuracy by using one single classifier, which is a significant asset to the diagnostic team.</description>

      <title>Federated GNNs for EEG-Based Stroke Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has the potential to become an essential tool in supporting clinical decision-making processes, offering enhanced diagnostic capabilities and personalized treatment plans. However, outsourcing medical records to train ML models using patient data raises legal, privacy, and security concerns. Federated learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for collaborative ML, meeting healthcare institutions' requirements for robust models without sharing sensitive data and compromising patient privacy. This study proposes a novel method that combines federated learning (FL) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict stroke severity using electroencephalography (EEG) signals across multiple medical institutions. Our approach enables multiple hospitals to jointly train a shared GNN model on their local EEG data without exchanging patient information. Specifically, we address a regression problem by predicting the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), a key indicator of stroke severity. The proposed model leverages a masked self-attention mechanism to capture salient brain connectivity patterns and employs EdgeSHAP to provide post-hoc explanations of the neurological states after a stroke. We evaluated our method on EEG recordings from four institutions, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.23 in predicting NIHSS, close to the average error made by human experts (MAE $\approx$ 3.0). This demonstrates the method's effectiveness in providing accurate and explainable predictions while maintaining data privacy.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Generative Multicasting with Intent-aware Semantic Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative diffusion models (GDMs) have recently shown great success in synthesizing multimedia signals with high perceptual quality enabling highly efficient semantic communications in future wireless networks. In this paper, we develop an intent-aware generative semantic multicasting framework utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. In the proposed framework, the transmitter decomposes the source signal to multiple semantic classes based on the multi-user intent, i.e. each user is assumed to be interested in details of only a subset of the semantic classes. The transmitter then sends to each user only its intended classes, and multicasts a highly compressed semantic map to all users over shared wireless resources that allows them to locally synthesize the other classes, i.e. non-intended classes, utilizing pre-trained diffusion models. The signal retrieved at each user is thereby partially reconstructed and partially synthesized utilizing the received semantic map. This improves utilization of the wireless resources, with better preserving privacy of the non-intended classes. We design a communication/computation-aware scheme for per-class adaptation of the communication parameters, such as the transmission power and compression rate to minimize the total latency of retrieving signals at multiple receivers, tailored to the prevailing channel conditions as well as the users reconstruction/synthesis distortion/perception requirements. The simulation results demonstrate significantly reduced per-user latency compared with non-generative and intent-unaware multicasting benchmarks while maintaining high perceptual quality of the signals retrieved at the users.</description>

Abstract: This work proposes a novel joint design for multiuser multiple-input multiple-output wiretap channels. The base station exploits a switching network to connect a subset of its antennas to the available radio frequency chains. The switching network and transmit beamformers are jointly designed to maximize the weighted secrecy sum-rate for this setting. The principal design problem reduces to an NP-hard mixed-integer non-linear programming. We invoke the fractional programming technique and the penalty dual decomposition method to develop a tractable iterative algorithm that effectively approximates the optimal design. Our numerical investigations validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and its superior performance compared with the benchmark.</description>

      <title>Spectral Clustering via Orthogonalization-Free Methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.10356v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While orthogonalization exists in current dimensionality reduction methods in spectral clustering on undirected graphs, it does not scale in parallel computing environments. We propose four orthogonalization-free methods for spectral clustering. Our methods optimize one of two objective functions with no spurious local minima. In theory, two methods converge to features isomorphic to the eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest eigenvalues of the symmetric normalized Laplacian. The other two converge to features isomorphic to weighted eigenvectors weighting by the square roots of eigenvalues. We provide numerical evidence on the synthetic graphs from the IEEE HPEC Graph Challenge to demonstrate the effectiveness of the orthogonalization-free methods. Numerical results on the streaming graphs show that the orthogonalization-free methods are competitive in the streaming graph scenario since they can take full advantage of the computed features of previous graphs and converge fast. Our methods are also more scalable in parallel computing environments because orthogonalization is unnecessary. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the scalability of our methods. Consequently, our methods have advantages over other dimensionality reduction methods when handling spectral clustering for large streaming graphs.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Compensation of Carrier Frequency Offset Impairments in Unique Word OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unique Word-orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (UW-OFDM) is known to provide various performance benefits over conventional cyclic prefix (CP) based OFDM. Most important, UW-OFDM features excellent spectral sidelobe suppression properties and an outstanding bit error ratio (BER) performance. Carrier frequency offset (CFO) induced impairments denote a challenging task for OFDM systems of any kind. In this work we investigate the CFO effects on UW-OFDM and compare it to conventional multi-carrier and single-carrier systems. Different CFO compensation approaches with different computational complexity are considered throughout this work and assessed against each other. A mean squared error analysis carried out after data estimation reveals a significant higher robustness of UW-OFDM over CP-OFDM against CFO effects. Additionally, the conducted BER simulations generally support this conclusion for various scenarios, ranging from uncoded to coded transmission in a frequency selective environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the probability of error is paramount in the design and analysis of digital communication systems, particularly in Rayleigh fading channels where signal impairments are prevalent. This article presents a unified approach for deriving the probability of error formulations applicable to Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), 16-Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (16-QAM), and 64-QAM in Rayleigh fading channels. This article presents a general approach to derive the probability of error formulations applicable to Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), 16-Quadruple Amplitude Modulation (16-QAM) and 64-QAM in Rayleigh fading channels. The derivation process encompasses the unique characteristics of each modulation scheme and the statistical properties of Rayleigh fading providing a comprehensive framework to analyze error performance. By establishing a unified formulation, this approach simplifies the analysis and facilitates a deeper understanding of error probability behavior across different modulation schemes. The derived formulations offer insights into the impact of fading-induced impairments on system performance, allowing for accurate prediction and optimization of communication systems in real-world fading environments. The insights and techniques presented herein serve as a valuable resource for researchers, engineers, and practitioners engaged in the design and optimization of communication systems operating in challenging fading environments.</description>

      <title>Refining ADHD diagnosis with EEG: The impact of preprocessing and temporal segmentation on classification accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: EEG signals are commonly used in ADHD diagnosis, but they are often affected by noise and artifacts. Effective preprocessing and segmentation methods can significantly enhance the accuracy and reliability of ADHD classification. Methods: We applied filtering, ASR, and ICA preprocessing techniques to EEG data from children with ADHD and neurotypical controls. The EEG recordings were segmented, and features were extracted and selected based on statistical significance. Classification was performed using various EEG segments and channels with Machine Learning models (SVM, KNN, and XGBoost) to identify the most effective combinations for accurate ADHD diagnosis. Results: Our findings show that models trained on later EEG segments achieved significantly higher accuracy, indicating the potential role of cognitive fatigue in distinguishing ADHD. The highest classification accuracy (86.1%) was achieved using data from the P3, P4, and C3 channels, with key features such as Kurtosis, Katz fractal dimension, and power spectrums in the Delta, Theta, and Alpha bands contributing to the results. Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of preprocessing and segmentation in improving the reliability of ADHD diagnosis through EEG. The results suggest that further research on cognitive fatigue and segmentation could enhance diagnostic accuracy in ADHD patients.</description>

      <title>Sensing Accuracy Optimization for Communication-assisted Dual-baseline UAV-InSAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the optimization of the sensing accuracy of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based dual-baseline interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) systems. A swarm of three UAV-synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems is deployed to image an area of interest from different angles, enabling the creation of two independent digital elevation models (DEMs). To reduce the InSAR sensing error, i.e., the height estimation error, the two DEMs are fused based on weighted averaging techniques into one final DEM. The heavy computations required for this process are performed on the ground. To this end, the radar data is offloaded in real time via a frequency division multiple access (FDMA) air-to-ground backhaul link. In this work, we focus on improving the sensing accuracy by minimizing the worst-case height estimation error of the final DEM. To this end, the UAV formation and the power allocated for offloading are jointly optimized based on alternating optimization (AO), while meeting practical InSAR sensing and communication constraints. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution can significantly improve the sensing accuracy compared to classical single-baseline UAV-InSAR systems and other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal Non-Invasive Deep Learning Framework for Progressive Prediction of Seizures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative framework designed for progressive (granular in time to onset) prediction of seizures through the utilization of a Deep Learning (DL) methodology based on non-invasive multi-modal sensor networks. Epilepsy, a debilitating neurological condition, affects an estimated 65 million individuals globally, with a substantial proportion facing drug-resistant epilepsy despite pharmacological interventions. To address this challenge, we advocate for predictive systems that provide timely alerts to individuals at risk, enabling them to take precautionary actions. Our framework employs advanced DL techniques and uses personalized data from a network of non-invasive electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) sensors, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy. The algorithms are optimized for real-time processing on edge devices, mitigating privacy concerns and minimizing data transmission overhead inherent in cloud-based solutions, ultimately preserving battery energy. Additionally, our system predicts the countdown time to seizures (with 15-minute intervals up to an hour prior to the onset), offering critical lead time for preventive actions. Our multi-modal model achieves 95% sensitivity, 98% specificity, and 97% accuracy, averaged among 29 patients.</description>

Abstract: Aperiodic autocorrelation is an important indicator of performance of sequences used in communications, remote sensing, and scientific instrumentation. Knowing a sequence's autocorrelation function, which reports the autocorrelation at every possible translation, is equivalent to knowing the magnitude of the sequence's Fourier transform. The phase problem is the difficulty in resolving this lack of phase information. We say that two sequences are equicorrelational to mean that they have the same aperiodic autocorrelation function. Sequences used in technological applications often have restrictions on their terms: they are not arbitrary complex numbers, but come from a more restricted alphabet. For example, binary sequences involve terms equal to only $+1$ and $-1$. We investigate the necessary and sufficient conditions for two sequences to be equicorrelational, where we take their alphabet into consideration. There are trivial forms of equicorrelationality arising from modifications that predictably preserve the autocorrelation, for example, negating a binary sequence or reversing the order of its terms. By a search of binary sequences up to length $44$, we find that nontrivial equicorrelationality among binary sequences does occur, but is rare. An integer $n$ is said to be equivocal when there are binary sequences of length $n$ that are nontrivially equicorrelational; otherwise $n$ is unequivocal. For $n \leq 44$, we found that the unequivocal lengths are $1$--$8$, $10$, $11$, $13$, $14$, $19$, $22$, $23$, $26$, $29$, $37$, and $38$. We pose open questions about the finitude of unequivocal numbers and the probability of nontrivial equicorrelationality occurring among binary sequences.</description>

      <title>Acousto-optic reconstruction of exterior sound field based on concentric circle sampling with circular harmonic expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acousto-optic sensing provides an alternative approach to traditional microphone arrays by shedding light on the interaction of light with an acoustic field. Sound field reconstruction is a fascinating and advanced technique used in acousto-optics sensing. Current challenges in sound-field reconstruction methods pertain to scenarios in which the sound source is located within the reconstruction area, known as the exterior problem. Existing reconstruction algorithms, primarily designed for interior scenarios, often exhibit suboptimal performance when applied to exterior cases. This paper introduces a novel technique for exterior sound-field reconstruction. The proposed method leverages concentric circle sampling and a two-dimensional exterior sound-field reconstruction approach based on circular harmonic extensions. To evaluate the efficacy of this approach, both numerical simulations and practical experiments are conducted. The results highlight the superior accuracy of the proposed method when compared to conventional reconstruction methods, all while utilizing a minimal amount of measured projection data.</description>

      <title>RCS reduction method with anomalous reflection metasurfaces using Floquet analysis : design modelling and measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00858v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter proposes the design and measurement of a periodic metasurface that achieves anomalous reflection with reduced RCS in a given direction. A previous study proposed a semi-analytical model to predict the RCS behaviour of such a metasurface. This work focuses the discussion on manufacturing and measurement issues. The synthesis, design specifications, fabrication method and experimental setup are presented and discussed. Measurement results are also examined in detail, highlighting some limitations in metasurfaces RCS measurements. The proposed metasurface effectively achieves the predicted RCS level reduction in the Floquet direction considered. The agreement between simulation and experimental results demonstrates the accuracy of the modelling and the efficiency of the optimisation procedure.</description>

      <title>H2G2-Net: A Hierarchical Heterogeneous Graph Generative Network Framework for Discovery of Multi-Modal Physiological Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02905v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering human cognitive and emotional states using multi-modal physiological signals draws attention across various research applications. Physiological responses of the human body are influenced by human cognition and commonly used to analyze cognitive states. From a network science perspective, the interactions of these heterogeneous physiological modalities in a graph structure may provide insightful information to support prediction of cognitive states. However, there is no clue to derive exact connectivity between heterogeneous modalities and there exists a hierarchical structure of sub-modalities. Existing graph neural networks are designed to learn on non-hierarchical homogeneous graphs with pre-defined graph structures; they failed to learn from hierarchical, multi-modal physiological data without a pre-defined graph structure. To this end, we propose a hierarchical heterogeneous graph generative network (H2G2-Net) that automatically learns a graph structure without domain knowledge, as well as a powerful representation on the hierarchical heterogeneous graph in an end-to-end fashion. We validate the proposed method on the CogPilot dataset that consists of multi-modal physiological signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art GNNs by 5%-20% in prediction accuracy.</description>

      <title>ArEEG_Chars: Dataset for Envisioned Speech Recognition using EEG for Arabic Characters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces is an important and hot research topic that revolutionize how people interact with the world, especially for individuals with neurological disorders. While extensive research has been done in EEG signals of English letters and words, a major limitation remains: the lack of publicly available EEG datasets for many non-English languages, such as Arabic. Although Arabic is one of the most spoken languages worldwide, to the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available dataset for EEG signals of Arabic characters until now. To address this gap, we introduce ArEEG_Chars, a novel EEG dataset for Arabic 31 characters collected from 30 participants (21 males and 9 females), these records were collected using Epoc X 14 channels device for 10 seconds long for each char record. The number of recorded signals were 930 EEG recordings. To make the EEG signals suitable for analyzing, each recording has been split into multiple signals with a time duration of 250ms, respectively. Therefore, a total of 39857 recordings of EEG signals have been collected in this study. Moreover, ArEEG_Chars will be publicly available for researchers. We do hope that this dataset will fill an important gap in the research of Arabic EEG benefiting Arabic-speaking individuals with disabilities.</description>

      <title>Physics-aware deep learning framework for the limited aperture inverse obstacle scattering problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a deep learning approach to the limited aperture inverse obstacle scattering problem. It is well known that traditional deep learning relies solely on data, which may limit its performance for the inverse problem when only indirect observation data and a physical model are available. A fundamental question arises in light of these limitations: is it possible to enable deep learning to work on inverse problems without labeled data and to be aware of what it is learning? This work proposes a deep decomposition method (DDM) for such purposes, which does not require ground truth labels. It accomplishes this by providing physical operators associated with the scattering model to the neural network architecture. Additionally, a deep learning based data completion scheme is implemented in DDM to prevent distorting the solution of the inverse problem for limited aperture data. Furthermore, apart from addressing the ill-posedness imposed by the inverse problem itself, DDM is the first physics-aware machine learning technique that can have interpretability property for the obstacle detection. The convergence result of DDM is theoretically investigated. We also prove that adding small noise to the input limited aperture data can introduce additional regularization terms and effectively improve the smoothness of the learned inverse operator. Numerical experiments are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed DDM even when the incident and observation apertures are extremely limited.</description>

      <title>Localized Distributional Robustness in Submodular Multi-Task Subset Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we approach the problem of multi-task submodular optimization with the perspective of local distributional robustness, within the neighborhood of a reference distribution which assigns an importance score to each task. We initially propose to introduce a regularization term which makes use of the relative entropy to the standard multi-task objective. We then demonstrate through duality that this novel formulation itself is equivalent to the maximization of a monotone increasing function composed with a submodular function, which may be efficiently carried out through standard greedy selection methods. This approach bridges the existing gap in the optimization of performance-robustness trade-offs in multi-task subset selection. To numerically validate our theoretical results, we test the proposed method in two different settings, one on the selection of satellites in low Earth orbit constellations in the context of a sensor selection problem involving weak-submodular functions, and the other on an image summarization task using neural networks involving submodular functions. Our method is compared with two other algorithms focused on optimizing the performance of the worst-case task, and on directly optimizing the performance on the reference distribution itself. We conclude that our novel formulation produces a solution that is locally distributional robust, and computationally inexpensive.</description>

      <title>Enabling 6G Performance in the Upper Mid-Band by Transitioning From Massive to Gigantic MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The initial 6G networks will likely operate in the upper mid-band (7-24 GHz), which has decent propagation conditions but underwhelming new spectrum availability. In this paper, we explore whether we can anyway reach the ambitious 6G performance goals by evolving the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology from being massive to gigantic. We describe how many antennas are needed and can realistically be deployed, and what the peak user rate and degrees-of-freedom (DOF) can become. We further suggest a new deployment strategy that enables the utilization of radiative near-field effects in these bands for precise beamfocusing, localization, and sensing from a single base station site. Finally, we identify five open research challenges that must be overcome to efficiently use gigantic MIMO dimensions in 6G from hardware, cost, and algorithmic perspectives.</description>

      <title>Self-supervised Multimodal Speech Representations for the Assessment of Schizophrenia Symptoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multimodal schizophrenia assessment systems have gained traction over the last few years. This work introduces a schizophrenia assessment system to discern between prominent symptom classes of schizophrenia and predict an overall schizophrenia severity score. We develop a Vector Quantized Variational Auto-Encoder (VQ-VAE) based Multimodal Representation Learning (MRL) model to produce task-agnostic speech representations from vocal Tract Variables (TVs) and Facial Action Units (FAUs). These representations are then used in a Multi-Task Learning (MTL) based downstream prediction model to obtain class labels and an overall severity score. The proposed framework outperforms the previous works on the multi-class classification task across all evaluation metrics (Weighted F1 score, AUC-ROC score, and Weighted Accuracy). Additionally, it estimates the schizophrenia severity score, a task not addressed by earlier approaches.</description>

      <title>Towards Generative Ray Path Sampling for Faster Point-to-Point Ray Tracing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radio propagation modeling is essential in telecommunication research, as radio channels result from complex interactions with environmental objects. Recently, Machine Learning has been attracting attention as a potential alternative to computationally demanding tools, like Ray Tracing, which can model these interactions in detail. However, existing Machine Learning approaches often attempt to learn directly specific channel characteristics, such as the coverage map, making them highly specific to the frequency and material properties and unable to fully capture the underlying propagation mechanisms. Hence, Ray Tracing, particularly the Point-to-Point variant, remains popular to accurately identify all possible paths between transmitter and receiver nodes. Still, path identification is computationally intensive because the number of paths to be tested grows exponentially while only a small fraction is valid. In this paper, we propose a Machine Learning-aided Ray Tracing approach to efficiently sample potential ray paths, significantly reducing the computational load while maintaining high accuracy. Our model dynamically learns to prioritize potentially valid paths among all possible paths and scales linearly with scene complexity. Unlike recent alternatives, our approach is invariant with translation, scaling, or rotation of the geometry, and avoids dependency on specific environment characteristics.</description>

      <title>Understanding Generalizability of Diffusion Models Requires Rethinking the Hidden Gaussian Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the generalizability of diffusion models by looking into the hidden properties of the learned score functions, which are essentially a series of deep denoisers trained on various noise levels. We observe that as diffusion models transition from memorization to generalization, their corresponding nonlinear diffusion denoisers exhibit increasing linearity. This discovery leads us to investigate the linear counterparts of the nonlinear diffusion models, which are a series of linear models trained to match the function mappings of the nonlinear diffusion denoisers. Surprisingly, these linear denoisers are approximately the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset. This finding implies that diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing and utilizing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training dataset for data generation. We empirically demonstrate that this inductive bias is a unique property of diffusion models in the generalization regime, which becomes increasingly evident when the model's capacity is relatively small compared to the training dataset size. In the case that the model is highly overparameterized, this inductive bias emerges during the initial training phases before the model fully memorizes its training data. Our study provides crucial insights into understanding the notable strong generalization phenomenon recently observed in real-world diffusion models.</description>

      <title>RSRP Measurement Based Channel Autocorrelation Estimation for IRS-Aided Wideband Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The passive and frequency-flat reflection of IRS, as well as the high-dimensional IRS-reflected channels, have posed significant challenges for efficient IRS channel estimation, especially in wideband communication systems with significant multi-path channel delay spread. To address these challenges, we propose a novel neural network (NN)-empowered framework for IRS channel autocorrelation matrix estimation in wideband orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. This framework relies only on the easily accessible reference signal received power (RSRP) measurements at users in existing wideband communication systems, without requiring additional pilot transmission. Based on the estimates of channel autocorrelation matrix, the passive reflection of IRS is optimized to maximize the average user received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over all subcarriers in the OFDM system. Numerical results verify that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing powermeasurement-based IRS reflection designs in wideband channels.</description>
