      <title>Fractionalized Altermagnets: from neighboring and altermagnetic spin-liquids to fractionalized spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum-fluctuation-driven fractionalized phases in the vicinity of altermagnetic order. First, the long-range magnetic orders in the vicinity of collinear altermagnetism are identified; these feature a non-coplanar "orbital altermagnet" which has altermagnetic symmetries in spin-rotation invariant observables. We then describe neighboring fractionalized phases with topological order reached when quantum fluctuations destroy long-range spin order, within Schwinger-boson theory and an SU(2) gauge theory of fluctuating magnetism. Discrete symmetries remain broken in some of the fractionalized phases, with the orbital altermagnet becoming an "altermagnetic spin liquid". We compute the electronic spectral function in the doped system, revealing "fractionalized spin-orbit coupling" characterized by split Fermi surfaces, reminiscent of conventional spin-orbit coupling, but with preserved spin-rotation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Review of honeycomb-based Kitaev materials with zigzag magnetic ordering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for a Kitaev quantum spin liquid in crystalline magnetic materials has fueled intense interest in the two-dimensional honeycomb systems. Many promising candidate Kitaev systems are characterized by a long range ordered magnetic structure with an antiferromagnetic zigzag-type order, where the static moments form alternating ferromagnetic chains. Recent experiments on high-quality single crystals uncovered the existence of intriguing multi-$\mathbf{k}$ magnetic structures, which evolved from zigzag structures. Those discoveries have sparked new theoretical developments and amplified interest in these materials. We present an overview of the honeycomb materials known to display this type of magnetic structure and provide detailed crystallographic information for the possible single and multi-$\mathbf{k}$ variants.</description>

      <title>Spectral function of a bipolaron coupled to dispersive optical phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using an efficient variational exact diagonalization method, we computed the electron removal spectral function of a low-doped system within the framework of the Holstein-Hubbard model with dispersive quantum optical phonons. Our primary focus was examining the interplay between phonon dispersion and Coulomb repulsion and their effects on the spectral function in the intermediate to strong electron-phonon coupling regime. Tuning the strengths of the electron-phonon coupling and the Hubbard interaction allows us to examine the evolution of the spectral properties of the system as it crosses over from a bound bipolaron to separate polarons. With increasing Hubbard repulsion, the decrease of the bipolaron binding energy results in the gradual downward shift of the polaron band - a low-frequency feature in the spectral function. Simultaneously, the intensity of the polaron band away from the center of the Brillouin zone diminishes until it remains non-zero only in its center as the bipolaron unbinds into two separate polarons. The spectral function is significantly influenced by phonon dispersion, particularly in systems with strong electron-phonon coupling. The sign of the curvature of the phonon band plays a crucial role in the distribution of spectral weight.</description>

      <title>Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operators: An efficient numerical approach for fermionic path integral simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing numerical exact solvers for open quantum systems is a challenging task due to the non-perturbative and non-Markovian nature when coupling to structured environments. The Feynman-Vernon influence functional approach is a powerful analytical tool to study the dynamics of open quantum systems. Numerical treatments of the influence functional including the quasi-adiabatic propagator technique and the tensor-network-based time-evolving matrix product operator method, have proven to be efficient in studying open quantum systems with bosonic environments. However, the numerical implementation of the fermionic path integral suffers from the Grassmann algebra involved. In this work, we present a detailed introduction of the Grassmann time-evolving matrix product operator method for fermionic open quantum systems. In particular, we introduce the concepts of Grassmann tensor, signed matrix product operator, and Grassmann matrix product state to handle the Grassmann path integral. Using the single-orbital Anderson impurity model as an example, we review the numerical benchmarks for structured fermionic environments for real-time nonequilibrium dynamics, real-time and imaginary-time equilibration dynamics, and its application as an impurity solver. These benchmarks show that our method is a robust and promising numerical approach to study strong coupling physics and non-Markovian dynamics. It can also serve as an alternative impurity solver to study strongly-correlated quantum matter with dynamical mean-field theory.</description>

      <title>Exploiting the Hermitian symmetry in tensor network algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploiting symmetries in tensor network algorithms plays a key role for reducing the computational and memory costs. Here we explain how to incorporate the Hermitian symmetry in double-layer tensor networks, which naturally arise in methods based on projected entangled-pair states (PEPS). For real-valued tensors the Hermitian symmetry defines a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry on the combined bra and ket auxiliary level of the tensors. By implementing this symmetry, a speedup of the computation time by up to a factor 4 can be achieved, while expectation values of observables and reduced density matrices remain Hermitian by construction. Benchmark results based on the corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) and higher-order tensor renormalization group (HOTRG) are presented. We also discuss how to implement the Hermitian symmetry in the complex case, where a similar speedup can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Wigner-Yanase skew information, quantum entanglement and spin nematic quantum phase transitions in biquadratic spin-1 and spin-2 XY chains with single-ion anisotropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) between uniaxial or biaxial spin nematic (SN) phases are investigated in biquadratic spin-1 and spin-2 XY infinite chains with the rhombic- and uniaxial-type single-ion anisotropies. Systematic discussions of distinctive singular behaviors are made to classify various types of QPT from one SN state to the other SN state in using the Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI), the bipartite entanglement entropy (BEE), and the quadrupole moments (QMs). For the spin-1 system with the three uniaxial SN phases, we find that a discontinuous QPT, signaled by discontinuous behaviors of all the considered WYSI, BEE, and QMs, occurs from the z-ferroquadrupole phase (FQP) to the x- or y-FQPs, while a continuous QPT occurs between the x- and y-FQPs. The central charge in the continuous QPT line is estimated as $c \simeq 1$ from the BEE. Compared to the spin-1 system, depending on a given strength of the uniaxial-type single-ion anisotropy, the spin-2 system undergoes four different types of QPTs between the two biaxial SN phases as the rhombic-type anisotropy varies: the quantum crossovers, connecting the two orthogonal biaxial SN states adiabatically without an explicit phase transition, the continuous and the discontinuous QPTs, and the SN to magnetic transitions via the antiferromagnetic phase (AFP). In a sharp contrast to the spin-1 system, for the transitions between the two biaxial SN phases, the discontinuous transition line is classified as a topological phase characterized by a doubly degenerate entanglement spectrum and a string order parameter defined by the Cartan generator of the $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ symmetry group in spin-2 systems, while the continuous QPT is advocated by the central charge $c \simeq 1$. Whereas the QPT lines with $c \simeq 1/2$ indicate that the transition between the biaxial SN phase and the AFP belongs to the Ising universality class.</description>

      <title>Tunable topological transitions in the frustrated magnet HoAgGe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome lattice, known for its strong frustration in two dimensions, hosts a variety of exotic magnetic and electronic states. A variation of this geometry, where the triangular motifs are twisted to further reduce symmetry, has recently revealed even more complex physics. HoAgGe exemplifies such a structure, with magnetic and electronic properties believed to be driven by strong in-plane anisotropy of the Ho spins, effectively acting as a two-dimensional spin ice. In this study, using a combination of magnetization, Hall conductivity measurements, and density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate how various spin-ice states, stabilized by external magnetic fields, influence the Fermi surface topology. More interestingly, we observe sharp transitions in Hall conductivity without concurrent changes in magnetization when an external magnetic field is applied along a particular crystallographic direction, underscoring the role of strong magnetic frustration and providing a new platform for exploring the interplay between magnetic frustration, electronic topology, and crystalline symmetry. These results also highlight the limitations of a simple spin-ice model, suggesting that a more sophisticated framework is necessary to capture the subtle experimental nuances observed.</description>

      <title>The charge gap is greater than the neutral gap in fractional quantum Hall systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Past studies of fractional quantum Hall systems have found that the charge gap dominates the neutral gap for all relevant parameter choices. We report a wide-ranging proof that this domination is in fact a universal property of any Hamiltonian that satisfies a few simple structural properties: translation-invariance, charge conservation, dipole conservation, and a fractionally filled ground state. The result applies to both fermions and bosons. Our main tool is a new mathematical scheme, the gap comparison method, which provides a sequence of inequalities that relate the spectral gaps in successive particle number sectors. Our finding sheds new light on dipole conservation's profound effects on many-body physics.</description>

      <title>High spatial resolution charge sensing of quantum Hall states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charge distribution offers a unique fingerprint of important properties of electronic systems, including dielectric response, charge ordering and charge fractionalization. We develop a new architecture for charge sensing in two-dimensional electronic systems in a strong magnetic field. We probe local change of the chemical potential in a proximitized detector layer using scanning tunneling microscopy (STS), allowing us to infer the chemical potential and the charge profile in the sample. Our technique has both high energy (&lt;0.3 meV) and spatial (&lt;10 nm) resolution exceeding that of previous studies by an order of magnitude. We apply our technique to study the chemical potential of quantum Hall liquids in monolayer graphene under high magnetic fields and their responses to charge impurities. The chemical potential measurement provides a local probe of the thermodynamic gap of quantum Hall ferromagnets and fractional quantum Hall states. The screening charge profile reveals spatially oscillatory response of the quantum Hall liquids to charge impurities, and is consistent with the composite Fermi liquid picture close to the half-filling. Our technique also paves the way to map moir\'e potentials, probe Wigner crystals, and investigate fractional charges in quantum Hall and Chern insulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a universal framework for classifying quantum states based on their scale-resolved correlation structure. Using the recently introduced information lattice, which provides an operational definition of the total amount of correlations at each scale, we define intrinsic characteristic length scales of quantum states. We analyze ground and midspectrum eigenstates of the disordered interacting Kitaev chain, showing that our framework provides a novel unbiased approach to quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Lattice Chern-Simons-Maxwell Theory and its Chirality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define and solve the $\text{U(1)}$ Chern-Simons-Maxwell theory on spacetime lattice, with an emphasis on the chirality of the theory. Realizing Chern-Simons theory on lattice has been a problem of interest for decades, and over the years it has gradually become clear that there are two key points: 1) Some non-topological term, such as a Maxwell term, is necessary -- this is true even in the continuum, but more manifestly on the lattice; 2) the $\text{U(1)}$ gauge field should be implemented in the Villainized form to retain its topological properties. Putting the two ideas together seriously, we show all interesting properties of a chiral Chern-Simons theory are reproduced in an explicitly regularized manner on the lattice. These include the bosonic and fermionic level quantization, the bulk and chiral edge spectrum, the Wilson loop flux attachment (with point-split framing or geometric framing depending on the Maxwell coupling), the Wilson loop spin, the ground state degeneracy, and, most non-trivially, the chiral gravitational anomaly.</description>

      <title>Threefold Way for Typical Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A typical quantum state with no symmetry can be realized by letting a random unitary act on a fixed state, and the subsystem entanglement spectrum follows the Laguerre unitary ensemble (LUE). For integer-spin time reversal symmetry, we have an analogous scenario where we prepare a time-reversal symmetric state and let random orthogonal matrices act on it, leading to the Laguerre orthogonal ensemble (LOE). However, for half-integer-spin time reversal symmetry, a straightforward analogue leading to the Laguerre symplectic ensemble (LSE) is no longer valid due to that time reversal symmetric state is forbidden by the Kramers' theorem. We devise a system in which the global time reversal operator is fractionalized on the subsystems, and show that LSE arises in the system. Extending this idea, we incorporate general symmetry fractionalization into the system, and show that the statistics of the entanglement spectrum is decomposed into a direct sum of LOE, LUE, and/or LSE. Here, various degeneracies in the entanglement spectrum may appear, depending on the non-Abelian nature of the symmetry group and the cohomology class of the non-trivial projective representation on the subsystem. Our work establishes the entanglement counterpart of the Dyson's threefold way for Hamiltonians with symmetries.</description>

      <title>Evolution and Instability of Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces under Zeeman Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution and instability of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (BFSs) in the spherical $j=3/2$ model under the Zeeman field have been theoretically studied. The Zeeman field induces a pronounced expansion of the BFSs, especially for those with a predominant $j_z = \pm 3/2$ component. This expansion can be detected through spectroscopic techniques such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Furthermore, calculations of bogolon correlation functions suggest that if an additional phase transition occurs within the superconducting phase, it is likely to result in a chiral $p$-wave pairing state of bogolons, rather than a density-wave-type transition. This chiral $p$-wave state, which coexists with the chiral $d$-wave superconducting state, is characterized by spontaneous inversion symmetry breaking and the disappearance of the torus-shaped BFS structure.</description>

      <title>Truncation-Free Quantum Simulation of Pure-Gauge Compact QED Using Josephson Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is one of the methods that have been proposed and used in practice to bypass computational challenges in the investigation of lattice gauge theories. While most of the proposals rely on truncating the infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces that these models feature, we propose a truncation-free method based on the exact analogy between the local Hilbert space of lattice QED and that of a Josephson junction. We provide several proposals, mostly semi-analog, arranged according to experimental difficulty. Our method can simulate a quasi-2D system of up to $2\times N$ plaquettes, and we present an approximate method that can simulate the fully-2D theory, but is more demanding experimentally and not immediately feasible. This sets the ground for analog quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories with superconducting circuits, in a completely Hilbert space truncation-free procedure, for continuous gauge groups.</description>

Abstract: The holographic approach to the strange metal phase relies on near-extremal asymptotically AdS$_4$ electrically charged black branes with important input from their AdS$_2$ near-horizon throat geometry. Motivated by the current understanding of the role of quantum fluctuations in the throat of near-extremal black holes, we revisit some transport properties. We model quantum gravitational and gauge fluctuations in the throat region by adopting results in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, effectively leading to quantum corrections for the dual CFT$_1$ Green's function in the near-horizon infrared region. We use the quantum-corrected Green's function to compute the conductivity for (2+1)-dimensional holographic strange metals and obtain corrections for the DC resistivity and the optical conductivity. We also compare the quantum-corrected holographic approach with results from the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and point out qualitative differences. Although experimental detection for the quantum-corrected holographic approach to the DC resistivity requires higher precision than current experimental accuracy, future experiments with improved technologies could detect these quantum corrections. Interestingly, including quantum corrections to the optical conductivity does provide a plausible explanation for the experimental anomalous power-law behavior detected in various strange metals.</description>

      <title>Preparing topological states with finite depth simultaneous commuting gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present protocols for preparing two-dimensional abelian and non-abelian topologically ordered states by employing finite depth unitary circuits composed of long-ranged, simultaneous, and mutually commuting two-qubit gates. Our protocols are motivated by recent proposals for circuits in trapped ion systems, which allow each qubit to participate in multiple gates simultaneously. Our circuits are shown to be optimal, in the sense that the number of two-qubit gates and ancilla qubits scales as $O(L^2)$, where $L$ is the linear size of the system. Examples include the ground states of the toric code, certain Kitaev quantum double models, and string net models. Going beyond two dimensions, we extend our scheme to more general Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes. As an application, we present protocols for realizing the three-dimensional Haah's code and X-Cube fracton models.</description>

      <title>Strings as Hyper-Fractons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically examine all possible Gauss laws obeying spatial rotation symmetry, characterising the corresponding conserved charges. In the case of conserved higher moments, this gives rise to fractonic behaviour. We show that many Gauss laws, including those arising from $p$-form electrodynamics, in fact, produce an infinite tower of conserved moments, which we dub hyper-fractonic. In hyper-fractonic systems, a finite number of charged particles cannot be mobile due to an inability of fulfilling the infinite number of conservation laws with a finite number of degrees of freedom. Instead, mobile charged objects must have an infinite number of degrees of freedom. In particular, the strings and branes naturally coupling to $p$-form potentials provide an example of hyper-fractonic matter.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Oscillations from Many-Body Quantum Scars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum scars are nonthermal eigenstates that prevent thermalization of initial states with weight on the scars. When the scar states are equally spaced in energy, superpositions of scars show oscillating local observables that can be detected in experiments. However, we note that scarred models in the literature show fundamentally different scar entanglement dynamics: some show entanglement oscillations while others are completely frozen. We explain this freezing through a no-go theorem which we apply to more than a dozen scarred models in the literature. We also discuss a method for evading the no-go theorem by deforming the scarred models with frozen scar entanglement dynamics.</description>

      <title>Continuous Transition between Bosonic Fractional Chern Insulator and Superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phases and the phase transitions between FCI and Mott insulators (MI) in bosonic systems are well studied. The continuous transitions between FCI and superfluid (SF), however, despite the inspiring field theoretical predictions, have not been directly verified. The existing numerical results of the FCI-SF transition are either indirect or clearly first-order. Here, by simply tuning the bandwidth of the Haldane honeycomb lattice model, we find direct transitions from a bosonic FCI at $\nu=1/2$ filling of a flat Chern band to two SF states with bosons condensed at momenta M or $\Gamma$, respectively. While the FCI-SF(M) transition is first-order, the FCI-SF($\Gamma$) transition is found continuous, and the bipartite entanglement entropy at the critical point with the area-law scaling is consistent with the critical theories. Through finite size criticality analysis, the obtained critical exponents $\beta\approx$ 0.35(5) and $\nu\approx$ 0.62(12) are both compatible with those of the 3D XY universality class within numerical uncertainty and possibly more exotic beyond-Landau ones. This letter thence presents a direct numerical demonstration of a continuous FCI-SF transition between topologically ordered phase and spontaneous continuous symmetry-breaking phase, and further indicates the zero-field bosonic FCI might be realized from a SF state by gradually flattening the dispersion of the Chern band, through the (quasi)adiabatic preparation in ultracold atom systems.</description>

      <title>A frustrated antipolar phase analogous to classical spin liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of magnetic frustration in classical spin systems was motivated by the prediction and discovery of classical spin liquid states. These uncommon magnetic phases are characterized by a massive degeneracy of their ground state implying a finite magnetic entropy at zero temperature. While the classical spin liquid state was originally predicted in the Ising triangular lattice antiferromagnet in 1950, this state has never been experimentally observed in any triangular magnets. We report here the discovery of an electric analogue of classical spin liquids on a triangular lattice of uniaxial electric dipoles in EuAl12O19 . This new type of frustrated antipolar phase is characterized by a highly degenerate state at low temperature implying an absence of long-range antiferroelectric order, despite short-range antipolar correlations. Its dynamics are governed by a thermally activated process, slowing down upon cooling towards a complete freezing at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy for artificially designed complex oxides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In designing material functionalities for transition metal oxides, lattice structure and d-orbital occupancy are key determinants. However, the modulation of these two factors is inherently limited by the need to balance thermodynamic stability, growth kinetics, and stoichiometry precision, particularly for metastable phases. We introduce a methodology, namely the gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy (GOALL-Epitaxy), enhancing oxidation power 3-4 orders of magnitude beyond oxide molecular beam epitaxy (OMBE) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD), while ensuring atomic-layer-by-layer growth of designed complex structures. Thermodynamic stability is markedly augmented with stronger oxidation at elevated temperatures, whereas growth kinetics is sustained by laser ablation at lower temperatures. We demonstrate the accurate growth of complex nickelates and cuprates, especially an artificially designed structure with alternating single and double NiO2 layers possessing distinct nominal d-orbital occupancy, as a parent of high-temperature superconductor. The GOALL-Epitaxy enables material discovery within the vastly broadened growth parameter space.</description>

      <title>Field-induced spin liquid in the decorated square-kagome antiferromagnet nabokoite KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum antiferromagnets realizing the square-kagome lattice are proving to be a promising platform for nontrivial phenomena in frustrated magnetism. We carry out a theoretical analysis of the recently synthesized compound nabokoite {\nab} based on a density functional theory energy mapping which establishes an unusual Heisenberg Hamiltonian with a hierarchy of couplings which suggests a description in terms of effective spin liquid models. Owing to the decoration of the square-kagome lattice with a seventh Cu site, nabokoite is characterized by highly frustrated square pyramids that are antiferromagnetically coupled in a chiral arrangement. Employing classical Monte Carlo simulations, we are able to explain the two transitions observed in the low-temperature magnetization curve from the experimental measurements. Remarkably, we show that the low-field phase is only realized when the inter-layer coupling is included. On the other hand, the intermediate-field phase is also found in a purely two-dimensional model and is described by a spin liquid featuring a subextensive degeneracy with a ferrimagnetic component. We show that this phase can be approximated by a checkerboard lattice in a magnetic field. We finally assess the effects of quantum fluctuations in zero fields using the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group method and predict the spin structure factor for comparison with future neutron scattering measurements.</description>

      <title>Fermions in Boundary Conformal Field Theory : Crossing Symmetry and $\epsilon$-Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the equations of motion in combination with crossing symmetry to constrain the properties of interacting fermionic boundary conformal field theories. This combination is an efficient way of determining operator product expansion coefficients and anomalous dimensions at the first few orders of the $\epsilon$ expansion. Two necessary ingredients for this procedure are knowledge of the boundary and bulk spinor conformal blocks. The bulk spinor conformal blocks are derived here for the first time. We then consider a number of examples. For $\phi$ a scalar field and $\psi$ a fermionic field, we study the effects of a $\phi \bar \psi \psi$ coupling in $4- \epsilon$ dimensions, a $\phi^2 \bar \psi \psi$ coupling in $3 -\epsilon$ dimensions, and a $(\bar \psi \psi)^2$ coupling in $2+\epsilon$ dimensions. We are able to compute some new anomalous dimensions for operators in these theories. Finally, we relate the anomalous dimension of a surface operator to the behavior of the charge density near the surface.</description>

      <title>Probing topological phases in a perturbed Kane-Mele model via RKKY interaction: Application to monolayer jacutingaite Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) are promising for spintronics, leveraging strong spin-orbit coupling for efficient spin manipulation via electrical and optical methods, with potential applications in memory storage, quantum computing, and spin-based logic. While the Kane-Mele model effectively captures the low-energy physics of these materials, the impact of perturbations driving phase transitions is less well understood. Developing approaches to describe these phases is crucial. Here, we study the noncollinear Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction between two magnetic impurities in a \textit{perturbed} Kane-Mele model with strong spin-orbit coupling, relevant to monolayer jacutingaite Pt$_2$HgSe$_3$ as a prominent QSHI. By analyzing RKKY interactions, we reveal distinct, relative (rather than absolute) signatures of the different phase transitions induced by static and dynamic perturbations based on their impact on magnetic impurities. We then employ these perturbations to switch between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic or clockwise and counterclockwise magnetic interactions for control processes. Our results offer a practical way to track topological phases via magnetic properties.</description>
