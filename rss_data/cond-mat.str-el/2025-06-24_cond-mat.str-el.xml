      <title>Tunable anyonic permeability across ${\mathbb{Z}_2}$ spin liquid junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two classes of junctions in a toric code, a prototypical model of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid, and study the nature of anyonic transport across them mediated by Zeeman fields. In the first class of junctions, termed potential barrier junctions, the charges sense effective static potentials and a change in the band mass. In a particular realization, while the junction is completely transparent to the electric charge, magnetic charge transmission is allowed only after a critical field strength. In the second class of junctions we stitch two toric codes with operators which do not commute at the junction. We show that the anyonic transmission gets tuned by effective pseudospin fluctuations at the junction. Using exact analytical mappings and numerical simulations, we compute charge-specific transmission probabilities. Our work, apart from uncovering the rich physical mechanisms at play in such junctions, can motivate experimental work to engineer defect structures in topologically ordered systems for tunable transport of anyonic particles.</description>

      <title>Raman scattering from moir\'e phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for probing moir\'e phonon modes using Raman spectroscopy, and illustrate it with the example of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG). These moir\'e phonons arise from interlayer sliding motion in twisted 2D materials and correspond to fluctuations of the stacking order in reconstructed moir\'e superlattices. These include both acoustic-like phason modes and a new set of low-energy optical modes originating from the zone-folding of monolayer graphene's acoustic modes, which are accessible via Raman spectroscopy. We show that the Raman response of TBG exhibits a series of low-frequency peaks that clearly distinguish it from that of decoupled layers. We further examine the role of anharmonic interactions in shaping the phonon linewidths and demonstrate the strong dependence of the Raman spectra on both the twist angle and the polarization of the incident light. Our findings establish Raman spectroscopy as a powerful tool for exploring moir\'e phonons in a broad class of twisted van der Waals systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-1/2 operators exactly mapped to spinful canonical Fermi operators present in two bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently it has been shown that the quantum spin-1/2 spin operators can be exactly transformed not only in spinless, but also in spinful canonical Fermi operators in 1D [\cite{JW1}], and 2D [\cite{JW2}] as well. In this paper, using the same technique based on an extended Jordan-Wigner transformation, we show in 1D, that the quantum spin-1/2 operators can be exactly transformed also in spinful canonical Fermi operators of spin-1/2 fermions that are belong to two bands.</description>

      <title>2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model with static domain walls and quasiperiodic disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of a two dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model on a square lattice to first minutely analyze its spectra including zero energy states (ZES) and in-gap states both under periodic and open boundaries. Thereafter, a series of antiphase domain walls (DW), distributed along two orthogonal lines, are introduced in the lattice with SSH like hoppings and this causes the ZES to localize not only at the corners but also at the intersection of the lines of domain walls. In-gap states not only populate at the edges but also show finite amplitudes along the DW lines. A different scenario appears for a radially symmetric distribution of domain walls along a circle around a poit within the lattice. It produces in-gap states localized at the center of the DW circle while the ZES show localizations around it in a symmetric fashion in the square lattice. We also probe the effect of a diagonal quasiperiodic disorder on the spectra and eigen-states of the 2D SSH model. This gives localization of the states more with a stronger disorder. We calculate participation ratios of the states and their averages to demonstrate how such localization develops with disorder. Lastly we also elaborate further on the eigenvalue and eigenstates of a few periodically hopping modulated cases, previously outlined briefly in the article: Jour. Phys. Cond.-Mat.{\bf 36}, 065301 (2024) and also give an account of the changed features of the spectra as a result of the application of DWs there. Our findings on these various fronts can increase many-fold the visibility of this popular model and the outcomes can be utilized in many emerging fields like topological quantum information processing, for example, by designing topological shielding of various kinds.</description>

      <title>Polarons with arbitrary nonlinear electron-phonon interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an exact computational method based on numerical X-propagators for solving polaron models with arbitrary nonlinear couplings of local vibration modes to the electron density and magnitude of the hopping amplitude. Our approach covers various polaron models, some of which were impossible to treat by any existing approximation-free techniques. Moreover, it remains efficient in the most relevant but computationally challenging regime of phonon frequencies much smaller than the electron bandwidth. As a case study, we consider the double-well type nonlinear model with quadratic ($g_2&lt;0$) and quartic ($g_4&gt;0$) interactions describing a broad class of technologically important materials, such as quantum paraelectric compounds and halide perovskites. We observe, depending on the model parameters, three qualitatively different regimes: (i) quantum interplay of quartic and quadratic interactions which suppresses effects of the quadratic coupling, (ii) intermediate-coupling regime with exponential $\propto \exp(\alpha g_2 \Omega^{-1/4})$ scaling of the quasiparticle weight and mass renormalization, and (iii) strong-coupling asymptotic behavior.</description>

      <title>Kitaev model in regular hyperbolic tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Kitaev model on regular hyperbolic trivalent tilings. Depending on the length $p$ of the elementary polygons, we examine two distinct tri-colorings of the tiling. Using a recent conjecture on the ground-state flux sector, we compute the phase diagram via exact diagonalizations and derive analytical expressions for the effective Hamiltonians in the isolated-dimer limit which are valid for all values of $p$. Our results interpolates between the Euclidean honeycomb lattice and the trivalent Bethe lattice ($p=\infty$) for which we derive the exact solution of the phase boundaries.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine electro-nuclear coupling at the quantum criticality of YbCu4Zn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An increasing number of Yb-based compounds fulfill the conditions for the investigation of hyperfine electro-nuclear coupling effects related to 171-Yb and 173-Yb isotopes. Among them, the lack of magnetic order down to the milikelvin range in compounds with robust localized electronic moments and their nuclear magnetism. Although reminiscences of short range magnetic interactions may be observed below 1K, such perturbation can be dodged investigating compounds located close to a quantum critical point (QCP), where quantum fluctuations prevent the development of magnetic correlations to develop. Within the family of cubic YbCu4M compounds (M = Ni, Au and Zn), we have investigated YbCu4Zn that shows a logarithmic temperature dependence: C_P /T ~ ln(T/TQ) in its electronic specific heat, as predicted for a QCP. Simultaneously, no signs of RKKY interactions are detected down to 0.03K. Due to the low Kondo temperature of its doublet ground state, the localized 4f electrons weakly couple with conduction electrons, allowing the coupling between nuclear and 4f electron moments to become relevant. However, the reminder Kondo interaction acts on the electronic hyperfine field producing a small deviation from the standard nuclear C_N ~ 1/T^2 dependence into a n &lt; 2 power law. The expected n = 2 dependence is progressively recovered under applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Driven Topological Transitions in Monolayer TaIrTe4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering materials that combine topological phenomena with correlated electron behavior is a central pursuit in quantum materials research. Monolayer TaIrTe$_4$ has recently emerged as a promising platform in this context, hosting robust quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) phases both within a single-particle gap and within a correlation-induced gap arising from van Hove singularities (vHSs), accessed via electrostatic doping. Its intrinsic monolayer nature offers exceptional tunability and the potential to realize a versatile array of interaction-driven topological phases. In this work, we combine theory and experiment to map the phase landscape of monolayer TaIrTe$_4$. Using Hartree-Fock calculations, we investigate the interaction-driven phase diagram near the vHSs under commensurate filling conditions. By systematically tuning the dielectric screening and strain, we uncover a rich set of ground states--including QSHI, trivial insulator, higher-order topological insulator, and metallic phase--among which are interaction-driven topological phase transitions. Experimentally, we perform both local and nonlocal transport measurements across a broad set of devices, which--due to unavoidable strain variations during fabrication-realize several phases consistent with theoretical predictions. Together, our results lay the groundwork for understanding correlation-driven topological phenomena in TaIrTe$_4$ and open new directions for engineering exotic quantum phases in low-dimensional materials beyond the limitations of moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <title>Influence of Interlayer Stacking on Optical Behavior in WSe$_{2}$/MoS$_{2}$ van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of crystal alignment on excitonic behavior in WSe$_{2}$/MoS$_{2}$ van der Waals heterostructures by comparing eclipsed (AA) and staggered (AB) stacking configurations. Our first-principles and symmetry-based analysis reveal that interlayer stacking symmetry plays a central role in determining the nature of electron-hole pairs. We uncover a rich variety of excitonic states, including spatially confined two-dimensional (2D) excitons, delocalized three-dimensional (3D) excitons, and charge-transfer (CT) excitons with interlayer character. The dimensionality and optical activity of these excitons are governed by the interplay among orbital character, interlayer hybridization, and symmetry-imposed selection rules. Our findings establish general principles for engineering excitonic properties in van der Waals heterostructures through controlled layer orientation and stacking order.</description>

      <title>Local classical correlations between physical electrons in the Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the local nonfreeness, an unbiased measure of correlation between electrons at a single lattice site, can be computed as the mutual information between local natural spin orbitals. Using this concept, we prove that local electron correlations in the Hubbard model are fully classical: in the natural basis the local reduced density matrix is separable and no quantum correlations beyond entanglement are present. Finally, we compare different theoretical descriptions of magnetic and nonmagnetic states, showing that local classical correlations are drastically influenced by nonlocal processes. Our results confirm the relation between local classical correlations within an open system and the nonlocal correlations with its quantum environment.</description>

      <title>Quantum critical dynamical response of the twisted Kitaev spin chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical structure factor of the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) shows universal power-law divergence at its quantum critical point, signatures of which have been arguably observed in inelastic neutron scattering studies of quantum spin chain materials, for example CoNb2O6. However, it has been recently suggested that its microscopic description is better captured in terms of a twisted Kitaev spin chain (TKSC) with bond-anisotropic couplings. Here, we present exact results for the dynamical structure factor of the TKSC across its quantum critical point, analyzing both the universal low-frequency response and the non-universal high-energy features. In addition, we explore extensions of the model including broken glide symmetry as well as the case of random, and incommensurate magnetic fields. Notably, in the latter case the fermionic excitations exhibit a localization-delocalization transition, which is manifest in the dynamical response as a distinct signature at finite frequency. We discuss the relevance of these features for the observation of quantum critical response in experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Origin of the Intrinsic Nonlinear Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the quantum geometric contribution to the intrinsic second-order nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) for a general multiband Hamiltonian. The nonlinear conductivity, obtained in Green's function formalism, is decomposed into its quantum geometric constituents using a projector-based approach. In addition to the previously identified Berry curvature and interband quantum metric dipoles, we obtain a third term of quantum geometric origin, given by the momentum derivative of the $intraband$ quantum metric. This contribution, which we term the intraband quantum metric dipole, provides substantial corrections to the NLHE in topological magnets and becomes the dominant geometric term in topological antiferromagnets with gapped Dirac cones. Considering generalized 2D and 3D Weyl/Dirac Hamiltonians, describing a large class of topological band crossings with sizable quantum geometry, we derive analytical expressions of the NLHE, thereby revealing the individual contributions of the three quantum geometric terms. Combined with an exhaustive symmetry classification of all magnetic space groups, this analysis leads to the identification of several candidate materials expected to exhibit large intrinsic NLHE, including the antiferromagnets $\text{Yb}_3\text{Pt}_4$, $\text{CuMnAs}$, and $\text{CoNb}_3\text{S}_6$, as well as the nodal-plane material $\text{MnNb}_3\text{S}_6$. Finally, our projector-based approach yields a compact expression for the NLHE in terms of momentum derivatives of the Bloch Hamiltonian matrix alone, enabling efficient numerical evaluation of each contribution in the aforementioned materials.</description>

      <title>Specific-heat anomaly in frustrated magnets with vacancy defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by frustrated magnets and spin-liquid-candidate materials, we study the thermodynamics of a 2D geometrically frustrating magnet with vacancy defects. The presence of vacancies imposes constraints on the bulk spins, which freezes some of the degrees of freedom in the system at low temperatures. With increasing temperature, these constraints get relaxed, resulting in an increase in the system's entropy. This leads to the emergence of a peak in the heat capacity $C(T)$ of the magnet at a temperature determined by the concentration of the vacancy defects. To illustrate the emergence of such an anomaly, we compute analytically the heat capacity of the antiferromagnetic (AFM) Ising model on the triangular lattice with vacancy defects. The presence of the vacancy leads to a peak in $C(T)$ at the temperature $T_\text{imp}=-6J/\ln n_\text{imp}$, where $J$ is the AFM coupling between the spins and $n_\text{imp}$ is the fraction of the missing sites.</description>

      <title>Measurement induced scrambling and emergent symmetries in random circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement is affected by unitary evolution, which spreads the entanglement through the whole system, and also by measurements, which usually tends to disentangle subsystems from the rest. Their competition has been known to result in the measurement-induced phase transition. But more intriguingly, measurement alone has the ability to drive a system into different entanglement phases. In this work, we map the entanglement evolution under unitaries and/or measurements into a classical spin problem. This framework is used to understand a myriad of random circuit models analytically, including measurement-induced and measurement-only transitions. Regarding many-body joint measurements, a lower bound of measurement range that is necessary for a global scrambled phase is derived. Moreover, emergent continuous symmetries (U(1) or SU(2)) are discovered in some random measurement models in the large-$d$ (qudit dimension) limit. The emergent continuous symmetry allows a variety of spin dynamics phenomena to find their counterparts in random circuit models.</description>

Abstract: Experimental data collected from a triple-axis spectrometer (TAS) are typically analysed by considering the instrument resolution, as the resolution of a TAS instrument is often complex and significantly influences the measured results. Two Python packages, TasVisAn and InsPy, have been developed to visualize and analyse data from TAS instruments - particularly from the cold-neutron TAS Sika and the thermal-neutron TAS Taipan at the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering. TasVisAn offers a range of functions, including data importing, reduction, plotting, contour mapping, convolution fitting, and more, for data collected on TAS instruments, especially on Sika and Taipan. It also supports data reduction of the current trendy multi-analyser and multiplexing TAS instruments, including the multiplexing mode of Sika. Besides, it includes scan simulation and batch file validation tools for both Taipan and Sika, assisting users in designing and planning experiments in advance. InsPy is a general-purpose Python package designed to calculate the four-dimensional (4D) instrument resolution in momentum-energy space for any TAS instrument. Combined with InsPy, TasVisAn supports both instrument resolution calculation and resolution-convoluted data fitting. Its flexible external data import feature further allows TasVisAn to be adapted for the visualization and convolution analysis of inelastic neutron scattering data across various TAS instruments.</description>

      <title>Optical Excitations of Flat Bands Induced by Exciton Condensation in Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_{5}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the charge dynamics of Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ using temperature-dependent optical spectroscopy with polarized light. We observe a metal-insulator transition characterized by the collapse of Drude response and the emergence of sharp and narrow absorption peaks at low temperatures. Unlike previous excitonic insulator candidates such as TiSe$_2$ and Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$, where the excitonic order is intertwined with charge density wave or structural instabilities, the sharp features in Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ point to intrinsic excitonic excitations associated with ultra-flat bands driven by many-body renormalization of the band structure via spontaneous exciton condensation. Our findings thus provide clear-cut optical evidence for exciton condensation in a bulk crystal and establish Ta$_2$Pd$_3$Te$_5$ as a promising platform for exploring correlated quantum phases and novel excitonic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Probing d-wave superconducting gap of high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprate $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Sr}_2\mathrm{Ca}_2\mathrm{Cu}_3\mathrm{O}_{10+\delta}$ by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting gap is a characteristic feature of high-T$_c$ superconductors and provides crucial information on the pairing mechanism underlying high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we employ high-resolution resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Cu $L_3$-edge to investigate the superconducting gap in the overdoped cuprate $\mathrm{Bi}_2\mathrm{Sr}_2\mathrm{Ca}_2\mathrm{Cu}_3\mathrm{O}_{10+\delta}$ ($T_\mathrm{c}$ = 107 K). By analyzing antisymmetrized, temperature-dependent RIXS spectra over a range of in-plane momentum transfers, we observe a clear suppression of low-energy spectral weight below T$_c$, indicative of superconducting gap formation. This suppression is most pronounced at small momentum transfers ($|\boldsymbol{q}_\parallel| \leq 0.18$ r.l.u.) and corresponds to a gap size of approximately 2$\Delta_0 \sim$ 130 meV. Comparison with theoretical calculations of the momentum-dependent charge susceptibility supports a d-wave symmetry of the superconducting gap, while an isotropic s-wave gap fails to reproduce key experimental features. These findings establish RIXS as a powerful, bulk-sensitive probe of superconducting gap symmetry and highlight its utility for studying materials beyond the reach of surface-sensitive techniques such as ARPES and STM.</description>

      <title>R\'{e}nyi and Shannon mutual information in critical and decohered critical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a critical many-body system by introducing a R\'{e}nyi generalized mutual information, connecting between R\'{e}nyi mutual information and R\'{e}nyi Shannon mutual information. This R\'{e}nyi generalized mutual information can offer more experimentally accessible alternative than the conventional entanglement entropy. As a critical many-body state, we focus on the critical transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) described by the Ising conformal field theory (CFT). We show that even if we modify the non-selective projective measurement assumed in R\'{e}nyi Shannon mutual information by replacing the measurement into decoherence by environment, the R\'{e}nyi generalized Shannon mutual information maintains the CFT properties such as subsystem CFT scaling law and its central charge observed through both the conventional R\'{e}nyi Shannon mutual information and R\'{e}nyi mutual information. Furthermore, we apply a local decoherence to the critical ground state of the TFIM and numerically observe the R\'{e}nyi generalized mutual information by changing the parameter controlling environment effect (corresponding to the strength of measurement) in the R\'{e}nyi generalized mutual information and the strength of the decoherence to which the entire system subjects. We find that R\'{e}nyi-$2$ type central charge connected to the central charge is fairly robust, indicating the strong robustness of the Ising CFT properties against local decoherence by environment.</description>

      <title>Topological crystals and soliton lattices in a Gross-Neveu model with Hilbert-space fragmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the finite-density phase diagram of the single-flavour Gross-Neveu-Wilson (GNW) model using matrix product state (MPS) simulations. At zero temperature and along the symmetry line of the phase diagram, we find a sequence of inhomogeneous ground states that arise through a real-space version of the mechanism of Hilbert-space fragmentation. For weak interactions, doping the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of the GNW model leads to localized charges or holes at periodic arrangements of immobile topological defects separating the fragmented subchains: a topological crystal. Increasing the interactions, we observe a transition into a parity-broken phase with a pseudoscalar condensate displaying a modulated periodic pattern. This soliton lattice is a sequence of topological charges corresponding to anti-kinks, which also bind the doped fermions at their respective centers. Out of this symmetry line, we show that quasi-spiral profiles appear with a characteristic wavevector set by the density $k = 2{\pi}{\rho}$, providing non-perturbative evidence for chiral spirals beyond the large-N limit. These results demonstrate that various exotic inhomogeneous phases can arise in lattice field theories, and motivate the use of quantum simulators to confirm such QCD-inspired phenomena in future experiments.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Study of Critical Fermi Surface with Spatially Disordered Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Fermi liquids are an important topic in condensed matter physics, as their characteristics challenge the framework of traditional Fermi liquid theory and reveal the complex behavior of electrons in strongly interacting systems. Despite some progress in this field, linear-in-temperature resistivity and inverse-in-frequency tail of optical conductivity are unresolved issues in non-Fermi liquids. Both the experimentally observed smeared region and the theoretically predicted marginal Fermi liquid suggest that spatial disorder seems to be an important driver of these phenomena. By performing large-scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations in the ferromagnetic spin-fermion model at finite $N$, beyond the large-$N$ used in previous theoretical work, we investigated the role of spatial disorder in the critical Fermi surface (FS) of this model. We proposed a corrected theory of our system, which is based on a modified Eliashberg theory and a universal theory of strange metals. This theory agrees well with the data obtained from DQMC, particularly in capturing the $\omega \ln \omega$ type self-energy characteristic of marginal Fermi liquid behavior, though temperature limitations prevent us from observing the linear-in-temperature scattering rate. Our findings offer strong and unbiased validation of the universal theory of strange metals, broaden the applicability of the modified Eliashberg theory, and provide insights for numerically searching for marginal Fermi liquid and linear-in-temperature resistivity.</description>

      <title>Anyon polarons as a window into competing phases of the Kitaev honeycomb model under a Zeeman field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the spectra of anyon quasiparticles in all three super-selection sectors of the Kitaev model (i.e., visons, fermions and bosons), perturbed by a Zeeman field away from its exactly solvable limit, to gain insights on the competition of its non-abelian spin-liquid with other nearby phases, such as the mysterious intermediate state observed in the antiferromagnetic model. Both for the ferro- and antiferro-magnetic models we find that the fermions and visons become gapless at nearly identical critical Zeeman couplings. In the ferromagnetic model this is consistent with a direct transition into a polarized state. In the anti-ferromagnetic model this implies that previous theories of the intermediate phase viewed as a spin liquid with a different fermion Chern number are inadequate, as they presume that the vison gap does not close. In the antiferromagnetic model we also find that a bosonic quasiparticle becomes gapless at nearly the same critical field as the fermions and visons. This boson carries the quantum numbers of an anti-ferromagnetic order parameter, suggesting that the intermediate phase has spontaneously broken symmetry with this order.</description>

      <title>Exact Chiral Symmetries of 3+1D Hamiltonian Lattice Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct Hamiltonian models on a 3+1d cubic lattice for a single Weyl fermion and for a single Weyl doublet protected by exact (as opposed to emergent) chiral symmetries. In the former, we find a not-on-site, non-compact chiral symmetry which can be viewed as a Hamiltonian analog of the Ginsparg-Wilson symmetry in Euclidean lattice models of Weyl fermions. In the latter, we combine an on-site $U(1)$ symmetry with a not-on-site $U(1)$ symmetry, which together generate the $SU(2)$ flavor symmetry of the doublet at low energies, while in the UV they generate an algebra known in integrability as the Onsager algebra. This latter model is in fact the celebrated magnetic Weyl semimetal which is known to have a chiral anomaly from the action of $U(1)$ and crystalline translation, that gives rise to an anomalous Hall response - however reinterpreted in our language, it has two exact $U(1)$ symmetries that gives rise to the global $SU(2)$ anomaly which protects the gaplessness even when crystalline translations are broken. We also construct an exact symmetry-protected single Dirac cone in 2+1d with the $U(1) \rtimes T$ parity anomaly. Our constructions evade both old and recently-proven no-go theorems by using not-on-siteness in a crucial way, showing our results are sharp.</description>

      <title>Stability of quasi-particle creation and multiband geometry in fractional Chern insulators under magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study creation of quasi-particles in fractional Chern insulators (FCI) under magnetic fields. We consider two representative models, the Kapit-Mueller model and the checkerboard model, which have distinct band properties in terms of the quantum geometry. The former satisfies the so-called ideal condition and well mimics the lowest Landau level, while the latter is not ideal for realization of FCI states. It is found within exact diagonalization that both quasi-holes and quasi-electrons are stably created by the magnetic fields in the Kapit-Mueller model. On the other hand, stability of the quasi-particle creation depends on directions of the magnetic field in the checkerboard model. Although the quasi-electron creation is stable under a magnetic field, the quasi-hole creation and the underlying FCI state are unstable for the opposite field direction, leading to a field-induced non-FCI state. We point out that this difference can be understood based on the multiband quantum geometry in the presence of the magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Magnetic excitations of a trilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the squared sublattice magnetizations and magnetic excitations of a $S=1/2$ trilayer antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model with interlayer interaction $J_{\bot}$ and intralayer interaction $J_{//}$ by employing stochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE-QMC) and stochastic analytic continuation (SAC) methods. Compared with the bilayer model, the trilayer model has one inner layer and two outer layers. The change in its symmetry can lead to special magnetic excitations. Our study reveals that the maximum of the magnetization of the outer sublattice corresponds to smaller ratio parameter $g={J_{//}}/{J_{\bot}}$, a finding that is verified using the finite-size extrapolation. As $g$ decreases, the excitation spectra gradually evolve from a degenerate magnon mode with continua to low-energy and high-energy branches. Particularly when $g$ is small enough, like $0.02$, the high-energy spectrum further splits into characteristic doublon ($\approx J_{\bot}$) and quarton ($\approx 1.5 J_{\bot}$) spectral bands. Moreover, the accuracy of the magnetic excitations is confirmed through the SpinW software package and the dispersion relations derived through the linear spin wave theory. Our results provide an important reference for experiments, which can be directly compared with experimental data from inelastic neutron scattering results to verify and guide the accuracy of experimental detection.</description>

Abstract: The study of magnetism in two-dimensional materials has garnered significant interest, driven by fundamental investigations into low-dimensional magnetic phenomena and their potential for applications in spintronic devices. Through dynamical mean-field theory calculations, we demonstrate that Ni$_{3}$GeTe$_{2}$ exhibits flat-band characteristics resulting from the geometric frustration of its layered triangular lattice. These flat bands are further renormalized due to electronic correlation. Our calculations reveal that the magnetic order of Ni atoms is significantly influenced by both the Coulomb interaction and Hund's coupling, indicating that the physics of Ni atoms is situated in an intermediate region between Hundness and Mottness. Additionally, our results show that Ni atoms experience significant spin fluctuations in their local moments, maintaining paramagnetism at low temperatures. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of vacancies, finding a substantial suppression of the density of states at the Fermi level. The physical mechanisms uncovered by our study provide a comprehensive understanding of the novel properties exhibited in this material.</description>

      <title>Landau-Ginzburg Paradigm of Topological Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topologically ordered matter phases have been regarded as beyond the Landau-Ginzburg symmetry breaking paradigm of matter phases. Recent studies of anyon condensation in topological phases, however, may fit topological phases back in the Landau-Ginzburg paradigm. To truly do so, we realized that the string-net model of topological phases is in fact an effective lattice gauge theory coupled with anyonic matter once two modifications are made: (1) We reinterpret anyons as matter fields coupled to lattice gauge fields, thus extending the HGW model to a genuine Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. (2) By explicitly incorporating the internal degrees of freedom of anyons, we construct an enlarged Hilbert space that supports well-defined gauge transformations and covariant coupling, restoring the analogy with conventional lattice gauge field theory. In this modified string-net model, topological phase transitions induced by anyon condensation and their consequent phenomena, such as order parameter fields, coherent states, Goldstone modes, and gapping gauge degrees of freedom, can be formulated exactly as Landau's effective theory of the Higgs mechanism. To facilitate the understanding, we also compare anyon condensation to/with the Higgs boson condensation in the electroweak theory and the Cooper pair condensation.</description>

Abstract: A material in possession of localized 4f-electron magnetism and delocalized 3d-electron or band magnetism can often present A material in possession of localized 4f-electron magnetism and delocalized 3d-electron or band magnetism can often present enigmatic physical phenomena, and there has been a longstanding interest in the kagome metal YbFe6Ge6. More recently, because of an investigation of a so-called anomalous Hall effect, or topological Hall effect, and magnetic neutron Bragg diffraction [W. Yao et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 186501 (2025)]. Iron moments in the two-dimensional layers of a hexagonal nuclear structure undergo collinear antiferromagnetic order below a temperature 500 K. The moments depart from the c axis in a spontaneous transition at 63 K to an orthorhombic structure. The magnetism of Yb ions appears to behave independently, which can be confirmed using resonant x-ray diffraction enhanced by a Fe atomic resonance. The inferred magnetic space group is a P(parity)T(time)-symmetric (anti-inversion collinear antiferromagnet. A linear magnetoelectric effect is allowed, as in historically important chromium sesquioxide, and Kerr rotation and the piezomagnetic effect are forbidden. Symmetry informed Bragg diffraction patterns for future x-ray and neutron experiments are shown to be rich in Fe magnetic properties of orthorhombic YbFe6Ge6, including space-spin correlations, anapoles and Dirac quadrupoles familiar in high-Tc ceramic superconductors.</description>

      <title>Atomic and bond polarization causing strong screening of short-range Coulomb interactions and its effect in cuprate superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00787v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel and efficient real space, semiclassical model of electric polarization with general applicability to any system in which screening plays an important role. This model includes the effects of both atomic and bond polarizabilities, the latter originating from the modification of local bond charge transfer energies induced by polarizing charges. The nonlinear interference of multiple polarization clouds and the emergence of local field effects are highlighted as key phenomena highly influencing the short-range screening of the Coulomb interaction. As a representative system to showcase this model, the screened interaction between doped holes in the CuO$_2$ planes of cuprate high-temperature superconductors is investigated. This leads to the emergence of striking direction-dependent short-range minima in their Coulomb repulsion, which can strongly reduce the need for retardation effects and allow for an enhancement of the attractive interaction resulting from the exchange of bosons between two electrons or holes. This in turn enhances T$_C$, shortens the Cooper pair coherence length and supports the materialization of the pseudogap phase anisotropy observed in many high-T$_C$ superconductors.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07195v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by L\"{u}scher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</description>

      <title>Reentrant topological phases and spin density wave induced by 1D moir\'e potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01656v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies of 2D moir\'e materials have opened opportunities for advancing condensed matter physics. However, the effect of 1D moir\'e potentials on topological and correlated phases remains largely unexplored. Here we reveal a sequence of trivial-to-topological transitions and periodic-moir\'e-spin density waves induced by the 1D commensurate moir\'e potentials for spin-1/2 fermionic atoms. Such reentrant topology from a trivial phase is absent without the moir\'e potential and can be understood as the renormalization of topological parameters by the moir\'e strength. We then unveil the critical exponent and localization properties of the single-particle eigenstates. The periodic spin density wave of many-body ground states is contributed by the moir\'e potential, and is enhanced by on-site interactions but suppressed by nearest-neighbor interactions. Our results enrich the topological physics with multiple transitions and spin-density orders in 1D moir\'e systems, and the realization of the proposed model is promising in near-future ultracold atom setups.</description>

      <title>Theory of Irreversibility in Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the longstanding challenge in quantum many-body theory of reconciling unitary dynamics with irreversible relaxation. In classical chaos, the unitary evolution operator develops Ruelle-Pollicott (RP) resonances inside the unit circle in the continuum limit, leading to mixing. In the semiclassical limit, chaotic single-particle quantum systems relax with the same RP resonances. In contrast, the theory of quantum many-body RP resonances and their link to irreversibility remain underdeveloped. Here, we relate the spectral form factor to the sum of autocorrelation functions and, in generic many-body lattice systems without conservation laws, argue that all quantum many-body RP resonances converge inside the unit disk, highlighting the role of nonunitary and the thermodynamic limit. While we conjecture this picture to be general, we analytically prove the emergence of irreversibility in the random phase model (RPM), a paradigmatic Floquet quantum circuit model, in the limit of large local Hilbert space dimension. To this end, we couple it to local environments and compute the exact time evolution of autocorrelation functions, the dissipative form factor, and out-of-time-order correlation functions (OTOCs). Although valid for any dissipation strength, we then focus on weak dissipation to clarify the origin of irreversibility in unitary systems. When the dissipationless limit is taken after the thermodynamic limit, the unitary quantum map develops an infinite tower of decaying RP resonances -- chaotic systems display so-called anomalous relaxation. We also show that the OTOC in the RPM can undergo a two-stage relaxation and that during the second stage, the approach to the stationary value is again controlled by the leading RP resonance.

      <title>Chemically-Disordered Transparent Conductive Perovskites with High Crystalline Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09193v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript presents a working model linking chemical disorder and transport properties in correlated-electron perovskites with high-entropy formulations and a framework to actively design them. We demonstrate this new learning in epitaxial Sr$x$(Ti,Cr,Nb,Mo,W)O$3$ thin films that exhibit exceptional crystalline fidelity despite a diverse chemical formulation where most B-site species are highly misfit with respect to valence and radius. X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy confirm a unique combination of chemical disorder and structural perfection in thick epitaxial layers. This combination produces significant electron correlation, low electrical resistivity, and an optical transparency window that surpasses that of constituent end-members, with a flattened frequency- and temperature-dependent response. We address the computational challenges of modeling such systems and investigate short-range ordering using cluster expansion. These results showcase that unusual d-metal combinations access an expanded property design space that is predictable using end-member characteristics -- though unavailable to them -- thus offering performance advances in optical, spintronic, and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Page Curve and Entanglement Dynamics in an Interacting Fermionic Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generic non-equilibrium many-body systems display a linear growth of bipartite entanglement entropy in time, followed by a volume law saturation. In stark contrast, the Page curve dynamics of black hole physics shows that the entropy peaks at the Page time $t_{\text{Page}}$ and then decreases to zero. Here, we investigate such Page-like behavior of the von Neumann entropy in a model of strongly correlated spinless fermions in a typical system-environment setup, and characterize the properties of the Page curve dynamics in the presence of interactions using numerically exact matrix product states methods. The two phases of growth, namely the linear growth and the bending down, are shown to be separated by a non-analyticity in the min-entropy before $t_{\text{Page}}$, which separates two different quantum phases, realized as the respective ground states of the corresponding entanglement (or equivalently, modular) Hamiltonian. We confirm and generalize, by introducing interactions, the findings of \href{https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.109.224308}{Phys. Rev. B 109, 224308 (2024)} for a free spinless fermionic chain where the corresponding entanglement Hamiltonian undergoes a quantum phase transition at the point of non-analyticity. However, in the presence of interactions, a scaling analysis gives a non-zero critical time for the non-analyticity in the thermodynamic limit only for weak to intermediate interaction strengths, while the dynamics leading to the non-analyticity becomes \textit{instantaneous} for interactions large enough. We present a physical picture explaining these findings.</description>

      <title>Pairing phase diagram for electron-doped cuprates in the square-lattice $t-U-V$ Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by significant discrepancies between experimental observations of electron-doped cuprates and numerical results of the Hubbard model, we investigate the role of nearest-neighbor (NN) electron interactions $V$ by studying the $t-U-V$ model on square lattices. Upon doping $\delta$= 0.153, by using constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) method, we find that NN electron attraction $V$ can notably drive an exotic $p$-wave spin-triplet pairing, while the NN electron repulsion $V$ will suppress the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave ($d$-wave) pairing and triggers the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing. Especially in the intermediate coupling regime, as NN repulsion increases, the intensity of $d_{xy}$-wave pairing also increases, further suppressing the presence of $d$-wave pairing, which may help explain the notable suppression of $d$-wave pairing in electron-doped cuprate superconductors. Besides the pairing phase, we also find that the NN electron attraction $V$ has no significant effect on spin density wave (SDW) and charge density wave (CDW), but repulsion $V$ significantly enhanced CDW and suppressed SDW. Our study suggests the $t-U-V$ Hubbard model can serve as the minimal model to capture the essential physics of the electron-doped cuprates.</description>

Abstract: Lindbladian dynamics of open systems may be employed to steer a many-body system towards a non-trivial ground state of a local Hamiltonian. Such protocols provide us with tunable platforms facilitating the engineering and study of non-trivial many-body states. Steering towards a degenerate ground state manifold provides us with a protected platform to employ many-body states as a resource for quantum information processing. Notably, ground states of frustrated local Hamiltonians have been known not to be amenable to steering protocols. Revisiting this intricate physics we report two new results: (i) we find a broad class of (geometrically) frustrated local Hamiltonians for which steering of the ground state manifold is possible through a sequence of discrete steering steps. Following the steering dynamics, states within the degenerate ground-state manifold keep evolving in a non-stationary manner. (ii) For the class of Hamiltonians with ground states which are non-steerable through local superoperators, we derive a "glass floor" on how close to the ground state one can get implementing a steering protocol. This is expressed invoking the concept of cooling-by-steering (a lower bound of the achievable temperature), or through an upper bound of the achievable fidelity. Our work provides a systematic outline for studying quantum state manipulation of a broad class of strongly correlated states.</description>

      <title>Emergent Holographic Spacetime from Quantum Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Holographic duality describes gravitational theories in terms of quantum many-body systems. In holography, quantum information theory provides a crucial tool that directly connects microscopic structures of these systems to the geometries of gravitational spacetimes. One manifestation is that the entanglement entropy in quantum many-body systems can be calculated from the area of an extremal surface in the corresponding gravitational spacetime. This implies that a gravitational spacetime can emerge from an enormous number of entangled qubits. In this Essay, I will discuss open problems in this area of research, considering recent developments and outlining future prospects towards a complete understanding of quantum gravity. The first step in this direction is to understand what kind of quantum circuits each holographic spacetime corresponds to, drawing on recent developments in quantum complexity theories and studying concrete examples of holography in string theory. Next, we should extend the concept of holography to general spacetimes, e.g., those spacetimes which appear in realistic cosmologies, by utilizing the connections between quantum information and holography. To address the fundamental question of how time emerges, I will propose the concepts of pseudo-entropy and time-like entanglement as a useful tool in our exploration.</description>

      <title>Half-integer thermal conductance in the absence of Majorana mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12526v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering a range of candidate quantum phases of matter, half-integer thermal conductance ($\kappa_{\text{th}}$) is believed to be an unambiguous evidence of non-Abelian states. It has been long known that such half-integer values arise due to the presence of Majorana edge modes, representing a significant step towards topological quantum computing platforms. Here, we challenge this prevailing notion by presenting a comprehensive theoretical and experimental study where half-integer two-terminal thermal conductance plateau is realized employing Abelian phases. Our proposed setup features a confined geometry of bilayer graphene, interfacing distinct particle-like and hole-like integer quantum Hall states. Each segment of the device exhibits full charge and thermal equilibration. Our approach is amenable to generalization to other quantum Hall platforms, and may give rise to other values of fractional (electrical and thermal) quantized transport. Our study demonstrates that the observation of robust non-integer values of thermal conductance can arise as a manifestation of mundane equilibration dynamics as opposed to underlying non-trivial topology.</description>
