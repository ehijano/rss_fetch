      <title>Heat transfer and mixing in initiated Chemical Vapor Deposition analyzed by in-situ gas composition sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of iCVD kinetics often make assumptions about the iCVD vapor phase that have been challenging to validate experimentally. We address this gap by investigating heat transfer and mixing in the iCVD reactor using in-situ gas composition sensing. Our work allows practitioners of iCVD to estimate the degree of mixing and temperature profile in the vapor phase based on reactor dimensions and process variables such as chamber pressure. We begin by using dimensional analysis to simplify the parameter space governing heat transfer and mixing, identifying key dimensionless groups that capture the dominant physics. We find that the degree of mixing in the reactor is primarily determined by the Peclet number (Pe), and heat transfer is primarily determined by the Knudsen number (Kn). Multiphysics simulations of the iCVD reactor provide visualizations of non-ideal mixing and allow us to identify the critical Pe above which the well-mixed assumption may begin to break down. To verify that the well-mixed assumption applies to iCVD at low Pe, we measured the residence time distribution (RTD) for argon and isopropanol flowing at 1 sccm, finding a close match to the well-mixed model. We used a Pirani pressure gauge for composition sensing to measure the RTD. We demonstrate the Pirani gauge to be a precise gas composition sensor, which is more modular and less expensive than methods like in-situ infrared spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. We then address heat transfer by measuring thermal diffusion from the filament at a range of pressures in argon and isopropanol. We quantified the effects of non-ideal heat transfer at low pressures and identified a critical Kn, above which heat transfer is independent of pressure. Measurement of thermally driven pressure changes in batch mode enables us to define and model an "effective temperature" for the reactor, matching the thermal diffusion model.</description>

      <title>The classical limit of quantum mechanics through coarse-grained measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the classical limit of quantum mechanics, focusing on its emergence through coarse-grained measurements when multiple outcomes are conflated into slots. We rigorously derive effective classical kinematics under such measurements, demonstrating that when the volume of the coarse-grained slot in phase space significantly exceeds Planck's constant, quantum states can be effectively described by classical probability distributions. Furthermore, we show that the dynamics, derived under coarse-grained observations and the linear approximation of the quantum Hamiltonian around its classical values within the slots, is effectively described by a classical Hamiltonian following Liouville dynamics. The classical Hamiltonian obtained through this process is equivalent to the one from which the underlying quantum Hamiltonian is derived via the (Dirac) quantization procedure, completing the quantization-classical limit loop. The Ehrenfest time, marking the duration within which classical behavior remains valid, is analyzed for various physical systems. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of both macroscopic and microscopic systems, revealing the mechanisms behind their observed classicality. This work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the quantum-to-classical transition and addresses foundational questions about the consistency of the quantization-classical limit cycle.</description>
