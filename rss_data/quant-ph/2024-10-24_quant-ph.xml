      <title>A practical applicable quantum-classical hybrid ant colony algorithm for the NISQ era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum ant colony optimization (QACO) has drew much attention since it combines the advantages of quantum computing and ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm overcoming some limitations of the traditional ACO algorithm. However,due to the hardware resource limitations of currently available quantum computers, the practical application of the QACO is still not realized. In this paper, we developed a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm by combining the clustering algorithm with QACO algorithm.This extended QACO can handle large-scale optimization problems with currently available quantum computing resource. We have tested the effectiveness and performance of the extended QACO algorithm with the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) as benchmarks, and found the algorithm achieves better performance under multiple diverse datasets. In addition, we investigated the noise impact on the extended QACO and evaluated its operation possibility on current available noisy intermediate scale quantum(NISQ) devices. Our work shows that the combination of the clustering algorithm with QACO effectively improved its problem solving scale, which makes its practical application possible in current NISQ era of quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Quantum Large Language Models via Tensor Network Disentanglers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by integrating quantum computing and quantum-inspired techniques. Specifically, our approach involves replacing the weight matrices in the Self-Attention and Multi-layer Perceptron layers with a combination of two variational quantum circuits and a quantum-inspired tensor network, such as a Matrix Product Operator (MPO). This substitution enables the reproduction of classical LLM functionality by decomposing weight matrices through the application of tensor network disentanglers and MPOs, leveraging well-established tensor network techniques. By incorporating more complex and deeper quantum circuits, along with increasing the bond dimensions of the MPOs, our method captures additional correlations within the quantum-enhanced LLM, leading to improved accuracy beyond classical models while maintaining low memory overhead.</description>

      <title>Generation of non-classical and entangled light states using intense laser-matter interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-classical and entangled light states are of fundamental interest in quantum mechanics and they are a powerful tool for the emergence of new quantum technologies. The development of methods that can lead to the generation of such light states is therefore of high importance. Recently, we have demonstrated that intense laser-matter interactions can serve towards this direction. Specifically, we have shown how the use of fully quantized approaches in intense laser-matter interactions and the process of high harmonic generation, can lead to the generation high photon-number non-classical (optical Schr\"{o}dinger's "cat" or squeezed) and entangled states from the far-infrared (IR) to the extreme-ultraviolet (XUV). Here, after a brief introduction on the fundamentals, we summarize the operation principles of these approaches and we discuss the future directions of non-classical light engineering using strong laser fields, and the potential applications in ultrafast and quantum information science. Our findings open the way to a novel quantum nonlinear spectroscopy method, based on the interplay between the quantum properties of light with that of quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Optimal conversion of Kochen-Specker sets into bipartite perfect quantum strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipartite perfect quantum strategies (BPQSs) allow two players isolated from each other to win every trial of a nonlocal game. BPQSs have crucial roles in recent developments in quantum information and quantum computation. However, only few BPQSs with a small number of inputs are known and only one of them has been experimentally tested. It has recently been shown that every BPQS has an associated Kochen-Specker (KS) set. Here, we first prove that any BPQS of minimum input cardinality that can be obtained from a generalized KS set can also be obtained from a KS set of pure states. Then, we address the problem of finding BPQSs of small input cardinality starting from KS sets. We introduce an algorithm that identifies the BPQS with the minimum number of settings for any given KS set. We apply it to many well-known KS sets of small input cardinality in dimensions $3$, $4$, $5$, $6$, $7$, and $8$. In each dimension, the algorithm either obtains the best BPQS known or find one with fewer inputs.</description>

      <title>First Photon Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum techniques are expected to revolutionize how information is acquired, exchanged, and processed. Yet it has been a challenge to realize and measure their values in practical settings. We present first photon machine learning as a new paradigm of neural networks and establish the first unambiguous advantage of quantum effects for artificial intelligence. By extending the physics behind the double-slit experiment for quantum particles to a many-slit version, our experiment finds that a single photon can perform image recognition at around $30\%$ fidelity, which beats by a large margin the theoretical limit of what a similar classical system can possibly achieve (about 24\%). In this experiment, the entire neural network is implemented in sub-attojoule optics and the equivalent per-calculation energy cost is below $10^{-24}$ joule, highlighting the prospects of quantum optical machine learning for unparalleled advantages in speed, capacity, and energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Universal Gate Set for Optical Lattice Based Atom Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new paradigm for atom interferometry and demonstrate that there exists a universal set of atom optic components for inertial sensing. These components constitute gates with which we carry out quantum operations and represent input-output matterwave transformations between lattice eigenstates. Each gate is associated with a modulation pattern of the position of the optical lattice according to machine-designed protocols. In this methodology, a sensor can be reprogrammed to respond to an evolving set of design priorities without modifying the hardware. We assert that such a gate set is metrologically universal, in analogy to universal gate sets for quantum computing. Experimental confirmation of the designed operation is demonstrated via in situ imaging of the spatial evolution of a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice, and by measurement of the momentum probabilities following time-of-flight expansion. The representation of several basic quantum sensing circuits is presented for the measurement of inertial forces, rotating reference frames, and gravity gradients.</description>

      <title>Selective continuous-variable quantum process tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum process tomography is a useful tool for characterizing quantum processes. This task is essential for the development of different areas, such as quantum information processing. We present a protocol for selective continuous-variable quantum process tomography. Our proposal allows to selectively estimate any element of an unknown continuous-variable quantum process in the position representation, without requiring the complete reconstruction of the process. By resorting to controlled squeezing and translation operations, and adaptatively discretizing the process, a direct measure of an estimate of any process element can be obtained. Furthermore, we show how the protocol can be used to partially reconstruct on a region a continuous-variable quantum process, alongside numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Can Constrained Quantum Annealing Be Effective in Noisy Quantum Annealers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the performance of penalty-based quantum annealing (PQA) and constrained quantum annealing (CQA) in solving the graph partitioning problem under various noise models, including depolarizing, bit-flip, and phase-flip noise. We found that even in the absence of noise, the relative superiority of PQA or CQA is highly problem-dependent. PQA generally demonstrates relatively stable success probabilities, while CQA's performance varies significantly across problem instances. Notably, CQA experiences leakage from the constraint-satisfying subspace under most noise models, with the exception of phase-flip noise, where no leakage occurs exactly. The dependence of success probability on noise strength reveals that PQA consistently outperforms CQA in the weak noise regime, whereas CQA achieves higher success probabilities under strong phase-flip noise. However, even in this case, the overall success probability remains low, suggesting that CQA is not yet practical for noisy quantum annealers without the development of error-corrected quantum annealing and autonomous error correction techniques to address leakage from the constraint-satisfying subspace. To confine the system within the constraint subspace in CQA, error correction methods and cat code encoding will likely be required, both of which can suppress bit-flip errors.</description>

      <title>Prethermal Floquet time crystals in chiral multiferroic chains and applications as quantum sensors of AC fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergence of prethermal Floquet Time Crystal (pFTC) in disordered chiral multiferroic chains. The model is an extension of the usual periodically driven nearest-neighbor disordered Heisenberg chain, with additional next-nearest-neighbor Heisenberg couplings and DMI interactions due to external magnetic and electric couplings. We derive the phase diagram of the model, characterizing the magnetization, entanglement, and coherence dynamics of the system along the extended interactions. In addition, we explore the application of the pFTC as quantum sensors of AC fields. The sensor performance to estimate small AC fields is quantified through the quantum Fisher information (QFI) measure. The sensor offers several advantages as compared to those composed of non-interacting spins due to its intrinsic robustness, long coherent interrogation time, and many-body correlations. Specifically, the sensor can overcome the standard quantum limit ($\rm{SQL} \sim N t^2$) during the prethermal regime, reaching an optimum performance at the pFTC lifetime $t^*$, where the $\rm{QFI}/Nt^{*^2} \sim N^\alpha$ with $\alpha &gt; 0$, scaling superlinarly with the number of spins. Different from \text{full} FTCs, the prethermal lifetime does not diverge in the thermodynamic limit, nevertheless it can be exponentially long with tuning system parameters.</description>

      <title>Universal Entanglement Revival of Topological Origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have analyzed the dynamics of entanglement in dissipative fermionic and bosonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models and found that, when the decoherence channel preserves the chiral symmetry, they exhibit a revival of entanglement in a wide range of parameters. This behavior only emerges in the topological phase, with the visibility of the revival dropping to zero at the phase boundary. Furthermore, the revival acquires a universal character once the system size exceeds the localization length of the edge modes. Our findings indicate that the universal entanglement revival has its origin in the topological properties of the SSH model. These dynamical properties may be experimentally accessible, for example, using photonic quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Phase sensitivity for an SU(1,1) interferometer via multiphoton subtraction at the output port</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of quantum precision measurement, enhancing phase sensitivity is crucial for various applications, including quantum metrology and quantum sensing technologies. We theoretically investigate the improvement in phase sensitivity and quantum Fisher information achieved through multiphoton subtraction operations at the output port of an SU(1,1) interferometer under conditions of photon loss. We use vacuum and coherent states as the inputs and detect the outputs by intensity detection. The results indicate that internal photon losses within the SU(1,1) interferometer have a more significant impact on the phase sensitivity compared to external photon losses. Moreover, increasing the number of photon subtractions m effectively enhances both the phase sensitivity and the quantum Fisher information. Notably, even under conditions of severe photon loss, the multiphoton subtraction operations can enable the phase sensitivity to surpass the standard quantum limit, approaching both the Heisenberg limit and the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound. This study provides a new theoretical basis for enhancing the phase sensitivity in the SU(1,1) interferometer.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian Approach for Two-Dimensional Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional spectroscopy (2DS) offers significant advantages in terms of high temporal and frequency resolutions and signal-to-noise ratio. Until now, the response-function (RF) formalism has been the prevalent theoretical description. In this study, we compare the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH) method with the RF formalism in a three-level system with a constant control field. We obtain the signals from both approaches and compare their population dynamics and 2DS. We propose the quasi-Green function for the NHH method, which allows all possible Liouville paths to be inferred. Although the NHH method overestimates relaxations, it also provides a more comprehensive description. Our results demonstrate that the NHH method is more suitable than the RF formalism for investigating the systems that are either dissipative or complex via the 2DS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optical networks are instrumental to address fundamental questions and enable applications ranging from communication to computation and, more recently, machine learning. In particular, photonic artificial neural networks offer the opportunity to exploit the advantages of both classical and quantum optics. Photonic neuro-inspired computation and machine learning have been successfully demonstrated in classical settings, while quantum optical networks have triggered breakthrough applications such as teleportation, quantum key distribution and quantum computing. We present a perspective on the state of the art in quantum optical machine learning and the potential advantages of artificial neural networks in circuit designs and beyond, in more general analogue settings characterised by recurrent and coherent complex interactions. We consider two analogue neuro-inspired applications, namely quantum reservoir computing and quantum associative memories, and discuss the enhanced capabilities offered by quantum substrates, highlighting the specific role of light squeezing in this context.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlations of the photon fields in a waveguide quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a time-dependent quantum calculations of the first order and second order photon correlation functions for the scattering of a single-photon pulse on a two-level atom (qubit) embedded in a one-dimensional open waveguide. Within Markov approximation we find the analytic expression for the quantum operator of positive frequency electric field. We restricted Hilbert space of initial states by the states with one and two excitations and show that the photon probability amplitudes are given by the off-diagonal matrix elements of the electric field operator between these states. For two-excitation initial state where the atom is excited and there exists a single photon in a waveguide we calculate the second order correlation function which describes the measurements by two detectors at two different space-time points. The second order correlation function exhibits the interference term showing that the measurements of two detectors are correlated. This interference is similar to that found in the Hanbury Brown and Twiss correlation experiment with two indistinguishable photons.</description>

      <title>Exponential Separations between Quantum Learning with and without Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum learning tasks, quantum memory can offer exponential reductions in statistical complexity compared to any single-copy strategies, but this typically necessitates at least doubling the system size. We show that such exponential reductions can also be achieved by having access to the purification of the target mixed state. Specifically, for a low-rank mixed state, only a constant number of ancilla qubits is needed for estimating properties related to its purity, cooled form, principal component and quantum Fisher information with constant sample complexity, which utilizes single-copy measurements on the purification. Without access to the purification, we prove that these tasks require exponentially many copies of the target mixed state for any strategies utilizing a bounded number of ancilla qubits, even with the knowledge of the target state's rank. Our findings also lead to practical applications in areas involving channel learning and quantum cryptography. With further discussions about the source and extent of the advantages brought by purification, our work uncovers a new resource with significant potential for quantum learning and other applications.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to celebrate Sir D. Payne's 80th birthday by dedicating our latest results as a continuation of his work in optical communications. One of the important issues in optical communications is to protect the transmission information data passing through optical fiber channels. Many ideas have been proposed and are being actively developed to implement in the physical layer of ultra-high-speed communications. As a representative example, a methodology that achieves this goal by fusing modulation techniques in ordinary optical communications and mathematical cipher is being actively studied. To further clarify this advantage, a theoretical concept has been proposed to solve the problem by adopting a PPM code format. However, this scheme has several difficulties at the implementation stage. Thus, this paper presents an optical scheme on modulation and receiver that eliminate those drawbacks.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Evolution Speed as Indicator of Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In studying the time evolution of isolated many-body quantum systems, a key focus is determining whether the system undergoes relaxation and reaches a steady state at a given point in time. Traditional approaches often rely on specific local operators or a detailed understanding of the stationary state. In this letter, we introduce an alternative method that assesses relaxation directly from the time-dependent state by focusing on the evolution speed of the subsystem. The proposed indicator evaluates the rate of change in the reduced density matrix of the subsystem over time. We demonstrate that in systems reaching relaxation, as the overall system size increases, the evolution speed of sufficiently small yet still finite-sized subsystems notably diminishes. This leads to small fluctuations in the expectation values of operators, which is also consistent with the predictions made by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. We apply this approach across various models, including the chaotic Ising chain, XXZ chains with and without many-body localization, and the transverse field Ising chain. Our results confirm the robustness and accuracy of subsystem evolution speed as a reliable indicator for relaxation.</description>

      <title>Fast classical simulation of qubit-qudit hybrid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating quantum circuits is a computationally intensive task that relies heavily on tensor products and matrix multiplications, which can be inefficient. Recent advancements, eliminate the need for tensor products and matrix multiplications, offering significant improvements in efficiency and parallelization. Extending these optimizations, we adopt a block-simulation methodology applicable to qubit-qudit hybrid systems. This method interprets the statevector as a collection of blocks and applies gates without computing the entire circuit unitary. Our method, a spiritual successor of the simulator QuDiet \cite{Chatterjee_2023}, utilizes this block-simulation method, thereby gaining major improvements over the simulation methods used by its predecessor. We exhibit that the proposed method is approximately 10$\times$ to 1000$\times$ faster than the state-of-the-art simulator for simulating multi-level quantum systems with various benchmark circuits.</description>

      <title>Controlling cooperative emission and superradiance in waveguide-coupled quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the measurement of collective emission from a pair of independently tuneable InAs quantum dots embedded in a nanophotonic waveguide. A split diode structure allows independent electrical control of the quantum dot transition energies over a wide range with minimal loss in waveguide coupling efficiency. We utilise this to systematically map out the transition from collective to independent emission. We perform both lifetime as well as Hanbury Brown-Twiss measurements on the device, observing anti-dips in the photon coincidences indicating collective emission while at the same time observing a drop in lifetime around zero detuning, indicating superradiant behaviour. Performing both measurement types allows us to investigate detuning regions which show both superradiant rate enhancement and inter-emitter coherence, as well as regions in which correlations persist in the absence of rate enhancement.</description>

      <title>Fully smooth one shot multipartite covering and decoupling of quantum states via telescoping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove fully smooth one shot multipartite covering, aka convex split, results as well as fully smooth multipartite decoupling results for quantum states. Fully smooth one shot results for these problems were not known earlier, though the works of Cheng, Gao and Berta (arXiv:2304.12056) for convex split, and Colomer and Winter (arXiv:2304.12114) for decoupling, had made substantial progress by introducing a technique called telescoping cum mean zero decomposition of quantum states. We show that the telescoping cum mean zero decomposition technique can in fact be simplified and further extended in order to prove fully smooth decoupling and convex split results. On the way, we obtain the first exponential concentration results for smooth multipartite soft covering in classical quantum states, leading to a powerful new matrix Chernoff bound that depends only on the smooth Renyi-2 divergence without any additional ambient Hilbert space dimension dependence.
  Our techniques allow us to prove the first fully smooth one shot inner bounds for various fundamental network quantum information theory problems like e.g. the generalised Slepian Wolf problem of (arXiv:1703.09961). We can also prove for the first time the natural polyhedral inner bound for sending quantum information over a quantum multiple access channel with limited entanglement assistance, first conjectured in (arXiv::2102.02187). We also prove a new one shot inner bound for sending private classical information over a point to point quantum wiretap channel with many non-interacting eavesdroppers, that is independent of the Hilbert space dimensions of the eavesdroppers. The last result was unknown earlier even in the classical setting.</description>

      <title>Fully smooth one shot multipartite soft covering of quantum states without pairwise independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a powerful machinery to prove fully smooth one shot multipartite covering, aka convex split, type results for quantum states. In the important case of smooth multipartite convex split for classical quantum states, aka smooth multipartite soft covering, our machinery works even when certain marginals of these states do not satisfy pairwise independence. The recent paper of Sen gave the first proof of fully smooth multipartite convex split by simplifying and extending a technique called telescoping, developed originally for convex split by (arXiv:2304.12056). However, that work as well as all earlier works on convex split assumed pairwise or even more independence amongst suitable marginals of the quantum states.
  We develop our machinery by leveraging known results from (arXiv:1806.07278) involving tilting and augmentation smoothing of quantum states, combined with a novel observation that a natural quantum operation `flattening' quantum states actually preserves the fidelity. This machinery is powerful enough to lead to non pairwise independent results as mentioned above.
  As an application of our soft covering lemma without pairwise independence, we prove the `natural' one shot inner bounds for sending private classical information over a quantum wiretap interference channel, even when the classical encoders at the input lose pairwise independence in their encoding strategies to a certain extent. This result was unknown earlier even in the classical setting.</description>

      <title>Geometric Antibunching and Directional Shaping of Photon Anticorrelations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the directional characteristics of photon statistics in dimers of quantum emitters. For their analysis, we construct a two-point second-order correlation function that allows us to find a new mechanism for photon anticorrelation, termed as geometric antibunching. This phenomenon is completely agnostic to the quantum state of the emitters and emerges from quantum interference effects due to the indistinguishability of different two-photon optical pathways. Finally, we explore its occurrence in emitters placed in the vicinity of a flat substrate and a nanosphere, demonstrating its tunnability through the different material and geometric parameters of these structures.</description>

      <title>Testing local realistic hidden-variable theories without inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many of the tests of local realistic hidden-variable theories against quantum mechanics are based on inequalities such as Bell's inequality and Clauser Horne, Shimony, and Holt's inequality. In this work we present a simple alternative test which does not involve inequalities, but direct comparison between correlation functions. The main advantage of this test is that it does not require measuring incompatible observables separately and simultaneously. This implies that our result, differently from traditional inequalities, does not involve counterfactual reasoning.</description>

      <title>Parallel quench and dynamic geometrical order parameter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical quantum phase transitions (DQPTs), while reflecting the characteristics of the dynamical evolution of nonequilibrium quantum systems, can also capture the geometric and topological effects of these system. For band systems, it has been found that the dynamic topological order parameter (DTOP) can describe the accompanying changes in the topological properties of the system when a DQPT occurs. In this paper, we demonstrate that for certain non-Bloch band models, a simpler quantity can also characterize the geometric changes accompanying DQPTs, provided the associated parallel-transport condition is satisfied. At zero temperature, this quantity is the Pancharatnam geometric phase, while at finite temperatures, it is generalized to the interferometric geometric phase. Notably, no dynamical phase is generated during this type of post-quench dynamical evolution. We illustrate these properties in detail through examples involving two-level systems and spin-$j$ systems. These findings provide new insights into understanding the geometric properties of quantum dynamical evolution.</description>

      <title>Learning the dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems from experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian algorithm to identify generators of open quantum system dynamics, described by a Lindblad master equation, that are compatible with measured experimental data. The algorithm, based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, assumes the energy levels of the system are known and outputs a ranked list of interpretable master equation models that produce predicted measurement traces that closely match experimental data. We benchmark our algorithm on quantum optics experiments performed on single and pairs of quantum emitters. The latter case opens the possibility of cooperative emission effects and additional complexity due to the possible interplay between photon and phonon influences on the dynamics. Our algorithm retrieves various minimal models that are consistent with the experimental data, and which can provide a closer fit to measured data than previously suggested and physically expected approximate models. Our results represent an important step towards automated systems characterisation with an approach that is capable of working with diverse and tomographically incomplete input data. This may help with the development of theoretical models for unknown quantum systems as well as providing scientists with alternative interpretations of the data that they might not have originally envisioned and enabling them to challenge their original hypotheses.</description>

Abstract: We present numerical simulation results for the 7-to-1 and 15-to-1 state distillation circuits, constructed using transversal CNOTs acting on multiple surface code patches. The distillation circuits are decoded iteratively using the method outlined in [arXiv:2407.20976]. We show that, with a re-configurable qubit architecture, we can perform fast, $\mathcal{O}(1)$ code cycles magic state distillation. We confirm the error suppression ability of both distillation circuits, from input error rate $p\rightarrow \mathcal{O}(p^{3})$ under circuit-level noise.</description>

      <title>Quantum optomechanical control of long-lived bulk acoustic phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity quantum optomechanical control of a mechanical oscillator requires the ability to perform efficient, low-noise operations on long-lived phononic excitations. Microfabricated high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonators ($\mathrm{\mu}$HBARs) have been shown to support high-frequency (&gt; 10 GHz) mechanical modes with exceptionally long coherence times (&gt; 1.5 ms), making them a compelling resource for quantum optomechanical experiments. In this paper, we demonstrate a new optomechanical system that permits quantum optomechanical control of individual high-coherence phonon modes supported by such $\mathrm{\mu}$HBARs for the first time. We use this system to perform laser cooling of such ultra-massive (7.5 $\mathrm{\mu}$g) high frequency (12.6 GHz) phonon modes from an occupation of ${\sim}$22 to fewer than 0.4 phonons, corresponding to laser-based ground-state cooling of the most massive mechanical object to date. Through these laser cooling experiments, no absorption-induced heating is observed, demonstrating the resilience of the $\mathrm{\mu}$HBAR against parasitic heating. The unique features of such $\mathrm{\mu}$HBARs make them promising as the basis for a new class of quantum optomechanical systems that offer enhanced robustness to decoherence, necessary for efficient, low-noise photon-phonon conversion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of a minimum measurable length scale was suggested by various theories of quantum gravity, string theory and black hole physics. Motivated by this we examine a quantum theory exhibiting a minimum measurable time scale. We use the Page-Wootters formalism to describe time evolution of a quantum system with the modified commutation relations between the time and frequency operator. Such modification leads to a minimal uncertainty in the measurement of time. This causes breaking of the time-translation symmetry and results in a modified version of the Schrodinger equation. A minimal time scale allows also to introduce a discrete Schrodinger equation describing time evolution on a lattice. We show that both descriptions of time evolution are equivalent. We demonstrate the developed theory on couple simple quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing nanoparticles in the intensity minimum: feedback levitation on an inverted potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the stable trapping of a levitated nanoparticle on top of an inverted potential using a combination of optical readout and electrostatic control. The feedback levitation on an inverted potential (FLIP) method stabilizes the particle at an intensity minimum. By using a Kalman-filter-based linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control method, we confine a particle to within $\sigma_x = (9.0 \pm 0.5) nm$ of the potential maximum at an effective temperature of $(16 \pm 1) K$ in a room-temperature environment. Despite drifts in the absolute position of the potential maximum, we can keep the nanoparticle at the apex by estimating the drift from the particle dynamics using the Kalman filter. Our approach may enable new levitation-based sensing schemes with enhanced bandwidth. It also paves the way for optical levitation at zero intensity of an optical potential, which alleviates decoherence effects due to material-dependent absorption and is hence relevant for macroscopic quantum experiments.</description>

      <title>The Role of Community Building and Education as Key Pillar of Institutionalizing Responsible Quantum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is an emerging technology whose positive and negative impacts on society are not yet fully known. As government, individuals, institutions, and corporations fund and develop this technology, they must ensure that they anticipate its impacts, prepare for its consequences, and steer its development in such a way that it enables the most good and prevents the most harm. However, individual stakeholders are not equipped to fully anticipate these consequences on their own it requires a diverse community that is well-informed about quantum computing and its impacts. Collaborations and community-building across domains incorporating a variety of viewpoints, especially those from stakeholders most likely to be harmed, are fundamental pillars of developing and deploying quantum computing responsibly. This paper reviews responsible quantum computing proposals and literature, highlights the challenges in implementing these, and presents strategies developed at IBM aimed at building a diverse community of users and stakeholders to support the responsible development of this technology.</description>

Abstract: A recently introduced recurrence-relation ansatz applied to the Bose-Hubbard model is here used in the Fermi-Hubbard model. The resulting modified Fermi-Hubbard model is soluble and exhibits a continuous phase transition (second order) reminiscent of the integer quantum Hall resistance and a ground-state, first-order phase transition.</description>

      <title>Topological excitations at time vortices in periodically driven systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two-dimensional periodically driven systems of fermions with particle-hole symmetry. Such systems support non-trivial topological phases, including ones that cannot be realized in equilibrium. We show that a space-time defect in the driving Hamiltonian, dubbed a ``time vortex,'' can bind $\pi$ Majorana modes. A time vortex is a point in space around which the phase lag of the Hamiltonian changes by a multiple of $2\pi$. We demonstrate this behavior on a periodically driven version of Kitaev's honeycomb spin model, where $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fluxes and time vortices can realize any combination of $0$ and $\pi$ Majorana modes. We show that a time vortex can be created using Clifford gates, simplifying its realization in near-term quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Duality defect in a deformed transverse-field Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physical quantities with long lifetimes have both theoretical significance in the study of quantum many-body systems and practical implications for quantum technologies. In this manuscript, we investigate the roles played by topological defects in the construction of quasi-conserved quantities, using as a prototypical example the Kramers-Wannier duality defect in a deformed 1d quantum transverse field Ising model. We construct the duality defect Hamiltonian in three different ways: half-chain Kramers-Wannier transformation, utilization of techniques in the Ising fusion category, and defect-modified weak integrability breaking deformation. The third method is also applicable for the study of generic integrable defects under weak integrability breaking deformations. We also work out the deformation of defect-modified higher charges in the model and study their slower decay behavior. Furthermore, we consider the corresponding duality defect twisted deformed Floquet transverse field Ising model, and investigate the stability of the isolated zero mode associated with the duality defect in the integrable Floquet Ising model, under such weak integrability breaking deformation.</description>

Abstract: Persistent currents flowing in spatially closed tracks define one of the most iconic concepts in mesoscopic physics. They have been studied in solid-state platforms such as superfluids, superconductors and metals. Cold atoms trapped in magneto-optical toroidal circuits and driven by suitable artificial gauge fields allow us to study persistent currents with unprecedented control and flexibility of the system's physical conditions. Here, we review persistent currents of ultracold matter. Capitalizing on the remarkable progress in driving different atomic species to quantum degeneracy, persistent currents of single or multicomponent bosons/fermions, and their mixtures can be addressed within the present experimental know-how. This way, fundamental concepts of quantum science and many-body physics, like macroscopic quantum coherence, solitons, vortex dynamics, fermionic pairing and BEC-BCS crossover can be studied from a novel perspective. Finally, we discuss how persistent currents can form the basis of new technological applications like matter-wave gyroscopes and interferometers.</description>

      <title>Linking Edge Modes and Geometrical Clocks in Linearized Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reference frames are crucial for describing local observers in general relativity. In quantum gravity, different proposals exist for how to treat reference frames. There are models with either classical or quantum reference frames. Recently, different choices appeared for investigating these possibilities at the level of the classical and quantum algebra of observables. One choice is based on the covariant phase space approach, using gravitational edge modes. In the canonical approach, there is another choice, relational clocks, built from matter or geometry itself. In this work, we extend existing results and show how to relate edge modes and geometrical clocks in linearized gravity. We proceed in three steps. First, we introduce an extension of the ADM (Arnowitt-Deser-Misner) phase space to account for covariant gauge fixing conditions and the explicit time dependence they add to Hamilton's equations. Second, we show how these gauge fixing conditions recover a specific choice of geometrical clocks in terms of Ashtekar-Barbero connection variables. Third, we study the effect of the Barbero-Immirzi parameter on the generators of asymptotic symmetries and the corresponding charges. This parameter, which disappears from metric gravity, affects the generators for angle-dependent asymptotic symmetries and the corresponding super-translation charges, while it has no effect on the global charges.</description>

Abstract: We apply a variational Ansatz based on neural networks to the problem of spin-$1/2$ fermions in a harmonic trap interacting through a short distance potential. We showed that standard machine learning techniques lead to a quick convergence to the ground state, especially in weakly coupled cases. Higher couplings can be handled efficiently by increasing the strength of interactions during "training".</description>

      <title>Deterministic formation of carbon-functionalized quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forming single-photon emitters (SPEs) in insulating hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has sparked wide interests in the quantum photonics. Despite significant progress, it remains challenging to deterministically create SPEs at precise locations with a specific type of element for creating defects. In this study, we present a straightforward approach to generate site-deterministic carbon-functionalized quantum emitters in hBN by harnessing ultrasonic nanoindentation. The obtained SPEs are high-quality and can be scaled up to large arrays in a single fabrication step. Comprehensive experimental analyses reveal that the insertion of carbon atoms into the hBN lattice is the source of the robust quantum emission. Complementary theoretical studies suggest possible candidates for the structural origin of the defects based on our experimental results. This rapid and scalable nanoindentation method provides a new way to create SPE arrays with specific types of atoms, enabling the comprehensive investigation of the origins and mechanics of SPE formations in two-dimensional (2D) materials and beyond.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Tuning of Single-Photon Emission in Monolayer WSe2 via Localized Strain Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation integrated single-photon emitters (SPEs). However, significant variability in the emission energies of 2D SPEs presents a major challenge in producing identical single photons from different SPEs, which may become crucial for various quantum applications including quantum information processing. Although various approaches to dynamically tuning the emission energies of 2D SPEs have been developed to address the issue, the practical solution to matching multiple individual SPEs in a single 2D flake is still scarce. In this work, we demonstrate a precise emission energy tuning of individual SPEs in a WSe2 monolayer. Our approach utilizes localized strain fields near individual SPEs, which we control independently by adjusting the physical volume of an SU-8-based stressor layer via focused laser annealing. This technique allows continuous emission energy tuning of up to 15 meV while maintaining the qualities of SPEs. Additionally, we showcase the precise spectral alignment of three distinct SPEs in a single WSe2 monolayer to the same wavelength. The tunability of 2D SPEs represents a solid step towards the on-chip integrated photonics with 2D materials for quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent appearance of the trillium lattice in the search for materials hosting spin liquids, we study the ground state of the classical Heisenberg model on its linegraph, the trilline lattice. We find that this network realises the recently proposed notion of a fragile spin liquid in three dimensions. Additionally, we analyze the Ising case and argue for a possible $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid phase in the corresponding quantum dimer model. Like the well-known $U(1)$ spin liquids, the classical phase hosts moment fractionalisation evidenced in the diluted lattice, but unlike these, it exhibits exponential decay both in spin correlations and interactions between fractionalised moments. This provides the first instance of a purely short-range correlated classical Heisenberg spin liquid in three dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce QICS (Quantum Information Conic Solver), an open-source primal-dual interior point solver fully implemented in Python, which is focused on solving optimization problems arising in quantum information theory. QICS has the ability to solve optimization problems involving the quantum relative entropy, noncommutative perspectives of operator convex functions, and related functions. It also includes an efficient semidefinite programming solver which exploits sparsity, as well as support for Hermitian matrices. QICS is also currently supported by the Python optimization modelling software PICOS. This paper aims to document the implementation details of the algorithm and cone oracles used in QICS, and serve as a reference guide for the software. Additionally, we showcase extensive numerical experiments which demonstrate that QICS outperforms state-of-the-art quantum relative entropy programming solvers, and has comparable performance to state-of-the-art semidefinite programming solvers.</description>

Abstract: The ability for optically active media to rotate the polarization of light is the basis of polarimetry, an illustrious technique responsible for many breakthroughs in fields as varied as astronomy, medicine and material science. Here, we recast the primary mechanism for spin readout in semiconductor-based quantum computers, Pauli spin-blockade (PSB), as the natural extension of polarimetry to the third dimension. We perform polarimetry with spins through a silicon quantum dot exchanging a hole with a boron acceptor, demonstrating the role of spin-orbit coupling in creating spin misalignment. Perfect spin alignment may be recovered by means of rotating the applied magnetic-field orientation. This work shows how spin misalignment sets a fundamental upper limit for the spin readout fidelity in quantum-computing systems based on PSB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For particles decaying without parity violation, it is impossible to reconstruct the full spin-density matrix from the velocities of their decay products. In this work, we consider Bell inequalities based on squares of spin operators. The corresponding Bell operators probe only the part of the density matrix that can be reconstructed from any gauge boson decay or splitting to fermions, which is accessible regardless of whether parity is violated. We find that our new choice of Bell operator has promising properties regarding states seen at colliders. In particular, it substantially outperforms the inequality previously used for the $pp \rightarrow ZZ$ process at the LHC in terms of the phase space volume in which it is violated. We also conduct the first investigation of Bell violation in a system involving gauge bosons mediating different interactions, namely the $W$ boson and gluon in the $pp \rightarrow W^{\pm} (g\rightarrow b\bar{b})$ process.</description>

Abstract: Determining whether a noisy quantum channel can be used to reliably transmit quantum information at a non-zero rate is a challenging problem in quantum information theory. This is because it requires computation of the channel's coherent information for an unbounded number of copies of the channel. In this paper, we devise an elementary perturbative technique to solve this problem in a wide variety of circumstances. Our analysis reveals that a channel's ability to transmit information is intimately connected to the relative sizes of its input, output, and environment spaces. We exploit this link to develop easy tests which can be used to detect positivity of quantum channel capacities simply by comparing the channels' input, output, and environment dimensions. Several noteworthy examples, such as the depolarizing and transpose-depolarizing channels (including the Werner-Holevo channel), dephasing channels, generalized Pauli channels, multi-level amplitude damping channels, and (conjugate) diagonal unitary covariant channels, serve to aptly exhibit the utility of our method. Notably, in all these examples, the coherent information of a single copy of the channel turns out to be positive.</description>

Abstract: Assume that Alice, Bob, and Charlie share a tripartite pure state $|\psi_{ABC}\rangle$. We prove that if Alice cannot distill entanglement with either Bob or Charlie using $|\psi_{ABC}\rangle$ and local operations with any one of the following configurations for classical communication: $(A\to B, A\leftrightarrow C), (A\leftrightarrow B, A\to C),$ and $(A\leftrightarrow B, A\leftrightarrow C)$, then the same is also true for the other two configurations. Moreover, this happens precisely when the state is such that both its reductions on systems $AB$ and $AC$ are separable, which is further equivalent to the reductions being PPT. This, in particular, implies that any NPT bipartite state is such that either the state itself or its complement is 2-way distillable. To prove these results, we first obtain an explicit lower bound on the 2-way distillable entanglement of low rank bipartite states. Furthermore, we show that even though not all low rank states are 1-way distillable, a randomly sampled low rank state will almost surely be 1-way distillable.</description>

Abstract: Optical lattices serve as fundamental building blocks for atomic quantum technology. However, the scale and resolution of these lattices are diffraction-limited to the light wavelength. In conventional lattices, achieving tight confinement of single sites requires high laser intensity, which unfortunately leads to reduced coherence due to increased scattering. This article presents a novel approach for creating an atomic optical lattice with a sub-wavelength spatial structure. The potential is generated by leveraging the nonlinear optical response of three-level Rydberg-dressed atoms, which allows us to overcome the diffraction limit of the driving fields. The resulting lattice comprises a three-dimensional array of ultra-narrow Lorentzian wells over nanometer scales. These unprecedented scales can now be accessed through a hybrid scheme that combines the dipolar interaction and optical twist of atomic eigenstates. The interaction-induced two-body resonance that forms the trapping potential, only occurs at a peculiar laser intensity, localizing the trap sites to ultra-narrow regions over the standing-wave driving field. The feasibility study shows that single-atom confinement in Lorentzian sites with 3nm width, and 37MHz depth are realizable with available lasers. The development of these ultra-narrow trapping techniques holds great promise for applications such as Rydberg-Fermi gates, atomtronics, quantum walks, Hubbard models, and neutral-atom quantum simulation.</description>

If the activation functions are also ridge functions, these networks are called explainable neural networks.
  In this brief paper, we first show that quantum neural networks which are based on variational quantum circuits can be written as a linear combination of ridge functions by following matrix notations. Consequently, we show that the interpretability and explainability of such quantum neural networks can be directly considered and studied as an approximation with the linear combination of ridge functions.</description>

Abstract: Accurately predicting a quantum computer's capability -- which circuits it can run and how well it can run them -- is a foundational goal of quantum characterization and benchmarking. As modern quantum computers become increasingly hard to simulate, we must develop accurate and scalable predictive capability models to help researchers and stakeholders decide which quantum computers to build and use. In this work, we propose a hardware-agnostic method to efficiently construct scalable predictive models of a quantum computer's capability for almost any class of circuits, and demonstrate our method using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Our CNN-based approach works by efficiently representing a circuit as a three-dimensional tensor and then using a CNN to predict its success rate. Our CNN capability models obtain approximately a $1\%$ average absolute prediction error when modeling processors experiencing both Markovian and non-Markovian stochastic Pauli errors. We also apply our CNNs to model the capabilities of cloud-access quantum computing systems, obtaining moderate prediction accuracy (average absolute error around $2-5\%$), and we highlight the challenges to building better neural network capability models.</description>

      <title>Efficient cavity-assisted storage of photonic qubits in a solid-state quantum memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the high-efficiency storage and retrieval of weak coherent optical pulses and photonic qubits in a cavity-enhanced solid-state quantum memory. By using an atomic frequency comb (AFC) memory in a $Pr^{3+}:Y_2 SO_5$ crystal embedded in a low-finesse impedance-matched cavity, we stored weak coherent pulses at the single photon level with up to 62% efficiency for a pre-determined storage time of 2 $\mu$s. We also confirmed that the impedance-matched cavity enhances the efficiency for longer storage times up to 70 $\mu$s. Taking advantage of the temporal multimodality of the AFC scheme, we then store weak coherent time-bin qubits with (51+-2)% efficiency and a measurement-device limited fidelity over (94.8+-1.4)% for the retrieved qubits. These results represent the most efficient storage in a single photon level AFC memory and the most efficient qubit storage in a solid-state quantum memory up-to-date.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivariable Quantum Signal Processing (M-QSP) [1] is expected to provide an efficient means to handle polynomial transformations of multiple variables simultaneously. However, we noticed several inconsistencies in the main Theorem 2.3 and its proof in Ref. [1]. Moreover, a counterexample for Conjecture 2.1 in Ref. [1], which is used as an assumption in the proof of Theorem 2.3, is presented at Quantum Information Processing 2023 [2], meaning the requirement of the conjecture should be included as a condition in Theorem 2.3. Here we note our observations and propose the revised necessary conditions of M-QSP. We also show that these necessary conditions cannot be sufficient conditions, and thus some additional condition on top of these revisions is essentially required for complete M-QSP Theorem.</description>

      <title>Counterdiabatic Driving for Periodically Driven Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02728v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems have emerged as a useful technique to engineer the properties of quantum systems, and are in the process of being developed into a standard toolbox for quantum simulation. An outstanding challenge that leaves this toolbox incomplete is the manipulation of the states dressed by strong periodic drives. The state-of-the-art in Floquet control is the adiabatic change of parameters. Yet, this requires long protocols conflicting with the limited coherence times in experiments. To achieve fast control of nonequilibrium quantum matter, we generalize the notion of variational counterdiabatic driving away from equilibrium focusing on Floquet systems. We derive a nonperturbative variational principle to find local approximations to the adiabatic gauge potential for the effective Floquet Hamiltonian. It enables transitionless driving of Floquet eigenstates far away from the adiabatic regime. We discuss applications to two-level, Floquet band, and interacting periodically driven models. The developed technique allows us to capture nonperturbative photon resonances and obtain high-fidelity protocols that respect experimental limitations like the locality of the accessible control terms.</description>

Abstract: High control in the preparation and manipulation of states is an experimental and theoretical important task in many quantum protocols. Shortcuts to adiabaticity methods allow to obtain desirable states of a adiabatic dynamics but in short time scales. In this work, the problem of considering this technique for two-coupled bosonic modes is addressed. By using symplectic transformations it is possible to decouple the modes and find the driving Hamiltonian that drives the system through a transitionless dynamics in a finite-time regime. Two paradigmatic interactions are discussed, the position-position and the magnetic field couplings. We also illustrate the finding in a concrete example where the nonadiabaticity degree is quantified in terms of the residual energy. Finally, it is shown that the driving Hamiltonian for each case contains local and global contributions, accounting for coherence in the energy basis and entanglement effects, respectively.</description>

      <title>Non-Clifford and parallelizable fault-tolerant logical gates on constant and almost-constant rate homological quantum LDPC codes via higher symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study parallel fault-tolerant quantum computing for families of homological quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes defined on 3-manifolds with constant or almost-constant encoding rate. We derive generic formula for a transversal $T$ gate of color codes on general 3-manifolds, which acts as collective non-Clifford logical CCZ gates on any triplet of logical qubits with their logical-$X$ membranes having a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ triple intersection at a single point. The triple intersection number is a topological invariant, which also arises in the path integral of the emergent higher symmetry operator in a topological quantum field theory: the $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory. Moreover, the transversal $S$ gate of the color code corresponds to a higher-form symmetry supported on a codimension-1 submanifold, giving rise to exponentially many addressable and parallelizable logical CZ gates. We have developed a generic formalism to compute the triple intersection invariants for 3-manifolds and also study the scaling of the Betti number and systoles with volume for various 3-manifolds, which translates to the encoding rate and distance. We further develop three types of LDPC codes supporting such logical gates: (1) A quasi-hyperbolic code from the product of 2D hyperbolic surface and a circle, with almost-constant rate $k/n=O(1/\log(n))$ and $O(\log(n))$ distance; (2) A homological fibre bundle code with $O(1/\log^{\frac{1}{2}}(n))$ rate and $O(\log^{\frac{1}{2}}(n))$ distance; (3) A specific family of 3D hyperbolic codes: the Torelli mapping torus code, constructed from mapping tori of a pseudo-Anosov element in the Torelli subgroup, which has constant rate while the distance scaling is currently unknown. We then show a generic constant-overhead scheme for applying a parallelizable universal gate set with the aid of logical-$X$ measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a protocol to realize quantum simulation and computation in spin systems with long-range interactions. Our approach relies on the local addressing of single spins with external fields parametrized by Walsh functions. This enables a mapping from a class of target Hamiltonians, defined by the graph structure of their interactions, to pulse sequences. We then obtain a recipe to implement arbitrary two-body Hamiltonians and universal quantum circuits. Performance guarantees are provided in terms of bounds on Trotter errors and total number of pulses. Additionally, Walsh pulse sequences are shown to be robust against various types of pulse errors, in contrast to previous hybrid digital-analog schemes of quantum computation. We demonstrate and numerically benchmark our protocol with examples from the dynamics of spin models, quantum error correction and quantum optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics on a background modulo observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12493v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we will answer the following question: What remains of Quantum Mechanics when we transform the background space-time into a space modularized by observation or measurement regions ? This new moduli space is constructed by identifying regions of space-time where quantum phase comparison (observation, measurement) is implied. We call it Observation Modular space (OM-space). In addition we replace in QM statements the Plank constant (h) by the quantity $\zeta_0 4 \pi^2$ (where $\zeta_0$ is the Plank Length) or otherwise, replacing $P_0$ (the Planck Momentum) by $4 \pi^2$. This maps Quantum Mechanics into a very rich dual Number Theory which we call Observation Modular Quantum Mechanics (OM-QM). We find the OM-dual to the Dirac Equation, the quantum Wave Function and a free particle's mass. The OM-QM counterparts of the Energy turns out to be a simple function of the zeroes of the Riemann zeta function. We also find the OM-QM correspondents to the electron spin, the electron charge, the Electric Field and the Fine Structure Constant. We also find the OM-QM correspondents of the Heisemberg uncertainty relation and Einstein's General Relativity Field equation emerging as certain limits of a unique OM-QM equation. We also get the OM-QM correspondents of the Gravitational Constant and the Cosmological Constant. We find the analog of holography in the OM-QM side and we get an interpretation of spin as a high dimensional curvature. An interpretation of the OM-QM correspondence is proposed as giving the part of QM information which is not measurement or observation dependent. Some potential future applications of this correspondence are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Practical applications of quantum computing depend on fault-tolerant devices with error correction. Today, the most promising approach is a class of error-correcting codes called surface codes. We study the problem of compiling quantum circuits for quantum computers implementing surface codes. Optimal or near-optimal compilation is critical for both efficiency and correctness. The compilation problem requires (1) mapping circuit qubits to the device qubits and (2) routing execution paths between interacting qubits. We solve this problem efficiently and near-optimally with a novel algorithm that exploits the dependency structure of circuit operations to formulate discrete optimization problems that can be approximated via simulated annealing, a classic and simple algorithm. Our extensive evaluation shows that our approach is powerful and flexible for compiling realistic workloads.</description>

      <title>Capturing long-range memory structures with tree-geometry process tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of quantum non-Markovian processes -- dubbed process trees -- that exhibit polynomially decaying temporal correlations and memory distributed across time scales. This class of processes is described by a tensor network with tree-like geometry whose component tensors are (1) causality-preserving maps (superprocesses) and (2) locality-preserving temporal change of scale transformations. We show that the long-range correlations in this class of processes tends to originate almost entirely from memory effects, and can accommodate genuinely quantum power-law correlations in time. Importantly, this class allows efficient computation of multi-time correlation functions. To showcase the potential utility of this model-agnostic class for numerical simulation of physical models, we show how it can efficiently approximate the strong memory dynamics of the paradigmatic spin-boson model, in terms of arbitrary multitime features. In contrast to an equivalently costly matrix product operator (MPO) representation, the ansatz produces a fiducial characterization of the relevant physics. Finally, leveraging 2D tensor network renormalization group methods, we detail an algorithm for deriving a process tree from an underlying Hamiltonian, via the Feynmann-Vernon influence functional. Our work lays the foundation for the development of more efficient numerical techniques in the field of strongly interacting open quantum systems, as well as the theoretical development of a temporal renormalization group scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14901v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been shown that the entanglement between the system state and the ancillary state is not a strict requirement for performing ancilla-assisted process tomography(AAPT). Instead, it only requires that the system-ancilla state be faithful, which, in practice, is the invertibility of a certain matrix representing the state. Our paper takes on the operational definition of faithfulness, i.e., a state is faithful if one can extract complete information about the quantum process, and we restrict the process to single-qubit operations on a two-qubit system-ancilla state. We present a theoretical analysis to connect the invertibility problem to the concept of Sinisterness, which quantifies the correlation of two qubits. Using Sinisterness, we derive a way of constructing two-qubit states that are guaranteed to be faithful in an operational sense and estimate the bound on the average error of the process. Our analysis agrees that the maximally entangled states provided the smallest error amplification. Nevertheless, it maps out a numerical region where the advantage of the entanglement starts.</description>

Abstract: Embezzlement of entanglement refers to the counterintuitive possibility of extracting entangled quantum states from a reference state of an auxiliary system (the "embezzler") via local quantum operations while hardly perturbing the latter. We uncover a deep connection between the operational task of embezzling entanglement and the mathematical classification of von Neumann algebras. Our result implies that relativistic quantum fields are universal embezzlers: Any entangled state of any dimension can be embezzled from them with arbitrary precision. This provides an operational characterization of the infinite amount of entanglement present in the vacuum state of relativistic quantum field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entangled light sources for illuminating objects offer advantages over conventional illumination methods by enhancing the detection sensitivity of reflecting objects. The core of the quantum advantage lies in effectively exploiting quantum correlations to isolate noise and detect objects with low reflectivity. This work experimentally demonstrates the benefits of using polarization-entangled photon pairs for quantum illumination and shows that the quantum correlation measure, using CHSH value and normalized CHSH value, is robust against losses, noise, and depolarization. We report the detection of objects with reflectivity ($\eta$) as low as 0.05 and an object submerged in noise with a signal-to-noise ratio of 0.003 using quantum correlation and residual quantum correlation measures, surpassing previous results. Additionally, we demonstrate that the normalized CHSH value aids in estimating the reflectivity of the detected object. Furthermore, we analyze the robustness of the correlation measure under photon attenuation in atmospheric conditions to show the practical feasibility of real-time applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised representation learning presents new opportunities for advancing Quantum Architecture Search (QAS) on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. QAS is designed to optimize quantum circuits for Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs). Most QAS algorithms tightly couple the search space and search algorithm, typically requiring the evaluation of numerous quantum circuits, resulting in high computational costs and limiting scalability to larger quantum circuits. Predictor-based QAS algorithms mitigate this issue by estimating circuit performance based on structure or embedding. However, these methods often demand time-intensive labeling to optimize gate parameters across many circuits, which is crucial for training accurate predictors. Inspired by the classical neural architecture search algorithm Arch2vec, we investigate the potential of unsupervised representation learning for QAS without relying on predictors. Our framework decouples unsupervised architecture representation learning from the search process, enabling the learned representations to be applied across various downstream tasks. Additionally, it integrates an improved quantum circuit graph encoding scheme, addressing the limitations of existing representations and enhancing search efficiency. This predictor-free approach removes the need for large labeled datasets. During the search, we employ REINFORCE and Bayesian Optimization to explore the latent representation space and compare their performance against baseline methods. Our results demonstrate that the framework efficiently identifies high-performing quantum circuits with fewer search iterations.</description>

Abstract: The quantum mechanics formalism introduced new revolutionary concepts challenging our everyday perceptions. Arguably, quantum entanglement, which explains correlations that cannot be reproduced classically, is the most notable of them. Besides its fundamental aspect, entanglement is also a resource, fueling emergent technologies such as quantum simulators and computers. The purpose of this chapter is to give a pedagogical introduction to the topic with a special emphasis on the multipartite scenario, i.e., entanglement distributed among many degrees of freedom. Due to the combinatorial complexity of this setting, particles can interact and become entangled in a plethora of ways, which we characterize here. We start by providing the necessary mathematical tools and elementary concepts from entanglement theory. A part of this chapter will be devoted to classifying and ordering entangled states. Then, we focus on various entanglement structures useful in condensed-matter theory such as tensor-network states or symmetric states useful for quantum-enhanced sensing. Finally, we discuss state-of-the-art methods to detect and certify such correlations in experiments, with some relevant illustrative examples.</description>

Abstract: Driven by the significant advantages offered by quantum computing, research in quantum machine learning has increased in recent years. While quantum speed-up has been demonstrated in some applications of quantum machine learning, a comprehensive understanding of its underlying mechanisms for improved performance remains elusive. Our study address this problem by investigating the functional expressibility of quantum circuits integrated within a convolutional neural network (CNN). Through numerical experiments on the MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and Letter datasets, our hybrid quantum-classical CNN model demonstrates superior feature selection capabilities and substantially reduces the required training steps compared to classical CNNs. Notably, we observe similar performance improvements when incorporating three other quantum-inspired activation functions in classical neural networks, indicating the benefits of adopting quantum-inspired activation functions. Additionally, we developed a hybrid quantum Chebyshev-polynomial network (QCPN) based on the properties of quantum activation functions. We demonstrate that a three-layer QCPN can approximate any continuous function, a feat not achievable by a standard three-layer classical neural network. Our findings suggest that quantum-inspired activation functions can reduce model depth while maintaining high learning capability, making them a promising approach for optimizing large-scale machine-learning models. We also outline future research directions for leveraging quantum advantages in machine learning, aiming to unlock further potential in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>TANQ-Sim: Tensorcore Accelerated Noisy Quantum System Simulation via QIR on Perlmutter HPC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although there have been remarkable advances in quantum computing (QC), it remains crucial to simulate quantum programs using classical large-scale parallel computing systems to validate quantum algorithms, comprehend the impact of noise, and develop resilient quantum applications. This is particularly important for bridging the gap between near-term noisy-intermediate-scale-quantum (NISQ) computing and future fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). Nevertheless, current simulation methods either lack the capability to simulate noise, or simulate with excessive computational costs, or do not scale out effectively.
  In this paper, we propose TANQ-Sim, a full-scale density matrix based simulator designed to simulate practical deep circuits with both coherent and non-coherent noise. To address the significant computational cost associated with such simulations, we propose a new density-matrix simulation approach that enables TANQ-Sim to leverage the latest double-precision tensorcores (DPTCs) in NVIDIA Ampere and Hopper GPUs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of double-precision tensorcores for non-AI/ML workloads. To optimize performance, we also propose specific gate fusion techniques for density matrix simulation. For scaling, we rely on the advanced GPU-side communication library NVSHMEM and propose effective optimization methods for enhancing communication efficiency. Evaluations on the NERSC Perlmutter supercomputer demonstrate the functionality, performance, and scalability of the simulator. We also present three case studies to showcase the practical usage of TANQ-Sim, including teleportation, entanglement distillation, and Ising simulation. TANQ-Sim will be released on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Coalescing hardcore-boson condensate states with nonzero momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs), as an exclusive feature of a non-Hermitian system, support coalescing states to be alternative stable state beyond the ground state. In this work, we explore the influence of non-Hermitian impurities on the dynamic formation of condensate states in one-, two-, and three-dimensional extended Bose-Hubbard systems with strong on-site interaction. Based on the solution for the hardcore limit, we show exactly that condensate modes with off-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) can exist when certain system parameters satisfy specific matching conditions. Under open boundary conditions, the condensate states become coalescing states when the non-Hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric boundary gives rise to the EPs. The fundamental mechanism behind this phenomenon is uncovered through analyzing the scattering dynamics of many-particle wavepackets at the non-Hermitian boundaries. The EP dynamics facilitate the dynamic generation of condensate states with non-zero momentum. To further substantiate the theoretical findings, numerical simulations are conducted. This study not only unveils the potential condensation of interacting bosons but also offers an approach for the engineering of condensate states.</description>

Abstract: The interrelation between the concepts of self-consistency, relativism and many-particle systems is considered within the framework of a unified consideration of classical and quantum physics based on the first principle of the probability conservation law. The probability conservation law underlies the Vlasov equation chain. From the first Vlasov equation, the Schr\"odinger equation, the Hamilton-Jacobi equation, the equation of motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field, the Maxwell equations, the Pauli equation and the Dirac equation are constructed. The paper shows with mathematical rigor that quantum systems with a time independent function of quasi-density probability in phase space are not capable to emit electromagnetic radiation. It is shown that at the micro-level a quantum object may be considered rather as an {\guillemotleft}extended{\guillemotright} object than a point one. And the hydrodynamic description of continuum mechanics is applicable for such an object. A number of exact solutions of quantum and classical model systems is considered, demonstrating a new insight at the quantum mechanics representation.</description>

Abstract: The principle of maximum entropy is used to study the geometric properties of an ensemble of finite dimensional Hamiltonian systems with known average energy. These geometric characterization is given in terms of the generalized diagonal Bloch vectors and the invariants of the special unitary group in $n$ dimensions. As examples, Hamiltonians written in terms of linear and quadratic generators of the angular momentum algebra are considered with $J= 1$ and $J=3/2$. For these cases, paths as functions of the temperature are established in the corresponding simplex representations, as well as the adiabatic evolution of the interaction strengths of the Hamiltonian models. For the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick Hamiltonian the quantum phase diagram is explicitly shown for different temperature values in parameter space.</description>

      <title>Correlations and signaling in the Schr\"{o}dinger-Newton model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger--Newton model is a semi-classical theory in which, in addition to mutual attraction, massive quantum particles interact with their own gravitational fields. While there are many studies on the phenomenology of single particles, correlation dynamics in multipartite systems is largely unexplored. Here, we show that the Schr\"odinger--Newton interactions preserve the product form of the initial state of a many-body system, yet on average agreeing with classical mechanics of continuous mass distributions. This leads to a simple test of the model, based on verifying bipartite gravitational evolution towards non-product states. We show using standard quantum mechanics that, with currently accessible single-particle parameters, two masses released from harmonic traps get correlated well before any observable entanglement is accumulated. Therefore, the Schr\"odinger--Newton model can be tested with setups aimed at observation of gravitational entanglement with significantly relaxed requirements on coherence time. We also present a mixed-state extension of the model that avoids superluminal signaling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One significant advantage of superconducting processors is their extensive design flexibility, which encompasses various types of qubits and interactions. Given the large number of tunable parameters of a processor, the ability to perform gradient optimization would be highly beneficial. Efficient backpropagation for gradient computation requires a tightly integrated software library, for which no open-source implementation is currently available. In this work, we introduce SuperGrad, a simulator that accelerates the design of superconducting quantum processors by incorporating gradient computation capabilities. SuperGrad offers a user-friendly interface for constructing Hamiltonians and computing both static and dynamic properties of composite systems. This differentiable simulation is valuable for a range of applications, including optimal control, design optimization, and experimental data fitting. In this paper, we demonstrate these applications through examples and code snippets.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we investigate the decoherence of a spatially superposed electrically neutral spin-$\frac12$ particle in the presence of a relativistic quantum electromagnetic field in Minkowski spacetime. We demonstrate that decoherence due to the spin-magnetic field coupling can be categorized into two distinct factors: local decoherence, originating from the two-point correlation functions along each branch of the superposed trajectories, and nonlocal decoherence, which arises from the correlation functions between the two superposed trajectories. These effects are linked to phase damping and amplitude damping. We also show that if the quantum field is prepared in a thermal state, decoherence monotonically increases with the field temperature.</description>

Abstract: Broadband impedance-matched Josephson parametric amplifiers are key components for high-fidelity single-shot multi-qubit readout. Nowadays, several types of impedance matched parametric amplifiers have been proposed: the first is an impedance-matched parametric amplifier based on a Klopfenstein taper, and the second is an impedance-matched parametric amplifier based on auxiliary resonators. Here, we present the quantum-limited 3-wave-mixing lumped-element SNAIL parametric amplifier with two-units impedance matching transformer. A two-pole Chebyshev matching network with shunted resonators based on parallel-plate capacitors and superconducting planar coil. Operating in a flux-pumped mode, we experimentally demonstrate an average gain of $15dB$ across a $600MHz$ bandwidth, along with an average saturation power of $-107dBm$ and quantum-limited noise temperature.</description>

In this paper, we explore the performance and design considerations of a linearly multiplexed photon number-resolving single-photon detector array, integrated on a single mode waveguide. Our investigation focus on defining and analyzing the fidelity of such an array under various conditions and proposing practical designs for its implementation. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we show how propagation losses and dark counts may have a strong impact on the performance of the system and highlight the importance of mitigating these effects in practical implementations.</description>

      <title>Compilation of Trotter-Based Time Evolution for Partially Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computing Architecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving practical quantum speedup with limited resources is a crucial challenge in both academic and industrial communities. To address this, a partially fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture called ``space-time efficient analog rotation quantum computing architecture (STAR architecture)'' has been recently proposed. This architecture focuses on minimizing resource requirements while maximizing the precision of non-Clifford gates, essential for universal quantum computation. However, non-deterministic processes such as the repeat-until-success (RUS) protocol and state injection can introduce significant computational overhead. Therefore, optimizing the logical circuit to minimize this overhead by using efficient fault-tolerant operations is essential. This paper presents an efficient method for simulating the time evolution of the 2D Hubbard model Hamiltonian, a promising application of the STAR architecture. We present two techniques, parallel injection protocol and adaptive injection region updating, to reduce unnecessary time overhead specific to our architecture. By integrating these with the existing fSWAP technique, we develop an efficient Trotter-based time evolution operation for the 2D Hubbard model. Our analysis reveals an acceleration of over 10 times compared to naive serial compilation. This optimized compilation enables us to estimate the computational resources required for quantum phase estimation of the 2D Hubbard model. For devices with a physical error rate of $p_{\rm phys} = 10^{-4}$, we estimate that approximately $6.5 \times 10^4$ physical qubits are required to achieve faster ground state energy estimation of the $8\times8$ Hubbard model compared to classical computation.</description>

Utilizing the fact that tilting the lattice results in oscillatory dynamics, we show how the parameters of the lattice and the initial state of the particle can be tuned so that during evolution the probability distribution does not change its shape while its center follows the trajectory known in classical mechanics as Lissajous curves.</description>

Abstract: Exactly solvable models in quantum many body dynamics provide valuable insights into many interesting physical phenomena, and serve as platforms to rigorously investigate fundamental theoretical questions. Nevertheless, they are extremely rare and existing solvable models and solution techniques have serious limitations. In this paper we introduce a new family of exactly solvable unitary circuits which model quantum many body dynamics in discrete space and time. Unlike many previous solvable models, one can exactly compute the full quantum dynamics initialized from any matrix product state in this new family of models. The time evolution of local observables and correlations, the linear growth of Renyi entanglement entropy, spatiotemporal correlations, and out-of-time-order correlations are all exactly computable. A key property of these models enabling the exact solution is that any time evolved local operator is an exact matrix product operator with finite bond dimension, even at arbitrarily long time, which we prove using the underlying (weak) Hopf algebra structure along with tensor network techniques. We lay down the general framework for the construction and solution of this family of models, and give several explicit examples. In particular, we study in detail a model constructed out of a weak Hopf algebra that is very close to a floquet version of the PXP model, and the exact results we obtain may shed light on the phenomenon of quantum many body scars, and more generally, floquet quantum dynamics in constrained systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an open quantum system undergoing Markovian dynamics, the latter being modelled by a discrete-time quantum Markov semigroup $(\Phi^n)_{n \in {\mathbb{N}}}$, resulting from the action of sequential uses of a quantum channel $\Phi$, with $n \in {\mathbb{N}}$ being the discrete time parameter. We find upper and lower bounds on the one-shot $\epsilon$-error information transmission capacities of $\Phi^n$ for a finite time $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $\epsilon \in [0,1)$ in terms of the structure of the peripheral space of the channel $\Phi$. We consider transmission of $(i)$ classical information (both in the unassisted and entanglement-assisted settings); $(ii)$ quantum information and $(iii)$ private classical information.</description>

      <title>Comparing Quantum Encoding Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09121v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As quantum computers continue to become more capable, the possibilities of their applications increase. For example, quantum techniques are being integrated with classical neural networks to perform machine learning. In order to be used in this way, or for any other widespread use like quantum chemistry simulations or cryptographic applications, classical data must be converted into quantum states through quantum encoding. There are three fundamental encoding methods: basis, amplitude, and rotation, as well as several proposed combinations. This study explores the encoding methods, specifically in the context of hybrid quantum-classical machine learning. Using the QuClassi quantum neural network architecture to perform binary classification of the `3' and `6' digits from the MNIST datasets, this study obtains several metrics such as accuracy, entropy, loss, and resistance to noise, while considering resource usage and computational complexity to compare the three main encoding methods.</description>

      <title>Generating entanglement of two acoustic modes by driving the qubit in circuit quantum acoustodynamics system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose how to generate the entanglement of two long-lived phonon modes in a circuit quantum acoustodynamics system, which consists of a multi-mode high-frequency bulk acoustic wave resonator and a transmon-type superconducting qubit. Two acoustic modes couple to the qubit through piezoelectric interaction, and the qubit is driven by a microwave field. Under the condition of far detuning between the qubit and acoustic modes, the qubit can be eliminated adiabatically, and thus establishing the indirect interaction between the two acoustic modes. We demonstrate that such the indirect interaction can be the parametric-amplification-type interaction by appropriately choosing the drive frequency and strength, so the entanglement between acoustic modes can be created by the direct unitary evolution. We numerically analyze the parameter conditions for generating the entanglement in detail and evaluate the influence of system dissipations and noise. The results show that the scheme can be realized using currently available parameters and has strong robustness against the dissipations and environmental temperature. This work may provide efficient resource for the quantum information processing based on the phononic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum many-body scars as remnants of stable many-body periodic orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) represent a weak ergodicity-breaking phenomenon that defies the common scenario of thermalization in closed quantum systems. They are often regarded as a many-body analog of quantum scars (QS) -- a single-particle phenomenon in quantum chaos -- due to their superficial similarities. However, unlike QS, a clear connection between QMBS and classical chaos has remained elusive. It has nevertheless been speculated that in an appropriate semiclassical limit, QMBS should have a correspondence to weakly unstable periodic orbits. In this paper, I present a counterexample to this conjecture by studying a bosonic model with a large number of flavors. The dynamics of out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs) suggest that QMBS do not display chaotic behavior in the semiclassical limit. In contrast, chaotic dynamics are expected for initial states not associated with QMBS. Interestingly, the anomalous OTOC dynamics persist even under weak perturbations that eliminate the scarred eigenstates, suggesting a certain robustness in the phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Quantized two terminal conductance, edge states and current patterns in an open geometry 2-dimensional Chern insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07640v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantization of the two terminal conductance in 2D topological systems is justified by the Landauer-Buttiker (LB) theory that assumes perfect point contacts between single channel leads and the sample. We examine this assumption in a microscopic model of a Chern insulator connected to leads, using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. We find that the currents are localized both in the leads and in the insulator and enter and exit the insulator only near the corners. The contact details do not matter and a single channel with perfect contact is emergent, thus justifying the LB theory. The quantized two-terminal conductance shows interesting finite-size effects and dependence on system-reservoir coupling.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-Vacancy Magnetic Relaxometry of Nanoclustered Cytochrome C Proteins</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08605v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry offers an alternative tool to detect paramagnetic centers in cells with a favorable combination of magnetic sensitivity and spatial resolution. Here, we employ NV magnetic relaxometry to detect cytochrome C (Cyt-C) nanoclusters. Cyt-C is a water-soluble protein that plays a vital role in the electron transport chain of mitochondria. Under ambient conditions, the heme group in Cyt-C remains in the Fe3+ state, which is paramagnetic. We vary the concentration of Cyt-C from 6 to 54 uM and observe a reduction of the NV spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) from 1.2 ms to 150 us, which is attributed to the spin noise originating from the Fe3+ spins. NV T1 imaging of Cyt-C drop-casted on a nanostructured diamond chip allows us to detect the relaxation rates from the adsorbed Fe3+ within Cyt-C.</description>

      <title>Multi-Excitation Projective Simulation with a Many-Body Physics Inspired Inductive Bias</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the impressive progress of deep learning, applications relying on machine learning are increasingly being integrated into daily life. However, most deep learning models have an opaque, oracle-like nature making it difficult to interpret and understand their decisions. This problem led to the development of the field known as eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). One method in this field known as Projective Simulation (PS) models a chain-of-thought as a random walk of a particle on a graph with vertices that have concepts attached to them. While this description has various benefits, including the possibility of quantization, it cannot be naturally used to model thoughts that combine several concepts simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Multi-Excitation Projective Simulation (mePS), a generalization that considers a chain-of-thought to be a random walk of several particles on a hypergraph. A definition for a dynamic hypergraph is put forward to describe the agent's training history along with applications to AI and hypergraph visualization. An inductive bias inspired by the remarkably successful few-body interaction models used in quantum many-body physics is formalized for our classical mePS framework and employed to tackle the exponential complexity associated with naive implementations of hypergraphs. We prove that our inductive bias reduces the complexity from exponential to polynomial, with the exponent representing the cutoff on how many particles can interact. We numerically apply our method to two toy environments and a more complex scenario modelling the diagnosis of a broken computer. These environments demonstrate the resource savings provided by an appropriate choice of inductive bias, as well as showcasing aspects of interpretability. A quantum model for mePS is also briefly outlined and some future directions for it are discussed.</description>

      <title>SU(N) magnetism with ultracold molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum systems with SU($N$) symmetry are paradigmatic settings for quantum many-body physics. They have been studied for the insights they provide into complex materials and their ability to stabilize exotic ground states. Ultracold alkaline-earth atoms were predicted to exhibit SU($N$) symmetry for $N=2I+1=1,2,\ldots,10$, where $I$ is the nuclear spin. Subsequent experiments have revealed rich many-body physics. However, alkaline-earth atoms realize this symmetry only for fermions with repulsive interactions. In this paper, we predict that ultracold molecules shielded from destructive collisions with static electric fields or microwaves exhibit SU($N$) symmetry, which holds because deviations of the s-wave scattering length from the spin-free values are only about 3\% for CaF with static-field shielding and are estimated to be even smaller for bialkali molecules. They open the door to $N$ as large as $32$ for bosons and $36$ for fermions. They offer important features unachievable with atoms, including bosonic systems and attractive interactions.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Nanocavity to Boost Single Photon Emission from Defects in Thin Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient and compact single photon emission platforms operating at room temperature with ultrafast speed and high brightness will be fundamental components of the emerging quantum communications and computing fields. However, so far, it is very challenging to design practical deterministic single photon emitters based on nanoscale solid-state materials that meet the fast emission rate and strong brightness demands. Here, a solution is provided to this longstanding problem by using metallic nanocavities integrated with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flakes with defects acting as nanoscale single photon emitters (SPEs) at room temperature. The presented hybrid nanophotonic structure creates a rapid speedup and large enhancement in single photon emission at room temperature. Hence, the nonclassical light emission performance is substantially improved compared to plain hBN flakes and hBN on gold-layered structures without nanocavity. Extensive theoretical calculations are also performed to accurately model the new hybrid nanophotonic system and prove that the incorporation of plasmonic nanocavity is key to efficient SPE performance. The proposed quantum nanocavity single photon source is expected to be an element of paramount importance to the envisioned room-temperature integrated quantum photonic networks.</description>

      <title>Klein-Gordon oscillators and Bergman spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider classical and quantum dynamics of relativistic oscillator in Minkowski space $\mathbb{R}^{3,1}$. It is shown that for a non-zero frequency parameter $\omega$ the covariant phase space of the classical Klein-Gordon oscillator is a homogeneous K\"ahler-Einstein manifold $Z_6=\mathrm{Ad}S_7/\mathrm{U}(1)=\mathrm{U}(3,1)/\mathrm{U}(3)\times \mathrm{U}(1)$. In the limit $\omega\to 0$, this manifold is deformed into the covariant phase space $T^*H^3$ of a free relativistic particle, where $H^3=H^3_+\cup H_-^3$ is a two-sheeted hyperboloid in momentum space. Quantization of this model with $\omega\ne 0$ leads to the Klein-Gordon oscillator equation which we consider in the Segal-Bargmann representation. It is shown that the general solution of this model is given by functions from the weighted Bergman space of square-integrable holomorphic (for particles) and antiholomorphic (for antiparticles) functions on the K\"ahler-Einstein manifold $Z_6$. This relativistic model is Lorentz covariant, unitary and does not contain non-physical states.</description>

      <title>Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principles, Liouville theorem and density of states: Snyder-de Sitter and Yang models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05110v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modifications in quantum mechanical phase space lead to changes in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, which can result in the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) or the Extended Uncertainty Principle (EUP), introducing quantum gravitational effects at small and large distances, respectively. A combination of GUP and EUP, the Generalized Extended Uncertainty Principle (GEUP or EGUP), further generalizes these modifications by incorporating noncommutativity in both coordinates and momenta. This paper examines the impact of GEUP on the Liouville theorem in statistical physics and density of states within non-relativistic quantum mechanics framework. We find a weighted phase space volume element, invariant under the infinitesimal time evolution, in the cases of Snyder-de Sitter and Yang models, presenting how GEUP alters the density of states, potentially affecting physical (thermodynamical) properties. Special cases, obtained in certain limits from the above models are also discussed. New higher order types of GEUP and EUP are also proposed.</description>
