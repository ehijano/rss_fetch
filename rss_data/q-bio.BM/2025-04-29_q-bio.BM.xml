      <title>An X-ray absorption spectrum database for iron-containing proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth-abundant iron is an essential metal in regulating the structure and function of proteins. This study presents the development of a comprehensive X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) database focused on iron-containing proteins, addressing a critical gap in available high-quality annotated spectral data for iron-containing proteins. The database integrates detailed XAS spectra with their corresponding local structural data of proteins and enables a direct comparison of spectral features and structural motifs. Utilizing a combination of manual curation and semi-automated data extraction techniques, we developed a comprehensive dataset from an extensive review of literature, ensuring the quality and accuracy of data, which contains 437 protein structures and 1954 XAS spectrums. Our methods included careful documentation and validation processes to ensure accuracy and reproducibility. This dataset not only centralizes information on iron-containing proteins but also supports advanced data-driven discoveries, such as machine learning, to predict and analyze protein structure and functions. This work underscores the potential of integrating detailed spectroscopic data with structural biology to advance the field of biological chemistry and catalysis.</description>

      <title>CAML: Commutative algebra machine learning -- a case study on protein-ligand binding affinity prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Suwayyid and Wei have introduced commutative algebra as an emerging paradigm for machine learning and data science. In this work, we integrate commutative algebra machine learning (CAML) for the prediction of protein-ligand binding affinities. Specifically, we apply persistent Stanley-Reisner theory, a key concept in combinatorial commutative algebra, to the affinity predictions of protein-ligand binding and metalloprotein-ligand binding. We introduce three new algorithms, i.e., element-specific commutative algebra, category-specific commutative algebra, and commutative algebra on bipartite complexes, to address the complexity of data involved in (metallo) protein-ligand complexes. We show that the proposed CAML outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in (metallo) protein-ligand binding affinity predictions.</description>

      <title>Molecular Determinants of Orthosteric-allosteric Dual Inhibition of PfHT1 by Computational Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To overcome antimalarial drug resistance, carbohydrate derivatives as selective PfHT1 inhibitor have been suggested in recent experimental work with orthosteric and allosteric dual binding pockets. Inspired by this promising therapeutic strategy, herein, molecular dynamics simulations are performed to investigate the molecular determinants of co-administration on orthosteric and allosteric inhibitors targeting PfHT1. Our binding free energy analysis capture the essential trend of inhibitor binding affinity to protein from published experimental IC50 data in three sets of distinct characteristics. In particular, we rank the contribution of key residues as binding sites which categorized into three groups based on linker length, size of tail group, and sugar moiety of inhibitors. The pivotal roles of these key residues are further validated by mutant analysis where mutated to nonpolar alanine leading to reduced affinities to different degrees. The exception was fructose derivative, which exhibited a significant enhanced affinity to mutation on orthosteric sites due to strong changed binding poses. This study may provide useful information for optimized design of precision medicine to circumvent drug-resistant Plasmodium parasites with high efficacy.</description>

      <title>Sparks: Multi-Agent Artificial Intelligence Model Discovers Protein Design Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) promise autonomous discovery, yet most systems still resurface knowledge latent in their training data. We present Sparks, a multi-modal multi-agent AI model that executes the entire discovery cycle that includes hypothesis generation, experiment design and iterative refinement to develop generalizable principles and a report without human intervention. Applied to protein science, Sparks uncovered two previously unknown phenomena: (i) a length-dependent mechanical crossover whereby beta-sheet-biased peptides surpass alpha-helical ones in unfolding force beyond ~80 residues, establishing a new design principle for peptide mechanics; and (ii) a chain-length/secondary-structure stability map revealing unexpectedly robust beta-sheet-rich architectures and a "frustration zone" of high variance in mixed alpha/beta folds. These findings emerged from fully self-directed reasoning cycles that combined generative sequence design, high-accuracy structure prediction and physics-aware property models, with paired generation-and-reflection agents enforcing self-correction and reproducibility. The key result is that Sparks can independently conduct rigorous scientific inquiry and identify previously unknown scientific principles.</description>

      <title>Towards Faster and More Compact Foundation Models for Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advancements in machine learning for molecular property prediction have improved accuracy but at the expense of higher computational cost and longer training times. Recently, the Joint Multi-domain Pre-training (JMP) foundation model has demonstrated strong performance across various downstream tasks with reduced training time over previous models. Despite JMP's advantages, fine-tuning it on molecular datasets ranging from small-scale to large-scale requires considerable time and computational resources. In this work, we investigate strategies to enhance efficiency by reducing model size while preserving performance. To better understand the model's efficiency, we analyze the layer contributions of JMP and find that later interaction blocks provide diminishing returns, suggesting an opportunity for model compression. We explore block reduction strategies by pruning the pre-trained model and evaluating its impact on efficiency and accuracy during fine-tuning. Our analysis reveals that removing two interaction blocks results in a minimal performance drop, reducing the model size by 32% while increasing inference throughput by 1.3x. These results suggest that JMP-L is over-parameterized and that a smaller, more efficient variant can achieve comparable performance with lower computational cost. Our study provides insights for developing lighter, faster, and more scalable foundation models for molecular and materials discovery.

      <title>TDP-43 multidomains and RNA modulate interactions and viscoelasticity in biomolecular condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: RNA-binding proteins form biomolecular condensates with RNA through phase separation, playing crucial roles in various cellular processes. While intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are key drivers of phase separation, additional factors such as folded domains and RNA also influence condensate formation and physical properties. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this regulation remain elusive. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate how the multidomain structure of TDP-43, which consists of its IDR, RNA recognition motifs (RRMs), and N-terminal domain (NTD), interacts with RNA and affects the characteristics of phase separation. Our analysis reveals that interaction sites within the IDR undergo dynamic rearrangement, driven by key residues that depend on the specific combination of folded domains. Upon RNA binding, several intermolecular interactions of TDP-43 are replaced by TDP-43-polyA interactions, altering viscoelastic properties of the condensate. Specifically, RRMs enhance viscosity, whereas the NTD reduces it. The presence of polyA increases elasticity, making viscosity and elasticity comparable in magnitude. These findings suggest that the multidomain structure of TDP-43 and its RNA interactions orchestrate condensate organization, modulating their viscoelastic properties.</description>

      <title>Pan-genome Analysis of Angiosperm Plastomes using PGR-TK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for taxonomic analysis of chloroplast genomes in angiosperms using the Pan-genome Research Toolkit (PGR-TK). Comparative plots generated by PGR-TK across diverse angiosperm genera reveal a wide range of structural complexity, from straightforward to highly intricate patterns. Notably, the characteristic quadripartite plastome structure, comprising the large single copy (LSC), small single copy (SSC), and inverted repeat (IR) regions, is clearly identifiable in over 75% of the genera analyzed. Our findings also underscore several occurrences of species mis-annotations in public genomic databases, which are readily detected through visual anomalies in the PGR-TK plots. While more complex plot patterns remain difficult to interpret, they likely reflect underlying biological variation or technical inconsistencies in genome assembly. Overall, this approach effectively integrates classical botanical visualization with modern molecular taxonomy, providing a powerful tool for genome-based classification in plant systematics.</description>

      <title>Guided Multi-objective Generative AI to Enhance Structure-based Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11785v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative AI has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery. Yet, despite recent advances in deep learning, existing models cannot generate molecules that satisfy all desired physicochemical properties. Herein, we describe IDOLpro, a generative chemistry AI combining diffusion with multi-objective optimization for structure-based drug design. Differentiable scoring functions guide the latent variables of the diffusion model to explore uncharted chemical space and generate novel ligands in silico, optimizing a plurality of target physicochemical properties. We demonstrate our platform's effectiveness by generating ligands with optimized binding affinity and synthetic accessibility on two benchmark sets. IDOLpro produces ligands with binding affinities over 10%-20% better than the next best state-of-the-art method on each test set, producing more drug-like molecules with generally better synthetic accessibility scores than other methods. We do a head-to-head comparison of IDOLpro against a classic virtual screen of a large database of drug-like molecules. We show that IDOLpro can generate molecules for a range of important disease-related targets with better binding affinity and synthetic accessibility than any molecule found in the virtual screen while being over 100x faster and less expensive to run. On a test set of experimental complexes, IDOLpro is the first to produce molecules with better binding affinities than experimentally observed ligands. IDOLpro can accommodate other scoring functions (e.g. ADME-Tox) to accelerate hit-finding, hit-to-lead, and lead optimization for drug discovery.</description>
