      <title>Quantum-Inspired Portfolio Optimization In The QUBO Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum-inspired optimization approach is proposed to study the portfolio optimization aimed at maximizing the returns of investment portfolio while minimizing its risk by diversifying investment across different asset classes. By integrating conventional approaches with quantum-inspired methods and simulation techniques for penalty coefficient estimation, this approach enables faster solutions to portfolio optimization. The proposed two-stage search strategy further enhances the method by starting with a broad search to quickly identify potential solutions and then refining these results to increase accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is validated through experiments using a real-world dataset of quarterly financial data spanning ten years. Moreover, the effectiveness of various portfolio strategies under volatile market conditions is also investigated with emphasis on the robustness and predictive capacity of our methodology. This research contributes to the growing body of literature on quantum-inspired techniques in finance, demonstrating its potential as a powerful tool for asset allocation and portfolio management.</description>

      <title>Worst-case values of target semi-variances with applications to robust portfolio selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The expected regret and target semi-variance are two of the most important risk measures for downside risk. When the distribution of a loss is uncertain, and only partial information of the loss is known, their worst-case values play important roles in robust risk management for finance, insurance, and many other fields. Jagannathan (1977) derived the worst-case expected regrets when only the mean and variance of a loss are known and the loss is arbitrary, symmetric, or non-negative. While Chen et al. (2011) obtained the worst-case target semi-variances under similar conditions but focusing on arbitrary losses. In this paper, we first complement the study of Chen et al. (2011) on the worst-case target semi-variances and derive the closed-form expressions for the worst-case target semi-variance when only the mean and variance of a loss are known and the loss is symmetric or non-negative. Then, we investigate worst-case target semi-variances over uncertainty sets that represent undesirable scenarios faced by an investors. Our methods for deriving these worst-case values are different from those used in Jagannathan (1977) and Chen et al. (2011). As applications of the results derived in this paper, we propose robust portfolio selection methods that minimize the worst-case target semi-variance of a portfolio loss over different uncertainty sets. To explore the insights of our robust portfolio selection methods, we conduct numerical experiments with real financial data and compare our portfolio selection methods with several existing portfolio selection models related to the models proposed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Improving Portfolio Optimization Results with Bandit Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Reinforcement Learning (RL), multi-armed Bandit (MAB) problems have found applications across diverse domains such as recommender systems, healthcare, and finance. Traditional MAB algorithms typically assume stationary reward distributions, which limits their effectiveness in real-world scenarios characterized by non-stationary dynamics. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing and evaluating novel Bandit algorithms designed for non-stationary environments. First, we present the Adaptive Discounted Thompson Sampling (ADTS) algorithm, which enhances adaptability through relaxed discounting and sliding window mechanisms to better respond to changes in reward distributions. We then extend this approach to the Portfolio Optimization problem by introducing the Combinatorial Adaptive Discounted Thompson Sampling (CADTS) algorithm, which addresses computational challenges within Combinatorial Bandits and improves dynamic asset allocation. Additionally, we propose a novel architecture called Bandit Networks, which integrates the outputs of ADTS and CADTS, thereby mitigating computational limitations in stock selection. Through extensive experiments using real financial market data, we demonstrate the potential of these algorithms and architectures in adapting to dynamic environments and optimizing decision-making processes. For instance, the proposed bandit network instances present superior performance when compared to classic portfolio optimization approaches, such as capital asset pricing model, equal weights, risk parity, and Markovitz, with the best network presenting an out-of-sample Sharpe Ratio 20% higher than the best performing classical model.</description>
