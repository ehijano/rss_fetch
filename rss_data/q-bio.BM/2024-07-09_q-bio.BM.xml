      <title>Single-Sequence-Based Protein Secondary Structure Prediction using One-Hot and Chemical Encodings of Amino Acids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In protein secondary structure prediction, each amino acid in sequence is typically treated as a distinct category and represented by a one-hot vector. In this study, we developed two novel chemical representations for amino acids utilizing molecular fingerprints and the dimensionality reduction algorithm FastMap. We demonstrate that the two new chemical encodings can provide additional information about the interactions of amino acids in sequences that an LSTM-based model cannot capture with one-hot encoding alone. Compared to the latest LSTM-based model used in the single-sequence-based method SPOT-1D-Single, our ensemble model utilizing one-hot and chemical encodings achieves better accuracy across most test sets while requiring approximately nine times fewer trainable parameters for each encoding model. Our single-sequence-based method is valuable for its simplicity, lower resource requirements, and independence from external sequence data. It is beneficial when quick or preliminary predictions are needed or when data on homologous sequences is scarce.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Protein-Ligand Docking: Are We There Yet?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The effects of ligand binding on protein structures and their in vivo functions carry numerous implications for modern biomedical research and biotechnology development efforts such as drug discovery. Although several deep learning (DL) methods and benchmarks designed for protein-ligand docking have recently been introduced, to date no prior works have systematically studied the behavior of docking methods within the practical context of (1) using predicted (apo) protein structures for docking (e.g., for broad applicability); (2) docking multiple ligands concurrently to a given target protein (e.g., for enzyme design); and (3) having no prior knowledge of binding pockets (e.g., for pocket generalization). To enable a deeper understanding of docking methods' real-world utility, we introduce PoseBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for practical protein-ligand docking. PoseBench enables researchers to rigorously and systematically evaluate DL docking methods for apo-to-holo protein-ligand docking and protein-ligand structure generation using both single and multi-ligand benchmark datasets, the latter of which we introduce for the first time to the DL community. Empirically, using PoseBench, we find that all recent DL docking methods but one fail to generalize to multi-ligand protein targets and also that template-based docking algorithms perform equally well or better for multi-ligand docking as recent single-ligand DL docking methods, suggesting areas of improvement for future work. Code, data, tutorials, and benchmark results are available at https://github.com/BioinfoMachineLearning/PoseBench.</description>
