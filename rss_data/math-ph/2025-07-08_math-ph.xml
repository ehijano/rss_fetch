      <title>On Frustration-Free Quantum Spin Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of our work is to map the landscape of the frustration-free quantum spin models over the Cayley graph of a finitely generated group. This is achieved by establishing equivariant connections with the spaces of hereditary C*-algebras of the underlying quasi-local algebra of observables, and of open projections of its double dual.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Robinson bounds, automorphic equivalence and LPPL for long-range interacting fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Lieb-Robinson bound for lattice fermion models with polynomially decaying interactions, which can be used to show the locality of the quasi-local inverse Liouvillian. This allows us to prove automorphic equivalence and the local perturbations perturb locally (LPPL) principle for these systems. The proof of the Lieb-Robinson bound is based on the work of Else et al. (2020), and our results also apply to spin systems. We explain why some newer Lieb-Robinson bounds for long-range spin systems cannot be used to prove the locality of the quasi-local inverse Liouvillian, and in some cases may not even hold for fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>An infinite family of Dunkl type superintegrable curved Hamiltonians through coalgebra symmetry: Oscillator and Kepler-Coulomb models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to bridge the gap between Dunkl superintegrable systems and the coalgebra symmetry approach to superintegrability, and subsequently to recover known models and construct new ones. In particular, an infinite family of $N$-dimensional quasi-maximally superintegrable quantum systems with reflections, sharing the same set of $2N-3$ quantum integrals, is introduced. The result is achieved by introducing a novel differential-difference realization of $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$ and then applying the coalgebra formalism. Several well-known maximally superintegrable models with reflections appear as particular cases of this general family, among them, the celebrated Dunkl oscillator and the Dunkl-Kepler-Coulomb system. Furthermore, restricting to the case of "hidden" quantum quadratic symmetries, maximally superintegrable curved oscillator and Kepler-Coulomb Hamiltonians of Dunkl type, sharing the same underlying $\mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{R})$ coalgebra symmetry, are presented. Namely, the Dunkl oscillator and the Dunkl-Kepler-Coulomb system on the $N$-sphere and hyperbolic space together with two models which can be interpreted as a one-parameter superintegrable deformation of the Dunkl oscillator and the Dunkl-Kepler-Coulomb system on non-constant curvature spaces. In addition, maximally superintegrable generalizations of these models, involving non-central potentials, are also derived on flat and curved spaces. For all specific systems, at least an additional quantum integral is explicitly provided, which is related to the Dunkl version of a (curved) Demkov-Fradkin tensor or a Laplace-Runge-Lenz vector.</description>

      <title>Jones Polynomials and their Zeros for a Family of Knots and Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate Jones polynomials $V(H_r,t)$ for a family of alternating knots and links $H_r$ with arbitrarily many crossings $r$, by computing the Tutte polynomials $T(G_+(H_r),x,y)$ for the associated graphs $G_+(H_r)$ and evaluating these with $x=-t$ and $y=-1/t$. Our method enables us to circumvent the generic feature that the computational complexity of $V(L_r,t)$ for a knot or link $L_r$ for generic $t$ grows exponentially rapidly with $r$. We also study the accumulation set of the zeros of these polynomials in the limit of infinitely many crossings, $r \to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Resonances for Atoms in Dipole approximation of non-relativistic QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider atoms or molecules coupled to the quantized electromagnetic radiation field in a dipole approximation. We show the existence of ground states and resonance states in situations where the eigenvalues are degenerate and protected by a symmetry group. We show that ground states and resonance states as well as their energies depend analytically on the coupling constant. Our results are an application of the result in [20], which in turn is obtained using operator theoretic renormalization.</description>

      <title>Gauging the Schwarzian Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we promote the global $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ symmetry of the Schwarzian derivative to a local gauge symmetry. To achieve this, we develop a procedure that potentially can be generalized beyond the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ case: We first construct a composite field from the fundamental field and its derivative such that it transforms linearly under the group action. Then we write down its gauge-covariant extension and apply standard gauging techniques. Applying this to the fractional linear representation of $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, we obtain the gauge-invariant analogue of the Schwarzian derivative as a bilinear invariant of covariant derivatives of the composite field. The framework enables a simple construction of N\"other charges associated with the original global symmetry. The gauge-invariant Schwarzian action introduces $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ gauge potentials, allowing for locally invariant couplings to additional fields, such as fermions. While these potentials can be gauged away on topologically trivial domains, non-trivial topologies (e.g., $S^1$) lead to distinct topological sectors. We mention that in the context of two-dimensional gravity, these sectors could correspond to previously discussed quantized defects in the bulk theory.</description>

      <title>About Fractional Calculus and its Applications in Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Historically the fractional calculus concept works an extended idea based on the question asked by Guillaume de L'H\^opital to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1695 about the notation ${d^nf}/{dx^n}$ for the derivative operator "What if $n=\frac{1}{2}$ ?" To which Leibiniz replied : "This is an apparent paradox, from which useful consequences will be established".
  Our work revisits the unfolds who followed this questions with some classical definitions of fractional derivative operators and fractional integral. We still point out possible applications in areas such as Engineering, Physics, among others. Among these definitions we will focus more on the Riemann-Liouville and Caputo definitions, however other definitions are also briefly commented. In this work we begin with a historical inspection of the birth of the fractional calculus, parallels with the differential calculus and some of its developments are traced. Always focusing on the definitions of Riemann-Liouville and Caputo, more commonly found in the bibliography of the area and more frequent in scientific works. Some examples of its operability are presented, such as the direct calculation of constant function derivatives, polynomial function and exponential function. Derivative operators and fractional integrals are defined as derivatives and noninteger-order integrals. Our work revisits these two classical definitions of derivative operators and fractional integral and points out possible applications in areas such as Engineering, Physics, among others. Our main goal is to address the feasibility of implementing this content in a degree form program in Physics, we strogly believe that this theme will aggregate a lot of content mainly because its multidisciplinary character.</description>

      <title>Perturbed Toroidal Vortices Display Internal Simply Connected Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work shows that the interiors of perturbed zero-helicity vortices display simply connected topology with a crescent-shaped boundary. Flux surfaces in fluid and magnetic vortices were explored analytically, while particle trajectories in the context of plasma confinement were examined numerically, demonstrating the existence of both toroidal and simply connected topologies. This new topology appears for perturbations in a broad class, with amplitudes and spatial variance allowed to be arbitrarily small. A corollary of this work proves the closedness of field lines under odd-parity perturbations of zero-helicity vortices.</description>

      <title>A description of classical field equations using extensions of graded Poisson brackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As it is well-known, Poisson brackets play a fundamental role both in mechanics and in classical field theories. In this paper we develop a theory of extensions of graded Poisson brackets in graded Dirac manifolds. We then show how these extensions can be used to obtain the field equations of a particular theory as well as the evolution of forms of arbitrary order, in a similar way that ordinary Poisson brackets provide in mechanics.</description>

      <title>On an analogy between the Wiener--Hopf formulations of discrete and continuous diffraction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is dedicated to unifying the framework used to derive the Wiener--Hopf equations arising from some discrete and continuous wave diffraction problems.The main tools are the discrete Green's identity and the appropriate notion of discrete normal derivative. The resulting formal analogy between the Wiener--Hopf equations allows one to effortlessly move between the discrete and continuous formulations. The validity of this novel analogy is illustrated through several famous two-dimensional canonical diffraction problems and extended to three-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Ballistic Transport for Discrete Multi-Dimensional Schr\"odinger Operators With Decaying Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the discrete Schr\"odinger operator $H = -\Delta + V$ on $\ell^2(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ with a decaying potential, in arbitrary lattice dimension $d\in\mathbb{N}^*$, where $\Delta$ is the standard discrete Laplacian and $V_n = o(|n|^{-1})$ as $|n| \to \infty$. We prove that the unitary evolution $e^{-i tH}$ exhibits ballistic transport in the sense that, for any $r &gt; 0$, the weighted $\ell^2-$norm $$\|e^{-i tH}u\|_r:=\left(\sum_{n\in\mathbb{Z}^d} (1+|n|^2)^{r} |(e^{-i tH}u)_n|^2\right)^\frac12 $$ grows at rate $\simeq t^r$ as $t\to \infty$, provided that the initial state $u$ is in the absolutely continuous subspace and satisfies $\|u\|_r&lt;\infty$.
  The proof relies on commutator methods and a refined Mourre estimate, which yields quantitative lower bounds on transport for operators with purely absolutely continuous spectrum over appropriate spectral intervals. Compactness arguments and localized spectral projections are used to extend the result to perturbed operators, extending the classical result for the free Laplacian to a broader class of decaying potentials.</description>

      <title>An operator algebraic approach to fusion category symmetry on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a framework for fusion category symmetry on the (1+1)D lattice in the thermodynamic limit by giving a formal interpretation of SymTFT decompositions. Our approach is based on axiomatizing physical boundary subalgebra of quasi-local observables, and applying ideas from algebraic quantum field theory to derive the expected categorical structures. We show that given a physical boundary subalgebra $B$ of a quasi-local algebra $A$, there is a canonical fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ that acts on $A$ by bimodules and whose fusion ring acts by locality preserving quantum channels on the quasi-local algebra such that $B$ is recovered as the invariant operators. We show that a fusion category can be realized as symmetries of a tensor product spin chain if and only if all of its objects have integer dimensions, and that it admits an on-site action on a tensor product spin chain if and only if it admits a fiber functor. We give a formal definition of a topological symmetric state, and prove a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem. Using this, we show that for any fusion category $\mathcal{C}$ with no fiber functor there always exists gapless pure symmetric states on an anyon chain. Finally, we apply our framework to show that any state covariant under an anomalous Kramers-Wannier type duality must be gapless.</description>

On the other hand, for $s\in[0,1]$ such that the map $x\mapsto x^s g(x)$ is positive and decreasing, then $ \text{Tr}[ g(A) (A^{1/2} B A^{1/2} )^s ] \leq \text{Tr}[ g(A) A^s B^s ]$.</description>

      <title>Analogue of Goeritz matrices for computation of bipartite HOMFLY-PT polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Goeritz matrix is an alternative to the Kauffman bracket and, in addition, makes it possible to calculate the Jones polynomial faster with some minimal choice of a checkerboard surface of a link diagram. We introduce a modification of the Goeritz method that generalizes the Goeritz matrix for computing the HOMFLY-PT polynomials for any $N$ in the special case of bipartite links. Our method reduces to purely algebraic operations on matrices, and therefore, it can be easily implemented as a computer program. Bipartite links form a rather large family including a special class of Montesinos links constructed from the so-called rational tangles.

      <description>arXiv:2507.03140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Burq's logarithmic decay rate [Bur98] to general compactly supported scatterers in dimension two. The main novelty is using recent results on low-frequency expansions to remove the requirement that the spectrum be regular at zero. This allows us to include, among other examples, arbitrary smooth obstacles with variable boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>From random matrices to systems of particles in interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of these expository notes is to give an introduction to random matrices for non-specialist of this topic focusing on the link between random matrices and systems of particles in interaction. We first recall some general results about the random matrix theory that create a link between random matrices and systems of particles through the knowledge of the law of the eigenvalues of certain random matrices models. We next focus on a continuous in time approach of random matrices called the Dyson Brownian motion. We detail some general methods to study the existence of system of particles in singular interaction and the existence of a mean field limit for these systems of particles. Finally, we present the main result of large deviations when studying the eigenvalues of random matrices. This method is based on the fact that the eigenvalues of certain models of random matrices can be viewed as log gases in dimension 1 or 2.</description>

      <title>Geometric realizations of the Lie superalgebra D(2,1;a)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every parabolic subgroup $P$ of a Lie supergroup $G$, the homogeneous superspace $G/P$ carries a $G$-invariant supergeometry. We address the question whether $\mathfrak{g}=\text{Lie}(G)$ is the maximal supersymmetry of this supergeometry in the case of the exceptional Lie superalgebra $D(2,1;a)$. For each choice of parabolic $\mathfrak{p}\subset\mathfrak{g}$, we consider the corresponding negatively graded Lie subalgebra $\mathfrak{m}\subset\mathfrak{g}$, and compute its Tanaka--Weisfeiler prolongations, with reduction of the structure group when required, thus realizing $D(2,1;a)$ via symmetries of supergeometries.
  This gives 6 inequivalent supergeometries: one of these is a vector superdistribution, two are given by cone fields of supervarieties, and the remaining three are higher order structure reductions (a novel feature). We describe those supergeometries and realize $D(2,1;a)$ supersymmetry explicitly in each case.</description>

      <title>A covariant approach to the Dirac field in LRS space-times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the polar decomposition to describe the Dirac field in terms of an effective spinorial fluid. After reformulating all covariant equations in ``spinorial'' signature $(+ -- )$, we develop a $(1+1+2)$ covariant approach for the Dirac field that does not require the use of tetrad fields or Clifford matrices. By identifying the velocity and spin fields as the generators of time-like and space-like congruences, we examine the compatibility of a self-gravitating Dirac field with Locally Rotationally Symmetric space-times of types I, II, and III. We provide illustrative examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of our construction.</description>

      <title>On one-dimensional Cluster cluster model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cluster-cluster model was introduced by Meakin et al in 1984. Each $x\in \mathbb{Z}^d$ starts with a cluster of size 1 with probability $p \in (0,1]$ independently. Each cluster $C$ performs a continuous-time SRW with rate $|C|^{-\alpha}$. If it attempts to move to a vertex occupied by another cluster, it does not move, and instead the two clusters connect via a new edge. Focusing on dimension $d=1$, we show that for $\alpha&gt;-2$, at time $t$, the cluster size is of order $t^\frac{1}{\alpha + 2}$, and for $\alpha &lt; -2$ we get an infinite cluster in finite time a.s. Additionally, for $\alpha = 0$ we show convergence in distribution of the scaling limit.</description>

      <title>Scientific Machine Learning of Chaotic Systems Discovers Governing Equations for Neural Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from noise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that this method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct symbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount of data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex, prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and macroscale brain activity.</description>

      <title>Perturbative renormalisation of the $\Phi^4_{4-\varepsilon}$ model via generalized Wick maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the perturbative renormalisation of the $\Phi^4_d$ model from Euclidean Quantum Field Theory for any, possibly non-integer dimension $d&lt;4$. The so-called BPHZ renormalisation, named after Bogoliubov, Parasiuk, Hepp and Zimmermann, is usually encoded into extraction-contraction operations on Feynman diagrams, which have a complicated combinatorics. We show that the same procedure can be encoded in the much simpler algebra of polynomials in two unknowns $X$ and $Y$, which represent the fourth and second Wick power of the field. In this setting, renormalisation takes the form of a \lq\lq Wick map\rq\rq\ which maps monomials into Bell polynomials. The construction makes use of recent results by Bruned and Hou on multiindices, which are algebraic objects of intermediate complexity between Feynman diagrams and polynomials.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct integrable self-adaptive moving mesh schemes for multi-component modified short pulse and short pulse equations under general boundary conditions including periodic boundary conditions by using the consistency condition with the hodograph transformation. We also construct multi-soliton solutions expressed by Pfaffian for our self-adaptive moving mesh schemes. Using self-adaptive moving mesh schemes presented in this paper, we perform numerical experiments to evaluate their effectiveness and accuracy as a numerical method.</description>

      <title>The windowed quadratic phase Fourier transform: structure, convolution theorem and application</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The windowed quadratic phase Fourier transform (WQPFT) combines the localization capabilities of windowed transforms with the phase modulation structure of the quadratic phase Fourier transform (QPFT). This paper investigates fundamental properties of the WQPFT, including linearity, shifting, modulation, conjugation, and symmetry. In addition, we derive the reproducing kernel, establish a reconstruction formula, and characterize the range of the transform. Convolution theorems in both the spectral and spatial domains are developed, along with the existence results and norm estimates for the convolution operation associated with the WQPFT. Finally, as an application, the solution of a convolution equation is given using the convolution theorem of the WQPFT.</description>

      <title>Noise Reinstates Collapsed Populations: Stochastic Reversal of Deterministic Extinction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom suggests that environmental noise drives populations toward extinction. In contrast, we report a paradoxical phenomenon in which stochasticity reverses a deterministic tipping point, thereby preventing collapse. Using a hybrid model that integrates logistic growth with a density-triggered sigmoidal collapse, we uncover a striking reversal: deterministic fragility on one side, and stochastic rescue under weak noise on the other. Our analysis demonstrates that noise disrupts the convergence of deterministic trajectories toward extinction by altering the phase space topology, enabling back-transitions to viable states. This mechanism gives rise to noise-induced metastability and reveals a form of stochastic robustness not captured by deterministic models. These findings suggest that natural fluctuations can serve as a stabilizing force in complex systems, offering a compelling counter-narrative to classical models in ecology, epidemiology, and beyond. We advocate for a re-evaluation of stabilization strategies, emphasizing the constructive role of stochasticity in averting population collapse.</description>

      <title>Solving Lane-Emden-Type Eigenvalue Problems with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Lane-Emden equation, a nonlinear second-order ordinary differential equation, plays a fundamental role in theoretical physics and astrophysics, particularly in modeling the structure of stellar interiors. Also referred to as the polytropic differential equation, it describes the behavior of self-gravitating polytropic spheres. In this study, we present a novel approach to the solution of the eigenvalue problem which arises when considering the Lane-Emden equation for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The novelty of this work is that, we not only solve the Lane-Emden equation via PINNS but we also determine the eigenvalue, r, which is the stellar radius. Hyperparameter tuning was conducted using Bayesian optimization in the Optuna framework to identify optimal values for the number of hidden layers, number of neurons, activation function, optimizer, and learning rate for each value of n. The results show that, for n = 0, 1, PINNs achieve near-exact agreement with theoretical eigenvalues (errors &lt; 0.000806%). While for more nonlinear cases, n = 2, 3 and n=4, PINNs yield errors below 0.0009% and 0.05% respectively, validating their robustness.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Origins of Conformable Dynamics: From Disorder to Deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformable derivatives have attracted increasing interest for bridging classical and fractional calculus while retaining analytical tractability. However, their physical foundations remain underexplored. In this work, we provide a systematic derivation of conformable relaxation dynamics from microscopic principles. Starting from a spatially-resolved Ginzburg-Landau framework with quenched disorder and temperature-dependent kinetic coefficients, we demonstrate how spatial heterogeneity and energy barrier distributions give rise to emergent power-law memory kernels. In the adiabatic limit, these kernels reduce to a conformable temporal structure of the form T^{1-\mu}\,d\psi/dT. The deformation parameter \mu is shown to be connected to experimentally measurable properties such as transport coefficients, disorder statistics, and relaxation time spectra. This formulation also reveals a natural link with nonextensive thermodynamics and Tsallis entropy. By unifying memory effects, anomalous relaxation, and spatial correlations under a coherent physical mechanism, our framework transforms conformable derivatives from heuristic tools into physically grounded operators suitable for modeling complex critical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Parallel spin wave for the Villain model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Villain model in $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in dimension $d\geq 3$. It is conjectured, that the parallel correlation function in the infinite volume Gibbs state, i.e., the map
  $$
  x \mapsto \langle \cos\theta(0) \cos\theta(x) \rangle_{\mu_{\mathrm{Vil}, \beta}} -\left( \langle \cos\theta(0) \rangle_{\mu_{\mathrm{Vil}, \beta}} \right)^2,
  $$
  decays like $|x|^{-2(d-2)}$ as $|x| \to \infty$ at low temperature. The results of Bricmont, Fontaine, Lebowitz, Lieb, and Spencer (1981) show that for the related XY model, this correlation decays at least as fast as $|x|^{2-d}$. We prove the optimal upper and lower bounds for the Villain model in $d=3$, up to a logarithmic correction, and also improve the upper bound in general dimensions.
  Our proof builds upon the approach developed in our previous article, which in turn is inspired by a key observation of Fr\"{o}hlich and Spencer (1982): in the low temperature regime, a combination of duality transformation and renormalisation allows certain properties of the Villain model to be analysed in terms of a (vector-valued) $\nabla \varphi$ interface model. This latter model can be investigated using the Helffer-Sj\"{o}strand representation formula combined with tools of elliptic and parabolic regularity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Operator systems of matrices can be viewed as quantum analogues of finite graphs. This analogy suggests many natural combinatorial questions in linear algebra. We determine the quantum Ramsey numbers $QR(2,k)$ and the lower quantum Tur\'an numbers $T^\downarrow(n, m)$ with $n &gt; 3m$. In particular, we conclude that $QR(2,2) = 4$ and confirm Weaver's conjecture that $T^\downarrow(4, 1) = 4$. We also obtain a new result for the existence of anticliques in quantum graphs of low dimension.</description>

      <title>P\'olya's conjecture up to $\epsilon$-loss and quantitative estimates for the remainder of Weyl's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain. For any $\epsilon\in (0,1)$ we show that for any Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_k(\Omega)&gt;\Lambda(\epsilon,\Omega)$, it holds \begin{align*} k&amp;\le (1+\epsilon)\frac{|\Omega|\omega(n)}{(2\pi)^n}\lambda_k(\Omega)^{n/2}, \end{align*} where $\Lambda(\epsilon,\Omega)$ is given explicitly. This reduces the $\epsilon$-loss version of P\'olya's conjecture to a computational problem. This estimate is based on a uniform estimate on the remainder of the Weyl law on Lipschitz domains, which appears to be the first quantitative estimate for the remainder of Weyl's law since Weyl's seminal work in the year 1911.

      <title>Noncommutative discrete equations, symmetries and reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing the Lax pairs of the noncommutative discrete potential Korteweg--de Vries (KdV) and Hirota's KdV equations, we derive differential--difference equations that are consistent with these systems and serve as their generalised symmetries. Miura transformations mapping these equations to a noncommutative modified Volterra equation and its master symmetry are constructed. We demonstrate the use of these symmetries to reduce the potential KdV equation, leading to a noncommutative discrete Painlev{\`{e}} equation and to a system of partial differential equations that generalises the Ernst equation and the Neugebauer--Kramer involution. Additionally, we present a Darboux transformation and an auto-B\"acklund transformation for the Hirota KdV equation, and establish their connection with the noncommutative Yang--Baxter map $F_{III}$.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Induced Temporal Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified theoretical framework, Measurement-Induced Temporal Geometry (MTG), in which time, causality, and spacetime geometry emerge from quantum measurement acting on a fiber-valued internal time field. Each spacetime point supports a local degree of freedom $\tau$, modeled as a smooth section of a fiber bundle $\pi: E \to M$, with projection events $\mu[\tau]$ generating classical temporal flow. Quantum coherence and entanglement are encoded in the curvature $F = \nabla^2$ of a connection on the time-fiber, while the effective spacetime metric $g_{\mu\nu}^{\mathrm{eff}}$ arises as an integral over measurement histories. We derive the dynamical equations governing $\tau$, its supersymmetric completions, and the entanglement connection $A_\mu$, showing how quantization proceeds via both canonical and path-integral methods. Standard Model fields couple covariantly to the fiber geometry, and gravitational dynamics emerge from variational principles over projection-induced entropy. Cosmological inflation, dark energy, and large-scale structure are reinterpreted as consequences of modular coherence, topological obstruction, and fluctuations in the projection density $\rho(x)$. Within the AdS/CFT correspondence, MTG reinterprets modular Hamiltonians as boundary projections of bulk time flow and identifies entanglement wedges with surfaces minimizing measurement-induced projection current. A UV-complete embedding arises through string theory, where $\tau$ descends from compactified moduli and projection corresponds to brane interaction and spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. The framework yields a set of falsifiable predictions, including CMB anisotropies, black hole ringdown echoes, and modular deviations in lab-scale quantum systems, offering a consistent and testable account of spacetime as an emergent property of quantum measurement.</description>

      <title>Exceptional point rings and $PT$-symmetry in the non-Hermitian XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The XY spin chain is a paradigmatic example of a model solved by free fermions, in which the energy eigenspectrum is built from combinations of quasi-energies. In this article we show that by extending the XY model's anisotropy parameter $\lambda$ to complex values, it is possible for two of the quasi-energies to become degenerate. In the non-Hermitian XY model these quasi-energy degeneracies give rise to exceptional points (EPs) where two of the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. The distinct $\lambda$ values at which EPs appear form concentric rings in the complex plane which are shown in the infinite system size limit to converge to the unit circle coinciding with the boundary between distinct topological phases. The non-Hermitian model is also seen to possess a line of broken $PT$ symmetry along the pure imaginary $\lambda$-axis. For finite systems, there are four EP values on this broken $PT$-symmetric line if the system size is a multiple of 4.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions to the Klein--Gordon Equation via Reduction Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduction algebras (also known as generalized Mickelsson algebras, Zhelobenko algebras, or transvector algebras) are well-studied associative algebras appearing in the representation theory of Lie algebras. In the 1990s, Zhelobenko noted that reduction algebras have a connection to field equations from physics, whereas Howe's study of dual pairs in the 1980s signifes that the link originated even earlier. In this paper, we revisit the simplest case of a scalar field, working in arbitrary spacetime dimension $n\ge 3$, and in arbitrary flat metric $\eta_{ab}$. We recall that the field equations specialize to the homogeneous Laplace equation and the (massless) Klein--Gordon equation for appropriate metrics; correspondingly, there is a representation of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ (technically, $\mathfrak{sp}_2$) by differential operators and an associated reduction algebra. The reduction algebra contains raising operators, which provide a means to construct bosonic states $|a_1a_2\cdots a_\ell\rangle$ as certain degree $\ell$ polynomials solving the relevant field equation. We give an explicit formula for these solutions and prove that they span the polynomial part of the solution space. We also give a complete presentation of the reduction algebra and compute the inner product between the bosonic states in terms of the rational dynamical R-matrix.</description>

      <title>Geometry-induced Coulomb-like potential in helically twisted quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Schr\"odinger equation in a three-dimensional helically twisted space characterized by a non-trivial torsion parameter. By applying exact separation of variables, we derive the radial equation governing the dynamics of quantum particles in this geometric background. Remarkably, the intrinsic coupling between angular and longitudinal momenta induced by the torsion gives rise to an attractive Coulomb-like potential term that emerges purely from the underlying geometry, without introducing any external fields or interactions. We obtain exact analytical solutions for the bound states, including both the energy spectrum and the normalized wave functions. Numerical calculations are also performed, and excellent agreement with the exact results is found. The interplay between the torsion parameter and the effective Coulomb-like interaction is analyzed in detail, showing how geometric deformation generates novel quantum confinement mechanisms in twisted spaces.</description>

      <title>Retraction Dynamics of a Highly Viscous Liquid Sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional capillary-driven retraction of a finite, planar liquid sheet in the asymptotic regime where both the Ohnesorge number $\mathrm{Oh}$ and the initial length-to-thickness ratio $l_0/h_0$ are large. In this regime, the fluid domain decomposes into two regions: a thin-film region governed by one-dimensional mass and momentum equations, and a small tip region near the free edge described by a self-similar Stokes flow. Asymptotic matching between these regions yields an effective boundary condition for the thin-film region, representing a balance between viscous and capillary forces at the free edge. Surface tension drives the thin-film flow only through this boundary condition, while the local momentum balance is dominated by viscous and inertial stresses. We show that the thin-film flow possesses a conserved quantity, reducing the equation of thickness to heat equation with time-dependent boundary conditions. The reduced problem depends on a single dimensionless parameter $\mathcal{L} = l_0 / (4 h_0 \mathrm{Oh})$. Numerical solutions of the reduced model agree well with previous studies and reveal that the sheet undergoes distinct retraction regimes depending on $\mathcal{L}$ and a dimensionless time after rupture $T$. We derive asymptotic approximations for the thickness profile, velocity profile, and retraction speed during the early and late stages of retraction. At early times, the retraction speed grows as $T^{1/2}$, while at late times it decays as $1/T^2$. An intermediate regime arises for very long sheets ($\mathcal{L} \gg 1$). During this phase, the retraction speed approaches the Taylor-Culick value. When $T \approx \mathcal{L}$, the speed undergoes fast deceleration from the Taylor-Culick speed to late-time asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological quantum mechanics II: deducing the formalism from experimental observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an exercise in which one attempts to deduce the formalism of quantum mechanics solely from phenomenological observations. The only assumed inputs are the multi-time probability distributions estimated from the results of sequential measurements of quantum observables; no presuppositions about the underlying mathematical structures are permitted. In the concluding Part II of the paper, we carry out the deduction of the formalism from the phenomenological inputs described in Part I. We show that the resulting formalism exhibits an affinity with Hilbert spaces, and we derive an explicit representation in terms of those mathematical structures. Analogues of the obtained elementary building blocks -- such as projection operators -- are readily identifiable within the standard formalism. However, once these building blocks are assembled according to the blueprint of the deduced bi-trajectory formalism, it becomes evident that the new and the standard formalisms differ substantially at the conceptual level. These differences do not negate the fact that both formalisms are in perfect agreement with respect to empirically testable predictions. Rather, the emergence of a novel, non-standard formulation should be seen as a relatively rare opportunity to reassess, from a fresh perspective, some of the long-standing foundational issues in the theory. The hope is that the new approach may prove more successful in addressing problems that have resisted resolution within the established theoretical framework.</description>

      <title>Blowing-up the edge: connection formulae and stability chart of the Lam\'e equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study periodic spectral problems through their connection with supersymmetric gauge theories and two-dimensional conformal field theory. To characterize the associated stability chart, we develop a novel and systematic approach for analyzing semi-classical Virasoro blocks near their poles. Via the AGT correspondence, these blocks correspond to SU(2) Nekrasov partition functions in the Nekrasov-Shatashvili limit, which we propose to resum using an appropriate limit of blow-up equations. We show that the analytic structure of the resulting resummed partition functions features branch cuts located precisely at the edges between bands and gaps in the spectrum of the associated quantum integrable system with periodic potential. We examine the Nekrasov partition functions of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SQCD with $N_f \le 4$ flavors and of the $\mathcal{N}=2^*$ theory, which are related to the Heun equation, its confluent forms, and the Lam\'e equation. In the latter case, we analyze the spectrum in detail and solve the associated connection problem. Finally, we compare our results with those obtained via isomonodromic deformation techniques and the computation of orbifold surface defect partition functions in the $\mathcal{N}=2^*$ gauge theory, finding perfect agreement.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Open Quantum Dynamics and Isomorphism to Superconformal Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the Lie algebraic structure of a physical problem often makes it easier to find its solution. In this paper, we focus on the Lie algebra of Gaussian-conserving superoperators. We construct a Lie algebra of $n$-mode states, $\mathfrak{go}(n)$, composed of all superoperators conserving Gaussianity, and we find it isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^{2n^2+3n}\oplus_{\mathrm{S}}\mathfrak{gl}(2n,\mathbb{R})$. This allows us to solve the quadratic-order Redfield equation for any, even non-Gaussian, state. We find that the algebraic structure of Gaussian operations is the same as that of super-Poincar\'e algebra in three-dimensional spacetime, where the CPTP condition corresponds to the combination of causality and directionality of time flow. Additionally, we find that a bosonic density matrix satisfies both the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac equations. Finally, we expand the algebra of Gaussian superoperators even further by relaxing the CPTP condition. We find that it is isomorphic to a superconformal algebra, which represents the maximal symmetry of the field theory. This suggests a deeper connection between two seemingly unrelated fields, with the potential to transform problems from one domain into another where they may be more easily solved.</description>

      <title>Paired Explicit Relaxation Runge-Kutta Methods: Entropy-Conservative and Entropy-Stable High-Order Optimized Multirate Time Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present novel entropy-conservative and entropy-stable multirate Runge-Kutta methods based on Paired Explicit Runge-Kutta (P-ERK) with relaxation for conservation laws and related systems of partial differential equations. Optimized schemes up to fourth-order of accuracy are derived and validated in terms of order of consistency, conservation of linear invariants, and entropy conservation/stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these P-ERRK methods when combined with a high-order, entropy-conservative/stable discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method on unstructured meshes. The Paired Explicit Relaxation Runge-Kutta methods(P-ERRK) are readily implemented for partitioned semidiscretizations arising from problems with equation-based scale separation such as non-uniform meshes. We highlight that the relaxation approach acts as a time-limiting technique which improves the nonlinear stability and thus robustness of the multirate schemes. The P-ERRK methods are applied to a range of problems, ranging from compressible Euler over compressible Navier-Stokes to the visco-resistive magnetohydrodynamics equations in two and three spatial dimensions. For each test case, we compare computational load and runtime to standalone relaxed Runge-Kutta methods which are outperformed by factors up to four. All results can be reproduced using a publicly available repository.</description>

      <title>The Cauchy Problem for Symmetric Hyperbolic Systems with Nonlocal Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the initial value problem for symmetric hyperbolic systems on globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds with potentials that are both nonlocal in time and space. When the potential is retarded and uniformly bounded in time, we establish well-posedness of the Cauchy problem on a time strip, proving existence, uniqueness, and regularity of solutions. If the potential is not retarded but has only short time range, we show that strong solutions still exist, under the additional assumptions that the uniform bound in time is sufficiently small compared to the range in time and that its kernel decays sufficiently fast in time with respect to the zero-order terms of the system. Furthermore, we present a counterexample demonstrating that when the uniform bound is too large compared to the time range, solutions may fail to exist. As an application, we discuss Maxwell's equations in linear dispersive media on ultrastatic spacetimes, as well as the Dirac equation with nonlocal potential naturally arising in the theory of causal fermion systems. Our paper aims to represent the starting point for a rigorous study for the Cauchy problem for the semiclassical Einstein equations.</description>

Abstract: We compute the correlation of analytic functions of general Gaussian fields in terms of multigraphs and Feynman diagrams on the lattice Z^d. Then, we connect its scaling limit to tensors of the correlation functionals of Fock space fields. Afterwards, we investigate the relation with fermionic Gaussian field states for even functions. For instance, we characterize the correlation functionals of the exponential of a continuous Gaussian Free Field or general analytic functions of fractional Gaussian fields as limits of quantities constructed via a sequences of discrete fields. Finally, we show that the duality between even powers of bosonic Gaussian fields and "complex" fermionic Gaussian fields can be reformulated in terms of a principal minors assignment problem of the corresponding covariance matrices.</description>

      <title>Neumann scalar determinants on constant curvature disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working in the $\zeta$-function regularisation scheme, we find certain infinite series representations of the logarithms of massive scalar determinants, $\det(\Delta+m^{2})$ for arbitrary $m^2$, on finite round disks of constant curvature ($R=\frac{2\eta}{L^2}, \eta=0,\pm1$) with Neumann boundary conditions. The derivation of these representations relies on a relation between the Neumann determinants on the disks and the corresponding Dirichlet determinants via the determinants of the Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps on the boundaries of the disks. We corroborate the results in an appendix by computing the Neumann determinants in an alternative way. In the cases of disks with nonzero curvatures, we show that the infinite series representations reduce to exact expressions for some specific values of $m^2$, viz. $m^2=-\frac{\eta}{L^2}q(q+1)$ with $q\in \mathbb{N}$. Our analysis uses and extends the results obtained in arXiv:2405.14958 for similar Dirichlet determinants on constant curvature disks.</description>

      <title>The Landau equation and Fisher information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this expository note (submitted to Notices of the AMS) we present the ideas used in our recent work ruling out blow up for the Landau equation with Coulomb potential. Blow up is ruled out by the discovery that the Fisher information is not increasing in time along a solution. This monotonicity is established by means of a new ``lifted equation'' which is an auxiliary linear equation in double the number of variables that encodes the nonlinear nonlocal collision operator. For the Landau equation in particular this lifted equation amounts to a family of heat equations over the sphere. Some background on kinetic equations and the Fisher information, and connections to Bakry-Emery theory is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Existence of Schrodinger Evolution with Absorbing Boundary Condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:1912.12057v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a non-relativistic quantum particle with wave function inside a region $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^3$, and suppose that detectors are placed along the boundary $\partial \Omega$. The question how to compute the probability distribution of the time at which the detector surface registers the particle boils down to finding a reasonable mathematical definition of an ideal detecting surface; a particularly convincing definition, called the \emph{absorbing boundary rule}, involves a time evolution for the particle's wave function $\psi$ expressed by a Schr\"odinger equation in $\Omega$ together with an ``absorbing'' boundary condition on $\partial \Omega$ first considered by Werner in 1987, viz., $\partial \psi/\partial n=i\kappa\psi$ with $\kappa&gt;0$ and $\partial/\partial n$ the normal derivative. We provide here a discussion of the rigorous mathematical foundation of this rule. First, for the viability of the rule it plays a crucial role that these two equations together uniquely define the time evolution of $\psi$; we point out here how, under some technical assumptions on the regularity (i.e., smoothness) of the detecting surface, the Lumer-Phillips theorem implies that the time evolution is well defined and given by a contraction semigroup. Second, we show that the collapse required for the $N$-particle version of the problem is well defined. We also prove that the joint distribution of the detection times and places, according to the absorbing boundary rule, is governed by a positive-operator-valued measure.</description>

      <title>Field Theory via Higher Geometry I: Smooth Sets of Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most modern theoretical considerations of the physical world suggest that nature is: (1) field-theoretic, (2) smooth, (3) local, (4) gauged, (5) containing fermions, and (6) non-perturbative. Tautologous as this may sound to experts, it is remarkable that the mathematical notion of geometry which reflects all of these aspects - namely, ``supergeometric homotopy theory'' - has received little attention. Elaborate algebraic machinery is known for perturbative field theories both at the classical and quantum level, but to tackle the deep open questions of the subject, these will need to be lifted to a global geometry of physics.
  Our aim in this series is to introduce inclined physicists to this theory, to fill mathematical gaps in the existing literature, and to rigorously develop the full power of supergeometric homotopy theory and apply it to the analysis of fermionic (not necessarily super-symmetric) field theories. Secondarily, this will also lead to a streamlined and rigorous perspective we hope would also be desirable to mathematicians.
  In this first part, we explain how classical bosonic Lagrangian field theory (variational Euler-Lagrange theory) finds a natural home in the ``topos of smooth sets'', thereby neatly setting the scene for the higher supergeometry discussed in later parts of the series. This introductory material will be largely known to a few experts but has never been comprehensively laid out before. A key technical point we make is to regard jet bundle geometry systematically in smooth sets instead of just its subcategories of diffeological spaces or even Fr{\'e}chet manifolds -- or worse simply as a formal object. Besides being more transparent and powerful, it is only on this backdrop that a reasonable supergeometric jet geometry exists, needed for satisfactory discussion of any field theory with fermions.</description>

Abstract: We repeat, using methods developed for BKM systems, the famous results of S. Novikov (1974), J. Moser (1981, 1982) , and A. Veselov (1980) that relate Schr\"odinger-Hill operators with finite-band spectra, solutions of the Neumann system, and certain solutions of the KdV equations. Our general motivation is to determine whether it is possible to apply inverse scattering methods to BKM systems, and in the conclusion, we indicate initial observations in this direction.</description>

      <title>Local Boundary Conditions for Dirac-type operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Dirac-type operators on manifolds with boundary, and set out to determine all local smooth boundary conditions that give rise to (strongly) regular self-adjoint operators. By combining the general theory of boundary value problems for Dirac operators as in [BB12] and pointwise considerations, for local smooth boundary conditions the question of being self-adjoint resp. regular is fully translated into linear-algebraic language at each boundary point. We analyse these conditions and classify them in low dimensions and ranks. In particular, we classify all local self-adjoint regular boundary conditions for Dirac spinors (four spinor components) in dimensions $3$ and $4$. With the same techniques we can also treat transmission boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: We present a new approach to the problem of proving global stability, based on symplectic geometry and with a focus on systems with several conserved quantities. We also provide a proof of instability for integrable systems whose momentum map is everywhere regular. Our results take root in the recently proposed notion of a confining function and are motivated by ghost-ridden systems, for whom we put forward the first geometric definition.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and analyze a new geometric structure on topological surfaces generalizing the complex structure. To define this so called higher complex structure we use the punctual Hilbert scheme of the plane. The moduli space of higher complex structures is defined and is shown to be a generalization of the classical Teichm\"uller space. We give arguments for the conjectural isomorphism between the moduli space of higher complex structures and Hitchin's component.</description>

      <title>Sharp Thresholds for the Overlap Gap Property: Ising $p$-Spin Glass and Random $k$-SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Ising $p$-spin glass and random $k$-SAT are two canonical examples of disordered systems that play a central role in understanding the link between geometric features of optimization landscapes and computational tractability. Both models exhibit hard regimes where all known polynomial-time algorithms fail and possess the multi Overlap Gap Property ($m$-OGP), an intricate geometrical property that rigorously rules out a broad class of algorithms exhibiting input stability.
  We establish that, in both models, the symmetric $m$-OGP undergoes a sharp phase transition, and we pinpoint its exact threshold. For the Ising $p$-spin glass, our results hold for all sufficiently large $p$; for the random $k$-SAT, they apply to all $k$ growing mildly with the number of Boolean variables. Notably, our findings yield qualitative insights into the power of OGP-based arguments. A particular consequence for the Ising $p$-spin glass is that the strength of the $m$-OGP in establishing algorithmic hardness grows without bound as $m$ increases.
  These are the first sharp threshold results for the $m$-OGP. Our analysis hinges on a judicious application of the second moment method, enhanced by concentration. While a direct second moment calculation fails, we overcome this via a refined approach that leverages an argument of~\cite{frieze1990independence} and exploiting concentration properties of carefully constructed random variables.</description>

Abstract: We prove the tightness of a natural approximation scheme for an analog of the Liouville quantum gravity metric on $\mathbb R^d$ for arbitrary $d\geq 2$. More precisely, let $\{h_n\}_{n\geq 1}$ be a suitable sequence of Gaussian random functions which approximates a log-correlated Gaussian field on $\mathbb R^d$. Consider the family of random metrics on $\mathbb R^d$ obtained by weighting the lengths of paths by $e^{\xi h_n}$, where $\xi &gt; 0$ is a parameter. We prove that if $\xi$ belongs to the subcritical phase (which is defined by the condition that the distance exponent $Q(\xi)$ is greater than $\sqrt{2d}$), then after appropriate re-scaling, these metrics are tight and that every subsequential limit is a metric on $\mathbb R^d$ which induces the Euclidean topology. We include a substantial list of open problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1983, Feingold and Frenkel discovered a relation between Siegel modular forms of genus two and a rank-three hyperbolic Kac--Moody algebra extending the affine Lie algebra of type $A_1$. It inspires a problem to explore more general relations between affine Lie algebras, hyperbolic Kac--Moody algebras and modular forms. In this paper, we give an automorphic answer to this problem. We classify hyperbolic Borcherds--Kac--Moody superalgebras whose super-denominators define reflective automorphic products of singular weight on lattices of type $2U\oplus L$. As a consequence, we prove that there are exactly $81$ affine Lie algebras $\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$ which have extensions to hyperbolic BKM superalgebras for which the leading Fourier--Jacobi coefficients of super-denominators coincide with the denominators of $\widehat{\mathfrak{g}}$. We find that $69$ of them appear in Schellekens' list of semi-simple $V_1$ structures of holomorphic CFT of central charge $24$, while $8$ of them correspond to the $N=1$ structures of holomorphic SCFT of central charge $12$ composed of $24$ chiral fermions. The last $4$ cases are related to exceptional modular invariants from nontrivial automorphisms of fusion algebras. This clarifies the relationship of affine Lie algebras, vertex algebras and hyperbolic BKM superalgebras at the level of modular forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06696v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show the variational convergence of an irreversible Markov jump process describing a finite stochastic particle system to the solution of a countable infinite system of deterministic time-inhomogeneous quadratic differential equations known as the exchange-driven growth model, which has two conserved quantities. As a bounded perturbation of the reversible kernel, the variational formulation is a generalization of the gradient flow formulation of the reversible process and can be interpreted as the large deviation functional of the Markov jump process. As a consequence of the variational convergence result, we show the propagation of chaos of the Markov processes to the limiting equation and the $\Gamma$-convergence of the energy functional. The latter convergence is consistent with related results for reversible coagulation-fragmentation equations and reveals the connection of stochastic processes to the long-time condensation phenomena in the limit equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06711v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A cryptographic compiler introduced by Kalai et al. (STOC'23) converts any nonlocal game into an interactive protocol with a single computationally bounded prover. Although the compiler is known to be sound in the case of classical provers and complete in the quantum case, quantum soundness has so far only been established for special classes of games. In this work, we establish a quantum soundness result for all compiled two-player nonlocal games. In particular, we prove that the quantum commuting operator value of the underlying nonlocal game is an upper bound on the quantum value of the compiled game. Our result employs techniques from operator algebras in a computational and cryptographic setting to establish information-theoretic objects in the asymptotic limit of the security parameter. It further relies on a sequential characterization of quantum commuting operator correlations which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a flat extension of a connection $\theta$ on a principal bundle. Roughly speaking, $\theta$ admits a flat extension if it arises as the pull-back of a component of a Maurer-Cartan form. For trivial bundles over closed oriented $3$-manifolds, we relate the existence of certain flat extensions to the vanishing of the Chern-Simons invariant associated with $\theta$. As an application, we recover the obstruction of Chern-Simons for the existence of a conformal immersion of a Riemannian $3$-manifold into Euclidean $4$-space. In addition, we obtain corresponding statements for a Lorentzian $3$-manifold, as well as a global obstruction for the existence of an equiaffine immersion into $\mathbb{R}^4$ of a $3$-manifold that is equipped with a torsion-free connection preserving a volume form.</description>

Abstract: We propose an exercise in which one attempts to deduce the formalism of quantum mechanics solely from phenomenological observations. The only assumed inputs are obtained through sequential probing of quantum systems; no presuppositions about the underlying mathematical structures are permitted. We demonstrate that it is indeed possible to derive, on this basis, a complete and fully functional formalism rooted in the structures of Hilbert spaces. However, the resulting formalism--the bi-trajectory formalism--differs significantly from the standard state-focused formulation. In Part I of the paper, we analyze the outcomes of various experiments involving sequential measurements of quantum observables. These outcomes are quantitatively described by phenomenological multi-time probability distributions, estimated from experimental data. Our first conclusion is that the theory describing these experiments must be non-classical: the measured sequences cannot be interpreted as sampling of a uni-trajectory representing the system's observable. The non-classical nature of the investigated systems manifests in a range of observed phenomena, including quantum interference, the quantum Zeno effect, and uncertainty relations between the measured observables.</description>

      <title>The multimode conditional quantum Entropy Power Inequality and the squashed entanglement of the multimode extreme bosonic Gaussian channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the multimode conditional quantum Entropy Power Inequality for bosonic quantum systems. This inequality determines the minimum conditional von Neumann entropy of the output of the most general linear mixing of bosonic quantum modes among all the input states of the modes with given conditional entropies. Bosonic quantum systems constitute the mathematical model for the electromagnetic radiation in the quantum regime, which provides the most promising platform for quantum communication and quantum key distribution. We apply our multimode conditional quantum Entropy Power Inequality to determine new lower bounds to the squashed entanglement of a large family of bosonic Gaussian states. The squashed entanglement is one of the main entanglement measures in quantum communication theory, providing the best known upper bound to the distillable key. Exploiting this result, we determine a new lower bound to the squashed entanglement of the multimode bosonic Gaussian channels that are extreme, i.e., that cannot be decomposed as a non-trivial convex combination of quantum channels. The squashed entanglement of a quantum channel provides an upper bound to its secret-key capacity, i.e., the capacity to generate a secret key shared between the sender and the receiver. Lower bounds to the squashed entanglement are notoriously hard to prove. Our results contribute to break this barrier and will stimulate further research in the field of quantum communication with bosonic quantum systems.</description>

      <title>The transition from homeostasis to stochasticity induced catastrophe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: What are the signatures of the onset of catastrophe? Here we present the rich system physics characterizing the transition from homeostasis to stochasticity driven breakdown in an experimentally motivated minimal model. Recent high-precision experiments on individual bacterial cells, growing and dividing repeatedly in a variety of environments, have revealed a previously unknown intergenerational scaling law which not only uniquely determines the stochastic map governing homeostasis, but also, as we show here, offers quantitative insights into the transition from the "conspiracy principle" regime (homeostasis) to the "catastrophe principle" regime and then to system breakdown. In fact, upon closer examination, the stochastic map turns out to be a one-dimensional Kesten process; these transitions occur as a single parameter, the strength of the multiplicative noise term, is continuously tuned. Emergence of asymptotically scale invariant distributions with quantifiable power law tails, outlier driven extremal behavior and reverse monotonicity of the conditional exceedance distribution characterize this transition to catastrophe. In turn, prevention of rapid increase in the extremal event-driven rate of failure, in the interest of system preservation, causes the catastrophe regime to be strategically unfavorable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A basic question about the directed landscape is how much of it can be reconstructed simply by knowing the shapes of its geodesics. We prove that the directed landscape can be reconstructed from the shapes of its semi-infinite geodesics. In order to show this result, we make use of the Busemann process of the directed landscape together with a novel ``coordinate system" and ``differential distance" to capture the behaviour of semi-infinite geodesics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Theoretical results on water waves almost always start by assuming irrotationality of the flow in order to simplify the formulation. In this work, we investigate the well-foundedness of this hypothesis via numerical simulations of the free-surface Navier-Stokes equation. We show that, in the presence of a non-flat bottom, a gravity wave can shed vortex pairs, or modons, from the bottom boundary layer into the bulk flow. As these eddies approach the free surface they modify the shape of the wave. It is found that this perturbation is singular and does not vanish with the viscosity.</description>

      <title>A Unified Hamiltonian Formulation for Energy Loss, Entropy Evolution, and Fusion Performance in Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive Hamiltonian formulation for plasma dynamics that unifies collisionless gyrokinetic and collisional processes. Our framework rigorously describes the evolution of free energy and entropy during the transition from Maxwellian to non-Maxwellian distributions, explicitly coupling microscopic turbulent processes with macroscopic measures of energy confinement and fusion performance. Unlike standard gyrokinetic treatments that treat collisions as a minor perturbation, our approach incorporates a collision operator directly into the Hamiltonian structure, thereby accounting for irreversible dissipation and entropy production. We derive quantitative relations linking turbulence intensity, entropy production, energy confinement time and fusion yield. Our work builds on recent energetic bounds and optimal mode analyses by Helander and Plunk and on Zhdankin's generalised entropy-production framework, thus providing a bridge between microscopic kinetics and reactor-scale performance.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnets from higher $SU(N)$ representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general formalism for deriving the thermodynamics of ferromagnets consisting of "atoms" carrying an arbitrary irreducible representation of $SU(N)$ and coupled through long-range two-body quadratic interactions. Using this formalism, we derive the thermodynamics and phase structure of ferromagnets with atoms in the doubly symmetric or doubly antisymmetric irreducible representations. The symmetric representation leads to a paramagnetic and a ferromagnetic phase with transitions similar to the ones for the fundamental representation studied before. The antisymmetric representation presents qualitatively new features, leading to a paramagnetic and two distinct ferromagnetic phases that can coexist over a range of temperatures, two of them becoming metastable. Our results are relevant to magnetic systems of atoms with reduced symmetry in their interactions compared to the fundamental case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15784v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On any complex smooth projective curve with positive genus, we construct Hilbert bundles that admit Hermitian--Einstein metrics. Our main constructive step is by investigating the arithmetic property of the upper half plane in Bridgeland's definition of stability conditions
  and its homological countparts. The main analytic ingredient in our proof is a notion called a well-approximating sequence of stable bundles. This notion helps us to apply the Diophantine approximation to Donaldson's functional and bound the $L^\infty$ norm of Hermitian-Einstein metrics. We further study the continuous structures, smooth structures, and holomorphic structures on such Hilbert bundles. We hope that this construction can shed some new light on the geometric background of quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Avoiding Big Rip Singularities in Phantom Scalar Field theory with Gauss-Bonnet term</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18392v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a phantom scalar field coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet scalar within a spatially flat FLRW geometry. Moreover, we assume a nonzero interaction between the scalar field and the matter term. We perform a detailed phase space analysis using two sets of dimensionless variables. Specifically, we introduce dimensionless variables based on the Hubble normalization approach and a new set based on the matter-scalar field normalization. These two sets of variables allow for a comprehensive phase space analysis. This model supports inflationary solutions without the Big Rip or Big Crunch singularities appearing as asymptotic solutions. This outcome is attributed to the presence of the Gauss-Bonnet scalar. The result remains valid even in the absence of the interaction term.</description>

      <title>A unified approach to hypergeometric class functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergeometric class equations are given by second
  order differential operators in one variable whose coefficient at the second derivative
  is a polynomial of degree $\leq2$, at the first derivative of degree
  $\leq1$ and the free term is a number. Their solutions, called hypergeometric class functions, include the Gauss hypergeometric function and its various limiting cases. The paper presents a unified approach to these functions. The main structure behind this approach is a family of complex 4-dimensional Lie algebras, originally due to Willard Miller. Hypergeometric class functions can be interpreted as eigenfunctions of the quadratic Casimir operator in a representation of Miller's Lie algebra given by differential operators in three complex variables. One obtains a unified treatment of various properties of hypergeometric class functions such as recurrence relations, discrete symmetries, power series expansions, integral representations, generating functions and orthogonality of polynomial solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In integrable spin chains, the spectral problem can be solved by the method of Bethe ansatz, which transforms the problem of diagonalization of the Hamiltonian into the problem of solving a set of algebraic equations named Bethe equations. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin-$s$ XXX chain with twisted and open boundary conditions using the rational $Q$-system, which is a powerful tool to solve Bethe equations. We establish basic frameworks of the rational $Q$-system and confirm its completeness numerically in both cases. For twisted boundaries, we investigate the polynomiality conditions of the rational $Q$-system and derive physical conditions for singular solutions of Bethe equations. For open boundaries, we uncover novel phenomena such as hidden symmetries and magnetic strings under specific boundary parameters. Hidden symmetries lead to the appearance of extra degeneracies in the Hilbert space, while the magnetic string is a novel type of exact string configuration, whose length depends on the boundary magnetic fields. These findings, supported by both analytical and numerical evidences, offer new insights into the interplay between symmetries and boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Inverse scattering transform for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with local and nonlocal nonlinearities under non-zero boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of the Riemann-Hilbert problem, the theory of inverse scattering transform is established for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with local and nonlocal nonlinearities (which originates from the parity-symmetric reduction of the Manakov system) under non-zero boundary conditions. First, the adjoint Lax pair and auxiliary eigenfunctions are introduced for the direct scattering, and the analyticity, symmetries of eigenfunctions and scattering matrix are studied in detail. Then, the distribution of discrete eigenvalues is examined, and the asymptotic behaviors of the eigenfunctions and scattering coefficients are analyzed rigorously. Compared with the Manakov system, the reverse-space nonlocality introduces an additional symmetry, leading to stricter constraints on eigenfunctions, scattering coefficients and norming constants. Further, the Riemann-Hilbert problem is formulated for the the inverse problem with the scattering coefficients admitting an arbitrary number of simple zeros. For the reflectionless case, the N-soliton solutions are presented in the determinant form. With N=1, the dark and beating one-soliton solutions are obtained, which are respectively associated with a pair of discrete eigenvalues lying on and off the circle on the spectrum plane. Via the asymptotic analysis, the two-soliton solutions are found to admit the interactions between two dark solitons or two beating solitons, as well as the superpositions of two beating solitons or one beating soliton and one dark soliton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss kinetic-based particle optimization methods and variable-sample strategies for problems where the cost function represents the expected value of a random mapping. Kinetic-based optimization methods rely on a consensus mechanism targeting the global minimizer, and they exploit tools of kinetic theory to establish a rigorous framework for proving convergence to that minimizer. Variable-sample strategies replace the expected value by an approximation at each iteration of the optimization algorithm. We combine these approaches and introduce a novel algorithm based on instantaneous collisions governed by a linear Boltzmann-type equation. After proving the convergence of the resulting kinetic method under appropriate parameter constraints, we establish a connection to a recently introduced consensus-based method for solving the random problem in a suitable scaling. Finally, we showcase its enhanced computational efficiency compared to the aforementioned algorithm and validate the consistency of the proposed modeling approaches through several numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: We explore the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition problem for an operator field in small dimensions. In dimensions three and four, we find tensorial conditions for an operator field $L$, similar to a nilpotent Jordan block, to possess local coordinates in which $L$ takes a strictly upper triangular form.

      <description>arXiv:2503.16182v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the study of higher-form-symmetries to theories with supersymmetry. Using a supergeometry formulation, we find that ordinary higher-form-symmetries nicely combine with supersymmetry to give rise to a much larger spectrum of topological conserved (super)currents. These can be classified as a supersymmetric version of Chern-Weil symmetries, and a brand new set of geometric-Chern-Weil symmetries whose generators are constructed using invariant differential forms in super-manifolds. For N=1 super-Maxwell theory in various dimensions, we build the topological operators generating these super-higher-form symmetries and construct defects carrying non-trivial charges. Notably, the charge is proportional to the super-linking number between the super-hypersurface supporting the symmetry generator and the one supporting the defect.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08887v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although high-threshold and low-overhead quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes, such as bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, can reduce the physical-qubit cost by an order of magnitude compared to the Kitaev toric code, their torus layout remains difficult for physical implementation. In this work, we introduce the first systematic procedure to convert BB codes into fully planar, open-boundary qLDPC codes, preserving their performance. We present planar code families with logical dimensions $k=6\sim13$, e.g., $[[78, 6, 6]]$, $[[107, 7, 7]]$, $[[268, 8, 12]]$, $[[405, 9, 15]]$, $[[348, 10, 13]]$, $[[450, 11, 15]]$, $[[386, 12, 12]]$, $[[362, 13, 11]]$, all with geometrically local weight-6 stabilizers. Allowing weight-8 stabilizers produces a $[[282,12,14]]$ code, exhibiting an efficiency metric ($kd^2/n$) an order of magnitude higher than the surface code. The construction combines boundary anyon condensation with the ``lattice grafting'' optimization, yielding high-performance qLDPC codes natively compatible with planar hardware architectures. It also uncovers Sierpinski-type fractal logical operators whose distance scales with the fractal area on finite lattices. These planar qLDPC codes provide an implementable route to resource-efficient, high-threshold fault tolerance and a flexible framework for future code design on realistic two-dimensional hardware.</description>

      <title>Self-duality and the Holomorphic Ansatz in Generalized BPS Skyrme Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the BPS Skyrme model for simple compact Lie groups $G$ that leads to Hermitian symmetric spaces. In such a theory, the Skyrme field takes its values in $G$, while the remaining fields correspond to the entries of a symmetric, positive, and invertible $\dim G \times \dim G$-dimensional matrix $h$. We also use the holomorphic map ansatz between $S^2 \rightarrow G/H \times U(1)$ to study the self-dual sector of the theory, which generalizes the holomorphic ansatz between $S^2 \rightarrow CP^N$. This ansatz is constructed using the fact that stable harmonic maps of the two $S^2$ spheres for compact Hermitian symmetric spaces are holomorphic or anti-holomorphic. Apart from some special cases, the self-duality equations do not fix the matrix $h$ entirely in terms of the Skyrme field, which is completely free, as it happens in the original self-dual Skyrme model for $G=SU(2)$. In general, the freedom of the $h$ fields tend to grow with the dimension of $G$. The holomorphic ansatz enable us to construct an infinite number of exact self-dual Skyrmions for each integer value of the topological charge and for each value of $N \geq 1$, in case of the $CP^N$, and for each values of $p,\,q\geq 1$ in case of $SU(p+q)/SU(p)\otimes SU(q)\otimes U(1)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The helicity operator of massless particles has only two polarisations like it takes place for photons and gravitons. For them not all of the 2s+1 spin magnetic quantum states exist, with two exceptions, and the spin operator ceases to be defined properly and consistently. The problem was solved by Schwinger, who introduced non-commutative space coordinates that completely eliminate the spin operator and ensure that only helicity operator appears explicitly. We further investigate the violation of the associativity relation of the momentum translation operator that emerges due to the failure of the corresponding Jacobi identity. The associativity relation is broken by a phase factor which satisfies a 3-cocycle relation. The associativity is restored when a 3-cocycle is an integer number, and leads to the quantisation of massless particle's helicity. We discuss the correspondence (duality) between the helicity and the Dirac quantisation conditions. The relation for the minimal space cell volume, similar to the minimal phase-space cell of Heisenberg is suggested.</description>

      <title>The Magnus expansion for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Magnus expansion offers a method to express a time-ordered exponential as an ordinary operatorial exponential. This representation has advantageous theoretical properties, while still solving the original differential equation. For any finite dimensional Hermitian Hamiltonians, the standard Magnus expansion guarantees a manifestly unitary representation. However, this property is no longer preserved if the Hamiltonian is infinite dimensional or non-Hermitian. In this work, we derive a generalized expansion that maintains the property of unitarity for all bounded finite dimensional Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Lie Group Theory of Multipole Moments and Shape of Stationary Rotating Fluid Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining the equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating, self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the classical challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating foundational theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that enhances the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method applies Lie group theory to vector flows and solves functional equations using the Neumann series. We extend Clairaut's classical linear perturbation theory into the nonlinear regime via Lie exponential mapping, yielding a system of nonlinear functional equations for gravitational potential and fluid density. These are analytically tractable using shift operators and Neumann series summation, enabling explicit characterization of density and gravitational perturbations. This leads to an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing equilibrium deformation without assuming slow rotation. We validate the framework through exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques for analyzing radial harmonics and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order nonlinear corrections efficiently. The framework includes boundary conditions for Legendre harmonics, supporting the derivation of nonlinear Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments. This work offers a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational and tidal deformations in astrophysical and planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Physical Reduced Stochastic Equations for Continuously Monitored Non-Markovian Quantum Systems with a Markovian Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An effective approach to modeling non-Markovian quantum systems is to embed a principal (quantum) system of interest into a larger quantum system. A widely employed embedding is one that uses another quantum system, referred to as the auxiliary system, which is coupled to the principal system, and both the principal and auxiliary can be coupled to quantum white noise processes. The principal and auxiliary together form a quantum Markov system and the quantum white noises act as a bath (environment) for this system. Recently it was shown that the conditional evolution of the principal system in this embedding under continuous monitoring by a travelling quantum probe can be expressed as a system of coupled stochastic differential equations (SDEs) that involve only operators of the principal system. The reduced conditional state of the principal only (conditioned on the measurement outcomes) is determined by the ``diagonal" blocks of this coupled systems of SDEs. It is shown here that the ``off-diagonal" blocks can be exactly eliminated up to their initial conditions, leaving a reduced closed system of SDEs for the diagonal blocks only. Under additional conditions the off-diagonal initial conditions can be made to vanish. This new closed system of equations, which includes an integration term involving a two-time stochastic kernel, represents the non-Markovian stochastic dynamics of the principal system under continuous-measurement. The system of equations determine the reduced conditional state of the principal only and may be viewed as a stochastic Nakajima-Zwanzig type of equation for continuously monitored non-Markovian quantum systems.</description>

      <title>On dual regime in Yang-Baxter deformed $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ sigma models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a new class of integrable sigma models, which we refer to as the "dual regime" of Yang-Baxter (YB) deformed $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ sigma models. This dual regime manifests itself in the conformal perturbation approach. Namely, it is well known that conventional YB-deformed $\mathrm{O}(N)$ sigma models are described in the UV by a collection of free bosonic fields perturbed by some relevant operators. The holomorphic parts of these operators play the role of screening operators which define certain integrable systems in the free theory. All of these integrable systems depend on a continuous parameter $b$, which parametrizes the central charge, and are known to possess the duality under $b^2\longleftrightarrow -1-b^2$. Although $\mathrm{O}(2N+1)$ integrable systems are self-dual, $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ systems are not. In particular, the $\mathrm{O}(2N)$ integrable systems provide new perturbations of the sigma model type. We identify the corresponding one-loop metric and $B-$field and show that they solve the generalized Ricci flow equation.</description>

      <title>What is a double star-product?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Double Poisson brackets, introduced by M. Van den Bergh in 2004, are noncommutative analogs of the usual Poisson brackets in the sense of the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle: they induce Poisson structures on the space of $N$-dimensional representations $\operatorname{Rep}_N(A)$ of an associative algebra $A$ for any $N$. The problem of deformation quantization of double Poisson brackets was raised by D. Calaque in 2010, and had remained open since then.
  In this paper, we address this problem by answering the question in the title. We present a structure on $A$ that induces a star-product under the representation functor and, therefore, according to the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle, can be viewed as an analog of star-products in noncommutative geometry. We also provide an explicit example for $A=\Bbbk\langle x_1,\ldots,x_d\rangle$ and prove a double formality theorem in this case. Along the way, we invert the Kontsevich-Rosenberg principle by introducing a notion of double algebra over an arbitrary operad.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Quantum Dynamics on Embedded Submanifolds: From Geometric Mass to Higgs Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07337v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a quantum dynamics framework for curved submanifolds embedded in higher-dimensional spaces. Through rigorous dimensional reduction, we derive the first complete Schr\"{o}dinger and Klein-Gordon equations incorporating non-perturbative geometric interactions-resolving ambiguities in constrained quantization. Crucially, extrinsic curvature of the ambient manifold governs emergent low-dimensional quantum phenomena. Remarkably, this mechanism generates scalar field masses matching Kaluza-Klein spectra while eliminating periodic compactification requirements. Geometric induction concurrently produces Higgs mechanism potentials. Particle masses emerge solely from submanifold embedding geometry, with matter-field couplings encoded in curvature invariants. This enables experimental access to higher-dimensional physics at all energy scales through geometric induction. We also discuss the Higgs vacuum near small-mass black holes.</description>

      <title>The multinomial dimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An $N$-dimer cover of a graph is a collection of edges (with multiplicity) such that each vertex is contained in exactly $N$ edges in the collection. The multinomial dimer model is a natural probability measure on $N$-dimer covers. We study the behavior of these measures on periodic bipartite graphs in ${\mathbb R}^d$, in the scaling limit as the multiplicity $N$ and then the size of the graph go to infinity.
  In this iterated limit, we prove a large deviation principle, where the rate function is the integral of an explicit surface tension, and show that random configurations concentrate on a limit shape which is the unique solution to an associated Euler-Lagrange equation. We further show that the associated critical gauge functions, which exist in the $N\to\infty$ limit on each finite graph, converge in the scaling limit to a limiting gauge function which solves a dual Euler-Lagrange equation.
  We use our techniques to compute explicit limit shapes in some two and three dimensional examples, such as the Aztec diamond and ``Aztec cuboid". These $3d$ examples are the first stat mech models in dimensions $d\ge3$ where limit shapes can be computed explicitly.</description>

      <title>Generalized False Vacuum Skyrme model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the False Vacuum Skyrme model for any simple compact Lie groups $G$ that leads to Hermitian symmetric spaces. The Skyrme field that in the original theory takes its values in $SU(2)$ Lie group, now takes its values in $G$, while the remaining fields correspond to the entries of a symmetric, positive, and invertible $\dim G \times \dim G$-dimensional matrix $h$. This model is also an extension of the generalized BPS Skyrme model. We prove that the global minima correspond to the $h$ fields being self-dual solutions of the generalized BPS Skyrme model, together with a particular field configuration for the Skyrme field that leads to a spherically symmetric topological charge density. As in the case of the original model, the minimization of the energy leads to the so-called reduced problem, defined in the context of false vacuum decay. This imposes a condition on the Skyrme field, which, if satisfied, makes the total energy of the global minima, as well as the main properties of the model, equivalent to those obtained for the $G=SU(2)$ case. We study this condition and its consequences within the generalized rational map ansatz and show how it can be satisfied for $G=SU(p+q)$, where $p$ and $q$ are positive integers, with the Hermitian symmetric spaces being $SU(p+q)/SU(p) \otimes SU(q) \otimes U(1)$. In such a case, the model is completely equivalent to the $G=SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model, independent of the values of $p$ and $q$. We also provide a numerical study of the baryon density, RMS radius, and binding energy per nucleon that deepens the analysis conducted for the $SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit a double-scaled limit of the superconformal index of ${\cal N}=2$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs) which generalizes the Schur index. The resulting partition function, $\hat {\cal Z}(q,\alpha)$, has a standard $q$-expansion with coefficients depending on a continuous parameter $\alpha$. The Schur index is a special case with $\alpha=1$. Through explicit computations we argue that this partition function is an invariant of certain mass deformations and vacuum expectation value (vev) deformations of the SCFT. In particular, two SCFTs residing in different corners of the same Coulomb branch, satisfying certain restrictive conditions, have the same partition function with a non-trivial map of the parameters, $\hat {\cal Z}_1(q,\alpha_1)=\hat {\cal Z}_2(q,\alpha_2(\alpha_1))$. For example, we show that the Schur index of all the SCFTs in the Deligne-Cvitanovi\'c series is given by special values of $\alpha$ of the partition function of the SU(2) $N_f=4$ ${\cal N}=2$ SQCD.</description>

      <title>Explicit construction of states in orbifolds of products of $N=2$ Superconformal ADE Minimal models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the explicit construction of fields in orbifolds of products of $N=(2,2)$ minimal models, developed by A. Belavin, V. Belavin and S. Parkhomenko to include minimal models with D and E-type modular invariants. It is shown that spectral flow twisting by the elements of admissible group $G_{\text{adm}}$, which is used in the construction of the orbifold, is consistent with the nondiagonal pairing of D and E-type minimal models. We obtain the complete set of fields of the orbifold from the mutual locality and other requirements of the conformal bootstrap. The collection of mutually local primary fields is labeled by the elements of mirror group $G^{*}_{\text{adm}}$. The permutation of $G_{\text{adm}}$ and $G^*_{\text{adm}}$ is given by the mirror spectral flow construction of the fields and transforms the original orbifold into a mirror one. This transformation is by construction an isomorphism of $N=(2,2)$ models. We illustrate our construction for the orbifolds of $\textbf{A}_{2}\textbf{E}_7^{3}$ model.</description>

      <title>The monomial expansions of modified Macdonald polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discover a family $A$ of sixteen statistics on fillings of any given Young diagram and prove new combinatorial formulas for modified Macdonald polynomials, that is, $$\tilde{H}_{\lambda}(X;q,t)=\sum_{\sigma\in T(\lambda)}x^{\sigma}q^{maj(\sigma)}t^{\eta(\sigma)}$$ for each statistic $\eta\in A$. Building upon this new formula, we establish four compact formulas for the modified Macdonald polynomials, namely, $$\tilde{H}_{\lambda}(X;q,t)=\sum_{\sigma}d_{\varepsilon}(\sigma)x^{\sigma}q^{maj(\sigma)}t^{\eta(\sigma)}$$ which is summed over all canonical or dual canonical fillings of a Young diagram and $d_{\varepsilon}(\sigma)$ is a product of $t$-multinomials. Finally, the compact formulas enable us to derive four explicit expressions for the monomial expansion of modified Macdonald polynomials, one of which coincides with the formula given by Garbali and Wheeler (2020).</description>
