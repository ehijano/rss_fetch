      <title>Local intricacy and average sample complexity for amenable group actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,G)$, $(Y,G)$ be two $G$-systems, where $G$ is an infinite countable discrete amenable group and $X$, $Y$ are compact metric spaces. Suppose that $\mathcal{U}$ is a cover of $X$. We first introduce the conditional local topological intricacy $\mathrm{Int}_\mathrm{top} (G,\mathcal{U}|Y)$ and average sample complexity $\mathrm{Asc}_\mathrm{top} (G,\mathcal{U}|Y)$. Given an invariant measure $\mu$ of $X$, we study the conditional local measure-theoretical intricacy $\mathrm{Int}_\mu^\pm(G,\mathcal{U}|Y)$ and average sample complexity $\mathrm{Asc}_\mu^\pm(G,\mathcal{U}|Y)$. For any F{\o}lner sequence $\{F_n\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$, we take $\{c^{F_n}_S\}_{S\subseteq F_n}$ to be the uniform system of coefficients. We establish the equivalence of $\mathrm{Asc}_\mu^-(G,\mathcal{U}|Y)$ and $\mathrm{Asc}_\mu^+(G,\mathcal{U}|Y)$ when $G=\mathbb{Z}$. Furthermore, we verified that $\mathrm{Asc}_\mu^-(G,\mathcal{U})$ is equal to $\mathrm{Asc}_\mu^+(G,\mathcal{U})$ in general case. Finally, we give a local variational principle of average sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Locally integrable cross sections and their intersection covolume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study systematically cross sections of probability preserving actions of unimodular groups and their associated transverse measures, and introduce the invariant \emph{intersection covolume} to quantify their periodicity. Our main theorem, derived from a higher order version of Kac's lemma, shows that the intersection covolume is bounded below by the intensity, with equality precisely when the action is induced by a lattice (in the sense of Mackey). We further prove that the natural cross sections of cut--and--project actions have finite intersection covolume.</description>

      <title>Periodicity of point processes in abelian groups without lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the intersection covolume of cross sections for probability preserving actions of a class of abelian groups without lattices, including $p$-adic groups and the group of finite adeles. We show that for cross sections with a uniformly discrete return time set, the intersection covolume is bounded below by twice the intensity, revealing a strict gap compared to the lattice case. Our main theorem asserts that cut-and-project systems uniquely attain the minimal intersection covolume. As an application, we characterize the generalized Farey fractions in the finite adeles via their Banach density.</description>

      <title>Recognisability for generalised hierarchical patterns and pattern spaces of finite local complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore an extended notion of a tiling of translational finite local complexity (FLC) being substitutional, or hierarchical, to Euclidean `patterns' and define, more generally, a similar notion for spaces of patterns. We prove recognisability results for these, relating injectivity of substitution to aperiodicity, with no minimality requirements. More precisely, for a suitable power of the substitution map, we determine the size of fibre over any pattern to be the index of its inflated (translational) periods in its whole group of periods. This answers an open question of Cortez and Solomyak, on whether non-periodic tilings necessarily have unique pre-images under substitution: they do, even for a wider notion of pattern and being substitutional; conversely, for an appropriate power of the substitution, discretely periodic points necessarily have multiple pre-images. Our results cover examples of FLC pattern spaces, such as of uniformly discrete but non-relatively dense point sets, that contain elements with non-discrete groups of periods.</description>

      <title>On the geometric quantization of $\theta$-almost twisted Poisson manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $\theta$-almost twisted Poisson manifold is a manifold $M$ together with a bivector field $\Lambda$, a 3-form $\varphi$, and a closed 1-form $\theta$ such that the exterior derivative $d\varphi$ of $\varphi$ is the wedge product of $\theta$ and $\varphi$, the anchor $\Lambda^\#(\theta)$ of $\theta$ is identically zero, and the Jacobiator (Jacobi operator; which is half the Schouten-Nijenhuis bracket of $\Lambda$ with itself) associated to $\Lambda$ is the anchor $\Lambda^\#(\varphi)$ of $\varphi$. In this work, we define the notion of a contravariant derivative adapted to these manifolds and establish the prequantization condition in terms of the $\theta$-almost twisted Poisson cohomology. We then introduce a polarization and construct a quantum Hilbert space. These results are illustrated by examples.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven State Observers for Measure-Preserving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing use of data-driven control strategies gives rise to the problem of learning-based state observation. Motivated by this need, the present work proposes a data-driven approach for the synthesis of state observers for discrete-time nonlinear systems with measure-preserving dynamics. To this end, Kazantzis-Kravaris/Luenburger (KKL) observers are shown to be well-defined, where the observer design boils down to determining a nonlinear injective mapping of states and its pseudo-inverse. For its learning-based construction, the KKL observer is related to the Koopman and Perron-Frobenius operators, defined on a Sobolev-type reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) on which they are shown to be normal operators and thus have a spectral resolution. Hence, observer synthesis algorithms, based on kernel interpolation/regression routines for the desired injective mapping in the observer and its pseudo-inverse, have been proposed in various settings of available dataset -- (i) many orbits, (ii) single long orbit, and (iii) snapshots. Theoretical error analyses are provided, and numerical studies on a chaotic Lorenz system are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>The LLN and CLT for the statistical ensembles of discrete integrable Hamiltonian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the behavior of statistical ensembles under iteration map induced by discrete integrable Hamiltonian systems in deterministic case and stochastic case, addressing the problem from two perspectives: the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem. In deterministic case, the Law of Large Numbers simplifies the convergence conditions to the extent that the Riemann-Lebesgue lemma is no longer required. In the stochastic setting, we extend the results to general stochastic processes, beginning with the perturbation term represented by standard Brownian motion. Moreover, we establish a Central Limit Theorem for the statistical ensemble. A numerical example is also included.</description>

      <title>Automated algorithm design for convex optimization problems with linear equality constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthesis of optimization algorithms typically follows a {\em design-then-analyze\/} approach, which can obscure fundamental performance limits and hinder the systematic development of algorithms that operate near these limits. Recently, a framework grounded in robust control theory has emerged as a powerful tool for automating algorithm synthesis. By integrating design and analysis stages, fundamental performance bounds are revealed and synthesis of algorithms that achieve them is enabled. In this paper, we apply this framework to design algorithms for solving strongly convex optimization problems with linear equality constraints. Our approach yields a single-loop, gradient-based algorithm whose convergence rate is independent of the condition number of the constraint matrix. This improves upon the best known rate within the same algorithm class, which depends on the product of the condition numbers of the objective function and the constraint matrix.</description>

      <title>Birationally integrable vector fields on complex projective surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rational vector field on a complex projective smooth surface $S$ is said to be birationally integrable if it generates, by integration, a one-parameter subgroup of the group $\operatorname{Bir}(S)$ of birational transformations of $S$. We prove that every birationally integrable vector field is regularizable, i.e. birationally conjugated to a holomorphic vector field. Next, we extend this result to any finite-dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ of birationally integrable vector fields. This implies that $\mathfrak g$ is naturally included into the Lie algebra of an algebraic subgroup of $\operatorname{Bir}(S)$. Moreover, we obtain a complete birational classification of birationally integrable Lie algebras that are of dimension two or semisimple, exhibiting holomorphic normal forms of them. We also characterize those birationally integrable algebras of rational vector fields that are maximal.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Root-Finding Algorithm and its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Root-finding method is an iterative process that constructs a sequence converging to a solution of an equation. Householder's method is a higher-order method that requires higher order derivatives of the reciprocal of a function and has disadvantages. Firstly, symbolic computations can take a long time, and numerical methods to differentiate a function can accumulate errors. Secondly, the convergence factor existing in the literature is a rough estimate. In this paper, we propose a higher-order root-finding method using only Taylor expansion of a function. It has lower computational complexity with explicit convergence factor, and can be used to numerically implement Householder's method. As an application, we apply the proposed method to compute pre-images of $q$-ary entropy functions, commonly seen in coding theory. Finally, we study basins of attraction using the proposed method and compare them with other root-finding methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Aperiodic order refers to the mathematical formalisation of quasicrystals. Substitutions and cut and project sets are among their main actors; they also play a key role in the study of dynamical systems, whether they are symbolic, generated by tilings, or point sets. We focus here on the relations between quasicrystals and self-similarity from an arithmetical and dynamical viewpoint, illustrating how efficiently aperiodic order irrigates various domains of mathematics and theoretical computer science, on a journey from Diophantine approximation to computability theory. In particular, we see how Pisot numbers allow the definition of simple model sets, and how they also intervene for scaling factors for invariance by multiplication of Meyer sets. We focus in particular on the characterisation due to Yves Meyer: any Pisot or Salem number is a parameter of dilation that preserves some Meyer set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15238v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celebrated Birkhoff Ergodic Theorem asserts that, for an ergodic map, orbits of almost every point equidistributes when sampled at integer times. This result was generalized by Bourgain to many natural sparse subsets of the integers. On the other hand, the behaviour of orbits of \textbf{all} points in a dynamical system is much less understood, especially for sparse subsets of the integers. We generalize a method introduced by A. Venkatesh to tackle this problem in two directions, general $\mathbb{R}^d$ actions instead of flows, and weak mixing, rather than mixing, actions. Along the way, we also establish some basic properties of weak mixing and show weak mixing for the time 1-map of a weak mixing flow.</description>

      <title>A Compartmental Model for Epidemiology with Human Behavior and Stochastic Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a compartmental model for epidemiology wherein the population is split into groups with either comply or refuse to comply with protocols designed to slow the spread of a disease. Parallel to the disease spread, we assume that noncompliance with protocols spreads as a social contagion. We begin by deriving the reproductive ratio for a deterministic version of the model, and use this to fully characterize the local stability of disease free equilibrium points. We then append the deterministic model with stochastic effects, specifically assuming that the transmission rate of the disease and the transmission rate of the social contagion are uncertain. We prove global existence and nonnegativity for our stochastic model. Then using suitably constructed stochastic Lyapunov functions, we analyze the behavior of the stochastic system with respect to certain disease free states. We demonstrate all of our results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Spatial Stark-Zeeman Systems and Their Regularizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study spatial Stark-Zeeman systems which describe the dynamics of a charged particle moving in three-dimensional space under the influence of a Coulomb potential, a magnetic field, and an electric field, possibly time-dependent. Such systems are modeled by Hamiltonian flows on the cotangent bundle of an open subset of $\mathbb{R}^3, $ equipped with a twisted symplectic structure. The presence of the Coulomb singularity leads to the study of collision orbits, and hence understanding the regularization of these orbits is essential for global dynamical properties.
  We investigate regularization techniques for spatial Stark-Zeeman systems, both in time-independent and time-dependent cases. In particular, in the time-dependent case, following a new regularization method developed by Barutello, Ortega, and Verzini, we formulate the corresponding regularized variational principles and carefully analyze the effects of magnetic and electric terms under the Kustaanheimo-Stiefel transformation. The resulting regularized action functional yields a variational characterization of collision orbits and facilitates further analysis of periodic solutions.
  Our results provide a general scheme for regularizing spatial Stark-Zeeman systems, opening the door for further applications in symplectic geometry, Floer theory, and celestial mechanics.</description>

      <title>Multicycle dynamics and high-codimension bifurcations in SIRS epidemic models with cubic psychological saturated incidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates bifurcation dynamics in an SIRS epidemic model with cubic saturated incidence, extending the quadratic saturation framework established by Lu, Huang, Ruan, and Yu (Journal of Differential Equations, 267, 2019). We rigorously prove the existence of codimension-three Bogdanov-Takens bifurcations and degenerate Hopf bifurcations, demonstrating the coexistence of three limit cycles within a single epidemiological model, a phenomenon that is rarely documented and exhibits significant dynamical complexity. Our analysis reveals that both the infection rate $\kappa$ (through specific inequality conditions) and psychological effect thresholds critically govern disease dynamics: from complete eradication to various persistence patterns, including multiple periodic oscillations and coexistent steady states. By innovatively applying singularity theory, we characterize the topology of the bifurcation set through the local unfolding of singularities and the identification of nondegenerate singularities for fronts. Numerical simulations verify the emergence of three limit cycles in monotonic parameter regimes and two limit cycles in nonmonotonic regimes. This work advances existing bifurcation research by incorporating higher-order interactions and comprehensive singularity analysis, thereby providing a mathematical foundation for decoding complex transmission mechanisms critical to the design of public health strategies.</description>

      <title>Limit theorems for a strongly irreducible product of independent random matrices under optimal moment assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\nu$ be a probability distribution over the semi-group of square matrices of size $d\ge2$. We assume that $\nu$ is proximal, strongly irreducible and that $\nu^{*n}\{0\}=0$ for all $n$. We consider the sequence $\overline\gamma_n:=\gamma_0\cdots\gamma_{n-1}$ for $(\gamma_k)_{k}$ independent of distribution law $\nu$. Let $s_1\ge s_2\ge\dots s_d$ be the singular values given by the Cartan projection. We show that $(\log\frac{s_1}{s_2}(\overline{\gamma}_n))_{n}$, escapes to infinity linearly and satisfies exponential large deviations inequalities below its escape rate. This is an extension the simplicity of the top Lyapunov exponent result, proven by Guivarc'h and Raugi under a first moment assumption. We also show that the image of a generic line by $\overline{\gamma}_n$ as well as its eigenspace of maximal eigenvalue both converge to the same random line $l^\infty$ at an exponential speed.
  If we moreover assume that $\nu$ is supported on the group of invertible matrices and that the push-forward distribution $N_*\nu$ is $\mathrm{L}^p$ for $N:g\mapsto\log\|g\|\|g^{-1}\|$ and for some $p&gt;0$, then we show that $-\log d(l^\infty,H)$ is uniformly $\mathrm{L}^p$ for all proper subspace $H\subset\mathbb{R}^d$. For $p=1$, we moreover show that the rescaled logarithm of each coefficient of $\overline{\gamma}_n$ almost surely converges to the top Lyapunov exponent. This is an extension of results by Benoist and Quint which were themselves improvements of historic results by Guivarc'h, Lepage and Raugi, first proven under exponential moment assumptions.
  To prove these results, we do not rely on the existence of the stationary measure nor on the existence of the Lyapunov exponent. Instead we describe an effective way to group the i.i.d. factors into i.i.d. random words that are aligned in the Cartan decomposition. We moreover have an explicit control over the moments.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotic Behavior of Attention in Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transformer architecture has become the foundation of modern Large Language Models (LLMs), yet its theoretical properties are still not well understood. As with classic neural networks, a common approach to improve these models is to increase their size and depth. However, such strategies may be suboptimal, as several works have shown that adding more layers yields increasingly diminishing returns. More importantly, prior studies have shown that increasing depth may lead to model collapse, i.e., all the tokens converge to a single cluster, undermining the ability of LLMs to generate diverse outputs. Building on differential equation models for the transformer dynamics, we prove that all the tokens in a transformer asymptotically converge to a cluster as depth increases. At the technical level we leverage tools from control theory, including consensus dynamics on manifolds and input-to-state stability (ISS). We then extend our analysis to autoregressive models, exploiting their structure to further generalize the theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Morse-Bott-Smale chain complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Banyaga and Hurtubise defined the Morse-Bott-Smale chain complex as a quotient of a large chain complex by introducing five degeneracy relations. However, their five degeneracy relations are in fact redundant. In the present paper, we unify these five conditions into a single degeneracy condition and resolve the issue of the well-definedness of the Morse-Bott-Smale chain complex. This provides an appropriate definition of the Morse-Bott homology and more computable examples. Moreover, we show that our chain complex for a Morse-Smale function is quasi-isomorphic to the usual Morse-Smale-Witten chain complex. As a consequence, we obtain an alternative proof of the Morse Homology Theorem.</description>

      <title>Why and When Deep is Better than Shallow: An Implementation-Agnostic State-Transition View of Depth Supremacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Why and when is deep better than shallow? We answer this question in a framework that is agnostic to network implementation. We formulate a deep model as an abstract state-transition semigroup acting on a general metric space, and separate the implementation (e.g., ReLU nets, transformers, and chain-of-thought) from the abstract state transition. We prove a bias-variance decomposition in which the variance depends only on the abstract depth-$k$ network and not on the implementation (Theorem 1). We further split the bounds into output and hidden parts to tie the depth dependence of the variance to the metric entropy of the state-transition semigroup (Theorem 2). We then investigate implementation-free conditions under which the variance grow polynomially or logarithmically with depth (Section 4). Combining these with exponential or polynomial bias decay identifies four canonical bias-variance trade-off regimes (EL/EP/PL/PP) and produces explicit optimal depths $k^\ast$. Across regimes, $k^\ast&gt;1$ typically holds, giving a rigorous form of depth supremacy. The lowest generalization error bound is achieved under the EL regime (exp-decay bias + log-growth variance), explaining why and when deep is better, especially for iterative or hierarchical concept classes such as neural ODEs, diffusion/score models, and chain-of-thought reasoning.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Chaotic Itinerancy Phenomenon using Entropy and Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new methodology for the analysis of the phenomenon of chaotic itinerancy in a dynamical system using the notion of entropy and a clustering algorithm. We determine systems likely to experience chaotic itinerancy by means of local Shannon entropy and local permutation entropy. In such systems, we find quasi-stable states (attractor ruins) and chaotic transition states using a density-based clustering algorithm. Our approach then focuses on examining the chaotic itinerancy dynamics through the characterization of residence times within these states and chaotic transitions between them with the help of some statistical tests. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods on the system of globally coupled logistic maps (GCM), a well-known model exhibiting chaotic itinerancy. In particular, we conduct comprehensive computations for a large number of parameters in the GCM system and algorithmically identify itinerant dynamics observed previously by Kaneko in numerical simulations as coherent and intermittent phases.</description>
