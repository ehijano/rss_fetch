      <title>Multi-team Formation System for Collaborative Crowdsourcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For complex crowdsourcing tasks that require collaboration between multiple individuals, teams should be formed by considering both worker compatibility and expertise. Furthermore, the nature of crowdsourcing dictates the budget for tasks and workers' remuneration, and excessively large team sizes may reduce collaborative performance. To address these challenges, we propose a heuristic optimization algorithm that leverages social network information to simultaneously form teams with optimized worker compatibility for multiple tasks. In our approach, historical collaboration is represented as a social network, where the edge weights correspond to explicit ratings of worker compatibility. In a simulation experiment using synthetic data, we applied Gaussian process regression to examine the relationship between eight experimental parameters and evaluation values, thereby analyzing the output of the proposed algorithm. To generate the necessary data for regression, we ran the proposed algorithm with experimental parameters that were sequentially estimated using Bayesian optimization. Our experiments revealed that the evaluation values were extremely low when the team size limit, the degree mean of the social network, and the task budget were set to low values. The results also indicate that the proposed algorithm outperformed the hill-climbing method under almost all experimental conditions. In addition, the highest evaluation values were achieved when the simulated annealing temperature decrease rate was approximately 0.9, while smoothing the objective function proved ineffective.</description>

      <title>Structural asymmetry as a fraud signature: detecting collusion with Heron's Information Coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fraud in public procurement remains a persistent challenge, especially in large, decentralized systems like Brazil's Unified Health System. We introduce Heron's Information Coefficient (HIC), a geometric measure that quantifies how subgraphs deviate from the global structure of a network. Applied to over eight years of Brazilian bidding data for medical supplies, this measure highlights collusive patterns that standard indicators may overlook. Unlike conventional robustness metrics, the Heron coefficient focuses on the interaction between active and inactive subgraphs, revealing structural shifts that may signal coordinated behavior, such as cartel formation. Synthetic experiments support these findings, demonstrating strong detection performance across varying corruption intensities and network sizes. While our results do not replace legal or economic analyses, they offer an effective complementary tool for auditors and policymakers to monitor procurement integrity more effectively. This study demonstrates that simple geometric insight can reveal hidden dynamics in real-world networks better than other Information Theoretic metrics.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Control of Sustainable Transitions through Opinion-Behavior Coupling in Heterogeneous Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how sustainable behaviors spread within heterogeneous societies requires the integration of behavioral data, social influence mechanisms, and structured approaches to control. In this paper, we propose a data-driven computational framework for coupled opinion-adoption dynamics in social systems. Each node in the multilayer network represents a community characterized by a specific age group and mobility level, derived from large-scale survey data on the predisposition to adopt electric vehicles in Northern Europe. The proposed model captures three mechanisms: behavioral contagion through social and informational diffusion, abandonment driven by dissatisfaction, and feedback between opinions and adoption levels through social influence. Analyzing the equilibrium points of the coupled system allows us to derive the conditions that enable large-scale adoption. We empirically calibrate the model using data to construct synthetic populations and social similarity networks, which we use to explore targeted interventions that promote sustainable transitions. Specifically, the analysis focuses on two types of control strategies: opinion-based policies, which act on the social network layer, and policies that aim to improve experience and reduce dissatisfaction. Simulation results show that the latter ensure more stable and long-term adoption, offering concrete insights for designing effective interventions in sociotechnical transitions toward sustainability.</description>

      <title>Latent space models for grouped multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex multilayer network datasets have become ubiquitous in various applications, including neuroscience, social sciences, economics, and genetics. Notable examples include brain connectivity networks collected across multiple patients or trade networks between countries collected across multiple goods. Existing statistical approaches to such data typically focus on modeling the structure shared by all networks; some go further by accounting for individual, layer-specific variation. However, real-world multilayer networks often exhibit additional patterns shared only within certain subsets of layers, which can represent treatment and control groups, or patients grouped by a specific trait. Identifying these group-level structures can uncover systematic differences between groups of networks and influence many downstream tasks, such as testing and low-dimensional visualization. To address this gap, we introduce the GroupMultiNeSS model, which enables the simultaneous extraction of shared, group-specific, and individual latent structures from a sample of networks on a shared node set. For this model, we establish identifiability, develop a fitting procedure using convex optimization in combination with a nuclear norm penalty, and prove a guarantee of recovery for the latent positions as long as there is sufficient separation between the shared, group-specific, and individual latent subspaces. We compare the model with MultiNeSS and other models for multiplex networks in various synthetic scenarios and observe an apparent improvement in the modeling accuracy when the group component is accounted for. Experiment with the Parkinson's disease brain connectivity dataset demonstrates the superiority of GroupMultiNeSS in highlighting node-level insights on biological differences between the treatment and control patient groups.</description>

      <title>An External Fairness Evaluation of LinkedIn Talent Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct an independent, third-party audit for bias of LinkedIn's Talent Search ranking system, focusing on potential ranking bias across two attributes: gender and race. To do so, we first construct a dataset of rankings produced by the system, collecting extensive Talent Search results across a diverse set of occupational queries. We then develop a robust labeling pipeline that infers the two demographic attributes of interest for the returned users. To evaluate potential biases in the collected dataset of real-world rankings, we utilize two exposure disparity metrics: deviation from group proportions and MinSkew. Our analysis reveals an under-representation of minority groups in early ranks across many queries. We further examine potential causes of this disparity, and discuss why they may be difficult or, in some cases, impossible to fully eliminate among the early ranks of queries. Beyond static metrics, we also investigate the concept of subgroup fairness over time, highlighting temporal disparities in exposure and retention, which are often more difficult to audit for in practice. In employer recruiting platforms such as LinkedIn Talent Search, the persistence of a particular candidate over multiple days in the ranking can directly impact the probability that the given candidate is selected for opportunities. Our analysis reveals demographic disparities in this temporal stability, with some groups experiencing greater volatility in their ranked positions than others. We contextualize all our findings alongside LinkedIn's published self-audits of its Talent Search system and reflect on the methodological constraints of a black-box external evaluation, including limited observability and noisy demographic inference.</description>

      <title>HyperComplEx: Adaptive Multi-Space Knowledge Graph Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs have emerged as fundamental structures for representing complex relational data across scientific and enterprise domains. However, existing embedding methods face critical limitations when modeling diverse relationship types at scale: Euclidean models struggle with hierarchies, vector space models cannot capture asymmetry, and hyperbolic models fail on symmetric relations. We propose HyperComplEx, a hybrid embedding framework that adaptively combines hyperbolic, complex, and Euclidean spaces via learned attention mechanisms. A relation-specific space weighting strategy dynamically selects optimal geometries for each relation type, while a multi-space consistency loss ensures coherent predictions across spaces. We evaluate HyperComplEx on computer science research knowledge graphs ranging from 1K papers (~25K triples) to 10M papers (~45M triples), demonstrating consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines including TransE, RotatE, DistMult, ComplEx, SEPA, and UltraE. Additional tests on standard benchmarks confirm significantly higher results than all baselines. On the 10M-paper dataset, HyperComplEx achieves 0.612 MRR, a 4.8% relative gain over the best baseline, while maintaining efficient training, achieving 85 ms inference per triple. The model scales near-linearly with graph size through adaptive dimension allocation. We release our implementation and dataset family to facilitate reproducible research in scalable knowledge graph embeddings.</description>

      <title>Echoless Label-Based Pre-computation for Memory-Efficient Heterogeneous Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) are widely used for deep learning on heterogeneous graphs. Typical end-to-end HGNNs require repetitive message passing during training, limiting efficiency for large-scale real-world graphs. Pre-computation-based HGNNs address this by performing message passing only once during preprocessing, collecting neighbor information into regular-shaped tensors, which enables efficient mini-batch training. Label-based pre-computation methods collect neighbors' label information but suffer from training label leakage, where a node's own label information propagates back to itself during multi-hop message passing - the echo effect. Existing mitigation strategies are memory-inefficient on large graphs or suffer from compatibility issues with advanced message passing methods. We propose Echoless Label-based Pre-computation (Echoless-LP), which eliminates training label leakage with Partition-Focused Echoless Propagation (PFEP). PFEP partitions target nodes and performs echoless propagation, where nodes in each partition collect label information only from neighbors in other partitions, avoiding echo while remaining memory-efficient and compatible with any message passing method. We also introduce an Asymmetric Partitioning Scheme (APS) and a PostAdjust mechanism to address information loss from partitioning and distributional shifts across partitions. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that Echoless-LP achieves superior performance and maintains memory efficiency compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization of Pairwise Polynomial Graph Spectral Functions via Subgraph Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study distributed optimization of finite-degree polynomial Laplacian spectral objectives under fixed topology and a global weight budget, targeting the collective behavior of the entire spectrum rather than a few extremal eigenvalues. By re-formulating the global cost in a bilinear form, we derive local subgraph problems whose gradients approximately align with the global descent direction via an SVD-based test on the $ZC$ matrix. This leads to an iterate-and-embed scheme over disjoint 1-hop neighborhoods that preserves feasibility by construction (positivity and budget) and scales to large geometric graphs. For objectives that depend on pairwise eigenvalue differences $h(\lambda_i-\lambda_j)$, we obtain a quadratic upper bound in the degree vector, which motivates a ``warm-start'' by degree-regularization. The warm start uses randomized gossip to estimate global average degree, accelerating subsequent local descent while maintaining decentralization, and realizing $\sim95\%{}$ of the performance with respect to centralized optimization. We further introduce a learning-based proposer that predicts one-shot edge updates on maximal 1-hop embeddings, yielding immediate objective reductions. Together, these components form a practical, modular pipeline for spectrum-aware weight tuning that preserves constraints and applies across a broader class of whole-spectrum costs.</description>

      <title>Protection Degree and Migration in the Stochastic SIRS Model: A Queueing System Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the prevalence of COVID-19, the modeling of epidemic propagation and its analyses have played a significant role in controlling epidemics. However, individual behaviors, in particular the self-protection and migration, which have a strong influence on epidemic propagation, were always neglected in previous studies. In this paper, we mainly propose two models from the individual and population perspectives. In the first individual model, we introduce the individual protection degree that effectively suppresses the epidemic level as a stochastic variable to the SIRS model. In the alternative population model, an open Markov queueing network is constructed to investigate the individual number of each epidemic state, and we present an evolving population network via the migration of people. Besides, stochastic methods are applied to analyze both models. In various simulations, the infected probability, the number of individuals in each state and its limited distribution are demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Evolving Network Modeling Driven by the Degree Increase and Decrease Mechanism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ever since the Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) scale-free network has been proposed, network modeling has been studied intensively in light of the network growth and the preferential attachment (PA). However, numerous real systems are featured with a dynamic evolution including network reduction in addition to network growth. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for evolving networks from the perspective of vertex degree. We construct a queueing system to describe the increase and decrease of vertex degree, which drives the network evolution. In our mechanism, the degree increase rate is regarded as a function positively correlated to the degree of a vertex, ensuring the preferential attachment in a new way. Degree distributions are investigated under two expressions of the degree increase rate, one of which manifests a ``long tail'', and another one varies with different values of parameters. In simulations, we compare our theoretical distributions with simulation results and also apply them to real networks, which presents the validity and applicability of our model.</description>

      <title>The evolution of cooperation in spatial public goods game with tolerant punishment based on reputation threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reputation and punishment are significant guidelines for regulating individual behavior in human society, and those with a good reputation are more likely to be imitated by others. In addition, society imposes varying degrees of punishment for behaviors that harm the interests of groups with different reputations. However, conventional pairwise interaction rules and the punishment mechanism overlook this aspect. Building on this observation, this paper enhances a spatial public goods game in two key ways: 1) We set a reputation threshold and use punishment to regulate the defection behavior of players in low-reputation groups while allowing defection behavior in high-reputation game groups. 2) Differently from pairwise interaction rules, we combine reputation and payoff as the fitness of individuals to ensure that players with both high payoff and reputation have a higher chance of being imitated. Through simulations, we find that a higher reputation threshold, combined with a stringent punishment environment, can substantially enhance the level of cooperation within the population. This mechanism provides deeper insight into the widespread phenomenon of cooperation that emerges among individuals.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Physical-Layer Information on Epidemic Spreading in Cyber-Physical Networked Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since Granell et al. proposed a multiplex network for information and epidemic propagation, researchers have explored how information propagation affects epidemic dynamics. However, the role of individuals acquiring information through physical interactions has received relatively less attention. In this work, we introduce a novel source of information: physical layer information, and derive the epidemic outbreak threshold using the Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA). Our simulation results indicate that the outbreak threshold derived from the MMCA is consistent with the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation results, thereby confirming the accuracy of the theoretical model. Furthermore, we find that the physical-layer information effectively increases the population's awareness density and the infection threshold $\beta_c$, while reducing the population's infection density, thereby suppressing the spreading of the epidemic. Another interesting finding is that when the density of 2-simplex information is relatively high, the 2-simplex plays a role similar to pairwise interaction, significantly enhancing the population's awareness density and effectively preventing large-scale epidemic outbreaks. In addition, our model works equally well for cyber physical systems with similar interaction mechanisms, while we simulate and validate it in a real grid system.</description>

      <title>Measuring Technological Complexity Using Japanese Patents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11932v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As international competition intensifies in technologies, nations need to identify key technologies to foster innovation. However, the identification is challenging due to the independent and inherently complex nature of technologies. Traditionally, analyses of technological portfolios have been limited to simple evaluations, indicating merely whether a technology is specialized. We propose evaluating TCI at the corporate level, which provides finer granularity and more detailed insights than conventional regional evaluations by using Japanese patent data spanning fiscal years 1981 to 2010. Specifically, we analyze a bipartite network composed of 1,939 corporations connected to technological fields categorized into either 35 or 124 classifications. Our findings quantitatively characterize the ubiquity and sophistication of each technological field, reveal detailed technological trends reflecting broader societal contexts, and demonstrate methodological stability even when employing finer technological classifications. Additionally, our corporate-level analysis allows consistent comparisons across different regions and technological fields, clarifying regional advantages in specific technologies. The corporate level analysis also reveals a new possibility for formulating an innovation strategy.</description>

      <title>SIS Epidemic Modelling on Homogeneous Networked System: General Recovering Process and Mean-Field Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12290v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although we have made progress in understanding disease spread in complex systems with non-Poissonian activity patterns, current models still fail to capture the full range of recovery time distributions. In this paper, we propose an extension of the classic susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model, called the general recovering process SIS (grp-SIS) model. This model incorporates arbitrary recovery time distributions for infected nodes within the system. We derive the mean-field equations assuming a homogeneous network, provide solutions for specific recovery time distributions, and investigate the probability density function (PDF) for infection times in the system's steady state. Our findings show that recovery time distributions significantly affect disease dynamics, and we suggest several future research directions, including extending the model to arbitrary infection processes and using the quasistationary method to address deviations in numerical results.</description>

Abstract: This study examines how contact network topology influences the effectiveness of vaccination programs in the context of human papillomavirus (HPV) transmission. Using the SeCoNet sexual contact network growth model, we evaluate age based, ring based, and several centrality based vaccination strategies across the overall, male, and female cohorts, focusing on peak incidence, timing of peak prevalence, and cumulative incidence. The simulations show that degree, betweenness, and percolation centrality based strategies are generally the most effective, while ring vaccination achieves the greatest reduction in cumulative incidence among females. Network topology also plays a critical role: higher average degree reduces vaccination effectiveness, whereas higher power-law exponent, longer average shortest path length, and stronger clustering improve vaccination outcomes. The results highlight the importance of incorporating network structure into the design of HPV vaccination programs.</description>

      <title>Towards Effective Federated Graph Foundation Model via Mitigating Knowledge Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in graph machine learning have shifted to data-centric paradigms, driven by two emerging fields: (1) Federated graph learning (FGL) enables multi-client collaboration but faces challenges from data and task heterogeneity, limiting its practicality; (2) Graph foundation models (GFM) offer strong domain generalization but are usually trained on single machines, missing out on cross-silo data and resources.
  These paradigms are complementary, and their integration brings notable benefits. Motivated by this, we propose FedGFM, a novel decentralized GFM training paradigm. However, a key challenge is knowledge entanglement, where multi-domain knowledge merges into indistinguishable representations, hindering downstream adaptation.
  To address this, we present FedGFM+, an enhanced framework with two core modules to reduce knowledge entanglement: (1) AncDAI: A global anchor-based domain-aware initialization strategy. Before pre-training, each client encodes its local graph into domain-specific prototypes that serve as semantic anchors. Synthetic embeddings around these anchors initialize the global model. We theoretically prove these prototypes are distinguishable across domains, providing a strong inductive bias to disentangle domain-specific knowledge. (2) AdaDPP: A local adaptive domain-sensitive prompt pool. Each client learns a lightweight graph prompt capturing domain semantics during pre-training. During fine-tuning, prompts from all clients form a pool from which the GFM selects relevant prompts to augment target graph attributes, improving downstream adaptation.
  FedGFM+ is evaluated on 8 diverse benchmarks across multiple domains and tasks, outperforming 20 baselines from supervised learning, FGL, and federated GFM variants.</description>
