      <title>Measuring redshift and galaxy properties via a multi-task neural net with probabilistic outputs: An application to simulated MOONS spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The era of large-scale astronomical surveys demands innovative approaches for rapid and accurate analysis of extensive spectral data, and a promising direction to address this challenge is offered by artificial intelligence (AI). Here we introduce a new pipeline, M-TOPnet (Multi-Task network Outputting Probabilities), which employs a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual learning to simultaneously derive redshift and other key physical properties of galaxies from their spectra. Our tool efficiently encodes spectral information into a latent space, employing distinct downstream branches for each physical quantity, thereby benefiting from multi-task learning. Notably, our method handles the redshift output as a probability distribution, allowing for a more refined and robust estimation of this critical parameter. We demonstrate preliminary results using simulated data from the MOONS instrument, which will be soon operating at the ESO/VLT. We highlight the effectiveness of our tool in accurately predicting redshift, stellar mass, and star-formation rate for galaxies at z&gt;~1-3, even for faint sources (m_H &gt;~ 24) where traditional methods often struggle. Through analysis of the output probability distributions, we demonstrate that our pipeline enables robust quality screening of the results, achieving accuracy rates of up to 99% in redshift determination (defined as predictions within |Delta_z| &lt; 0.01 relative to the true redshift) with 8 h exposure spectra, while automatically identifying potentially problematic cases. Our AI pipeline thus emerges as a powerful solution for the upcoming challenges in observational astronomy, combining precision, interpretability, and efficiency, all aspects which are crucial for analysing the massive datasets expected from next-generation instruments.</description>

      <title>frb-voe: A Real-time Virtual Observatory Event Alert Service for Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present frb-voe, a publicly available software package that enables radio observatories to broadcast fast radio burst (FRB) alerts to subscribers through low-latency virtual observatory events (VOEvents). We describe a use-case of frb-voe by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) Collaboration, which has broadcast thousands of FRB alerts to subscribers worldwide. Using this service, observers have daily opportunities to conduct rapid multi-wavelength follow-up observations of new FRB sources. Alerts are distributed as machine-readable reports and as emails containing FRB metadata, and are available to the public within approximately 13 seconds of detection. A sortable database and a downloadable JSON file containing FRB metadata from all broadcast alerts can be found on the CHIME/FRB public webpage. The frb-voe service also provides users with the ability to retrieve FRB names from the Transient Name Server (TNS) through the frb-voe client user interface (CLI). The frb-voe service can act as a foundation on which any observatory that detects FRBs can build its own VOEvent broadcasting service to contribute to the coordinated multi-wavelength follow-up of astrophysical transients.</description>

      <title>Performance of the Segment Anything Model in Various RFI/Events Detection in Radio Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging era of big data in radio astronomy demands more efficient and higher-quality processing of observational data. While deep learning methods have been applied to tasks such as automatic radio frequency interference (RFI) detection, these methods often face limitations, including dependence on training data and poor generalization, which are also common issues in other deep learning applications within astronomy. In this study, we investigate the use of the open-source image recognition and segmentation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), and its optimized version, HQ-SAM, due to their impressive generalization capabilities. We evaluate these models across various tasks, including RFI detection and solar radio burst (SRB) identification. For RFI detection, HQ-SAM (SAM) shows performance that is comparable to or even superior to the SumThreshold method, especially with large-area broadband RFI data. In the search for SRBs, HQ-SAM demonstrates strong recognition abilities for Type II and Type III bursts. Overall, with its impressive generalization capability, SAM (HQ-SAM) can be a promising candidate for further optimization and application in RFI and event detection tasks in radio astronomy.</description>

      <title>DRUID: Source Detection and Deblending in Astronomical Images with Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source detection is a vital part of any astronomical survey analysis pipeline. In addition, a versatile source finder that can recover and handle sources of all morphological types is becoming more important as surveys get bigger and achieve a higher resolution than ever before. Here we present Detector of astRonomical soUrces in optIcal and raDio images (DRUID), a source finder that utilises persistent homology to detect and deblend sources. This method enables us to effectively and uniquely segment structures within morphologically complex sources and deal with high source density images. We test DRUID on the complex morphologies of 3CR radio loud active galactic nuclei, where we demonstrate its ability to usefully segment the main structures in the sources. We also demonstrate the level of structure DRUID segments within well resolved galaxies in the optical. Finally, we present two source catalogues on the LoTSS Deep field observation of the Lockman Hole and an example tile from the KiDS r-band survey. We conclude that DRUID's method of utilising persistent homology provides a new way to detect and deblend highly nested sources.</description>

      <title>Machine learning based stellar classification with highly sparse photometry data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying stars belonging to different classes is vital in order to build up statistical samples of different phases and pathways of stellar evolution. In the era of surveys covering billions of stars, an automated method of identifying these classes becomes necessary. Many classes of stars are identified based on their emitted spectra. In this paper, we use a combination of the multi-class multi-label Machine Learning (ML) method XGBoost and the PySSED spectral-energy-distribution fitting algorithm to classify stars into nine different classes, based on their photometric data. The classifier is trained on subsets of the SIMBAD database. Particular challenges are the very high sparsity (large fraction of missing values) of the underlying data as well as the high class imbalance. We discuss the different variables available, such as photometric measurements on the one hand, and indirect predictors such as Galactic position on the other hand. We show the difference in performance when excluding certain variables, and discuss in which contexts which of the variables should be used. Finally, we show that increasing the number of samples of a particular type of star significantly increases the performance of the model for that particular type, while having little to no impact on other types. The accuracy of the main classifier is ~0.7 with a macro F1 score of 0.61. While the current accuracy of the classifier is not high enough to be reliably used in stellar classification, this work is an initial proof of feasibility for using ML to classify stars based on photometry.</description>

      <title>Approximate model for the coupling of far-field wavefront errors and jitter in space-based gravitational wave laser interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-based gravitational wave observatories, such as LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, employ long-baseline laser interferometry, necessitating displacement measurement sensitivity at 1 pm/$\sqrt{Hz}$ level. A significant challenge in achieving this precision is the coupling noise arising from far-field wavefront errors (WFE) and laser pointing jitter. This paper presents a comprehensive noise model that incorporates three critical factors: transmitted WFE, static pointing angle, and laser beam jitter. Utilizing the Nijboer-Zernike diffraction theory, we derive an approximate expression for far-field WFE, ensuring minimal error and efficient computational performance. The approximate expression has convincing physical interpretability and reveals how various Zernike aberrations and their coupling impact far-field WFE. Furthermore, the study identifies that correcting optical axis deviations induced by $Z_3^{\pm1}$ through beam tilt exacerbates far-field WFE, underscoring the necessity for active suppression of $Z_3^{\pm1}$. The proposed model facilitates detailed system simulations of the laser link, evaluates Tilt-to-Length (TTL) noise, and offers theoretical insights for system optimization.</description>

      <title>Broad-band, high-gain, low-frequency Antennas for Radio Detection of Earth-skimming Tau Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A promising approach to detect high-energy tau neutrinos is through the measurement of impulsive radio emission from horizontal air showers initiated in the Earth's atmosphere. Observations at frequencies between 30 and 80 MHz seem particularly promising -- if high-gain antennas focused at the horizon and blocking out as much as possible of the noisy sky are employed. Due to the large wavelengths, however, designing an antenna with the required properties is highly non-trivial at such low frequencies. In this article, we explore suitable antenna designs that provide the desired high gain, possess a smooth beam, are insensitive to ground conditions, are easily impedance-matched over the wide band, and are mechanically simple for deployment in large numbers in inaccessible terrain. In particular, we consider the "rhombus" antenna design for both horizontally and vertically polarized radiation a very attractive option for tau neutrino detection efforts in the atmosphere with the radio technique.</description>

Abstract: A new detector controller, NGCII, is in development for the first-generation instruments of the ELT as well as new instruments for the VLT. Building on experience with previous ESO detector controllers, a modular system based on the MicroTCA.4 industrial standard, is designed to control a variety of infrared and visible light scientific and wavefront sensor detectors. This article presents the early development stages of NGCII hardware and firmware from the decision to start an all-new design to first tests with detectors and ROICs.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification for fast reconstruction methods using augmented equivariant bootstrap: Application to radio interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of next-generation radio interferometers like the Square Kilometer Array promises to revolutionise our radio astronomy observational capabilities. The unprecedented volume of data these devices generate requires fast and accurate image reconstruction algorithms to solve the ill-posed radio interferometric imaging problem. Most state-of-the-art reconstruction methods lack trustworthy and scalable uncertainty quantification, which is critical for the rigorous scientific interpretation of radio observations. We propose an unsupervised technique based on a conformalized version of a radio-augmented equivariant bootstrapping method, which allows us to quantify uncertainties for fast reconstruction methods. Noticeably, we rely on reconstructions from ultra-fast unrolled algorithms. The proposed method brings more reliable uncertainty estimations to our problem than existing alternatives.</description>

      <title>Templated Anisotropic Analyses of the LISA Galactic Foreground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will feature a prominent anisotropic astrophysical stochastic gravitational wave signal, arising from the tens of millions of unresolved mHz white dwarf binaries in the Milky Way: the Galactic foreground. While proper characterization of the Galactic foreground as a noise source will be crucial for every LISA science goal, it is extremely scientifically interesting in its own right, comprising -- along with $\sim10^4$ resolvable white dwarf binaries -- a complete sample of every mHz white dwarf binary in our Galaxy. We present a novel Bayesian analysis of the LISA Galactic foreground that directly treats its anisotropy via astrophysically-motivated templates, allowing for a direct connection between the observed time-modulation of the foreground amplitude and the underlying spatial distribution of the Milky Way. We validate the efficacy of this approach via simulated data and show that it is able to accurately recover the foreground spectrum in the presence of LISA instrumental noise.</description>

      <title>Retrievals on NIRCam transmission and emission spectra of HD 189733b with PLATON 6, a GPU code for the JWST era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the 2.4--5.0 \um JWST/NIRCam emission spectrum of HD 189733b, along with an independent re-reduction of the previously published transmission spectrum at the same wavelengths. We use an upgraded version of PLanetary Atmospheric Tool for Observer Noobs (PLATON) to retrieve atmospheric parameters from both geometries. In transit, we obtain [M/H]=$0.53_{-0.12}^{+0.13}$ and C/O=$0.41_{-0.12}^{+0.13}$, assuming a power-law haze and equilibrium chemistry with methane depletion. In eclipse, we obtain [M/H]=$0.68_{-0.11}^{+0.15}$ and C/O=$0.43_{-0.05}^{+0.06}$, assuming a clear atmosphere and equilibrium chemistry without methane depletion. These results are consistent with each other, and with a re-run of our previously published joint retrieval of HST and Spitzer transmission and emission spectra. Accounting for methane depletion decreases the C/O ratio by 0.14/0.04 (transmission/emission), but changing the limb cloud parameterization does not affect the C/O ratio by more than 0.06. We detect H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, and H$_2$S in both the NIRCam transmission and emission spectra, find that methane is depleted on the terminator, and confirm with VULCAN that photochemistry is a potential cause of this depletion. We also find tentative (1.8$\sigma$) evidence of a dayside thermal inversion at millibar pressures. Finally, we take this opportunity to introduce a new version of PLATON. PLATON 6 supports GPU computation, speeding up the code up to 10x. It also supports free retrievals using both volume mixing ratio and centered-log ratio priors; emission from planetary surfaces of different compositions; updated opacities at improved resolution; and Pareto smoothed importance sampling leave-one-out cross validation (PSIS-LOO).</description>

      <title>A physics-aware data-driven surrogate approach for fast atmospheric radiative transfer inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: FORUM (Far-infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring) was selected in 2019 as the ninth Earth Explorer mission by the European Space Agency (ESA). Its primary objective is to collect interferometric measurements in the Far-InfraRed (FIR) spectral range, which accounts for 50\% of Earth's outgoing longwave radiation emitted into space, and will be observed from space for the first time. Accurate measurements of the FIR at the top of the atmosphere are crucial for improving climate models. Current instruments are insufficient, necessitating the development of advanced computational techniques. To ensure the quality of the mission data, an End-to-End Simulator (E2ES) was developed to simulate the measurement process and evaluate the effects of instrument characteristics and environmental factors. The core challenge of the mission is solving the retrieval problem, which involves estimating atmospheric properties from the radiance spectra observed by the satellite. This problem is ill-posed and regularization techniques are necessary. In this work, we present a novel and fast data-driven approach to approximate the inverse mapping. In the first phase, we generate an initial approximation of the inverse mapping using only simulated FORUM data. In the second phase, we improve this approximation by introducing climatological data as a priori information and using a neural network to estimate the optimal regularization parameters. While our approach does not match the precision of full-physics retrieval methods, its key advantage is the ability to deliver results almost instantaneously, making it highly suitable for real-time applications. Furthermore, the proposed method can provide more accurate a priori estimates for full-physics methods, thereby improving the overall accuracy of the retrieved atmospheric profiles.</description>

      <title>High Precision Astrometry Science in the Context of Space Mission Prospectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometry is one of the oldest branches of astronomy which measures the position, the proper motion and parallax of celestial objects. Following the Hipparcos and Gaia missions that have measured several billions of them using global astrometry, we propose to increase astrometry precision on pointed objects using differential astrometry in a large field in order to unravel rocky planets in habitable zones of stars in the Sun vicinity and investigate the nature of dark matter in galactic environments as recommended by the ESA Senior Committee in the Voyager 2050 prospective. Substantial technology developments in a number of critical areas is needed in order to reach the highest required precision of sub-micro-arcsecond. One of them is CMOS image sensors using the stitching technique to merge the multiple design structures on the wafer and produce array with very large number of pixels. Another one is to calibrate the pixel positions using projecting modulating interferometric laser fringes on the array. Finally, the distortion of the optical system can be monitored and compensated using reference stars as metrology sources. The final precision depends on the diameter and the field of view of the telescope that is used as well as the time spent on each target. We present here the science goals that can be achieved with such missions either within the framework of an ESA Medium-class mission or even in the NASA most challenging Habitable Worlds Observatory, a large space telescope recommended by the American Astronomy and Astrophysics prospective for the 2020s and designed specifically to search for signs of life on planets orbiting other stars.</description>

      <title>KiDS-Legacy: angular galaxy clustering from deep surveys with complex selection effects</title>

Abstract: Photometric galaxy surveys, despite their limited resolution along the line of sight, encode rich information about the large-scale structure (LSS) of the Universe thanks to the large number density and extensive depth of the data. However, the complicated selection effects in wide and deep surveys will potentially cause significant bias in the angular two-point correlation function (2PCF) measured from those surveys. In this paper, we measure the 2PCF from the newly published KiDS-Legacy sample. Given an $r$-band $5\sigma$ magnitude limit of $24.8$ and survey footprint of $1347$ deg$^2$, it achieves an excellent combination of sky coverage and depth for such a measurement. We find that complex selection effects, primarily induced by varying seeing, introduce over-estimation of the 2PCF by approximately an order of magnitude. To correct for such effects, we apply a machine learning-based method to recover an ``organised random'' (OR) that presents the same selection pattern as the galaxy sample. The basic idea is to find the selection-induced clustering of galaxies using a combination of self-organising maps (SOM) and hierarchical clustering (HC). This unsupervised machine learning method is able to recover complicated selection effects without specifying their functional forms. We validate this ``SOM+HC'' method on mock deep galaxy samples with realistic systematics and selections derived from the KiDS-Legacy catalogue. Using mock data, we demonstrate that the OR delivers unbiased 2PCF cosmological parameter constraints, removing the $27\sigma$ offset in the galaxy bias parameter that is recovered when adopting uniform randoms. Blinded measurements on the real KiDS-Legacy data show that the corrected 2PCF is robust to the SOM+HC configuration near the optimal setup suggested by the mock tests. Our software is open-source for future usage.</description>

      <title>A geometric distortion solution specifically for historical observations and its implementation</title>

Abstract: Geometric distortion (GD) critically constrains the precision of astrometry. Using well-established methods to correct GD requires calibration observations, which can only be obtained using a special dithering strategy during the observation period. Unfortunately, this special observation mode is not often used, especially for the historical observations before those GD correction methods presented. As a result, some telescopes have no GD calibration observations for a long period, making it impossible to accurately determine the GD effect. This limits the value of the telescope observations in certain astrometric scenarios, such as using historical observations of moving targets in the solar system to improve their orbits. We investigated a method for handling GD that does not rely on the calibration observations. With this advantage, it can be used to solve the GD models of telescopes which were intractable in the past. The method was implemented in Python and released on GitHub. It was then applied to solve GD in the observations taken with the 1-m and 2.4-m telescopes at Yunnan Observatory. The resulting GD models were compared with those obtained using well-established methods to demonstrate the accuracy. Furthermore, the method was applied in the reduction of observations for two targets, the moon of Jupiter (Himalia) and the binary GSC2038-0293, to show its effectiveness. After GD correction, the astrometric results for both targets show improvements. Notably, the mean residual between observed and computed position (O-C) for the binary GSC2038-0293 decreased from 36 mas to 5 mas.</description>

      <title>Detecting changes in anthropogenic light emissions: limits due to atmospheric variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monitoring the evolution of the anthropogenic light emissions is a priority task in light pollution research. Among the complementary approaches that can be adopted to achieve this goal stand out those based on measuring the direct radiance of the sources at ground level or from low Earth orbit satellites, and on measuring the scattered radiance (known as artificial night sky brightness or skyglow) using networks of ground-based sensors. The terrestrial atmosphere is a variable medium interposed between the sources and the measuring instruments, and the fluctuation of its optical parameters sets a lower limit for the actual source emission changes that can be confidently detected. In this paper we analyze the effect of the fluctuations of the molecular and aerosol optical depths. It is shown that for reliably detecting changes in the anthropogenic light emissions of order ~1% per year, the inter-annual variability of the annual means of these atmospheric parameters in the measurement datasets must be carefully controlled or efficiently corrected for.</description>

      <title>Gen TSO: A General JWST Simulator for Exoplanet Times-series Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gen TSO is a noise calculator specifically tailored to simulate James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) time-series observations of exoplanets. Gen TSO enables the estimation of signal-to-noise ratios (S/N) for transit or eclipse depths through an interactive graphical interface, similar to the JWST Exposure Time Calculator (ETC). This interface leverages the ETC by combining its noise simulator, Pandeia, with additional exoplanet resources from the NASA Exoplanet Archive, the Gaia DR3 catalog of stellar sources, and the TrExoLiSTS database of JWST programs. The initial release of Gen TSO allows users to calculate S/Ns for all JWST instruments for the spectroscopic time-series modes available as of the Cycle 4 GO call. Additionally, Gen TSO allows users to simulate target acquisition on the science targets or, when needed, on nearby stellar targets within the visit splitting distance. This article presents an overview of Gen TSO and its main functionalities. Gen TSO has been designed to provide both an intuitive graphical interface and a modular API to access the resources mentioned above, facilitating planing and simulation of JWST exoplanet time-series observations. Gen TSO is available for installation via the Python Package Index and its documentation can be found at pcubillos.github.io/gen_tso.</description>
