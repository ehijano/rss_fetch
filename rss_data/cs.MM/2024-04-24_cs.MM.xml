      <title>Tile-Weighted Rate-Distortion Optimized Packet Scheduling for 360$^\circ$ VR Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A key challenge of 360$^\circ$ VR video streaming is ensuring high quality with limited network bandwidth. Currently, most studies focus on tile-based adaptive bitrate streaming to reduce bandwidth consumption, where resources in network nodes are not fully utilized. This article proposes a tile-weighted rate-distortion (TWRD) packet scheduling optimization system to reduce data volume and improve video quality. A multimodal spatial-temporal attention transformer is proposed to predict viewpoint with probability that is used to dynamically weight tiles and corresponding packets. The packet scheduling problem of determining which packets should be dropped is formulated as an optimization problem solved by a dynamic programming solution. Experiment results demonstrate the proposed method outperforms the existing methods under various conditions.</description>

      <title>SkinGEN: an Explainable Dermatology Diagnosis-to-Generation Framework with Interactive Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the continuous advancement of vision language models (VLMs) technology, remarkable research achievements have emerged in the dermatology field, the fourth most prevalent human disease category. However, despite these advancements, VLM still faces "hallucination" in dermatological diagnosis, and due to the inherent complexity of dermatological conditions, existing tools offer relatively limited support for user comprehension. We propose SkinGEN, a diagnosis-to-generation framework that leverages the stable diffusion (SD) method to generate reference demonstrations from diagnosis results provided by VLM, thereby enhancing the visual explainability for users. Through extensive experiments with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we identify optimal strategies for skin condition image generation. We conduct a user study with 32 participants evaluating both the system performance and explainability. Results demonstrate that SkinGEN significantly improves users' comprehension of VLM predictions and fosters increased trust in the diagnostic process. This work paves the way for more transparent and user-centric VLM applications in dermatology and beyond.</description>

      <title>G3R: Generating Rich and Fine-grained mmWave Radar Data from 2D Videos for Generalized Gesture Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter wave radar is gaining traction recently as a promising modality for enabling pervasive and privacy-preserving gesture recognition. However, the lack of rich and fine-grained radar datasets hinders progress in developing generalized deep learning models for gesture recognition across various user postures (e.g., standing, sitting), positions, and scenes. To remedy this, we resort to designing a software pipeline that exploits wealthy 2D videos to generate realistic radar data, but it needs to address the challenge of simulating diversified and fine-grained reflection properties of user gestures. To this end, we design G3R with three key components: (i) a gesture reflection point generator expands the arm's skeleton points to form human reflection points; (ii) a signal simulation model simulates the multipath reflection and attenuation of radar signals to output the human intensity map; (iii) an encoder-decoder model combines a sampling module and a fitting module to address the differences in number and distribution of points between generated and real-world radar data for generating realistic radar data. We implement and evaluate G3R using 2D videos from public data sources and self-collected real-world radar data, demonstrating its superiority over other state-of-the-art approaches for gesture recognition.</description>

      <title>HOIN: High-Order Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INR) suffer from worsening spectral bias, which results in overly smooth solutions to the inverse problem. To deal with this problem, we propose a universal framework for processing inverse problems called \textbf{High-Order Implicit Neural Representations (HOIN)}. By refining the traditional cascade structure to foster high-order interactions among features, HOIN enhances the model's expressive power and mitigates spectral bias through its neural tangent kernel's (NTK) strong diagonal properties, accelerating and optimizing inverse problem resolution. By analyzing the model's expression space, high-order derivatives, and the NTK matrix, we theoretically validate the feasibility of HOIN. HOIN realizes 1 to 3 dB improvements in most inverse problems, establishing a new state-of-the-art recovery quality and training efficiency, thus providing a new general paradigm for INR and paving the way for it to solve the inverse problem.</description>

      <title>Other Tokens Matter: Exploring Global and Local Features of Vision Transformers for Object Re-Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object Re-Identification (Re-ID) aims to identify and retrieve specific objects from images captured at different places and times. Recently, object Re-ID has achieved great success with the advances of Vision Transformers (ViT). However, the effects of the global-local relation have not been fully explored in Transformers for object Re-ID. In this work, we first explore the influence of global and local features of ViT and then further propose a novel Global-Local Transformer (GLTrans) for high-performance object Re-ID. We find that the features from last few layers of ViT already have a strong representational ability, and the global and local information can mutually enhance each other. Based on this fact, we propose a Global Aggregation Encoder (GAE) to utilize the class tokens of the last few Transformer layers and learn comprehensive global features effectively. Meanwhile, we propose the Local Multi-layer Fusion (LMF) which leverages both the global cues from GAE and multi-layer patch tokens to explore the discriminative local representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method achieves superior performance on four object Re-ID benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Large Language Model is a Human-Aligned Annotator for Text-to-Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the exceptional potentials of leveraging human preference datasets to refine text-to-image generative models, enhancing the alignment between generated images and textual prompts. Despite these advances, current human preference datasets are either prohibitively expensive to construct or suffer from a lack of diversity in preference dimensions, resulting in limited applicability for instruction tuning in open-source text-to-image generative models and hinder further exploration. To address these challenges and promote the alignment of generative models through instruction tuning, we leverage multimodal large language models to create VisionPrefer, a high-quality and fine-grained preference dataset that captures multiple preference aspects. We aggregate feedback from AI annotators across four aspects: prompt-following, aesthetic, fidelity, and harmlessness to construct VisionPrefer. To validate the effectiveness of VisionPrefer, we train a reward model VP-Score over VisionPrefer to guide the training of text-to-image generative models and the preference prediction accuracy of VP-Score is comparable to human annotators. Furthermore, we use two reinforcement learning methods to supervised fine-tune generative models to evaluate the performance of VisionPrefer, and extensive experimental results demonstrate that VisionPrefer significantly improves text-image alignment in compositional image generation across diverse aspects, e.g., aesthetic, and generalizes better than previous human-preference metrics across various image distributions. Moreover, VisionPrefer indicates that the integration of AI-generated synthetic data as a supervisory signal is a promising avenue for achieving improved alignment with human preferences in vision generative models.</description>

      <title>MIMOSA: Human-AI Co-Creation of Computational Spatial Audio Effects on Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial audio offers more immersive video consumption experiences to viewers; however, creating and editing spatial audio often expensive and requires specialized equipment and skills, posing a high barrier for amateur video creators. We present MIMOSA, a human-AI co-creation tool that enables amateur users to computationally generate and manipulate spatial audio effects. For a video with only monaural or stereo audio, MIMOSA automatically grounds each sound source to the corresponding sounding object in the visual scene and enables users to further validate and fix the errors in the locations of sounding objects. Users can also augment the spatial audio effect by flexibly manipulating the sounding source positions and creatively customizing the audio effect. The design of MIMOSA exemplifies a human-AI collaboration approach that, instead of utilizing state-of art end-to-end "black-box" ML models, uses a multistep pipeline that aligns its interpretable intermediate results with the user's workflow. A lab user study with 15 participants demonstrates MIMOSA's usability, usefulness, expressiveness, and capability in creating immersive spatial audio effects in collaboration with users.</description>

      <title>Every Breath You Don't Take: Deepfake Speech Detection Using Breath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deepfake speech represents a real and growing threat to systems and society. Many detectors have been created to aid in defense against speech deepfakes. While these detectors implement myriad methodologies, many rely on low-level fragments of the speech generation process. We hypothesize that breath, a higher-level part of speech, is a key component of natural speech and thus improper generation in deepfake speech is a performant discriminator. To evaluate this, we create a breath detector and leverage this against a custom dataset of online news article audio to discriminate between real/deepfake speech. Additionally, we make this custom dataset publicly available to facilitate comparison for future work. Applying our simple breath detector as a deepfake speech discriminator on in-the-wild samples allows for accurate classification (perfect 1.0 AUPRC and 0.0 EER on test data) across 33.6 hours of audio. We compare our model with the state-of-the-art SSL-wav2vec model and show that this complex deep learning model completely fails to classify the same in-the-wild samples (0.72 AUPRC and 0.99 EER).</description>

      <title>SMPLer: Taming Transformers for Monocular 3D Human Shape and Pose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing Transformers for monocular 3D human shape and pose estimation typically have a quadratic computation and memory complexity with respect to the feature length, which hinders the exploitation of fine-grained information in high-resolution features that is beneficial for accurate reconstruction. In this work, we propose an SMPL-based Transformer framework (SMPLer) to address this issue. SMPLer incorporates two key ingredients: a decoupled attention operation and an SMPL-based target representation, which allow effective utilization of high-resolution features in the Transformer. In addition, based on these two designs, we also introduce several novel modules including a multi-scale attention and a joint-aware attention to further boost the reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SMPLer against existing 3D human shape and pose estimation methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Notably, the proposed algorithm achieves an MPJPE of 45.2 mm on the Human3.6M dataset, improving upon Mesh Graphormer by more than 10% with fewer than one-third of the parameters. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/xuxy09/SMPLer.</description>

      <title>X-Adapter: Adding Universal Compatibility of Plugins for Upgraded Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02238v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce X-Adapter, a universal upgrader to enable the pretrained plug-and-play modules (e.g., ControlNet, LoRA) to work directly with the upgraded text-to-image diffusion model (e.g., SDXL) without further retraining. We achieve this goal by training an additional network to control the frozen upgraded model with the new text-image data pairs. In detail, X-Adapter keeps a frozen copy of the old model to preserve the connectors of different plugins. Additionally, X-Adapter adds trainable mapping layers that bridge the decoders from models of different versions for feature remapping. The remapped features will be used as guidance for the upgraded model. To enhance the guidance ability of X-Adapter, we employ a null-text training strategy for the upgraded model. After training, we also introduce a two-stage denoising strategy to align the initial latents of X-Adapter and the upgraded model. Thanks to our strategies, X-Adapter demonstrates universal compatibility with various plugins and also enables plugins of different versions to work together, thereby expanding the functionalities of diffusion community. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments and the results show that X-Adapter may facilitate wider application in the upgraded foundational diffusion model.</description>

      <title>Seeing is Believing: Mitigating Hallucination in Large Vision-Language Models via CLIP-Guided Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are susceptible to object hallucinations, an issue in which their generated text contains non-existent objects, greatly limiting their reliability and practicality. Current approaches often rely on the model's token likelihoods or other internal information, instruction tuning on additional datasets, or incorporating complex external tools. We first perform empirical analysis on sentence-level LVLM hallucination, finding that CLIP similarity to the image acts as a stronger and more robust indicator of hallucination compared to token likelihoods. Motivated by this, we introduce our CLIP-Guided Decoding (CGD) approach, a straightforward but effective training-free approach to reduce object hallucination at decoding time. CGD uses CLIP to guide the model's decoding process by enhancing visual grounding of generated text with the image. Experiments demonstrate that CGD effectively mitigates object hallucination across multiple LVLM families while preserving the utility of text generation. Codes are available at https://github.com/d-ailin/CLIP-Guided-Decoding.</description>
