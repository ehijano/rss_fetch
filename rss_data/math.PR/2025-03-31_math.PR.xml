      <title>On the convergence of the Euler-Maruyama scheme for McKean-Vlasov SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the well-posedness of the backward Kolmogorov partial differential equation in the Wasserstein space, we analyze the strong and weak convergence rates for approximating the unique solution of a class of McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations via the Euler-Maruyama time discretization scheme applied to the associated system of interacting particles. We consider two distinct settings. In the first, the coefficients and test function are irregular, but the diffusion coefficient remains non-degenerate. Leveraging the smoothing properties of the underlying heat kernel, we establish the strong and weak convergence rates of the scheme in terms of the number of particles N and the mesh size h. In the second setting, where both the coefficients and the test function are smooth, we demonstrate that the weak error rate at the level of the semigroup is optimal, achieving an error of order N -1 + h.</description>

      <title>Multivariate strong subexponential distributions: properties and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the class of multivariate strong subexponential distributions and of multivariate strongly subexponential distributions. Some first properties are verified, as for example a type of multivariate analogue of Kesten's inequality, the closure property with respect to convolution, and the conditional closure property with respect to convolution roots. Next, we establish the the single big jump principle for the randomly stopped sums, under the assumption that the random vectors in the summation belong to the class of multivariate strong subexponential distributions. Here the conditions of the counting random variable are weaker in comparison with them in multivariate subexponential class. Further, we establish uniform asymptotic estimates for the precise large deviations in multivariate set up, both for random and nonrandom sums, when the distribution of the summands belongs to the class of multivariate strongly subexponential distributions. Finally, we provide an application in a nonstandard risk model, with independent and identically distributed claim vectors, from the class of multivariate strong subexponential distributions and in the presence of constant interest force.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic analysis of optimal multi-pivot QuickSort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a multi-pivot QuickSort algorithm using $K\in\mathbb{N}$ pivot elements to partition a nonsorted list into $K+1$ sublists in order to proceed recursively on these sublists.
  For the partitioning stage, various strategies are in use. We focus on the strategy that minimizes the expected number of key comparisons in the standard random model, where the list is given as a uniformly permuted list of distinct elements.
  We derive asymptotic expansions for the expectation and variance of the number of key comparisons as well as a limit law for all $K\in\mathbb{N}$, where the convergence holds for all (exponential) moments. For $K\le 4$ we also bound the rate of convergence within the Wasserstein and Kolmogorov--Smirnov distance.
  Our analysis of the expectation is based on classical results for random $m$-ary search trees. For the remaining results, combinatorial considerations are used to make the contraction method applicable.</description>

      <title>Chemical distance for smooth Gaussian fields in higher dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gaussian percolation can be seen as the generalization of standard Bernoulli percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^d$. Instead of a random discrete configuration on a lattice, we consider a continuous Gaussian field $f$ and we study the topological and geometric properties of the random excursion set $\mathcal{E}_\ell(f) := \{x\in \mathbb{R}^d\ |\ f(x)\geq -\ell\}$ where $\ell\in \mathbb{R}$ is called a level. It is known that for a wide variety of fields $f$, there exists a phase transition at some critical level $\ell_c$. When $\ell&gt; \ell_c$, the excursion set $\mathcal{E}_\ell(f)$ presents a unique unbounded component while if $\ell&lt;\ell_c$ there are only bounded components in $\mathcal{E}_\ell(f)$. In the supercritical regime, $\ell&gt;\ell_c$, we study the geometry of the unbounded cluster. Inspired by the work of Peter Antal and Agoston Pisztora for the Bernoulli model \cite{Antal}, we introduce the chemical distance between two points $x$ and $y$ as the Euclidean length of the shortest path connecting these points and staying in $\mathcal{E}_\ell(f)$. In this paper, we show that when $\ell&gt;-\ell_c$ then with high probability, the chemical distance between two points has a behavior close to the Euclidean distance between those two points.</description>

      <title>Beta Polytopes and Beta Cones: An Exactly Solvable Model in Geometric Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X_1,\ldots, X_n$ be independent random points in the unit ball of $\mathbb R^d$ such that $X_i$ follows a beta distribution with the density proportional to $(1-\|x\|^2)^{\beta_i}1_{\{\|x\| &lt;1\}}$. Here, $\beta_1,\ldots, \beta_n&gt; -1$ are parameters. We study random polytopes of the form $[X_1,\ldots,X_n]$, called beta polytopes. We determine explicitly expected values of several functionals of these polytopes including the number of $k$-dimensional faces, the volume, the intrinsic volumes, the total $k$-volume of the $k$-skeleton, various angle sums, and the $S$-functional which generalizes and unifies many of the above examples. We identify and study the central object needed to analyze beta polytopes: beta cones. For these, we determine explicitly expected values of several functionals including the solid angle, conic intrinsic volumes and the number of $k$-dimensional faces. We identify expected conic intrinsic volumes of beta cones as a crucial quantity needed to express all the functionals mentioned above. We obtain a formula for these expected conic intrinsic volumes in terms of a function $\Theta$ for which we provide an explicit integral representation. The proofs combine methods from integral and stochastic geometry with the study of the analytic properties of the function $\Theta$.</description>

      <title>A limit theorem for the total progeny distribution of multi-type branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multi-type branching process is defined as a random tree with labeled vertices, where each vertex produces offspring independently according to the same multivariate probability distribution. We demonstrate that in realizations of the multi-type branching process, the relative frequencies of the different types in the whole tree converge to a fixed ratio, while the probability distribution for the total size of the process decays exponentially. The results hold under the assumption that all moments of the offspring distributions exist. The proof uses a combination of the arborescent Lagrange inversion formula, a measure tilting argument, and a local limit theorem. We illustrate our concentration result by showing applications to random graphs and multi-component coagulation processes.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit for the random walk on critical lattice trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a scaling limit theorem for the simple random walk on critical lattice trees in $\mathbb{Z}^d$, for $d\geq 8$. The scaling limit is the Brownian motion on the Integrated Super-Brownian Excursion (BISE) which is the same one that we have identified earlier for other simpler models of anomalous diffusion on critical graphs in large enough dimension. The proof of this theorem is based on a combination of the tools of lace-expansion (contained in the articles \cite{CFHP} and \cite{CFHP2}), and a new and general convergence theorem.</description>

      <title>CLT for LES of correlated Non-Hermitian Random Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider two $n\times n$ non-Hermitian random matrices such that the $ij$th entry of one matrix is correlated with the $ij$th entry of the other matrix. However, the entries of any particular matrix are i.i.d. random variables. We study the asymptotic behavior of the combined spectrum, and the limit of the linear eigenvalue statistic defined on the combined spectrum. We show that if the random variables are centered with variance $1/n$ and having finite moments, then the centered \textit{Linear Eigenvalue Statistics} (LESs) converge jointly to a bivariate Gaussian distribution. We assumed that the test function used in the LES belongs to Sobolev $H^{2+\delta}$ space. The variance of the limiting Gaussian distribution depends on correlation structure of the matrix entries and the fourth order mixed cumulants of the matrix entries. This generalizes the previous results by Rider, Silverstein (2006), Cipolloni, Erd\H{o}s, Schr\"oder (2023). In particular, we obtain the limiting LES of random centrosymmetric matrices.</description>

      <title>Operator product expansions of derivative fields in the sine-Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we initiate the study of operator product expansions (OPEs) for the sine-Gordon model. For simplicity, we focus on the model below the first threshold of collapse ($\beta&lt;4\pi$) and on the singular terms in OPEs of derivative-type fields $\partial \varphi$ and $\bar\partial\varphi$. We prove that compared to corresponding free field OPEs, the sine-Gordon OPEs develop logarithmic singularities and generate Wick ordered exponentials. Our approach for proving the OPEs relies heavily on Onsager-type inequalities and associated moment bounds for GFF correlation functions involving Wick ordered exponentials of the free field.</description>

      <title>Selection of the fittest or selection of the luckiest: the emergence of Goodhart's law in evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biological evolution depends on the passing down to subsequent generations of genetic information encoding beneficial traits, and on the removal of unfit individuals by a selection mechanism. However, selection acts on phenotypes, and is affected by random contingencies. Thus, a combination of fitness and luck determines which individuals will successfully reproduce and give rise to the next generation. To understand how randomness in the selection mechanism affects the long-term patterns of evolution, we studied an idealized evolution model. We show through simulations and mathematical analysis, that the speed of adaptation increases with increasing selection pressure only up to a threshold. Beyond the threshold, any increase of the selection pressure results in more weight given to random effects rather than on genetic fitness in determining which individuals will successfully reproduce. This severely reduces the speed of adaptation and the diversity in the gene pool. Our findings may be considered as a biological instance of Goodhart's law: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure". Finally, we show that this intricate response of evolution to natural selection can be mathematically explained by a novel phase transition for pulled traveling waves.</description>

      <title>High order integration of stochastic dynamics on Riemannian manifolds with frozen flow methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new class of numerical methods for solving stochastic differential equations with additive noise on general Riemannian manifolds with high weak order of accuracy. In opposition to the popular approach with projection methods, the proposed methods are intrinsic: they only rely on geometric operations and avoid coordinates and embeddings. We provide a robust and general convergence analysis and an algebraic formalism of exotic planar Butcher series for the computation of order conditions at any high order. To illustrate the methodology, an explicit method of second weak order is introduced, and several numerical experiments confirm the theoretical findings and extend the approach for the sampling of the invariant measure of Riemannian Langevin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Inferential Motion Planning Using Heavy-Tailed Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots rely on motion planning to navigate safely and efficiently while performing various tasks. In this paper, we investigate motion planning through Bayesian inference, where motion plans are inferred based on planning objectives and constraints. However, existing Bayesian motion planning methods often struggle to explore low-probability regions of the planning space, where high-quality plans may reside. To address this limitation, we propose the use of heavy-tailed distributions -- specifically, Student's-$t$ distributions -- to enhance probabilistic inferential search for motion plans. We develop a novel sequential single-pass smoothing approach that integrates Student's-$t$ distribution with Monte Carlo sampling. A special case of this approach is ensemble Kalman smoothing, which depends on short-tailed Gaussian distributions. We validate the proposed approach through simulations in autonomous vehicle motion planning, demonstrating its superior performance in planning, sampling efficiency, and constraint satisfaction compared to ensemble Kalman smoothing. While focused on motion planning, this work points to the broader potential of heavy-tailed distributions in enhancing probabilistic decision-making in robotics.</description>

      <title>Short-time behavior of the At-The-Money implied volatility for the jump-diffusion stochastic volatility Bachelier model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we use Malliavin Calculus techniques in order to obtain expressions for the short-time behavior of the at-the-money implied volatility (ATM-IV) level and skew for a jump-diffusion stock price. The diffusion part is assumed to be the stochastic volatility Bachelier model and the jumps are modeled by a pure-jump L\'evy process with drift so that the stock price is a martingale. Regarding the level, we show that the short-time behavior of the ATM-IV level is the same for all pure-jump L\'evy processes and, regarding the skew, we give conditions on the law of the jumps for the skew to exist. We also give several numerical examples of stochastic volatilities and L\'evy processes that confirm the theoretical results found in the paper.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for Generalized Excited Random Walks in time-inhomogeneous Bernoulli environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.12228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a variant of the Generalized Excited Random Walk (GERW) on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ introduced by Menshikov, Popov, Ram\'irez and Vachkovskaia in [Ann. Probab. 40 (5), 2012]. It consists in a particular version of the model studied in [arXiv preprint arXiv:2211.05715, 2022] where excitation may or may not occur according to a time-dependent probability. Specifically, given $\{p_n\}_{n \ge 1}$, $p_n \in (0, 1]$ for all $n \ge 1$, whenever the process visits a site at time $n$ for the first time, with probability $p_n$ it gains a drift in a fixed direction. Otherwise, it behaves as a $d$-martingale with zero-mean vector. We refer to the model as a GERW in time-inhomogeneous Bernoulli environment, in short, $p_n$-GERW.
  Assuming bounded jumps and $p_n \approx n^{-\beta}$, we show a series of results for the $p_n$-\Name{} depending on the value of $\beta$ and on the dimension $d$. Specifically, for every $\beta\in(0,1]$ and $d=2$ or $d&gt;h(\beta)$, with $h$ a decreasing function of $\beta$, we prove a SLLN for the range, while for $\beta&lt;1/2$ we prove a sub-ballistic SLLN for the process whenever the SLLN for the range holds. We also study the $p_n$-\Name{} under diffusive scaling and we obtain a Functional Central Limit Theorem for $\beta &gt; 1/2$ and $d\geq 2$, or $\beta=1/2$ and $d=2$. Finally, for $\beta=1/2$ and $d&gt;22$ we show that the diffusively rescaled $p_n$-\Name{} converges in distribution to a Brownian Motion plus a multiple of the square root of time.</description>

Abstract: We consider sequences of finite weighted random graphs that converge locally to unimodular i.i.d. weighted random trees. When the weights are atomless, we prove that the matchings of maximal weight converge locally to a matching on the limiting tree. For this purpose, we introduce and study unimodular matchings on weighted unimodular random trees as well as a notion of optimality for these objects. In this context, we prove that, in law, there is a unique optimal unimodular matching for a given unimodular tree. We then prove that this law is the local limit of the sequence of matchings of maximal weight. Along the way, we also show that this law is characterised by an equation derived from a message passing algorithm.</description>

      <title>The weak averaging principle of stochastic functional partial differential equations with H$\ddot{\text{o}}$lder continuous coefficients and infinite delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the weak averaging principle for stochastic functional partial differential equations (in short, SFPDEs) with H$\ddot{\text{o}}$lder continuous coefficients and infinite delay by a new generalized coupling approach. Firstly, we rigorously establish the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions for a specific class of finite-dimensional systems by the generalized coupling approach. Then we extend these results to their infinite-dimensional counterparts using the variational approach and Galerkin projection technique. Subsequently, we establish the averaging principle for SFPDEs with infinite delay in the weak sense, i.e., we prove that the solution of the original system converges in law to that of the averaged system on a finite interval $[0,T]$ as the small parameter $\varepsilon\to 0$. To illustrate our findings, we present two applications: stochastic generalized porous media equations and stochastic reaction-diffusion equations.</description>

      <title>Existence and phase structure of random inverse limit measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Analogous to Kolmogorov's theorem for the existence of stochastic processes describing random functions, we consider theorems for the existence of stochastic processes describing random measures, as limits of inverse measure systems. Specifically, given a coherent inverse system of random (bounded/signed/positive/probability) histograms on refining partitions, we study conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a corresponding random inverse limit, a Radon probability measure on the space of (bounded/signed/positive/probability) measures. Depending on the topology (vague/tight/weak/total-variational) and Kingman's notion of complete randomness, the limiting random measure is in one of four phases, distinguished by their degrees of concentration (support/domination/discreteness). Results are applied in the well-known Dirichlet and Polya tree families of random probability measures and in a new Gaussian family of signed inverse limit measures. In these three families, examples of all four phases occur and we describe the corresponding conditions on defining parameters.</description>

      <title>Rough Heston model as the scaling limit of bivariate cumulative heavy-tailed INAR($\infty$) processes and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper establishes a novel link between nearly unstable cumulative heavy-tailed integer-valued autoregressive (INAR($\infty$)) processes and the rough Heston model via discrete scaling limits. We prove that a sequence of bivariate cumulative INAR($\infty$) processes converge in law to the rough Heston model under appropriate scaling conditions, providing a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding how microstructural order flow drives macroscopic prices following rough volatility dynamics. Our theoretical framework extends the scaling limit techniques from Hawkes processes to the INAR($\infty$) setting. Hence we can carry out efficient Monte Carlo simulation of the rough Heston model through simulating the corresponding approximating INAR($\infty$) processes, which provides an alternative discrete-time simulation method to the Euler-Maruyama method. Extensive numerical experiments illustrate the improved accuracy and efficiency of the proposed simulation scheme as compared to the literature, in the valuation of European options, and also path-dependent options such as arithmetic Asian options, lookback options and barrier options.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a Stochastic Particle System to the Continuous Generalized Exchange-Driven Growth Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The continuous generalized exchange-driven growth model (CGEDG) is a system of integro-differential equations describing the evolution of cluster mass under mass exchange. The rate of exchange depends on the masses of the clusters involved and the mass being exchanged. This can be viewed as both a continuous generalization of the exchange-driven growth model and a coagulation-fragmentation equation that generalizes the continuous Smoluchowski equation.
  Starting from a Markov jump process that describes a finite stochastic interacting particle system with exchange dynamics, we prove the weak law of large numbers for this process for sublinearly growing kernels in the mean-field limit. We establish the tightness of the stochastic process on a measure-valued Skorokhod space induced by the $1$-Wasserstein metric, from which we deduce the existence of solutions to the (CGEDG) system. The solution is shown to have a Lebesgue density under suitable assumptions on the initial data. Moreover, within the class of solutions with density, we establish the uniqueness under slightly more restrictive conditions on the kernel.</description>

      <title>Post-Lie algebras of derivations and regularity structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.02484v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a commutative algebra $A$, we exhibit a canonical structure of post-Lie algebra on the space $A\otimes Der(A)$ where $Der(A)$ is the space of derivations on $A$, in order to use the machinery given in [Guin &amp; Oudom 2008] and [Ebrahimi-Fard &amp; Lundervold &amp; Munthe-Kaas 2015] and to define a Hopf algebra structure on the associated enveloping algebra with a natural action on $A$. We apply these results to the setting of [Linares &amp; Otto &amp; Tempelmayr 2023], giving a simpler and more efficient construction of their action and extending the recent work [Bruned &amp; Katsetsiadis]. This approach gives an optimal setting to perform explicit computations in the associated structure group.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis of controlled particle systems arising in deep learning: from finite to infinite sample size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with a class of neural SDEs and studies the limiting behavior of the associated sampled optimal control problems as the sample size grows to infinity. The neural SDEs with N samples can be linked to the N-particle systems with centralized control. We analyze the Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equation corresponding to the N-particle system and establish regularity results which are uniform in N. The uniform regularity estimates are obtained by the stochastic maximum principle and the analysis of a backward stochastic Riccati equation. Using these uniform regularity results, we show the convergence of the minima of objective functionals and optimal parameters of the neural SDEs as the sample size N tends to infinity. The limiting objects can be identified with suitable functions defined on the Wasserstein space of Borel probability measures. Furthermore, quantitative algebraic convergence rates are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Some remarks on the effect of risk sharing and diversification for infinite mean risks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10139v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The basic principle of any version of insurance is the paradigm that exchanging risk by sharing it in a pool is beneficial for the participants. In case of independent risks with a finite mean this is the case for risk averse decision makers. The situation may be very different in case of infinite mean models. In that case it is known that risk sharing may have a negative effect, which is sometimes called the nondiversification trap. This phenomenon is well known for infinite mean stable distributions. In a series of recent papers similar results for infinite mean Pareto and Fr\'echet distributions have been obtained. We further investigate this property by showing that many of these results can be obtained as special cases of a simple result demonstrating that this holds for any distribution that is more skewed than a Cauchy distribution. We also relate this to the situation of deadly catastrophic risks, where we assume a positive probability for an infinite value. That case gives a very simple intuition why this phenomenon can occur for such catastrophic risks. We also mention several open problems and conjectures in this context.</description>

      <title>Average sizes of mixed character sums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the average size of a mixed character sum $$\sum_{1\le n \le x} \chi(n) e(n\theta) w(n/x)$$ (for a suitable smooth function $w$) is on the order of $\sqrt{x}$ for all irrational real $\theta$ satisfying a weak Diophantine condition, where $\chi$ is drawn from the family of Dirichlet characters modulo a large prime $r$ and where $x\le r$. In contrast, it was proved by Harper that the average size is $o(\sqrt{x})$ for rational $\theta$. Certain quadratic Diophantine equations play a key role in the present paper.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations of blowup time in a simple model of a super-Malthusian catastrophe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the paradigm of a super-Maltusian population catastrophe, we study a simple stochastic population model which exhibits a finite-time blowup of the population size and is strongly affected by intrinsic noise. We focus on the fluctuations of the blowup time $T$ in the asexual binary reproduction model $2A \to 3A$, where two identical individuals give birth to a third one. We determine exactly the average blowup time as well as the probability distribution $\mathcal{P}(T)$ of the blowup time and its moments. In particular, we show that the long-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to \infty)$ is purely exponential. The short-time tail $\mathcal{P}(T\to 0)$ exhibits an essential singularity at $T=0$, and it is dominated by a single (the most likely) population trajectory which we determine analytically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We settle two questions on sequence A120243 in the OEIS that were raised by Clark Kimberling and partly solve a conjecture of Van de Lune and Arias de Reyna. We extend Kimberling's questions to the framework of deterministic random walks, automatic sequences, and linear recurrences. Our results indicate that there may be a deeper connection between these structures. In particular, we conjecture that the records of deterministic random walks are $\xi$-Ostrowski automatic for a quadratic rotation number $\xi$.</description>
