      <title>Topological frustration in twisted, elastic ribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topology is an important determinant of the behavior of a great number of condensed-matter systems, but until recently has played a minor role in elasticity. We develop a theory for the deformations of a class of twisted non-Euclidean sheets which have a symmetry based on the celebrated Bonnet isometry. We show that non-orientability is an obstruction to realizing the symmetry globally, and induces a geometric phase that captures a memory analogous to a previously identified one in 2D metamaterials. However, we show that some of the orientable ribbons also obstruct realizing the symmetry globally. This new obstruction is mediated by the complex interplay between strain, geometry, and topology.</description>

      <title>Shape Changes of Liquid Crystal Elastomers Swollen by Low Molecular Weight Liquid Crystal Drops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An elastomer swelling actuator deforms by absorbing a fluid, thus generating mechanical movement. We show that depositing small droplets of low molecular weight liquid crystal on liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) films leads to shape changes and bending actuation. It is found that the radially symmetric LCE director alignments provide radially symmetric hat shapes, while swelling LCEs with uniform director structure leads to arch shapes. Hybrid samples (different director alignments on two sides) lead to more complicated bent shapes. All the observed shapes can be explained by the diffusion that mainly progresses along the direction normal to the director of the LCE. The swelling induced bending force is elevating the top of the swollen LCE up to a factor of 30, providing a powerful and long-lasting actuation. These observations may lead to applications in various fields, like sealants, soft robotics and biomedical devices.</description>

      <title>Wrapping nonspherical vesicles at bio-membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wrapping of particles and vesicles by lipid bilayer membranes is a fundamental process in cellular transport and targeted drug delivery. Here, we investigate the wrapping behavior of nonspherical vesicles, such as ellipsoidal, prolate, oblate, and stomatocytes, by systematically varying the bending rigidity of the vesicle membrane and the tension of the planar membrane. Using the Helfrich Hamiltonian, triangulated membrane models, and energy minimization techniques, we predict multiple stable wrapping states and identify the conditions for their coexistence. Our results demonstrate that softer vesicles bind more easily to planar membranes; however, achieving complete wrapping requires significantly higher adhesion strengths compared to rigid particles. As membrane tension increases, deep-wrapped states disappear at a triple point where shallow-wrapped, deep-wrapped, and complete-wrapped states coexist. The coordinates of the triple point are highly sensitive to the vesicle shape and stiffness. For stomatocytes, increasing stiffness shifts the triple point to higher adhesion strengths and membrane tensions, while for oblates it shifts to lower values, influenced by shape changes during wrapping. Oblate shapes are preferred in shallow-wrapped states and stomatocytes in deep-wrapped states. In contrast to hard particles, where optimal adhesion strength for complete wrapping occurs at tensionless membranes, complete wrapping of soft vesicles requires finite membrane tension for optimal adhesion strength. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between vesicle deformability, shape, and membrane properties, advancing our understanding of endocytosis and the design of advanced biomimetic delivery systems.</description>

      <title>Egg yolk as a model for gelation: from rheometry to flow physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Egg yolks are an excellent model for studying sol-gel transitions, particularly the power law viscoelasticity that defines the critical point of gelation. However, prior studies lack comprehensive datasets and fail to visualize flow behavior linked to temperature and time-dependent linear and nonlinear rheology. Here we present a detailed dataset characterizing egg yolk viscoelasticity across temperature, time, and forcing amplitude using oscillatory shear, step strain, step stress, and constant high strain rate. Novel protorheology visualizations link rheological properties with observable flow behavior. Our findings highlight the nuanced determination of the critical gel point, emphasizing observation timescale dependencies. We compare methods to identify critical temperatures for gelation, including power law viscoelasticity, moduli crossover, diverging zero-shear viscosity, and emerging equilibrium elastic modulus, while visualizing flow consequences near these transitions. Egg yolk is an accessible non-toxic material relevant to the physicist and the chef alike, making it ideal for understanding the rheology of critical gels. By integrating protorheology photos and videos with rigorous rheometric data, we deepen the understanding of critical gels, with broader impacts for teaching and modeling sol-gel transitions.</description>

      <title>Active Solids: Defect Self-Propulsion Without Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The self-propulsion of +1/2 topological defects is a hallmark of active nematic fluids, where the defects are advected by the flow field they themselves generate. In this paper we propose a minimal model for defect self-propulsion in a nematic active solid: a linear elastic medium with an embedded nematic texture that generates active stress and associated elastic strains. We show that such coupling gives rise to self-propelled +1/2 defects that move relative to the elastic medium by local remodeling of the nematic texture without advection. This mechanism is fundamentally different from the fluid case and can lead to unbinding of defect pairs and stabilization of +1 defects. Our findings might help explain how orientational order, of, for example, muscle fibers, is reconfigured during morphogenesis in solid-like tissues. The proposed mechanism may, for instance, control motility and merging of +1/2 defects, which play a crucial role in setting up the body axis during Hydra regeneration.</description>

      <title>Microscopic contact line dynamics dictate the emergent behaviors of particle rafts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluid-fluid interfaces laden with discrete particles behave curiously like continuous elastic sheets, leading to their applications in emulsion and foam stabilization. Although existing continuum models can qualitatively capture the elastic buckling of these particle-laden interfaces -- often referred to as particle rafts -- under compression, they fail to link their macroscopic collective properties to the microscopic behaviors of individual particles. Thus, phenomena such as particle expulsion from the compressed rafts remain unexplained. Here, by combining systematic experiments with first-principle modeling, we reveal how the macroscopic mechanical properties of particle rafts emerge from particle-scale interactions. We construct a phase diagram that delineates the conditions under which a particle raft collapses via collective folding versus single-particle expulsion. Guided by this theoretical framework, we demonstrate control over the raft's failure mode by tuning the physicochemical properties of individual particles. Our study highlights the previously overlooked dual nature of particle rafts and exemplifies how collective dynamics can arise from discrete components with simple interactions.</description>

      <title>Diffuse-charge dynamics across a capacitive interface in a DC electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cells and cellular organelles are encapsulated by nanometrically thin membranes whose main component is a lipid bilayer. In the presence of electric fields, the ion-impermeable lipid bilayer acts as a capacitor and supports a potential difference across the membrane. We analyze the charging dynamics of a planar membrane separating bulk solutions with different electrolyte concentrations upon the application of an applied uniform DC electric field. The membrane is modeled as a zero-thickness capacitive interface. The evolution of the electric potential and ions distributions in the bulk are solved for using the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations. Asymptotic solutions are derived in the limit of thin Debye layers and weak fields (compared to the thermal electric potential).</description>

      <title>Why is the strength of a polymer network so low?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments have long shown that a polymer network of covalent bonds commonly ruptures at a stress that is orders of magnitude lower than the strength of the covalent bonds. Here we investigate this large reduction in strength by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We show that the network ruptures by sequentially breaking a small fraction of bonds, and that each broken bond lies on the minimum "shortest path". The shortest path is the path of the fewest bonds that connect two monomers at the opposite ends of the network. As the network is stretched, the minimum shortest path straightens and bears high tension set by covalent bonds, while most strands off the path deform by entropic elasticity. After a bond on the minimum shortest path breaks, the process repeats for the next minimum shortest path. As the network is stretched and bonds are broken, the scatter in lengths of the shortest paths first narrows, causing stress to rise, and then broadens, causing stress to decline. This sequential breaking of a small fraction of bonds causes the network to rupture at a stress that is orders of magnitude below the strength of the covalent bonds.</description>

      <title>Rheological response of soft Solid/Liquid Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding a material's dissipative response is important for their use in many applications, such as adhesion. In dispersions the interplay between matrix and inclusions complicates any description. Fractional rheology is conveniently used to fit the storage and loss moduli of complex materials, although the physical picture is often elusive. We study the rheology of soft solid/liquid composites of liquid poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) droplets in a soft poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix. We analyze the influence of the droplets through fractional rheology and a time-concentration superposition. Viscous dissipation increases proportionally with volume fraction, and we show that a simple, well-fitting model can induce misinterpretation of the physics in a complex material.</description>

      <title>AI-guided transition path sampling of lipid flip-flop and membrane nanoporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study lipid translocation ("flip-flop") between the leaflets of a planar lipid bilayer with transition path sampling (TPS). Rare flip-flops compete with biological machineries that actively establish asymmetric lipid compositions. Artificial Intelligence (AI) guided TPS captures flip-flop without biasing the dynamics by initializing molecular dynamics simulations close to the tipping point, i.e., where it is equally likely for a lipid to next go to one or the other leaflet. We train a neural network model on the fly to predict the respective probability, i.e., the "committor" encoding the mechanism of flip-flop. Whereas coarse-grained DMPC lipids "tunnel" through the hydrophobic bilayer, unaided by water, atomistic DMPC lipids instead utilize spontaneously formed water nanopores to traverse to the other side. For longer DSPC lipids, these membrane defects are less stable, with lipid transfer along transient water threads in a locally thinned membrane emerging as a third distinct mechanism. Remarkably, in the high (~660) dimensional feature space of the deep neural networks, the reaction coordinate becomes effectively linear, in line with Cover's theorem and consistent with the idea of dominant reaction tubes.</description>

      <title>Analytical methods for cytoplasmic streaming in elongated cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cytoplasmic streaming, the coherent flow of cytoplasm, plays a critical role in transport and mixing over large scales in eukaryotic cells. In many large cells, this process is driven by active forces at the cell boundary, such as cortical cytoskeletal contractions in Drosophila and C. elegans embryos, or intracellular cargo transport in plant cells. These cytoplasmic flows are approximately Newtonian and governed by the Stokes equations. In this paper, we use lubrication theory - a powerful technique for simplifying the fluid mechanics equations in elongated geometries - to derive a general solution for boundary-driven cytoplasmic flows. We apply this framework to predict cytoplasmic fluid dynamics and cortical stresses in four systems of biological significance: the Drosophila and C. elegans embryos (including pseudocleavage furrow formation), the pollen tube of seed plants, and plant root hair cells. Our results showcase the elegance and accuracy of asymptotic solutions in capturing the complex flows and stress patterns in diverse biological contexts, reinforcing its utility as a robust tool for cellular biophysics.</description>

      <title>Signature of glassy dynamics in dynamic modes decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glasses are traditionally characterized by their rugged landscape of disordered low-energy states and their slow relaxation towards thermodynamic equilibrium. Far from equilibrium, dynamical forms of glassy behavior with anomalous algebraic relaxation have also been noted, e.g., in networks of coupled oscillators. Due to their disordered and high-dimensional nature, such systems have been difficult to study analytically, but data-driven methods are emerging as a promising alternative that may aid in their characterization. Here, we show that the gap between oscillatory and decaying modes in the Koopman spectrum vanishes in systems exhibiting algebraic relaxation. The dynamic mode decomposition, which is a data-driven spectral computation that approximates the Koopman spectrum, thus provides a model-agnostic signature for detecting and analyzing glassy dynamics. We demonstrate the utility of our approach through both a minimal example of one-dimensional ODEs and a high-dimensional example of coupled oscillators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the effects of shear deformations in a wide class of holographic amorphous solids. It is found that both the shear stress and the complexity of formation grow with the increase of the shear strain. Notably, in the regime of very large shear, they exhibit coordinated behavior and adhere to a universal scaling relation, uncovering a surprising connection between two seemingly unrelated aspects of amorphous systems. Furthermore, our findings also provide a counterexample to the previous understanding that the complexity scales linearly with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy for large static black holes.</description>

      <title>Vortex Dynamics in Tubular Fluid Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11206v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct 2D viscous flow sourced by a point vortex embedded in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in the flow field, consistent with Poincar\'e Index Theorem. In this setup, the incompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of a multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian on the cylinder, which depends on the fluid viscosities and vortex strengths. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex dynamics, distinct from flat and spherical fluid membranes. For a two vortex system of same circulation, we observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time. The compact angular direction of the membrane tube also allows two distinct closed orbits instead of one, under suitable initial conditions. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along helical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol 455 (1999). We also explore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and demonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be interesting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as experimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610 (2011).</description>

      <title>Active gel theory for cell migration with two myosin isoforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Myosin II molecular motors slide actin filaments relatively to each other and are essential for force generation, motility and mechanosensing in animal cells. For non-muscle cells, evolution has resulted in three different isoforms, which have different properties concerning the motor cycle and also occur in different abundances in the cells, but their respective biological and physical roles are not fully understood. Here we use active gel theory to demonstrate the complementary roles of isoforms A and B for cell migration. We first show that our model can be derived both from coarse-graining kinetic equations and from nonequilibrium thermodynamics as the macroscopic limit of a two-component Tonks gas. We then parametrize the model and show that motile solutions exist, in which the more abundant and more dynamic isoform A is localized to the front and the stronger isoform B to the rear, in agreement with experiments. We then explore the parameter space of the model and find a general pull-and-push mechanism that can produce different migratory modes, including cell oscillations in length and velocity. We also describe an analytical solution for the stiff limit. Our findings highlight the importance of including isoform-specific molecular details to describe whole cell behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantifying `local softness' in a simple liquid</title>

Abstract: Mutual information between local stress and local non-affine deformation is proposed as a collective field variable quantifying the {\em local softness} of soft materials. The liquid-solid transition in a simple liquid is considered as a generic example of mechanical transformation through varying correlation between stress and deformation at the microscopic level. Probing through this new measure, a liquid appears as a spatially heterogeneous medium of interacting interconnected regions of varying softness. In contrast, the soft regions shrink to isolated spots in the background of a negligible mean softness in the case of solids. In this view, the thermodynamic transition becomes purely geometric while keeping the essential mechanical information intact. Besides offering a general framework for understanding the mechanics of materials, this new approach can complement recent machine learning efforts by assigning physical meaning to their findings. Further, this collective variable can be used on the fly during material characterization as both of its ingredient variables are experimentally accessible.</description>

      <title>A Comparative Study of Enriched Computational Homogenization Schemes Applied to Two-Dimensional Pattern-Transforming Elastomeric Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10952</link>

Abstract: Elastomeric mechanical metamaterials exhibit unconventional behaviour, emerging from their microstructures often deforming in a highly nonlinear and unstable manner. Such microstructural pattern transformations lead to non-local behaviour and induce abrupt changes in the effective properties, beneficial for engineering applications. To avoid expensive simulations fully resolving the underlying microstructure, homogenization methods are employed. In this contribution, a systematic comparative study is performed, assessing the predictive capability of several computational homogenization schemes in the realm of two-dimensional elastomeric metamaterials with a square stacking of circular holes. In particular, classical first-order and two enriched schemes of second-order and micromorphic computational homogenization type are compared with ensemble-averaged full direct numerical simulations on three examples: uniform compression and bending of an infinite specimen, and compression of a finite specimen. It is shown that although the second-order scheme provides good qualitative predictions, it fails in accurately capturing bifurcation strains and slightly over-predicts the homogenized response. The micromorphic method provides the most accurate prediction for tested examples, although soft boundary layers induce large errors at small scale ratios. The first-order scheme yields good predictions for high separations of scales, but suffers from convergence issues, especially when localization occurs.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of liquid viscosity from unstable localized modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viscosity is the resistance of a liquid to flow, governed by atomic-scale friction between its constituent atoms. While viscosity can be directly computed using the Green-Kubo formalism, its microscopic origin remains poorly understood. In this work, we calculate the viscosity of a $\mathrm{Cu_{50}Zr_{50}}$ metallic liquid and a Kob-Andersen model in a large range of temperatures and compare the results with a theoretical formula based on nonaffine linear response and instantaneous normal mode theory. This analysis reveals that, above approximately the mode-coupling temperature ($T_{\text{MC}}$), unstable localized instantaneous normal modes (ULINMs) control the viscosity, suggesting a microscopic definition of it as diffusive momentum transport facilitated by local structural excitations mediated by ULINMs as precursors. On the other hand, at $ \approx T_{\text{MC}}$, we observe a dynamical crossover below which the viscosity is governed by stable modes. This behavior is compatible with the topological transition that emerges in the potential energy landscape between minima dominated dynamics ($T&lt;T_{\text{MC}}$), corresponding to stable modes, and saddles dominated dynamics ($T&gt;T_{\text{MC}}$), related to unstable ones. Finally, leveraging on the concept of configurational entropy, a quantitative model to connect viscosity with ULINMs is also proposed and validated in both the Arrhenius and non-Arrhenius regimes. In summary, our work provides a microscopic definition of liquid viscosity and highlights the fundamental role of ULINMs as its building blocks, ultimately opening the path to an atomic-scale prediction of viscosity in liquids and glasses.</description>

      <title>Internal motion of soft granular particles under circular shearing: Rate-dependent quaking and its spatial structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16293v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tightly packed granular particles under shear often exhibit intriguing intermittencies, specifically, sudden stress drops that we refer to as quaking. To probe the nature of this phenomenon, we prototype a circular shear cell that is capable of imposing a uniform and unlimited shear strain under quasi-static cyclic driving. Spherical PDMS(polydimethylsiloxane) particles, immersed in fluid, are driven in a fixed total volume at a wide range of shear rates, with particle trajectories captured in 3D space via refraction-index-matched fluorescent tomography. Statistics on the magnitude of fluctuating displacements of individual particles shows distinct dependence on the shear rate. Particle motions are smooth at high shear rates. At intermediate shear rates, quaking emerges with clusters of particles exhibiting relatively large displacements. At low shear rates, a cluster can span the entire system. and the cluster exhibits substructures in view of localized particle movements. Overall, we have confirmed that the quaking phenomena in the current setup are consistent with our previous work [Phys. Rev. Lett.,126, 128001 (2021)], and that the dimensionless shear rate that we have proposed [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 023065 (2024)] is indeed a good parameter for unifying the transitions observed in different experimental geometries.</description>

      <title>Anomalous energy transport in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamic theories with charge and energy conservation in and above two dimensions that describe the large-scale behavior of the Hamiltonian XY model in the disordered and ordered phases. Using renormalization group analysis at one-loop order, we show that while Fourier's law holds in the ordered phase above two dimensions and in the disordered phase in any dimension, the energy diffusivity in the ordered phase exactly in two dimensions, the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase, exhibits a logarithmic divergence in the thermodynamic limit. This divergence arises from elastic energy transport induced by spin-wave excitations.</description>

      <title>A study of pendular liquid bridge between two equal solid spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08344v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pendular liquid bridges with concave meridians between two equal rigid spheres are mathematically studied emphasizing some less analyzed facts in the literature. Discrepancies from the numerical solution of the Young-Laplace equation are examined among typical simplifying approximations and a few curve-fitting formulas. The separation distance between spheres is shown to play an important role in pendular ring formation via capillary condensation for a given relative humidity and the strength of subsequent capillary forces. For most practical situations, the toroidal approximation could be reasonably accurate (especially with diminishing separation distance) and provide valuable mathematical insights at least in a qualitative sense with its relatively simple analytical formulas. Using the elliptic meridional profile generally offers more accurate approximations, but with such complicated analytical formulas that it would limit its convenience for practical applications. With a few examples, the present study shows that curve-fitting formulas cannot be perfect and, by their approximative nature, would always leave room for improvements; therefore, care should be taken when applying curve-fitting formulas, to avoid undesirable errors.</description>
