      <title>Asymptotic expansions for Legendre functions via differential equations having coalescing turning points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linear second-order linear ordinary differential equations equations of the form $d^{2}w/dz^{2}=\{u^{2}f(a,z)+g(z)\}w$ are considered for large values of the real parameter $u$, $z$ being a complex variable ranging over a bounded or unbounded complex domain $Z$, and $a_{0} \leq a \leq a_{1} &lt; \infty$. It is assumed that $f(a,z)$ and $g(z)$ are analytic within $Z$. Furthermore, $f(a,z)$ has exactly two real simple zeros in $Z$ for $a&gt;a_{0}$ that depend continuously on $a$, and coalesce into a double zero as $a \to a_{0}$. Uniform asymptotic expansions are derived for solutions of the equation which involve parabolic cylinder functions and their derivatives, along with certain slowly varying coefficient functions. The new results involve readily computable coefficients and explicit error bounds, and are then applied to provide new asymptotic expansions for the associated Legendre functions when both the degree $\nu$ and order $\mu$ are large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study a new kind of generalized Hilbert operators, induced by a finite positive Borel measure on (0,1), acting on the weighted sequence spaces. We establish a sufficient and necessary conditions for the boundedness of these operators. These results extend some related ones obtained recently in [BLMS, 55 (2023), no. 6, 2598-2610].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the Sobolev space associated with the linear canonical Dunkl transform and explore some properties of the linear canonical Dunkl operators. Building on these results, we establish a real Paley-Wiener theorem for the linear canonical Dunkl transform. Further, we characterize the square-integrable function f whose linear canonical Dunkl transform of the function is supported in the polynomial domain. Finally, we develop the Boas-type Paley-Wiener theorem for the linear canonical Dunkl transform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a star-shaped Kac-Moody root system, we provide an effective algorithm to obtain representatives of the Weyl group orbits of roots with a given norm and implement it as a computer program. We also explain the relationship between these orbits and Fuchsian differential equations on the Riemann sphere, as well as higher-dimensional Painleve-type equations.</description>

      <title>Backward stochastic differential equations with nonlinear Young driver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) involving a nonlinear Young integral of the form $\int_{t}^{T}g(Y_{r})\eta(dr,X_{r})$, where the driver $\eta(t,x)$ is a space-time H\"older continuous function and $X$ is a diffusion process. Solutions to such equations provide a probabilistic interpretation of the solutions to stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) driven by space-time noise. We first obtain the existence and uniqueness of the solutions to these BSDEs under the assumption that the driver $\eta(t,x)$ is bounded, by a modified Picard iteration method. Then, we derive the comparison principle by analyzing associated linear BSDEs and further establish regularity results for the solutions. Finally, by combining the regularity results with a localization argument, we extend the well-posedness result to the case where $\eta(t,x)$ is unbounded. As applications, we derive nonlinear Feynman-Kac formulae for a class of partial differential equations with Young drivers (Young PDEs), and we also investigate BSDEs with non-Lipschitz coefficient functions as well as linear stochastic heat equations with Neumann boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>On the irrationality of certain super-polynomially decaying series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a negative answer to a question by Paul Erd\H{o}s and Ronald Graham on whether the series \[ \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(n+1)(n+2)\cdots(n+f(n))} \] has an irrational sum whenever $(f(n))_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a sequence of positive integers converging to infinity. To achieve this, we generalize a classical observation of S\={o}ichi Kakeya on the set of all subsums of a convergent positive series. We also discuss why the same problem is likely difficult when $(f(n))_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is additionally assumed to be increasing.</description>

      <title>Discrete analogues of second-order Riesz transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete analogues of many classical operators in harmonic analysis have been widely studied for many years with interesting connections to other areas in mathematics, including ergodic theory and analytic number theory. This paper concerns the problem of identifying the $\ell^p$-norms of discrete analogues of second-order Riesz transforms. Using probabilistic techniques, a class of second-order discrete Riesz transforms $\mathcal{R}^{(jk)}$ is constructed on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\geq 2$. It is shown that their $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z}^d)$ norms, $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$, are the same as the norms of the classical second-order Riesz transforms $R^{(jk)}$ in $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)$. The operators $\mathcal{R}^{(jk)}$ differ from the harmonic analysis analogues of the discrete Riesz transforms, $R^{(jk)}_{\mathrm{dis}}$, by convolution with a function in $\ell^1(\mathbb{Z}^d)$. Applications are given to the discrete Beurling-Ahlfors operator. It is shown that the operators $\mathcal{R}^{(jk)}$ arise by discretization of a class of Calder\'on-Zygmund singular integrals $T^{(jk)}$ which differ from the classical Riesz transforms $R^{(jk)}$ by convolution with a function in $L^1(\mathbb{R}^d)$.</description>

Abstract: This article is a continuation of our work on generalized matrix-weighted Besov--Triebel--Lizorkin-type spaces with matrix $\mathcal{A}_{\infty}$ weights. In this article, we aim to establish the boundedness of pseudo-differential, trace, and Calder\'{o}n--Zygmund operators on these spaces. The main tools involved in this article are the molecular and the wavelet characterizations of these spaces. Since generalized matrix-weighted Besov--Triebel--Lizorkin-type spaces include many classical function spaces such as matrix-weighted Besov--Triebel--Lizorkin spaces, all the results in this article are of wide generality.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we improve the $L^p$-Rellich and Hardy-Rellich inequalities in the setting of radial Baouendi--Grushin vector fields. We establish an identity relating the subcritical and critical Hardy inequalities, thereby demonstrating their equivalence. Moreover, we obtain improved versions of these inequalities via an analysis of extremizer stability. In the higher-order setting, we derive Hardy-Rellich type inequalities involving all radial operators in the Grushin framework and prove that all resulting constants are sharp. Finally, for the $L^2$-higher-order cases, we compute exact remainder terms by establishing identities rather than inequalities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.03953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The regularity of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function, in both discrete and continuous contexts, and for both centered and noncentered variants, has been subjected to intense study for the last two decades. But efforts so far have concentrated on first order differentiability and variation, as it is known that in the continuous context higher order regularity is impossible. This short note gives the first positive result on the higher order regularity of the discrete noncentered maximal function.</description>

      <title>Two principles of decoupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We put forward a radial principle and a degeneracy locating principle of decoupling. The former generalises the Pramanik-Seeger argument used in the proof of decoupling for the light cone. The latter locates the degenerate part of a manifold and effectively reduces the decoupling problem to two extremes: non-degenerate case and totally degenerate case. Both principles aim to provide a new algebraic approach of reducing decoupling for new manifolds to decoupling for known manifolds.</description>

Abstract: We find some identities involving the Pochhammer symbol (rising factorial) and apply them to find a closed form for some integrals of the Jacobi polynomials, as well as a hypergeometric function multiplied by the product of the Jacobi polynomial and the Beta density that makes this polynomial a member of the family of orthogonal polynomials. In other words, we expand a hypergeometric function in an orthogonal series of Jacobi polynomials.</description>

      <title>A priori bounds for geodesic diameter. Part II. Fine connectedness properties of varifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05955v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For varifolds whose first variation is representable by integration, we introduce the notion of indecomposability with respect to locally Lipschitzian real valued functions. Unlike indecomposability, this weaker connectedness property is inherited by varifolds associated with solutions to geometric variational problems phrased in terms of sets, $G$ chains, and immersions; yet it is strong enough for the subsequent deduction of substantial geometric consequences therefrom. Our present study is based on several further concepts for varifolds put forward in this paper: real valued functions of generalised bounded variation thereon, partitions thereof in general, partition thereof along a real valued generalised weakly differentiable function in particular, and local finiteness of decompositions.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Sextic Freud Weight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08522v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the properties of the sequence of coefficients $(\beta_n)_{n\geq0}$ in the recurrence relation satisfied by the sequence of monic symmetric polynomials, orthogonal with respect to the symmetric sextic Freud weight $$\omega(x; \tau, t) = \exp(-x^6 + \tau x^4 + t x^2), \qquad x \in \mathbb{R}, $$ with real parameters $\tau$ and $t$. We derive a fourth-order nonlinear discrete equation satisfied by $\beta_n$, which is shown to be a special case of {the second} member of the discrete Painlev\'{e} I hierarchy. Further, we analyse differential and differential-difference equations satisfied by the recurrence coefficients. The emphasis is to offer a comprehensive study of the intricate evolution in the behaviour of these recurrence coefficients as the pair of parameters $(\tau,t)$ change. A comprehensive numerical and computational analysis is carried out for critical parameter ranges, and graphical plots are presented to illustrate the behaviour of the recurrence coefficients as well as the complexity of the associated Volterra lattice hierarchy. The corresponding symmetric sextic Freud polynomials are shown to satisfy a second-order differential equation with rational coefficients. The moments of the weight are examined in detail, including their integral representations, differential equations, and recursive structure. Closed-form expressions for moments are obtained in several special cases, and asymptotic expansions for the recurrence coefficients are provided. The results highlight rich algebraic and analytic structures underlying the symmetric sextic Freud weight and its connections to integrable systems.</description>
