      <title>A Hardware/Firmware-Based Switching Gate Multiplexing Method for Pulse Mode Radiation Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a hardware/firmware-based switching gate multiplexing method for pulse mode radiation detectors that can combine many detector signals into two readout channels. One readout channel passes the signal of the multiplexed detector that "fired" first, and the other channel provides a variable-width logic pulse, i.e., a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal, that identifies the active detector. The multiplexed output pulse is produced by passing the first active detector's signal to a fan-in circuit by gating on the corresponding channel for a fixed duration while blocking all other detector signals. It does this using individual analog switches for all the detector signals. Each switch is controlled by a fixed width logic pulse that is triggered by the arrival of the first active detector pulse. Both the fixed width logic pulse and the PWM signal are generated using a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). To demonstrate the proposed multiplexing method, a prototype four-channel multiplexer was developed for use with four NaI(Tl) detectors. The performance of the multiplexer was evaluated in terms of its ability to retain energy resolution, timing resolution, and original pulse shape. The proposed multiplexing method showed very little degradation in energy resolution and timing resolution or alteration of pulse shape. The switching gate feature of the proposed method enables the multiplexer output to have very low noise contribution from the inactive channels. This multiplexing technique also has the unique capability of isolating and recovering the first active detector's output pulse in cases where there is overlap between pulses from different detectors in a single digitized record. These features make the proposed hardware/firmware-based switching gate multiplexing method very promising for application to large radiation detector networks.</description>

      <title>General Guide Concepts for Compact, High-Brilliance Neutron Moderators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trend in neutron sciences is toward integrating compact, high-brightness moderators into new or upgraded facilities. Transporting neutrons from the source to the sample position with a phase-space distribution tailored to specific requirements is crucial to leverage high source brilliance. We have investigated four guide concepts using Monte Carlo ray tracing simulations: Montel beamline with nested Kirkpatrick-Baez mirrors, curved-tapered beamline with a bender and straight sections, straight-elliptical beamline, and curved-elliptical beamline. The straight-elliptical (curved-elliptical) beamline features two half-ellipse guides connected by a straight (non-straight) guide section. The neutron transport efficiency and phase space homogeneity have been quantitatively compared. Our results show that the straight-elliptical beamline performs best because of few neutron bounces on the guide surface with small reflection angles, minimizing flux loss. The Montel beamline provides the best spatial confinement of neutrons within the desired region; however, there is a high thermal-neutron loss due to large reflection angles. The curved-tapered beamline suffers from significant flux loss due to high bounces, and it shows a non-uniform angular distribution related to broad ranges of bounces and reflection angles. The non-straight guide section of the curved-elliptical beamline increases phase space inhomogeneity, leading to a spatially non-uniform beam profile. The results apply to general neutron instruments that require transporting thermal and cold neutrons from a compact, high-brilliance moderator to the sample location with a moderate phase-space volume.</description>

      <title>Experimental timing and control using microcontrollers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern physics experiments rely on precise timing provided by programmable digital pulse generators. In many experimental control systems, this role is filled by custom devices built on Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). While highly flexible and performant, these systems can be difficult to scale to very large systems due to cost and complexity. Recent advances in microcontroller systems allows these much simpler systems to fill the role of digital pulse generators. Here we demonstrate one such alternative based on the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller which allows for timing resolution down to 7.5 ns with a minimum pulse width of of 37.5 ns.</description>

      <title>Detecting kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger with a multi-mode resonant bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a multi-mode bar consisting of mass elements of decreasing size for the direct detection of stimulated absorption of up to kHz gravitons from a neutron star merger and post-merger. We find that the multi-mode detector has normal modes that retain the coupling strength to the gravitational wave of the largest mass-element, while only having an effective mass comparable to the mass of the smallest element. This allows the normal modes to have graviton absorption rates due to the tonne-scale largest mass, while the single graviton absorption process in the normal mode could be resolved through energy measurements of a mass-element in-principle smaller than pico-gram scale. This improves the transduction of the single-graviton signal compared to a single-mode detector, enhancing the feasibility of detecting single gravitons.</description>

      <title>A life cycle assessment of the ISIS-II Neutron and Muon Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ISIS-II Neutron and Muon source is the proposed next generation of, and successor to, the ISIS Neutron and Muon Source based at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in the United Kingdom. Anticipated to start construction in 2031, the ISIS-II project presents a unique opportunity to incorporate environmental sustainability practices from its inception. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) will examine the environmental impacts associated with each of the ISIS-II design options across the stages of the ISIS-II lifecycle, encompassing construction, operation, and eventual decommissioning. This proactive approach will assess all potential areas of environmental impact and seek to identify strategies for minimizing and mitigating negative impacts, wherever feasible. This paper will provide insights into the process and first results of the LCA of the entirety of the ISIS-II project.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, photon bunching from LED light was observed for the first time using SiPMs. The bunching signature was observed with a significance of $7.3~\sigma$ using 97~hs of data. The light was spectrally filtered using a 1~nm bandpass filter and an Etalon filter to ensure temporal coherence of the field and its coherence time was measured to be $\tau_C = (19 \pm 2)$~ps. The impact of SiPM non-idealities in these kinds of measurements is explored, and we describe the methodology to process SiPM analog waveforms and the event selection used to mitigate these non-idealities.</description>

      <title>Design Space Exploration for Particle Detector Read-out Implementations in Matlab and Simulink on the Example of the SHiP SBT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On a very fundamental level, particle detectors share similar requirements for their read-out chain. This is reflected in the way that typical read-out solutions are developed, where a previous design is taken and modified to fit some changes in requirements. One of the two common approaches is the current-based read-out, where the waveform of the sensor output is sampled in order to later extract information from there. This approach is used in many detector applications using scintillation based detectors, including PET. With this contribution, we will introduce how we use Matlab in order to simulate the read-out electronics of particle detectors. We developed this simulation approach as a base for our ongoing development of software-defined read-out ASICs that cover the requirements of a variety of particle detector types. Simulink was chosen as a base for our developments as it allows simulation of mixed-signal systems and comes with built-in toolkits to aid in developments of such systems. With our approach, we want to take a new look at how we approach designing such a read-out, with a focus on digital signal processing close to the sensor, making use of known signal characteristics and modern methods of communications engineering. We are taking into account the time profile of an event, the bandwidth-limiting properties of the sensor and attached electronics, digitization stages and finally the parameterization of approaches for digital processing of the signal. We will show how we are applying the design approach to the development of a read-out for the proposed SHiP SBT detector, which is a scintillation based detector relying on SiPMs sensors, using this as an example for our modelling approach and show preliminary results.</description>

      <title>Towards CRES-Based Non-destructive Electron Momentum Estimation for the PTOLEMY Relic Neutrino Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The novel electron spectrometry method proposed by the PTOLEMY relic neutrino experiment requires a real-time, non-destructive estimate of the parallel and transverse momentum splits of tritium $\beta$-decay electrons. The collaboration has proposed to obtain this estimate using cyclotron-radiation emission spectroscopy (CRES), in which the kinetic energy of a charged particle is determined by measuring the relativistic frequency shift of the cyclotron radiation emitted by the particle in a magnetic field. However, no suitable approach to extract this information in a non-destructive manner has been developed to date. In this paper, we characterize the performance of a configuration that can be feasibly integrated directly into the existing design for the transverse drift filter proposed by the PTOLEMY collaboration. We study a geometry incorporating a cavity resonator to enhance a ${\sim}\mathcal{O}(1) \hspace{1mm}\mathrm{fW}$ cyclotron radiation signal and derive key features of the expected observed radiation specific to our radio-frequency (RF) tracking configuration. We estimate the performance of our design using electromagnetic simulations and propose a general signal reconstruction algorithm capable of matching an observed signal to electron kinematic parameters. The projected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of this technique suggests that a non-destructive RF tracking system based on an array of these components as building blocks is applicable for extracting the kinematic parameters of tritium endpoint electrons to the precision required for the PTOLEMY experiment.</description>

      <title>Estimation of waveform deformation with the matched filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many particle physics experiments the data processing is based on the analysis of the digitized waveforms provided by the detector. While the waveform amplitude is usually correlated to the event energy, the shape may carry useful information for event discrimination. Thanks to the high signal to noise ratio they provide, matched filters are often applied. Their original design is however intended for the estimation of the waveform amplitude only.
  In this work we introduce an analytical extension of the original matched filter for the estimation of a possible shape deformation with respect to a reference template. The new filter is validated on simulations and, with respect to shape parameters calculated on unfiltered waveforms or derived from the original matched filter, it improves the discrimination capability by at least a factor 2 both at low and high signal to noise ratios, making it applicable to the data of several experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study developed a new current-readout technique capable of handling measurements with high count rates reaching 1 Gcps. By directly capturing the output current of a photomultiplier as a digitized waveform, we estimated event rates, overcoming the limitations imposed by pulse pileup constraints and deadtimes. This innovative method was applied to a muon spin rotation/relaxation/resonance experiment at the Japan Proton Accelerator Research Complex, demonstrating its anticipated performance. Furthermore, we explored methods for estimating statistical uncertainty and investigated potential applications in analog-logic OR/AND gates. Overall, our findings reveal that the developed technique opens up avenues for the development of future non-binary logic circuits operating based on n-adic numbers.</description>

      <title>A Novel Diamond-like Carbon based photocathode for PICOSEC Micromegas detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The PICOSEC Micromegas (MM) detector is a precise timing gaseous detector based on a MM detector operating in a two-stage amplification mode and a Cherenkov radiator. Prototypes equipped with cesium iodide (CsI) photocathodes have shown promising time resolutions as precise as 24 picoseconds (ps) for Minimum Ionizing Particles. However, due to the high hygroscopicity and susceptibility to ion bombardment of the CsI photocathodes, alternative photocathode materials are needed to improve the robustness of PICOSEC MM. Diamond-like Carbon (DLC) film have been introduced as a novel robust photocathode material, which have shown promising results. A batch of DLC photocathodes with different thicknesses were produced and evaluated using ultraviolet light. The quantum efficiency measurements indicate that the optimized thickness of the DLC photocathode is approximately 3 nm. Furthermore, DLC photocathodes show good resistance to ion bombardment in aging test compared to the CsI photocathode. Finally, a PICOSEC MM prototype equipped with DLC photocathodes was tested in muon beams. A time resolution of around 42 ps with a detection efficiency of 97% for 150 GeV/c muons were obtained. These results indicate the great potential of DLC as a photocathode for the PICOSEC MM detector.</description>

      <title>Thermal/epithermal neutron detection via LiO$_{2}$-doped fiber bundles: A computational study through GEANT4 simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the neutron capture processes in lithium or lithium-doped materials leads to the production of secondary alpha-triton pairs. The counts of these secondary charged particle pairs in the presence of thermal/epithermal neutrons indirectly give access to detecting the primary incident neutrons with the aid of the plastic scintillators by reminding that both these secondary alphas and tritons deposit their entire kinetic energy within a short range. In this study, we modify the polystyrene fiber core of Kuraray Y11-200(M) by doping with 10 wt.$\%$ LiO$_{2}$. We investigate a fiber bundle system hinged on 10 wt.$\%$ LiO$_{2}$-doped Kuraray Y11-200(M) fibers via the GEANT4 simulations by targeting the detection of the incident thermal/epithermal neutrons through the generation of the secondary alpha-triton pairs. First, we estimate an optimal number of fiber arrays by using a monoenergetic beam of thermal neutrons with a kinetic energy of 0.025 eV and we count the number of secondary alpha-triton pairs. Subsequently, we insert a pixelated photo-sensor on both ends of the fiber bundle in order to collect the entrapped optical photons. In addition to the thermal neutrons, we also explore the detection of epithermal neutrons with a kinetic energy of 1 eV by utilizing a combination of the 10 wt.$\%$ LiO$_{2}$-doped Kuraray Y11-200(M) fiber bundles and the neutron absorption layers. We demonstrate that the LiO$_{2}$-doped plastic scintillating fiber bundles are instrumental for the detection of thermal/epithermal neutrons in diverse applications.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning of Structural Morphology Imaged by Scanning X-ray Diffraction Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scanning X-ray nanodiffraction microscopy is a powerful technique for spatially resolving nanoscale structural morphologies by diffraction contrast. One of the critical challenges in experimental nanodiffraction data analysis is posed by the convergence angle of nanoscale focusing optics which creates simultaneous dependency of the far-field scattering data on three independent components of the local strain tensor - corresponding to dilation and two potential rigid body rotations of the unit cell. All three components are in principle resolvable through a spatially mapped sample tilt series however traditional data analysis is computationally expensive and prone to artifacts. In this study, we implement NanobeamNN, a convolutional neural network specifically tailored to the analysis of scanning probe X-ray microscopy data. NanobeamNN learns lattice strain and rotation angles from simulated diffraction of a focused X-ray nanobeam by an epitaxial thin film and can directly make reasonable predictions on experimental data without the need for additional fine-tuning. We demonstrate that this approach represents a significant advancement in computational speed over conventional methods, as well as a potential improvement in accuracy over the current standard.</description>
