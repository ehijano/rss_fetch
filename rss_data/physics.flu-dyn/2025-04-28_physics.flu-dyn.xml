      <title>Integer Lattice Gas with a sampling collision operator for the fluctuating Navier-Stokes Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While lattice Boltzmann methods were originally derived as the Boltzmann limit of a Boolean lattice gas, modern improvements to lattice Boltzmann methods have broken this link. Because of this most lattice Boltzmann methods are not unconditionally stable and extending them to model fluctuations is challenging. In this article we show that the integer lattice gas method developed by Blommel and Wagner has a lattice Boltzmann limit corresponding to entropic lattice Boltzmann methods, while also recovering proper ideal gas equilibrium fluctuations. We also show that it is possible to accelerate these integer lattice gases such that they become computationally competitive with the corresponding lattice Boltzmann method.</description>

      <title>The Boundary Layer Dispersion and Footprint Model: A fast numerical solver of the Eulerian steady-state advection-diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how greenhouse gases and pollutants move through the atmosphere is essential for predicting and mitigating their effects. We present a novel atmospheric dispersion and footprint model: the Boundary Layer Dispersion and Footprint Model (BLDFM), which solves the three-dimensional steady-state advection-diffusion equation in Eulerian form using a numerical approach based on the Fourier method, the linear shooting method and the exponential integrator method. The model is designed to be flexible and can be used for a wide range of applications, including climate impact studies, industrial emissions monitoring, agricultural planning and spatial flux attribution. We validate the model using an analytical test case. The numerical results show excellent agreement with the analytical solution. We also compare the model with the Kormann and Meixner (Boundary-Layer Meteorology, 2001) footprint model (FKM), and the results show overall good agreement but some differences in the fetch of the footprints, which are attributed to the neglect of streamwise turbulent mixing in the FKM model. Our results demonstrate the potential of the BLDFM model as a useful tool for atmospheric scientists, biogeochemists, ecologists, and engineers.</description>

      <title>A Lie Scale Invariance in Fluids with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lie scale invariance is used to reduce the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations to non-linear ordinary equations. This yields a formulation in terms of logarithmic spirals as independent variables. We give the equations when the spirals lie on cones as well as in planes. The theory gives a locus in cylindrical coordinates of singularities as they arise in the reduced Navier-Stokes equations. We give two formal examples aimed at discovering singularities in the flow; another example is related to a Hele-Shaw cell, and finally we explore the flow through propellers comprised of blades made from congruent logarithmic spirals.</description>

      <title>Profile-Preserving Phase-Field Model for Surfactant Transport and Adsorption-Desorption in Two-Phase Flow Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffuse-interface model for two-phase flows with soluble surfactants has garnered considerable attention due to its ability to circumvent the need for Robin boundary condition in the bulk surfactant transport equation. However, the coupling between surfactant concentration and the phase field within this framework underscores the importance of accurately resolving interfacial equilibrium profiles. To address this limitation, we have developed a profile-preserving phase-field model for simulating surfactant transport and adsorption-desorption in two-phase flow systems. This approach iteratively refines interfacial profiles and delta functions, removing concentration singularities and improving mass conservation. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated through two benchmark simulations: surfactant transport in a vortex-deformed droplet, which quantitatively reveals reduced mass error over time, and adsorption-desorption dynamics on a stationary spherical interface, showing strong agreement with one-dimensional analytical solutions for surfactant concentration distributions. We further highlight the model's capability by simulating the settling behavior of a surfactant-laden droplet, underscoring the critical role of adsorption-desorption kinetics in governing droplet dynamics.</description>

      <title>Viscosity's impact on nutrient uptake along the gut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through switching contraction patterns driving digestive flows, the small intestine balances nutrient uptake and waste removal. Complex segmentation contraction patterns are associated with higher nutrient uptake, while peristaltic contractions primarily serve to flush out unused remnants. However, the impact of the Non-Newtonian behavior of digestive fluids on the efficacy of these contraction patterns remains unclear. Here, we present finite-element simulations that model nutrient transport, diffusion, and uptake within both segmentation and peristaltic contractions along the small intestine for Newtonian and Non-Newtonian fluids. Our simulations reveal that diffusion plays a key role in uptake, with nutrient absorption directly linked to fluid viscosity, which governs molecular diffusivity. Further, we present an analytical prediction for uptake in peristalsis as a function of molecular diffusivity, which aligns closely with our simulation results. Notably, we find that shear-thinning properties of Non-Newtonian fluids enhance nutrient uptake, particularly in segmentation contractions compared to peristalsis. Our results demonstrate the fluid dynamical principles underlying intestinal digestion, showing how shear-thinning Non-Newtonian fluids promote efficient nutrient uptake without compromising the clearance of waste. This physical insight advances our understanding of digestive processes and provides a foundation for exploring the prevention of intestinal diseases such as bacterial overgrowth.</description>

      <title>Wave Energy Is Conserved in a Spatially Varying and Inhomogeneously Moving Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waves are propagating disturbances that redistribute energy across space. Previous studies have shown that for waves propagating through an inhomogeneously moving mean flow, the conserved quantity is wave action rather than wave energy, raising questions about the validity of energy conservation, which is one of the foundational principles of physics. In this study, we prove that wave action conservation is, in fact, an apparent form of wave energy conservation in spatially varying and inhomogeneously moving media, where waves undergo deformation during propagation. We further show that wave action conservation can be derived directly from the law of energy conservation. This result holds universally across all isolated wave systems in varying media, including hydrodynamic and non-hydrodynamic waves.</description>

      <title>OpenFOAMGPT 2.0: end-to-end, trustworthy automation for computational fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the first multi agent framework for computational fluid dynamics that enables fully automated, end to end simulations directly from natural language queries. The approach integrates four specialized agents Pre processing, Prompt Generation, OpenFOAMGPT (simulator), and Post processing decomposing complex computational fluid dynamics workflows into collaborative components powered by large language models. Extensive validation through diverse case studies, including Poiseuille flows, single and multi phase porous media flows, and aerodynamic analyses, demonstrates 100% success and reproducibility rates across over 450 simulations. Rigorous trustworthiness verification confirms that properly designed multi agent systems can achieve the reliability standards necessary for zero tolerance scientific computing applications while significantly lowering entry barriers. The framework establishes a foundation for conversation-driven simulation workflows in computational science, potentially accelerating discovery and innovation through more accessible tools for complex numerical simulations. Results reveal that multi-agent architectures, when properly specialized and orchestrated, can effectively handle the stringent requirements of computational physics while maintaining the intuitive interface of natural language interaction.</description>

      <title>Normality-based analysis of multiscale velocity gradients and energy transfer in direct and large-eddy simulations of isotropic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry-based analyses of multiscale velocity gradients highlight that strain self-amplification and vortex stretching drive forward energy transfer in turbulent flows. By contrast, a strain-vorticity covariance mechanism produces backscatter that contributes to the bottleneck effect in the subinertial range of the energy cascade. We extend these analyses by using a normality-based decomposition of filtered velocity gradients in forced isotropic turbulence to distinguish contributions from normal straining, pure shearing, and rigid rotation at a given scale. Our analysis of direct numerical simulation (DNS) data illuminates the importance of shear layers in the inertial range and (especially) the subinertial range of the cascade. Shear layers contribute significantly to strain self-amplification and vortex stretching and play a dominant role in the backscatter mechanism responsible for the bottleneck effect. Our concurrent analysis of large-eddy simulation (LES) data characterizes how different closure models affect the flow structure and energy transfer throughout the resolved scales. We thoroughly demonstrate that the multiscale flow features produced by a mixed model closely resemble those in a filtered DNS, whereas the features produced by an eddy viscosity model resemble those in an unfiltered DNS at a lower Reynolds number. This analysis helps explain how small-scale shear layers, whose imprint is mitigated upon filtering, amplify the artificial bottleneck effect produced by the eddy viscosity model in the inertial range of the cascade. Altogether, the present results provide a refined interpretation of the flow structures and mechanisms underlying the energy cascade and insight for designing and evaluating LES closure models.</description>

      <title>The Diffuse Solid Method for Wetting and Multiphase Fluid Simulations in Complex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a diffuse solid method that is versatile and accurate for modeling wetting and multiphase flows in highly complex geometries. In this scheme, we harness N + 1-component phase field models to investigate interface shapes and flow dynamics of N fluid components, and we optimize how to constrain the evolution of the component employed as the solid phase to conform to any pre-defined geometry. Implementations for phase field energy minimization and lattice Boltzmann method are presented. Our approach does not need special treatment for the fluid-solid wetting boundary condition, which makes it simple to implement. To demonstrate its broad applicability, we employ the diffuse solid method to explore wide-ranging examples, including droplet contact angle on a flat surface, particle adsorption on a fluid-fluid interface, critical pressure on micropillars and on Salvinia leaf structures, capillary rise against gravity, Lucas-Washburn's law for capillary filling, and droplet motion on a sinusoidally undulated surface. Our proposed approach can be beneficial to computationally study multiphase fluid interactions with textured solid surfaces that are ubiquitous in nature and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>A thermodynamics-based turbulence model for isothermal compressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a new turbulence model for isothermal compressible flows. The model is derived by combining the Favre averaging and the Conservation-dissipation formalism -- a newly developed thermodynamics theory. The latter provides a systematic methodology to construct closure relations that intrinsically satisfy the first and second laws of thermodynamics. The new model is a hyperbolic system of first-order partial differential equations. It has a number of numerical advantages, and addresses some drawbacks of classical turbulence models by resolving the non-physical infinite information propagation paradox of the parabolic-type models and accurately capturing the interaction between compressibility and turbulence dissipation. Furthermore, we show the compatibility of the proposed model with Prandtl's one-equation model for incompressible flows by deliberately rescaling the model and studying its low Mach number limit.</description>

      <title>Stokes drag on a sphere in a three-dimensional anisotropic porous medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the hydrodynamic drag force exerted on a sphere in a static anisotropic porous medium. This problem is analysed using the Brinkman-Debye-Bueche equations with an axisymmetric shielding (or permeability) tensor. Using the exact Green's functions for this model fluid within a single-layer boundary element formulation, we numerically compute the friction tensor for a translating sphere subjected to stick boundary conditions. Furthermore, we derive approximate analytical expressions for small anisotropy using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem. By benchmarking this result against the numerical solutions, we find that a linear approximation is valid in a broad parameter regime. Our results are important for studying self-diffusion in general anisotropic porous media, but can also be applied to small tracers in nematic fluids composed of disk- or rod-like crowders.</description>

      <title>On the mechanics of inhaled bronchial transmission of pathogenic microdroplets generated from the upper respiratory tract, with implications for infection onset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Could the microdroplets formed by viscoelastic stretching and break-up of mucosal liquids in the upper respiratory tract (URT), when inhaled further downwind, explain the brisk pace at which deep lung infections emerge following onset of initial infection at the URT? While it is well-established that particulates inhaled from outside can possibly penetrate to the lower airway only if they are &lt; 5 microns, the fate of particulates (many &gt; 5-microns in diameter) sheared away from the intra-URT mucosa during inhalation remains an open question. These particulates predominantly originate at the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and laryngeal chamber with the vocal folds. To resolve the posed question, this study considers a CT-based 3D anatomical airway reconstruction and isolates the tract from the laryngeal vocal fold region, mapping the entire tracheal cavity and concluding at generation 2 of the tracheobronchial tree. Through the delineated geometry, airflow simulation is conducted using the LES scheme to replicate relaxed inhalation at 15 L/min. Against the ambient air flux, numerical experiments have been performed to monitor the transport of liquid particulates with diameters 1-30 microns, bearing physical properties akin to aerosolized mucus with embedded virions. The full-scale numerical transmission trends to the lower airway were found consistent with the findings from a reduced-order mathematical model that conceptualized the impact of intra-airway vortex instabilities on local particle transport through point vortex idealization in an anatomy-guided 2D potential flow domain. The results collectively demonstrate markedly elevated trends of deep lung penetration by the URT-derived particulates, even if they are as large as 10- and 15 microns. The high viral load carried by such droplets to the bronchial spaces could mechanistically explain the accelerated seeding of infection in the lungs.</description>

      <title>A Kinetic Scheme Based On Positivity Preservation For Multi-component Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A kinetic model with flexible velocities is presented for solving the multi-component Euler equations. The model employs a two-velocity formulation in 1D and a three-velocity formulation in 2D. In 2D, the velocities are aligned with the cell-interface to ensure a locally one-dimensional macroscopic normal flux in a finite volume. The velocity magnitudes are defined to satisfy conditions for preservation of positivity of density of each component as well as of overall pressure for first order accuracy under a CFL-like time-step restriction. Additionally, at a stationary contact discontinuity, the velocity definition is modified to achieve exact capture. The basic scheme is extended to third order accuracy using a Chakravarthy-Osher type flux-limited approach along with Strong Stability Preserving Runge-Kutta (SSPRK) method. Benchmark 1D and 2D test cases, including shock-bubble interaction problems, are solved to demonstrate the efficacy of the solver in accurately capturing the relevant flow features.</description>

      <title>Insights of Transitions to Thermoacoustic Instability in Inverse Diffusion Flame using Multifractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inverse diffusion flame (IDF) can experience thermoacoustic instability due to variations in power input or flow conditions. However, the dynamical transitions in IDF that lead to this instability when altering control parameters have not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we explore the control parameters through two different approaches and employ multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis to characterize the transitions observed prior to the onset of thermoacoustic instability in the inverse diffusion flame. Our findings reveal a loss of multifractality near the region associated with thermoacoustic instability, which suggests a more ordered behavior. We determine that the singularity exponent, the width of the multifractal spectrum, and the Hurst exponent are reliable indicators of thermoacoustic instability and serve as effective classifiers of dynamical states in inverse diffusion flames.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Complexity and Computational Capabilites of Proteinoid Spike Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proteinoids, as soft matter fluidic systems, are computational substrates that have been recently proposed for their analog computing capabilities. Such systems exhibit oscillatory electrical activity because of cationic and anionic exchange inside and outside such gels. It has also been recently shown that this (analog) electrical activity, when sampled at fixed time intervals, can be used to reveal their underlying information-theoretic, computational code. This code, for instance, can be expressed in the (digital) language of Boolean gates and QR codes. Though, this might seem as a good evidence that proteinoid substrates have computing abilities when subjected to analog-to-digital transition, the leap from their underlying computational code to computing abilities is not well demonstrated. In this work, we analyse the electrical activity patterns of proteinoid substrates using computational methods including deep ReLU networks. Our findings suggest intriguing parallels between these patterns and certain computational frameworks, hinting at the possibility that such chemical systems might possess inherent information-processing and computational capabilities. To demonstrate the computational ability, we construct a prediction algorithm which acts as a binary classification model and extract 16-dimensional vector data from the proteinoid spike, in order to perform predictions with 70.41% accuracy. This model in its core has a unique transformation modality, inspired from number-theoretic sieve theory, and is combination of two functions: spiral sampling F1 and significant digit extraction F2 functions. The complexity of the transformed data is measured using eight distinct metrics, and effectively, using a single meta-metric.</description>

      <title>Bubble-assisted micromixing via thermally excited intrinsic air within microfluidic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The micromixing process in microfluidic devices is of central importance in quite a few applications, with microfluidic studies on carbon capture and environmental monitoring being two examples. High surface area to volume ratio in microscale flows outweighs the role of interfacial tension manipulation by means of introducing a secondary phase to the main flow in order to augment the typically diffusion-dominant mass transfer operation. In this paper, we introduce an easily integrable continuous flow micromixing scheme implemented on a simple Y-type microchannel based on thermally excited intrinsic air within microchannel. Thanks to the direct contact between the sputtered thin platinum microheater and the co-flowing streams, trapped air in the liquid and/or tiny crevices is employed to generate elongated bubbles with a millisecond lifespan, consuming less than 0.4 W of power and thereby enabling homogeneous mixing. The performance of the micromixer is characterized in terms of the mixing index (MI), and it is shown that immediately ahead of the microheater, the MI exceeds 95% for side-by-side flowing of water at different overall flowrates, namely 4, 10, and 20 uL/min. Interpreting the experimental results, supplemented by scaling arguments, we quantitatively describe the ephemeral role of emerging elongated bubbles in the micromixing process in which the Marangoni as well as Weber numbers are recognized as the characteristic local non-dimensional groups while the enhancing role of tiny daughter microbubbles on the micromixing downstream of the microchannel can be reflected in the Peclet and the Capillary numbers.</description>

      <title>Application of Machine Learning and Convex Limiting to Subgrid Flux Modeling in the Shallow-Water Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a combination of machine learning and flux limiting for property-preserving subgrid scale modeling in the context of flux-limited finite volume methods for the one-dimensional shallow-water equations. The numerical fluxes of a conservative target scheme are fitted to the coarse-mesh averages of a monotone fine-grid discretization using a neural network to parametrize the subgrid scale components. To ensure positivity preservation and the validity of local maximum principles, we use a flux limiter that constrains the intermediate states of an equivalent fluctuation form to stay in a convex admissible set. The results of our numerical studies confirm that the proposed combination of machine learning with monolithic convex limiting produces meaningful closures even in scenarios for which the network was not trained.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for the Advection-Diffusion Equation by Direct Block Encoding of the Time-Marching Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07909v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum algorithm for simulating multidimensional scalar transport problems using a time-marching strategy is presented. A direct unitary block encoding of the explicit time-marching operator is constructed, resulting in the intrinsic success probability of the squared solution norm without the need for amplitude amplification, thereby retaining a linear dependence on the simulation time. The algorithm separates the explicit time-marching operator into an advection-like component and a corrective shift operator. The advection-like component is mapped to a Hamiltonian simulation and combined with the shift operator through the linear combination of unitaries algorithm. State-vector simulations of a scalar transported in a steady two-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex support the theoretical findings.</description>
