      <title>The mysterious magnetic ground state of Ba14MnBi11 is likely altermagnetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mn-based transition metal Zintl compounds in the 14-1-11 phase are known to host complex atomic and magnetic structures owing to their intricate crystal structure. Among them, Ba14MnBi11 stands out as one of the least understood compounds, with experimental measurements and theoretical findings largely inconsistent. Following up on the earlier attempt [D. Sanchez-Portal et al., PRB 65, 144414 (2002)] at establishing a connection between metallicity and magnetism through a DFT-based analysis, our work aims to provide additional insights to resolve the existing contradictions. Our key finding is that the magnetic ground state is very susceptible to charge doping. DFT calculations for stoichiometric Ba14MnBi11 give a rather stable ferromagnetic metallic ground state. However, by adding exactly one additional electron per Mn, the system becomes semiconducting and the magnetic ground state becomes weakly antiferromagnetic (AF). On the other hand, upon small hole doping the system transitions to a special type of AF state known as altermagnetic ordering. The observed trends suggest that hole and electron doping-induced phase transitions likely result from different underlying mechanisms, influencing various exchange pathways. Additionally, our projected density-of-states along with bandstructure analyses indicate that, besides the largest hole contribution coming from the tetrahedral unit of Bi, the isolated Bi sites also play a substantial role and the dispersive bands near VBM suggest a rather complex hybridization network involving both Bi band characters. Through a comprehensive comparison of available data and our analysis, we propose that the inconsistency in magnetic states between experimental findings and DFT calculations is due to nonstoichiometric effects, likely impurities or defects.</description>

      <title>Circumventing cracking in grading 316L stainless steel to Monel400 through compositional modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In joining Fe-alloys and Cu-containing alloys to access the high strength of steels and corrosion resistance of Cu-alloy, cracking is widely observed due to the significant Cu microsegregation during the solidification process, resulting in an interdendritic Cu-rich liquid film at the end of solidification. By fabricating functionally graded materials (FGMs) that incorporate additional elements like Ni in the transition region between these terminal alloy classes, the hot cracking can be reduced. In the present work, the joining of stainless steel 316L (SS316L) and Monel400 by modifying the Ni concentration in the gradient region was studied. A new hot cracking criterion based on hybrid Scheil-equilibrium approach was developed and validated with monolithic multi-layer samples within the SS316L-Ni-Monel400 three-alloy system and an SS316L to 55/45 wt% SS316L/Ni to Monel400 FGM sample fabricated by direct energy deposition (DED) process. The new hot cracking criterion, based on the hybrid Scheil-equilibrium approach, is expected to help design FGM paths between other Fe-alloys and Cu-containing alloys as well.</description>

      <title>Crystals with Transformers on Graphs, for Prediction of Unconventional Crystal Material Properties and the Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ionic bonding across the lattice and ordered microscopic structures endow crystals with unique symmetry and determine their macroscopic properties. Unconventional crystals, in particular, exhibit non-traditional lattice structures or possess exotic physical properties, making them intriguing subjects for investigation. Therefore, to accurately predict the physical and chemical properties of crystals, it is crucial to consider long-range orders. While GNN excels at capturing the local environment of atoms in crystals, they often face challenges in effectively capturing longer-ranged interactions due to their limited depth. In this paper, we propose CrysToGraph ($\textbf{Crys}$tals with $\textbf{T}$ransformers $\textbf{o}$n $\textbf{Graph}$s), a novel transformer-based geometric graph network designed specifically for unconventional crystalline systems, and UnconvBench, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate models' predictive performance on unconventional crystal materials such as defected crystals, low-dimension crystals and MOF. CrysToGraph effectively captures short-range interactions with transformer-based graph convolution blocks as well as long-range interactions with graph-wise transformer blocks. CrysToGraph proofs its effectiveness in modelling unconventional crystal materials in multiple tasks, and moreover, it outperforms most existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the benchmarks of both unconventional crystals and traditional crystals.</description>

      <title>Phonon hydrodynamic regimes in sapphire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When an ideal insulator is cooled, four regimes of thermal conductivity are expected to emerge one after another. Two of these, the Ziman and the Poiseuille, are hydrodynamic regimes in which collision among phonons are mostly Normal. It has been difficult to observe them, save for a few insulators with high levels of isotopic and chemical purity. Our thermal transport measurements, covering four decades of temperatures between 0.1 K and 900 K, reveal that sapphire displays all four regimes, despite its isotopic impurity. In the Ziman regime, the thermal conductivity exponentially increases attaining an amplitude as large as 35,000 W/Km. We show that the peak thermal conductivity of ultra-pure, simple insulators, including diamond, silicon and solid helium, is set by a universal scaling depending on isotropic purity. The thermal conductivity of sapphire is an order of magnitude higher than what is expected by this scaling. We argue that this may be caused by the proximity of optical and acoustic phonon modes, as a consequence of the large number of atoms in the primitive cell.</description>

      <title>Nano-optics of transition metal dichalcogenides and their van der Waals heterostructures with electron spectroscopies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outstanding properties of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers and their van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, arising from their structure and the modified electron-hole Coulomb interaction in 2D, make them promising candidates for potential electro-optical devices. However, the production of reproducible devices remains challenging, partly due to variability at the nanometer to atomic scales. Thus, access to chemical, structural, and optical characterization at these lengthscales is essential. While electron microscopy and spectroscopy can provide chemical and structural data, accessing the optical response at the nanoscale through electron spectroscopies has been hindered until recently. This review focuses on the application of two electron spectroscopies in scanning (transmission) electron microscopes, namely cathodoluminescence and electron energy-loss spectroscopy, to study the nano-optics of TMD atomic layers and their vdW heterostructures. We discuss how technological advancements that can improve these spectroscopies, many of which are already underway, will make them ideal for studying the physics of vdW heterostructures at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Unique magnetic structure of the vdW antiferromagnet VBr$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VBr$_3$ is a van der Waals antiferromagnet below the N\'eel temperature of 26.5 K with a saturation moment of 1.2 mB/f.u. above the metamagnetic transitions detected in the in-plane and out-of-plane directions. To reveal the AFM structure of VBr$_3$ experimentally, we performed a single-crystal neutron diffraction study on a large high-quality crystal. The collected data confirmed a slight monoclinic distortion of the high-temperature rhombohedral structure below 90 K. The magnetic structure was, nevertheless, investigated within the R-3 model. The antiferromagnetic structure propagation vector k = (1, 0, 0.5) was revealed. In an attempt to determine the magnetic structure, 72 non-equivalent magnetic reflections were recorded. The experimental data were confronted with the magnetic space groups dictated by the R-3 lattice symmetry and propagation vector. The best agreement between the experimental data and the magnetic structure model was obtained for the space group P-1.1'_c. The magnetic unit cell of the proposed unique antiferromagnetic structure with periodicity 6c is built from two identical triple layers antiferromagnetically coupled along the c axis. Each triple layer comprises a N\'eel antiferromagnetic monolayer sandwiched between two antiferromagnetically coupled ferromagnetic monolayers.</description>

      <title>Designing single and degenerate flat bands in the Kagome lattice with long-range hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic structure of the kagome lattice model with first, second, and two kinds of third nearest-neighbor hoppings. We reveal that by tuning the third nearest-neighbor hoppings, not only single flat band but also degenerate flat band can be created on the \Gamma - M line. We provide the detailed conditions to realize them. The coexistence of these bands can be almost realized near the fundamental band gap in graphene with triangular defects in a superhoneycomb arrangement. Our results strongly indicate that long-range electron hopping has a new possibility for designing electronic structures.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Li decorated Si6C14 and Si8C12 nanocages as promising hydrogen storage media: A computational study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents the reversible hydrogen storage capacities of Li-decorated Si6C14 and Si8C12 using Density Functional Theory (DFT). The chemical stabilities of the designed Si6C14Li6 and Si8C12Li4 nanocages are investigated using HOMO-LUMO gaps and various global reactivity descriptors such as chemical hardness and electrophilicity index. Our study reveals that each Li atom decorated over the designed Si6C14 and Si8C12 nanocages can hold up to 5H2 molecules with adsorption energy lying in the optimum range of 0.14-0.085 eV, thereby yielding an overall gravimetric density of 13.8% and 9.2% respectively. The interaction between adsorbed H2 molecules and the Li metal sites is found to occur via non-covalent and closed shell type of interaction. The H2 molecules are adsorbed in a quasi-molecular fashion with elongated bond length. The molecular dynamics study reveals that most of the H2 molecules get desorbed from the designed host nanocages at 300K without causing any significant structural changes, which confirms their reversibility. When the adsorption and desorption conditions are set at 100K/60bar and 240K/1bar respectively, the practical storage gravimetric densities of Si6C14Li6 and Si8C12Li4 cages are estimated to be 13.73 wt% and 9.08 wt%, which are relatively high in comparison to the US-DOE target of 5.5 wt% by the year 2020. Hence, the computationally designed Si6C14Li6 and Si8C12Li4 nanocages can be regarded as prospective systems for hydrogen storage applications.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical Control of Ordering Kinetics and Vacancy Behavior in Fe-Al Thin Films Quenched by Laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of issues arising in materials science is a behavior of non-equilibrium point defects in the atomic lattice, which defines the rates of chemical reactions and relaxation processes as well as affects the physical properties of solids. It was previously predicted that melting and rapid solidification of metals and alloys provides a vacancy concentration in the quenched material, which can be comparable to that quantity at the point of melting. Here, we experimentally explore the vacancy behavior in thin films of the quasi-equiatomic Fe-Al alloy subjected to nanosecond laser annealing with intensities up to film ablation. The effects of laser irradiation are studied by monitoring magneto-optically the ordering kinetics in the alloy at the very ablation edge, within a narrow (micron-scale) ring-shaped region around the ablation zone. Quantitatively, the vacancy supersaturation in the quenched alloy has been estimated by fitting a simulated temporal evolution of the long-range chemical order to the obtained experimental data. Laser quenching (LQ) of alloys and single-element materials would be a tool for obtaining novel phase states within a small volume of the crystal.</description>

      <title>Negative Longitudinal Magnetoresistance in the Dirac Semimetal PtSe$_2$ -- Kondo Effect and Surface Spin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of negative longitudinal magnetoresistance in the topologically non-trivial transition-metal dichalcogenide PtSe$_2$ is studied. Low $T$/high $\mu_0 H$ transport is performed for arbitrary field directions, and an analytical framework is established. The source of the negative longitudinal magnetoresistance is identified as the Kondo effect stemming from Pt-vacancies contributing an uncompensated spin, exclusively at the sample surface. The concentration of vacancies and the sample thickness are identified as tuning parameters. The findings are substantiated by density functional theory, which corroborates the proposed Pt-vacancy model.</description>

      <title>Regulated magnetic anisotropy and charge density wave in uniformly fabricated Janus CrTeSe monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials with Janus structure host novel physical properties due to their inversional symmetry breaking. However, it remains elusive to synthesize Janus monolayer crystals with tailored long-range magnetic orders. Here, we have developed a general method to fabricate uniform Janus CrTeSe monolayers by selective selenization of preformed CrTe2 monolayers with molecular beam epitaxy. The uniform Janus structure of CrTeSe with high crystal quality is confirmed by high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy measurements unveil that the Janus CrTeSe undergoes a charge density wave (CDW) transition and a robust antiferromagnetic order. The magnetic anisotropy of CrTeSe is drastically altered compared to monolayer CrTe2 by the breaking symmetries induced from the Janus structure and the CDW transition, as is substantiated with first principles calculations. Our research achieves the construction of large-area Janus structures, and artificially tailors the electronic and magnetic properties of Janus systems at the two-dimensional limit.</description>

      <title>Signatures of paracrystallinity in amorphous silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of amorphous silicon (a-Si) has been studied for decades. The two main theories are based on a continuous random network and on a `paracrystalline' model, respectively -- the latter being defined as showing localized structural order resembling the crystalline state whilst retaining an overall amorphous network. However, the extent of this local order has been unclear, and experimental data have led to conflicting interpretations. Here we show that signatures of paracrystallinity in an otherwise disordered network are indeed compatible with the existing body of experimental observations for a-Si. We use quantum-mechanically accurate, machine-learning-driven simulations to systematically sample the configurational space of quenched a-Si, thereby allowing us to elucidate the boundary between amorphization and crystallization. We analyze our dataset using structural and local-energy descriptors to show that paracrystalline models are consistent with experiments in both regards. Our work provides a unified explanation for seemingly conflicting theories in one of the most widely studied amorphous networks.</description>

      <title>Theory of electric polarization induced by magnon transport in two-dimensional honeycomb antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum mechanical formalism for computing the electric polarization arising in two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnets (AFMs) as a result of {\bf both} spin and orbital transport effect of magnons. We first show that an applied temperature gradient in a 2D collinear honeycomb AFM gives rise to accumulations of magnons having both orbital moment and spin moment at the edges of the 2D AFM as the manifestation of the magnon Nernst effects. We then use our formalism to show that such magnon Nernst effects, in the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI), induce electric polarization that can be measured experimentally. Finally, we demonstrate the value of this formalism by using it to predict the properties of two 2D honeycomb AFMs, one each with N\'eel and zigzag order. These results integrate advances in magnonics, spinorbitronics, and orbitronics to create a unified framework that can be used to understand and control the manipulation of magnetic states in 2D AFMs through the magnon spin and orbital degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Towards an effective two-orbital description of Nickelate physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered Nickelates have emerged as promising candidates for high-temperature superconductivity, drawing parallels to the well-studied Cuprates. This study provides a robust theoretical framework to understand the electronic structure of these materials, particularly focusing on the role of effective orbitals and the emergence of extra Fermi pocket. Using a multi-orbital model that takes into account the essential symmetries and interactions of the involved orbitals ($5d_{z^2}$, $3d_{z^2}$, $3d_{x^2-y^2}$, $2p_x$, $2p_y$, $2p_z$), we investigated the impact of the Nickel $3d_{z^2}$ orbital on the Fermi surface and the conditions that favor the emergence of a secondary Fermi surface pocket. Our findings reveal that the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital, through its exchange interactions with the rare-earth layer, can modify the Fermi surface, thus acting as a crucial element in the electronic structure. We develop an effective two-orbital model applicable to both $RNiO_3$ and $RNiO_2$ families, explaining the sensitivity of the Fermi surface to apical Oxygen presence and high-pressure environments. This model captures the evolution of the Fermi surface and predicts susceptibility features analogous to those observed in Cuprate superconductors. We observe a peak in Lindhard susceptibility in these Nickelate systems at wave vector $\mathbf{q} = (\pi, \pi)$, similar to the Cuprates. This peak can be tuned by pressure and doping.</description>

      <title>Unconventional superconductivity in magic-strain graphene superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensive investigations on the Moir\'e magic-angle have been conducted in twisted bilayer graphene, unlocking the mystery of unconventional superconductivity and insulating states. In analog to magic angle, here we demonstrate the new concept of magic-strain in graphene systems by judiciously tailoring mechanical relaxation (stretch and compression) which is easier to implement in practice. We elucidate the interplay of strain-induced effects and delve into the resulting unconventional superconductivity or semimetal-insulator transition in relaxation-strained graphene, going beyond the traditional twisting approach. Our findings reveal how relaxation strain can trigger superconducting transitions (with an ultra-flat band at the Fermi level) or the semimetal-insulator transition (with a gap opening at the $K$ point of $0.39\rm{~eV}$) in both monolayer and bilayer graphene. These discoveries open up a new branch for correlated phenomena and provide deeper insights into the underlying physics of superconductors, which positions graphene as a highly tunable platform for novel electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Stability-superconductivity map for compressed Na-intercalated graphite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent ab initio investigation of Na-C binary compounds under moderate pressures has uncovered a possible stable NaC$_4$ superconductor with an estimated critical temperature up to 41K. We revisit this promising binary system by performing a more focused exploration of Na-intercalated graphite configurations, assessing the sensitivity of their thermodynamic stability to density functional approximations at different (T,P) conditions, and examining their superconducting properties with the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg formalism. The combinatorial screening of possible Na arrangements reveals additional stable stoichiometries, i.e., Na$_3$C$_{10}$, NaC$_8$, NaC$_{10}$, and NaC$_{12}$, that redefine the previously proposed convex hulls for pressures up to 10 GPa. The evaluation of formation enthalpies with different van der Waals functionals indicates that the proposed compounds might not be thermodynamically stable at zero temperature but some of them could stabilize due to the vibrational entropy or form via cold compression if graphite is used as a starting material. Our more rigorous modeling of the electron-phonon coupling in NaC$_4$ confirms the material's potential for high-temperature superconductivity, with a critical temperature reaching 48 K at 10 GPa, and reveals a well-defined two-gap structure unusual for an electron-doped compound. By tracking the position of the intercalant nearly free electron states with respect to the Fermi level in viable Na-C compounds, we map out the range of pressures and compositions needed for strong electron-phonon coupling and identify Na$_3$C$_{10}$ as an equally promising superconductor.</description>

      <title>Self-driving lab discovers principles for steering spontaneous emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We developed an autonomous experimentation platform to accelerate interpretable scientific discovery in ultrafast nanophotonics, targeting a novel method to steer spontaneous emission from reconfigurable semiconductor metasurfaces. Controlling spontaneous emission is crucial for clean-energy solutions in illumination, thermal radiation engineering, and remote sensing. Despite the potential of reconfigurable semiconductor metasurfaces with embedded sources for spatiotemporal control, achieving arbitrary far-field control remains challenging. Here, we present a self-driving lab (SDL) platform that addresses this challenge by discovering the governing equations for predicting the far-field emission profile from light-emitting metasurfaces. We discover that both the spatial gradient (grating-like) and the curvature (lens-like) of the local refractive index are key factors in steering spontaneous emission. The SDL employs a machine-learning framework comprising: (1) a variational autoencoder for generating complex spatial refractive index profiles, (2) an active learning agent for guiding experiments with real-time closed-loop feedback, and (3) a neural network-based equation learner to uncover structure-property relationships. The SDL demonstrated a four-fold enhancement in peak emission directivity (up to 77%) over a 72{\deg} field of view within ~300 experiments. Our findings reveal that combinations of positive gratings and lenses are as effective as negative lenses and gratings for all emission angles, offering a novel strategy for controlling spontaneous emission beyond conventional Fourier optics.</description>

      <title>Origin of interlayer exciton-phonon coupling in 2D heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coupling between excitons and phonons across adjacent layers has been experimentally observed in various heterostructures of layered materials. Yet the precise mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains elusive. Using the WSe$_2$@hBN heterostructure as an example, we study the origin of the interlayer exciton-phonon coupling and its signature in resonant Raman scattering through first-principles calculations. Our study emphasizes the central role of crystal symmetries in the interlayer exciton-phonon scattering processes, which are responsible for the anomalous resonant Raman intensities of the in-plane and the out-of-plane hBN phonon modes. We find that the deformation potential induced by the hBN phonon interacts with the hybridized hole density of WSe$_2$ excitons near the hBN interface, leading to interlayer exciton-phonon coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a quantum-classical hybrid scheme for performing orbital-free density functional theory (OFDFT) using probabilistic imaginary-time evolution (PITE), designed for the era of fault-tolerant quantum computers (FTQC), as a material calculation method for large-scale systems. PITE is applied to the part of OFDFT that searches the ground state of the Hamiltonian in each self-consistent field (SCF) iteration, while the other parts such as electron density and Hamiltonian updates are performed by existing algorithms on classical computers. When the simulation cell is discretized into $N_\mathrm{g}$ grid points, combined with quantum phase estimation (QPE), it is shown that obtaining the ground state energy of Hamiltonian requires a circuit depth of $O(\log N_\mathrm{g})$. The ground state calculation part in OFDFT is expected to be accelerated, for example, by creating an appropriate preconditioner from the estimated ground state energy for the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method.</description>

Abstract: The concept of Chern insulators is one of the most important buliding block of topological physics, enabling the quantum Hall effect without external magnetic fields. The construction of Chern insulators has been typically through an guess-and-confirm approach, which can be inefficient and unpredictable. In this paper, we introduce a systematic method to directly construct two-dimensional Chern insulators that can provide any nontrivial Chern number. Our method is built upon the one-dimensional Rice-Mele model, which is well known for its adjustable polarization properties, providing a reliable framework for manipulation. By extending this model into two dimensions, we are able to engineer lattice structures that demonstrate predetermined topological quantities effectively. This research not only contributes the development of Chern insulators but also paves the way for designing a variety of lattice structures with significant topological implications, potentially impacting quantum computing and materials science. With this approach, we are to shed light on the pathways for designing more complex and functional topological phases in synthetic materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting films of alpha-Ta are promising candidates for the fabrication of advanced superconducting qubits. However, alpha-Ta films suffer from many growth-induced structural inadequacies that negatively affect their performance. We have therefore explored a new synthesis method for alpha-Ta films which allows the growth of these films with unprecedented quality. Using this method, high quality alpha-Ta films are deposited at a comparably high substrate temperature of 1150 C. They are single-phase alpha-Ta and have a single out-of-plane (110) orientation. They consist of grains above 2 um that have one of three possible in-plane orientations. As shown by scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss studies the substrate-film interfaces are sharp with no observable intermixing. The obtained insights into the epitaxial growth of body-centered-cubic films on quasi-hexagonal substrates lay the basis for harnessing the high structural coherence of such films in various applications.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of graphene aerogels toward the absorption of liquid and gas pollutants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environmental disasters, such as the oil spill in Mexico gulf or, more recently, the Mauritius oil spill caused by a bulk carrier vessel, are some of the ecological issues that the modern society faces frequently. These accidents highlight the need for development of efficient materials that can be employed to eliminate pollutants including crude oil and its derivatives, as well as toxic organic solvents. The objective of the present study is to achieve the synthesis of graphene aerogels with two main methods and to determine their efficiency as absorbents of liquid and gas pollutants. Graphene aerogels were prepared according to the information given by Hong et al. (2015) and Yang et al. (2015). Both methods are based on the chemical reduction of graphene oxide as the first step and the formation of the aerogel as the second, providing a more cost-effective solution and resulting in a lattice structure similar to graphene. The fabricated materials were investigated for their absorption capacity for liquid and gas pollutants. The specimens were mounted in airtight microenvironments saturated with a specific Volatile Organic Compound (VOC). Three VOCs were tested; formaldehyde, acetic acid and hydrochloric acid and the results were based on gravimetric measurements. In order to increase the accuracy of the obtained data, a VOCs sensor was used to measure the change of voltage before and after the introduction of graphene aerogels in a saturated microenvironment. Furthermore, the graphene aerogels were evaluated as absorbents in organic solvents, namely acetone, ethanol and methanol.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a linear-scaling numerical method for exploring nonequilibrium electron dynamics in systems of arbitrary complexity. Based on the Chebyshev expansion of the time evolution of the single-particle density matrix, the method gives access to nonperturbative excitation and relaxation phenomena in models of disordered materials with sizes on the experimental scale. After validating the method by applying it to saturable optical absorption in clean graphene, we uncover that disorder can enhance absorption in graphene and that the interplay between light, anisotropy, and disorder in nanoporous graphene might be appealing for sensing applications. Beyond the optical properties of graphene-like materials, the method can be applied to a wide range of large-area materials and systems with arbitrary descriptions of defects and disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of multicomponent material composition space requires significant time and financial investments, necessitating efficient use of resources for statistically relevant compositions. This article introduces a novel methodology, implemented in the open-source CASTRO (ConstrAined Sequential laTin hypeRcube sampling methOd) software package, to overcome equality-mixture constraints and ensure comprehensive design space coverage. Our approach leverages Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) and LHS with multidimensional uniformity (LHSMDU) using a divide-and-conquer strategy to manage high-dimensional problems effectively. By incorporating previous experimental knowledge within a limited budget, our method strategically recommends a feasible number of experiments to explore the design space. We validate our methodology with two examples: a four-dimensional problem with near-uniform distributions and a nine-dimensional problem with additional mixture constraints, yielding specific component distributions. Our constrained sequential LHS or LHSMDU approach enables thorough design space exploration, proving robustness for experimental design. This research not only advances material science but also offers promising solutions for efficiency challenges in pharmaceuticals and chemicals. CASTRO and the case studies are available for free download on GitHub.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The screening problem for Coulomb potential of a charge located in a two-dimensional system has an intriguing solution with power-law screening factor decreasing with distance, which is crucially different from a 3D case with common exponential screening law. This stems from the outplane electrical fields leading to the long-range action on charge distribution. An effective screening length controlling the power law of potential drop far from the charge depends on material parameters of a 2D semiconductor, although it does not prevent from electron flooding of low-doped regions of a heterostructure. In Graphene and other materials with linear energy spectrum for electrons this flooding effects also occur, but the effective screening length is doping-level-dependent now. We built the theory for electronic potential and electrons concentration in a 1D-periodically doped Graphene sheet taking into account all effects of a long-range 2D screening and linear spectrum influence. We show that due to linear spectrum such problem results in a substantially nonlinear integro-differential equation, which can be solved numerically. Similar nonlinear problems arise in a wide range of doped structures using 2D linear spectrum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simple yield stress materials are composed of soft particles, bubbles, or droplets with purely repulsive forces. The constituent elements are typically too large to undergo thermal fluctuations, suggesting that the material internal structure, and therefore its rheology, should not change over time. Here, we explore the rheology of Carbopol, a prototypical simple yield stress material, and reveal that gradual, spontaneous relaxation of residual stresses, induced when loading the sample into rheometer, results in a small yet significant reduction in the material dynamic yield stress. This relaxation process can lead to a non-monotonic creep deformation rate under constant stress, culminating in delayed fluidization of the material. These findings highlight that yield stress is not merely a static material property but a function of the material internal stress state.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Water Behavior and Its Impact on Adsorption: A case study with CNTs and Diclofenac</title>

Abstract: Water is a fundamental component of life, playing a critical role in regulating metabolic processes and facilitating the dissolution and transport of essential molecules. However, the presence of emerging contaminants, such as pharmaceuticals, poses significant challenges to water quality and safety. Nanomaterials-based technologies arise as a promising tool to remove those contaminants from water. Nevertheless, interfacial water plays a major role in the adsorption of chemical compounds in the nanomaterials - as it plays in biological processes such as protein folding, enzyme activity, and drug delivery. To understand this role, in this study we employ Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations to explore the adsorption dynamics of potassium diclofenac (K-DCF) on single-walled (SWCNT) and double-walled (DWCNT) carbon nanotubes, considering both dry and wet conditions. Our findings reveal that the structuring of water molecules around CNTs creates hydration layers that significantly influence the accessibility of active sites and the interaction strength between contaminants and adsorbents. Our analysis indicates higher energy barriers for adsorption in DWCNTs compared to SWCNTs, which is attributed to stronger water-surface interactions. This research highlights the importance of understanding nanoscale water behavior for optimizing the design and functionality of nanomaterials for water purification. These findings can guide the development of more efficient and selective nanomaterials, enhancing contaminant removal and ensuring safer water resources, while also contributing to a deeper understanding of fundamental biological interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The yielding transition, structural relaxation, and mechanical properties of metallic glasses subjected to repeated loading are examined using molecular dynamics simulations. We consider a poorly-annealed Cu-Zr amorphous alloy periodically deformed in a wide range of strain amplitudes at room temperature. It is found that low-amplitude cyclic loading leads to a logarithmic decay of the potential energy, and lower energy states are attained when the strain amplitude approaches a critical point from below. Moreover, the potential energy after several thousand loading cycles is a linear function of the peak value of the stress overshoot during startup continuous shear deformation of the annealed sample. We show that the process of structural relaxation involves collective, irreversible rearrangements of groups of atoms whose spatial extent is most pronounced at the initial stage of loading and higher strain amplitudes. At the critical amplitude, the glass becomes mechanically annealed for a number of transient cycles and then yields via formation of a shear band. The yielding transition is clearly marked by abrupt changes in the potential energy, storage modulus, and fraction of atoms with large nonaffine displacements.</description>

Abstract: Phonon properties of realistic materials are routinely calculated within the Density Functional Perturbation Theory\,(DFPT). This is a semi--classical approach where the atoms are assumed to oscillate along classical trajectories immersed in the electronic Kohn--Sham density, treated quantistically. In this work I demonstrate that, in metals, non--adiabatic effects induce a gap between the DFTP phonon frequencies and the fully quantistic solution of the phonon Dyson equation. A gap that increases with the phonon energy width reflecting the breakdown of the semi--classical DFPT description. The final message is that non--adiabatic phonon effects can be included only by using a fully quantistic approach.</description>

      <title>Control of the magnetic anisotropy in multi-repeat Pt/Co/Al heterostructures using magneto-ionic gating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling magnetic properties through the application of an electric field is a significant challenge in modern nanomagnetism. In this study, we investigate the magneto-ionic control of magnetic anisotropy in the topmost Co layer in Ta/Pt/[Co/Al/Pt]$_n$/Co/Al/AlO$_\text{x}$ multilayer stacks comprising $n +1$ Co layers and its impact on the magnetic properties of the multilayers. We demonstrate that the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy can be reversibly quenched through gate-driven oxidation of the intermediary Al layer between Co and AlO$_\text{x}$, enabling dynamic control of the magnetic layers contributing to the out-of-plane remanence - varying between $n$ and $n +1$. For multilayer configurations with $n = 2$ and $n = 4$, we observe reversible and non-volatile additions of 1/3 and 1/5, respectively, to the anomalous Hall effect amplitude based on the applied gate voltage. Magnetic imaging reveals that the gate-induced spin-reorientation transition occurs through the propagation of a single 90$^{\circ}$ magnetic domain wall separating the perpendicular and in-plane anisotropy states. In the 5-repetition multilayer, the modification leads to a doubling of the period of the magnetic domains at remanence. These results demonstrate that the magneto-ionic control of the anisotropy of a single magnetic layer can be used to control the magnetic properties of coupled multilayer systems, extending beyond the gating effects on a single magnetic layer.</description>

      <title>AI-accelerated Discovery of Altermagnetic Materials</title>

Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new magnetic phase, has been theoretically proposed and experimentally verified to be distinct from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Although altermagnets have been found to possess many exotic physical properties, the limited availability of known altermagnetic materials hinders the study of such properties. Hence, discovering more types of altermagnetic materials with different properties is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of altermagnetism and thus facilitating new applications in the next generation information technologies, e.g., storage devices and high-sensitivity sensors. Since each altermagnetic material has a unique crystal structure, we propose an automated discovery approach empowered by an AI search engine that employs a pre-trained graph neural network to learn the intrinsic features of the material crystal structure, followed by fine-tuning a classifier with limited positive samples to predict the altermagnetism probability of a given material candidate. Finally, we successfully discovered 50 new altermagnetic materials that cover metals, semiconductors, and insulators confirmed by the first-principles electronic structure calculations. The wide range of electronic structural characteristics reveals that various novel physical properties manifest in these newly discovered altermagnetic materials, e.g., anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Kerr effect, and topological property. Noteworthy, we discovered 4 $i$-wave altermagnetic materials for the first time. Overall, the AI search engine performs much better than human experts and suggests a set of new altermagnetic materials with unique properties, outlining its potential for accelerated discovery of the materials with targeted properties.</description>

      <title>Elastic Softening in Synthetic Diamonds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03377v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study reveals a novel phenomenon demonstrating the elastic softening of synthetic diamonds when cooled to very low temperatures below 1 K. We present the results of ultrasonic measurements of single-crystalline synthetic diamonds without irradiation, namely type-IIa (colorless) and Ib (yellow) diamonds grown by high-pressure-high-temperature synthesis as well as type-IIa diamond grown by chemical vapor deposition. We observed a divergent decrease of the elastic stiffness constant $C_{44}$ in all samples at low temperatures down to 20 mK. We argue for the existence of electric quadrupolar degrees of freedom with irreducible representation $T_2$ in diamond as the origin of this elastic softening. The possible ground state preserves local $T_d$ symmetry presumably down to absolute zero. Of the ground states of atomic vacancies in diamond proposed thus far, the only relevant one is the positively charged single atomic vacancy V$^+$, which has not been observed in previous optical measurements in diamonds.</description>

      <title>Formation of Highly Tunable Periodic Plasmonic Structures on Gold Films Using Direct Laser Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct laser writing method is a promising technique for the large-scale and cost-effective fabrication of periodic nanostructure arrays exciting hybrid lattice plasmons. This type of electromagnetic mode manifests a narrow and deep resonance peak with a high dispersion whose precise controllability is crucial for practical applications in photonic devices. Here, the formation of differently shaped gold nanostructures using the direct laser writing method on Au layers of different thicknesses is presented. The resonance peak is demonstrated to be highly dependent on the shape of the structures in the array, thus its position in the spectra, as well as the quality, can be additionally modulated by changing the morphology. The shape of the structure and the resonance itself pertain not only on the laser pulse energy but also on the grating period. This overlapping effect occurring at distances smaller than the diameter of the focused laser beam is studied in detail. By taking advantage of the highly controllable plasmonic resonance, the fabricated gratings open up new opportunities for applications in sensing.</description>

      <title>Reversible out-of-plane to in-plane magnetic transition by electrical and thermal cycling in Ni$_{90}$Fe$_{10}$/BaTiO$_3$(001)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study investigates the manipulation of the magnetic anisotropy in a thick (1 $\mu$m) Ni$_{90}$Fe$_{10}$ layer electrodeposited on a ferroelectric BaTiO$_3$(001) substrate, using a combination of Magneto-optical Kerr Effect, Photoemission Electron Microscopy with X-ray circular magnetic dichroism and X-ray diffraction. In the as-grown state, the system shows weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and characteristic stripe domains. Upon out-of-plane electrical poling of the BaTiO$_3$ substrate, the magnetic anisotropy switches to in-plane with a strong uniaxial behavior. This change is ascribed to the magnetoelastic effect due to the switching of the BaTiO$_3$ ferroelectric [001] axis into the sample plane, as evidenced by XRD. The strong mechanical interaction with the thick Ni$_{90}$Fe$_{10}$ overlayer prevents the full inversion of the substrate. The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy can be recovered by a mild thermal annealing above the BaTiO$_3$ tetrahedral to cubic phase transition and can be cycled by repeated electrical poling/thermal annealing. This method opens the path to a reversible control of the magnetic anisotropy in Ni$_{90}$Fe$_{10}$/BaTiO$_3$ heterostructures from perpendicular to in-plane.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the electron interaction within tilted anisotropic Dirac materials when subjected to external electric and magnetic fields possessing translational symmetry. Specifically, we focus on a distinct non-zero electric field magnitude, enabling the decoupling of the differential equation system inherent in the eigenvalue problem. Subsequently, employing supersymmetric quantum mechanics facilitates the determination of eigenstates and eigenvalues corresponding to the Hamiltonian operator. To delve into a semi-classical analysis of the system, we identify a set of coherent states. Finally, we assess the characteristics of these states using fidelity and the phase-space representation through the Wigner function.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality and Strength of Interatomic Interactions Inducing the Topological Phonon Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the phonon behavior in semiconductors from a topological physics perspective provides more opportunities to uncover extraordinary physics related to phonon transport and electron-phonon interactions. While various kinds of topological phonons have been reported in different crystalline solids, their microscopic origin has not been quantitatively uncovered. In this work, four typical analytical interatomic force constant (IFC) models are employed for wurtzite GaN and AlN to help establish the relationships between phonon topology and real-space IFCs. In particular, various nearest neighbor IFCs, i.e., different levels of nonlocality, and IFC strength controlled by characteristic coefficients, can be achieved in these models. The results demonstrate that changes in the strength of both the IFCs and nonlocal interactions can induce phonon phase transitions in GaN and AlN, leading to the disappearance of existing Weyl phonons and the appearance of new Weyl phonons. These new Weyl phonons are the result of a band reversal and have a Chern number of 1. Most of them are located in the kz=0 plane in pairs, while some of them are inside or at the boundary of the irreducible Brillouin zone. Among the various Weyl points observed, certain ones remain identical in both materials, while others exhibit variability depending on the particular case. Compared to the strength of the IFC, nonlocal interactions show much more significant effects in inducing the topological phonon phase transition, especially in cases modeled by the IFC model and SW potential. The larger number of 3NN atoms provides more space for variations in the topological phonon phase of wurtzite AlN than in GaN, resulting in a greater abundance of changes in AlN.</description>

      <title>Correlation between optical phonon softening and superconducting $T_c$ in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$ within $d$-wave Eliashberg theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.05763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical description, based on d-wave Eliashberg theory, of the strong correlation between the experimentally observed softening of Raman modes associated with in-plane oxygen motions and the corresponding superconducting critical temperature $T_c$, as a function of oxygen doping $x$, in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$. The theoretical model provides a direct link between physical trends of soft optical $A_g$ (in-plane) oxygen modes, the level of oxygen doping $x$, and the superconducting $T_c$. Different regimes observed in the trend of $T_c$ vs doping can be related to corresponding regimes of optical phonon softening in the Raman spectra. These results provide further evidence related to the physical origin of high-temperature superconductivity in rare-earth cuprate oxides and to the significant role of electron-phonon coupling therein.</description>

      <title>Scoring Anomalous Vertices Through Quantum Walks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the constant flow of data from vast sources over the past decades, a plethora of advanced analytical techniques have been developed to extract relevant information from different data types ranging from labeled data, quasi-labeled data, and data with no labels known a priori. For data with at best quasi-labels, graphs are a natural representation of these data types and have important applications in many industries and scientific disciplines. Specifically, for unlabeled data, anomaly detection on graphs is a method to determine which data points do not posses the latent characteristics that is present in most other data. There have been a variety of classical methods to compute an anomalous score for the individual vertices of a respected graph, such as checking the local topology of a node,random walks, and complex neural networks. Leveraging the structure of the graph, we propose a first quantum algorithm to calculate the anomaly score of each node by continuously traversing the graph with a uniform starting position of all nodes. The proposed algorithm incorporates well-known characteristics of quantum random walks, and, taking into consideration the NISQ era and subsequent ISQ era, an adjustment to the algorithm is given to mitigate the increasing depth of the circuit. This algorithm is rigorously shown to converge to the expected probability, with respect to the initial condition.</description>

      <title>Geometrical properties of 3D crossed nanowire networks</title>

Abstract: Three-dimensional interconnected nanowire networks have recently attracted notable attention for the fabrication of new devices for energy harvesting/storage, sensing, catalysis, magnetic and spintronic applications and for the design of new hardware neuromorphic computing architectures. However, the complex branching of these nanowire networks makes it challenging to investigate these 3D nanostructured systems theoretically. Here, we present a theoretical description and simulations of the geometric properties of these 3D interconnected nanowire networks with selected characteristics. Our analysis reveals that the nanowire segment length between two crossing zones follows an exponential distribution. This suggests that shorter nanowire segments have a more pronounced influence on the nanowire network properties compared to their longer counterparts. Moreover, our observations reveal a homogeneous distribution in the smallest distance between the cores of two crossing nanowires. The results are highly reproducible and unaffected by changes in the nanowire network characteristics. The density of crossing zones and interconnected nanowire segments are found to vary as the square of the nanowire density multiplied by their diameter, further multiplied by a factor dependent on the packing factor. Finally, densities of interconnected segments up to 10$^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$ can be achieved for 22-$\mu$m-thick nanowire networks with high packing factors. This has important implications for neuromorphic computing applications, suggesting that the realization of 10$^{14}$ interconnections, which corresponds to the approximate number of synaptic connections in the human brain, is achievable with a nanowire network of about 10 cm$^{2}$.</description>

      <title>Clustering of negative topological charge precedes plastic failure in 3D glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deformation mechanism in amorphous solids subjected to external shear remains poorly understood because of the absence of well-defined topological defects mediating the plastic deformation. The notion of soft spots has emerged as a useful tool to characterize the onset of irreversible rearrangements and plastic flow, but these entities are not clearly defined in terms of geometry and topology. In this study, we unveil the phenomenology of recently discovered, precisely defined topological defects governing the microscopic mechanical and yielding behavior of a model 3D glass under shear deformation. We identify the existence of vortex-like and anti-vortex-like topological defects within the 3D non-affine displacement field. The number density of these defects exhibits a significant anti-correlation with the plastic events, with defect proliferation-annihilation cycles matching the alternation of elastic-like segments and catastrophic plastic drops, respectively. Furthermore, we observe collective annihilation of these point-like defects via plastic events, with large local topological charge fluctuations in the vicinity of regions that feature strong non-affine displacements. We reveal that plastic yielding is driven by several large sized clusters of net negative topological charge, the massive annihilation of which triggers the onset of plastic flow. These findings suggest a geometric and topological characterization of soft spots and pave the way for the mechanistic understanding of topological defects as mediators of plastic deformation in glassy materials.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Schwinger effect and non-perturbative light detection in lead halide perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dielectric breakdown of physical vacuum (Schwinger effect) is the textbook demonstration of compatibility of Relativity and Quantum theory. Although, the observation of this effect in its original static formulation is practically unachievable, it has been shown that the requirements on field strengths can be significantly reduced for dynamical generalizations of Schwinger effect. Here, we report on observation of an analog dynamical Schwinger effect in gapped Dirac semiconductor lead-halide perovskite MAPbBr$_3$. Specifically, we observe strong photoluminescence of a lead-halide perovskite driven by deep sub-gap irradiation, and use the quasi-adiabatic Landau-Dykhne approach to interpret our data in terms of the dynamical Schwinger effect. Further, the exponential sensitivity of the Schwinger effect to driving fields allows us to measure the local frozen-in fields in a nominally cubic single perovskite crystal at room temperature. Finally, we demonstrate an AC analogue of biasing in our system -- the non-perturbative cooperation between two time-dependent fields simultaneously driving the sample. Our results establish lead-halide perovskites as an excellent platform for simulating effects of strong fields on Dirac fields. In addition, they contribute to the on-going discussion about inversion-breaking in MAPbBr$_3$ single crystal and pave the way for a mid-infrared light detection with lead-halide perovskites.</description>
