      <title>Sesame: Opening the door to protein pockets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular docking is a cornerstone of drug discovery, relying on high-resolution ligand-bound structures to achieve accurate predictions. However, obtaining these structures is often costly and time-intensive, limiting their availability. In contrast, ligand-free structures are more accessible but suffer from reduced docking performance due to pocket geometries being less suited for ligand accommodation in apo structures. Traditional methods for artificially inducing these conformations, such as molecular dynamics simulations, are computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce Sesame, a generative model designed to predict this conformational change efficiently. By generating geometries better suited for ligand accommodation at a fraction of the computational cost, Sesame aims to provide a scalable solution for improving virtual screening workflows.</description>

      <title>Towards better structural models from cryo-electron microscopy data with physics-based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryo-electron microscopy can now routinely deliver atomic resolution structures for a variety of biological systems. The relevance and value of these structures is directly related to their ability to help rationalize experimental observables, which in turn depends on the quality of model built into the density map. Coupling traditional model building tools with physics-based methods, such as docking, simulation, and modern force fields, has been shown to improve the quality of the resulting structures. Here, we survey the landscape of these hybrid approaches, highlighting their usefulness for medium- and low-resolution datasets, as well as for structures of small molecules, and make the argument that the community stands to benefit from their inclusion in model building and refinement workflows.</description>

      <title>Computational predictions of nutrient precipitation for intensified cell 1 culture media via amino acid solution thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on the market are produced using Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells cultured at scale in chemically defined cell culture medium. Because of the high costs associated with mammalian cell cultures, obtaining high cell densities to produce high product titers is desired. These bioprocesses require high concentrations of nutrients in the basal media and periodically adding concentrated feed media to sustain cell growth and therapeutic protein productivity. Unfortunately, the desired or optimal nutrient concentrations of the feed media are often solubility limited due to precipitation of chemical complexes that form in the solution. Experimentally screening the various cell culture media configurations which contain 50 to 100 compounds can be expensive and laborious. This article lays the foundation for utilizing computational tools to understand precipitation of nutrients in cell culture media by studying the pairwise interactions between amino acids in thermodynamic models. Activity coefficient data for one amino acid in water and amino acid solubility data of two amino acids in water have been used to determine a single set of UNIFAC group interaction parameters to predict the thermodynamic behavior of the multi-component systems found in mammalian cell culture media. The data collected in this study is, to our knowledge, the largest set of ternary system amino acid solubility data reported to date. These amino acid precipitation predictions have been verified with experimentally measured ternary and quaternary amino acid solutions. Thus, we demonstrate the utility of our model as a digital twin to identify optimal cell culture media compositions by replacing empirical approaches for nutrient precipitation with computational predictions based on thermodynamics of individual media components in complex mixtures.</description>

      <title>Canonicalization of the E value from BLAST similarity search -- dissimilarity measure and distance function for a metric space of protein sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequence matching algorithms such as BLAST and FASTA have been widely used in searching for evolutionary origin and biological functions of newly discovered nucleic acid and protein sequences. As parts of these search tools, alignment scores and E values are useful indicators of the quality of search results from querying a database of annotated sequences, whereby a high alignment score (and inversely a low E value) reflects significant similarity between the query and the subject (target) sequences. For cross-comparison of results from sufficiently different queries however, the interpretation of alignment score as a similarity measure and E value a dissimilarity measure becomes somewhat nuanced, and prompts herein a judicious distinction of different types of similarity. We show that an adjustment of E value to account for self-matching of query and subject sequences corrects for certain ostensibly anomalous similarity comparisons, resulting in canonical dissimilarity and similarity measures that would be more appropriate for database applications, such as all-on-all sequence alignment or selection of diverse subsets. In actual practice, the canonicalization of E value dissimilarity improves clustering and the diversity of subset selection. While both E value and the canonical E value share positivity and symmetry, two of the four axiomatic properties of a metric space, the canonical E value itself is also reflexive and meets the condition of triangle inequality, thus an appropriate distance function for a metric space of protein sequences.</description>

      <title>CAME-AB: Cross-Modality Attention with Mixture-of-Experts for Antibody Binding Site Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antibody binding site prediction plays a pivotal role in computational immunology and therapeutic antibody design. Existing sequence or structure methods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific binding sites on the antigens-a dual limitation in representation and prediction. In this paper, we propose CAME-AB, a novel Cross-modality Attention framework with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone for robust antibody binding site prediction. CAME-AB integrates five biologically grounded modalities, including raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM substitution profiles, pretrained language model embeddings, structure-aware features, and GCN-refined biochemical graphs-into a unified multimodal representation. To enhance adaptive cross-modal reasoning, we propose an adaptive modality fusion module that learns to dynamically weight each modality based on its global relevance and input-specific contribution. A Transformer encoder combined with an MoE module further promotes feature specialization and capacity expansion. We additionally incorporate a supervised contrastive learning objective to explicitly shape the latent space geometry, encouraging intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. To improve optimization stability and generalization, we apply stochastic weight averaging during training. Extensive experiments on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets demonstrate that CAME-AB consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple metrics, including Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each architectural component and the benefit of multimodal feature integration. The model implementation details and the codes are available on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CAME-AB-C525</description>

      <title>Molecular Generative Adversarial Network with Multi-Property Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), have been employed for $de~novo$ molecular generation in drug discovery. Most prior studies have utilized reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, particularly Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), to handle the discrete nature of molecular representations in GANs. However, due to the inherent instability in training GANs and RL models, along with the high computational cost associated with MCTS sampling, MCTS RL-based GANs struggle to scale to large chemical databases. To tackle these challenges, this study introduces a novel GAN based on actor-critic RL with instant and global rewards, called InstGAN, to generate molecules at the token-level with multi-property optimization. Furthermore, maximized information entropy is leveraged to alleviate the mode collapse. The experimental results demonstrate that InstGAN outperforms other baselines, achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models, and efficiently generates molecules with multi-property optimization. The source code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.</description>

      <title>Diffusion on language model encodings for protein sequence generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03726v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein sequence design has seen significant advances through discrete diffusion and autoregressive approaches, yet the potential of continuous diffusion remains underexplored. Here, we present DiMA, a latent diffusion framework that operates on protein language model representations. Through systematic exploration of architectural choices and diffusion components, we develop a robust methodology that generalizes across multiple protein encoders ranging from 8M to 3B parameters. We demonstrate that our framework achieves consistently high performance across sequence-only (ESM-2, ESMc), dual-decodable (CHEAP), and multimodal (SaProt) representations using the same architecture and training approach. We extensively evaluate existing methods alongside DiMA using multiple metrics across two protein modalities, covering quality, diversity, novelty, and distribution matching of generated proteins. DiMA consistently produces novel, high-quality and diverse protein sequences and achieves strong results compared to baselines such as autoregressive, discrete diffusion and flow matching language models. The model demonstrates versatile functionality, supporting conditional generation tasks including protein family-generation, motif scaffolding and infilling, and fold-specific sequence design. This work provides a universal continuous diffusion framework for protein sequence generation, offering both architectural insights and practical applicability across various protein design scenarios. Code is released at \href{https://github.com/MeshchaninovViacheslav/DiMA}{GitHub}.</description>
