      <title>Myopically Verifiable Probabilistic Certificates for Safe Control and Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the design of safety certificates for stochastic systems, with a focus on ensuring long-term safety through fast real-time control. In stochastic environments, set invariance-based methods that restrict the probability of risk events in infinitesimal time intervals may exhibit significant long-term risks due to cumulative uncertainties/risks. On the other hand, reachability-based approaches that account for the long-term future may require prohibitive computation in real-time decision making. To overcome this challenge involving stringent long-term safety vs. computation tradeoffs, we first introduce a novel technique termed `probabilistic invariance'. This technique characterizes the invariance conditions of the probability of interest. When the target probability is defined using long-term trajectories, this technique can be used to design myopic conditions/controllers with assured long-term safe probability. Then, we integrate this technique into safe control and learning. The proposed control methods efficiently assure long-term safety using neural networks or model predictive controllers with short outlook horizons. The proposed learning methods can be used to guarantee long-term safety during and after training. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed techniques in numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>DRL2FC: An Attack-Resilient Controller for Automatic Generation Control Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power grids heavily rely on Automatic Generation Control (AGC) systems to maintain grid stability by balancing generation and demand. However, the increasing digitization and interconnection of power grid infrastructure expose AGC systems to new vulnerabilities, particularly from cyberattacks such as false data injection attacks (FDIAs). These attacks aim at manipulating sensor measurements and control signals by injecting tampered data into the communication mediums. As such, it is necessary to develop innovative approaches that enhance the resilience of AGC systems. This paper addresses this challenge by exploring the potential of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to enhancing the resilience of AGC systems against FDIAs. To this end, a DRL-based controller is proposed that dynamically adjusts generator setpoints in response to both load fluctuations and potential cyber threats. The controller learns these optimal control policies by interacting with a simulated power system environment that incorporates the AGC dynamics under cyberattacks. The extensive experiments on test power systems subjected to various FDIAs demonstrate the effectiveness of the presented approach in mitigating the impact of cyberattacks.</description>

      <title>Toward Automated Formation of Composite Micro-Structures Using Holographic Optical Tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic Optical Tweezers (HOT) are powerful tools that can manipulate micro and nano-scale objects with high accuracy and precision. They are most commonly used for biological applications, such as cellular studies, and more recently, micro-structure assemblies. Automation has been of significant interest in the HOT field, since human-run experiments are time-consuming and require skilled operator(s). Automated HOTs, however, commonly use point traps, which focus high intensity laser light at specific spots in fluid media to attract and move micro-objects. In this paper, we develop a novel automated system of tweezing multiple micro-objects more efficiently using multiplexed optical traps. Multiplexed traps enable the simultaneous trapping of multiple beads in various alternate multiplexing formations, such as annular rings and line patterns. Our automated system is realized by augmenting the capabilities of a commercially available HOT with real-time bead detection and tracking, and wavefront-based path planning. We demonstrate the usefulness of the system by assembling two different composite micro-structures, comprising 5 $\mu m$ polystyrene beads, using both annular and line shaped traps in obstacle-rich environments.</description>

      <title>Finite Sample Analysis for a Class of Subspace Identification Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While subspace identification methods (SIMs) are appealing due to their simple parameterization for MIMO systems and robust numerical realizations, a comprehensive statistical analysis of SIMs remains an open problem, especially in the non-asymptotic regime. In this work, we provide a finite sample analysis for a class of SIMs, which reveals that the convergence rates for estimating Markov parameters and system matrices are $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$, in line with classical asymptotic results. Based on the observation that the model format in classical SIMs becomes non-causal because of a projection step, we choose a parsimonious SIM that bypasses the projection step and strictly enforces a causal model to facilitate the analysis, where a bank of ARX models are estimated in parallel. Leveraging recent results from finite sample analysis of an individual ARX model, we obtain an overall error bound of an array of ARX models and proceed to derive error bounds for system matrices via robustness results for the singular value decomposition.</description>

      <title>Establishing best practices for modeling long duration energy storage in deeply decarbonized energy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long duration energy storage (LDES) may become a critical technology for the decarbonization of the power sector, as current commercially available Li-ion battery storage technologies cannot cost-effectively shift energy to address multi-day or seasonal variability in demand and renewable energy availability. LDES is difficult to model in existing energy system planning models (such as electricity system capacity expansion models), as it is much more dependent on an accurate representation of chronology than other resources. Techniques exist for modeling LDES in these planning models; however, it is not known how spatial and temporal resolution affect the performance of these techniques, creating a research gap. In this study we examine what spatial and temporal resolution is necessarily to accurately capture the full value of LDES, in the context of a continent-scale capacity expansion model. We use the results to draw conclusions and present best practices for modelers seeking to accurately model LDES in a macro-energy systems planning context. Our key findings are: 1) modeling LDES with linked representative periods is crucial to capturing its full value, 2) LDES value is highly sensitive to the cost and availability of other resources, and 3) temporal resolution is more important than spatial resolution for capturing the full value of LDES, although how much temporal resolution is needed will depend on the specific model context.</description>

      <title>Scalable Adaptive Traffic Light Control Over a Traffic Network Including Turns, Transit Delays, and Blocking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop adaptive data-driven traffic light controllers for a grid-like traffic network considering straight, left-turn, and right-turn traffic flows. The analysis incorporates transit delays and blocking effects on vehicle movements between neighboring intersections. Using a stochastic hybrid system model with parametric traffic light controllers, we use Infinitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) to derive a data-driven cost gradient estimator with respect to controllable parameters. We then iteratively adjust them through an online gradient-based algorithm to improve performance metrics. By integrating a flexible modeling framework to represent diverse intersection and traffic network configurations with event-driven IPA-based adaptive controllers, we develop a general scalable, adaptive framework for real-time traffic light control in multi-intersection traffic networks.</description>

      <title>Smart Grids Secured By Dynamic Watermarking: How Secure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unconditional security for smart grids is defined. Cryptanalyses of the watermarked security of smart grids indicate that watermarking cannot guarantee unconditional security unless the communication within the grid system is unconditionally secure. The successful attack against the dynamically watermarked smart grid remains valid even with the presence of internal noise from the grid. An open question arises: if unconditionally authenticated secure communications within the grid, together with tamper resistance of the critical elements, are satisfactory conditions to provide unconditional security for the grid operation.</description>

      <title>Learning Control Barrier Functions and their application in Reinforcement Learning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a powerful technique for developing new robot behaviors. However, typical lack of safety guarantees constitutes a hurdle for its practical application on real robots. To address this issue, safe reinforcement learning aims to incorporate safety considerations, enabling faster transfer to real robots and facilitating lifelong learning. One promising approach within safe reinforcement learning is the use of control barrier functions. These functions provide a framework to ensure that the system remains in a safe state during the learning process. However, synthesizing control barrier functions is not straightforward and often requires ample domain knowledge. This challenge motivates the exploration of data-driven methods for automatically defining control barrier functions, which is highly appealing. We conduct a comprehensive review of the existing literature on safe reinforcement learning using control barrier functions. Additionally, we investigate various techniques for automatically learning the Control Barrier Functions, aiming to enhance the safety and efficacy of Reinforcement Learning in practical robot applications.</description>

      <title>A new Taxonomy for Automated Driving: Structuring Applications based on their Operational Design Domain, Level of Automation and Automation Readiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate the relationship between operational design domains (ODD), automated driving SAE Levels, and Technology Readiness Level (TRL). The first highly automated vehicles, like robotaxis, are in commercial use, and the first vehicles with highway pilot systems have been delivered to private customers. It has emerged as a crucial issue that these automated driving systems differ significantly in their ODD and in their technical maturity. Consequently, any approach to compare these systems is difficult and requires a deep dive into defined ODDs, specifications, and technologies used. Therefore, this paper challenges current state-of-the-art taxonomies and develops a new and integrated taxonomy that can structure automated vehicle systems more efficiently. We use the well-known SAE Levels 0-5 as the "level of responsibility", and link and describe the ODD at an intermediate level of abstraction. Finally, a new maturity model is explicitly proposed to improve the comparability of automated vehicles and driving functions. This method is then used to analyze today's existing automated vehicle applications, which are structured into the new taxonomy and rated by the new maturity levels. Our results indicate that this new taxonomy and maturity level model will help to differentiate automated vehicle systems in discussions more clearly and to discover white fields more systematically and upfront, e.g. for research but also for regulatory purposes.</description>

      <title>TIUP: Effective Processor Verification with Tautology-Induced Universal Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Design verification is a complex and costly task, especially for large and intricate processor projects. Formal verification techniques provide advantages by thoroughly examining design behaviors, but they require extensive labor and expertise in property formulation. Recent research focuses on verifying designs using the self-consistency universal property, reducing verification difficulty as it is design-independent. However, the single self-consistency property faces false positives and scalability issues due to exponential state space growth. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces TIUP, a technique using tautologies as universal properties. We show how TIUP effectively uses tautologies as abstract specifications, covering processor data and control paths. TIUP simplifies and streamlines verification for engineers, enabling efficient formal processor verification.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present Misaka, a visualized swarm testbed for smart grid algorithm evaluation, also an extendable open-source open-hardware platform for developing tabletop tangible swarm interfaces. The platform consists of a collection of custom-designed 3 omni-directional wheels robots each 10 cm in diameter, high accuracy localization through a microdot pattern overlaid on top of the activity sheets, and a software framework for application development and control, while remaining affordable (per unit cost about 30 USD at the prototype stage). We illustrate the potential of tabletop swarm user interfaces through a set of smart grid algorithm application scenarios developed with Misaka.</description>

      <title>Colosseum: The Open RAN Digital Twin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the Open Radio Access Network (RAN) paradigm transforming the fundamental ways cellular systems are deployed, managed, and optimized. This shift is led by concepts such as openness, softwarization, programmability, interoperability, and intelligence of the network, all of which had never been applied to the cellular ecosystem before. The realization of the Open RAN vision into practical architectures, intelligent data-driven control loops, and efficient software implementations, however, is a multifaceted challenge, which requires (i) datasets to train Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models; (ii) facilities to test models without disrupting production networks; (iii) continuous and automated validation of the RAN software; and (iv) significant testing and integration efforts. This paper poses itself as a tutorial on how Colosseum - the world's largest wireless network emulator with hardware in the loop - can provide the research infrastructure and tools to fill the gap between the Open RAN vision, and the deployment and commercialization of open and programmable networks. We describe how Colosseum implements an Open RAN digital twin through a high-fidelity Radio Frequency (RF) channel emulator and end-to-end softwarized O-RAN and 5G-compliant protocol stacks, thus allowing users to reproduce and experiment upon topologies representative of real-world cellular deployments. Then, we detail the twinning infrastructure of Colosseum, as well as the automation pipelines for RF and protocol stack twinning. Finally, we showcase a broad range of Open RAN use cases implemented on Colosseum, including the real-time connection between the digital twin and real-world networks, and the development, prototyping, and testing of AI/ML solutions for Open RAN.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Collisions in Sidelink NR V2X: A Study on Cooperative Resource Allocation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New Radio (NR) Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) Sidelink (SL), an integral part of the 5G NR standard, is expected to revolutionize the automotive and rail industries by enabling direct and low-latency exchange of critical information between traffic participants independently of cellular networks. However, this advancement depends primarily on efficient SL resource allocation. Mode 2(a) is a well-known method for this purpose, where each node autonomously selects resources. However, this method is prone to packet collisions due to the hidden-node problem. In this paper, we propose a cooperative scheduling method that could potentially address this issue. We describe an extension of Mode 2(a) that allows nodes to share resource allocation information at two hops. Initial simulation results show a promising improvement over Mode 2(a).</description>

      <title>Applications of Lifted Nonlinear Cuts to Convex Relaxations of the AC Power Flow Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that valid inequalities, or lifted nonlinear cuts (LNC), can be projected to tighten the Second Order Cone (SOC), Convex DistFlow (CDF), and Network Flow (NF) relaxations of the AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problem. We conduct experiments on 36 cases from the PGLib-OPF library for two objective functions, (1) power generation maximization and (2) generation cost minimization. Significant optimality gap improvements are shown for the maximization problem, where the LNC strengthen the SOC and CDF relaxations in 100% of the test cases, with average and maximum differences in the optimality gaps of 23.1% and 93.5% respectively. The NF relaxation is strengthened in 79.2% of test cases, with average and maximum differences in the optimality gaps of 3.45% and 21.2% respectively. We also study the trade-off between relaxation quality and solve time, demonstrating that the strengthened CDF relaxation outperforms the strengthened SOC formulation in terms of runtime and number of iterations needed, while the strengthened NF formulation is the most scalable with the lowest relaxation quality provided by these LNC.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes the context driven Critical Integrative Levels (CIL), a novel approach to lighting asset management in public libraries that aligns with the transformative vision of human-centric and integrative lighting. This approach encompasses not only the visual aspects of lighting performance but also prioritizes the physiological and psychological well-being of library users. Incorporating a newly defined metric, Mean Time of Exposure (MTOE), the approach quantifies user-light interaction, enabling tailored lighting strategies that respond to diverse activities and needs in library spaces. Case studies demonstrate how the CIL matrix can be practically applied, offering significant improvements over conventional methods by focusing on optimized user experiences from both visual impacts and non-visual effects.</description>

      <title>Distributed Sequential Receding Horizon Control of Multi-Agent Systems under Recurring Signal Temporal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the synthesis problem of a multi-agent system under signal temporal logic (STL) specifications representing bounded-time tasks that need to be satisfied recurrently over an infinite horizon. Motivated by the limited approaches to handling recurring STL systematically, we tackle the infinite-horizon control problem with a receding horizon scheme equipped with additional STL constraints that introduce minimal complexity and a backward-reachability-based terminal condition that is straightforward to construct and ensures recursive feasibility. Subsequently, we decompose the global receding horizon optimization problem into agent-level programs the objectives of which are to minimize local cost functions subject to local and joint STL constraints. We propose a scheduling policy that allows individual agents to sequentially optimize their control actions while maintaining recursive feasibility. This results in a distributed strategy that can operate online as a model predictive controller. Last, we illustrate the effectiveness of our method via a multi-agent system example assigned a surveillance task.</description>

      <title>A Robust, Efficient Predictive Safety Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel predictive safety filter that is robust to bounded perturbations and is implemented in an even-triggered fashion to reduce online computation. The proposed safety filter extends upon existing work to reject disturbances for discrete-time, time-varying nonlinear systems with time-varying constraints. The safety filter is based on novel concepts of robust, discrete-time barrier functions and can be used to filter any control law. Here, we use the safety filter in conjunction with Differentiable Predictive Control (DPC) as a promising offline learning-based policy optimization method. The approach is demonstrated on a two-tank system, building, and single-integrator example.</description>

      <title>On Completeness of SDP-Based Barrier Certificate Synthesis over Unbounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Barrier certificates, serving as differential invariants that witness system safety, play a crucial role in the verification of cyber-physical systems (CPS). Prevailing computational methods for synthesizing barrier certificates are based on semidefinite programming (SDP) by exploiting Putinar Positivstellensatz. Consequently, these approaches are limited by the Archimedean condition, which requires all variables to be bounded, i.e., systems are defined over bounded domains. For systems over unbounded domains, unfortunately, existing methods become incomplete and may fail to identify potential barrier certificates.
  In this paper, we address this limitation for the unbounded cases. We first give a complete characterization of polynomial barrier certificates by using homogenization, a recent technique in the optimization community to reduce an unbounded optimization problem to a bounded one. Furthermore, motivated by this formulation, we introduce the definition of homogenized systems and propose a complete characterization of a family of non-polynomial barrier certificates with more expressive power. Experimental results demonstrate that our two approaches are more effective while maintaining a comparable level of efficiency.</description>

      <title>Collision Avoidance Verification of Multiagent Systems with Learned Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For many multiagent control problems, neural networks (NNs) have enabled promising new capabilities. However, many of these systems lack formal guarantees (e.g., collision avoidance, robustness), which prevents leveraging these advances in safety-critical settings. While there is recent work on formal verification of NN-controlled systems, most existing techniques cannot handle scenarios with more than one agent. To address this research gap, this paper presents a backward reachability-based approach for verifying the collision avoidance properties of Multi-Agent Neural Feedback Loops (MA-NFLs). Given the dynamics models and trained control policies of each agent, the proposed algorithm computes relative backprojection sets by (simultaneously) solving a series of Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) offline for each pair of agents. We account for state measurement uncertainties, making it well aligned with real-world scenarios. Using those results, the agents can quickly check for collision avoidance online by solving low-dimensional Linear Programs (LPs). We demonstrate the proposed algorithm can verify collision-free properties of a MA-NFL with agents trained to imitate a collision avoidance algorithm (Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles). We further demonstrate the computational scalability of the approach on systems with up to 10 agents.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Metaplasticity for Continual Learning with Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge devices operating in dynamic environments critically need the ability to continually learn without catastrophic forgetting. The strict resource constraints in these devices pose a major challenge to achieve this, as continual learning entails memory and computational overhead. Crossbar architectures using memristor devices offer energy efficiency through compute-in-memory and hold promise to address this issue. However, memristors often exhibit low precision and high variability in conductance modulation, rendering them unsuitable for continual learning solutions that require precise modulation of weight magnitude for consolidation. Current approaches fall short to address this challenge directly and rely on auxiliary high-precision memory, leading to frequent memory access, high memory overhead, and energy dissipation. In this research, we propose probabilistic metaplasticity, which consolidates weights by modulating their update probability rather than magnitude. The proposed mechanism eliminates high-precision modification to weight magnitudes and, consequently, the need for auxiliary high-precision memory. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed mechanism by integrating probabilistic metaplasticity into a spiking network trained on an error threshold with low-precision memristor weights. Evaluations of two continual learning benchmarks show that probabilistic metaplasticity achieves state-of-the-art performance while consuming ~ 67% lower memory for additional parameters and up to two orders of magnitude lower energy during parameter updates compared to an auxiliary memory-based solution. The proposed model shows potential for energy-efficient continual learning with low-precision emerging devices.</description>

      <title>Battery Capacity Knee-Onset Identification and Early Prediction Using Degradation Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abrupt capacity fade can have a significant impact on performance and safety in battery applications. To address concerns arising from possible knee occurrence, this work aims for a better understanding of their cause by introducing a new definition of capacity knees and their onset. A curvature-based identification of a knee and its onset is proposed, which relies on the discovery of a distinctly fluctuating behavior in the transition between an initial and a final stable acceleration of the degradation. The method is validated on experimental degradation data of two different battery chemistries, synthetic degradation data, and is also benchmarked to the state-of-the-art knee identification method in the literature. The results demonstrate that our proposed method could successfully identify capacity knees when the state-of-the-art knee identification method failed. Furthermore, a significantly strong correlation is found between knee and end of life (EoL) and almost equally strong between knee onset and EoL. As the method does not require the full capacity fade curve, this opens up online knee-onset identification as well as knee and EoL prediction.</description>

      <title>Kinodynamic Motion Planning via Funnel Control for Underactuated Unmanned Surface Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an algorithm to control an underactuated unmanned surface vehicle (USV) using kinodynamic motion planning with funnel control (KDF). KDF has two key components: motion planning used to generate trajectories with respect to kinodynamic constraints, and funnel control, also referred to as prescribed performance control, which enables trajectory tracking in the presence of uncertain dynamics and disturbances. We extend prescribed performance control to address the challenges posed by underactuation and control-input saturation present on the USV. The proposed scheme guarantees stability under user-defined prescribed performance functions where model parameters and exogenous disturbances are unknown. Furthermore, we present an optimization problem to obtain smooth, collision-free trajectories while respecting kinodynamic constraints. We deploy the algorithm on a USV and verify its efficiency in real-world open-water experiments.</description>

      <title>Motion Control of Two Mobile Robots under Allowable Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates the motion control problem of two mobile robots under allowable collisions. Here, the allowable collisions mean that the collisions do not damage the mobile robots. The occurrence of the collisions is discussed and the effects of the collisions on the mobile robots are analyzed to develop a hybrid model of each mobile robot under allowable collisions. Based on the effects of the collisions, we show the necessity of redesigning the motion control strategy for mobile robots. Furthermore, impulsive control techniques are applied to redesign the motion control strategy to guarantee the task accomplishment for each mobile robot. Finally, an example is used to illustrate the redesigned motion control strategy.</description>
