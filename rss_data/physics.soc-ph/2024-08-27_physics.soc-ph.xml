      <title>Oscillatory and Excitable Dynamics in an Opinion Model with Group Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In traditional models of opinion dynamics, each agent in a network has an opinion and changes in opinions arise from pairwise (i.e., dyadic) interactions between agents. However, in many situations, groups of individuals can possess a collective opinion that may differ from the opinions of the individuals. In this paper, we study the effects of group opinions on opinion dynamics. We formulate a hypergraph model in which both individual agents and groups of 3 agents have opinions, and we examine how opinions evolve through both dyadic interactions and group memberships. In some parameter regimes, we find that the presence of group opinions can lead to oscillatory and excitable opinion dynamics. In the oscillatory regime, the mean opinion of the agents in a network has self-sustained oscillations. In the excitable regime, finite-size effects create large but short-lived opinion swings (as in social fads). We develop a mean-field approximation of our model and obtain good agreement with direct numerical simulations. We also show, both numerically and via our mean-field description, that oscillatory dynamics occur only when the number of dyadic and polyadic interactions per agent are not completely correlated. Our results illustrate how polyadic structures, such as groups of agents, can have important effects on collective opinion dynamics.</description>

      <title>ORBITAAL: A Temporal Graph Dataset of Bitcoin Entity-Entity Transactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research on Bitcoin (BTC) transactions is a matter of interest for both economic and network science fields. Although this cryptocurrency is based on a decentralized system, making transaction details freely accessible, making raw blockchain data analyzable is not straightforward due to the Bitcoin protocol specificity and data richness. To address the need for an accessible dataset, we present ORBITAAL, the first comprehensive dataset based on temporal graph formalism. The dataset covers all Bitcoin transactions from January 2009 to January 2021. ORBITAAL provides temporal graph representations of entity-entity transaction networks, snapshots and stream graph. Each transaction value is given in Bitcoin and US dollar regarding daily-based conversion rate. This dataset also provides details on entities such as their global BTC balance and associated public addresses.</description>

      <title>Big Tech influence over AI research revisited: memetic analysis of attribution of ideas to affiliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There exists a growing discourse around the domination of Big Tech on the landscape of artificial intelligence (AI) research, yet our comprehension of this phenomenon remains cursory. This paper aims to broaden and deepen our understanding of Big Tech's reach and power within AI research. It highlights the dominance not merely in terms of sheer publication volume but rather in the propagation of new ideas or memes. Current studies often oversimplify the concept of influence to the share of affiliations in academic papers, typically sourced from limited databases such as arXiv or specific academic conferences.
  The main goal of this paper is to unravel the specific nuances of such influence, determining which AI ideas are predominantly driven by Big Tech entities. By employing network and memetic analysis on AI-oriented paper abstracts and their citation network, we are able to grasp a deeper insight into this phenomenon. By utilizing two databases: OpenAlex and S2ORC, we are able to perform such analysis on a much bigger scale than previous attempts.
  Our findings suggest that while Big Tech-affiliated papers are disproportionately more cited in some areas, the most cited papers are those affiliated with both Big Tech and Academia. Focusing on the most contagious memes, their attribution to specific affiliation groups (Big Tech, Academia, mixed affiliation) seems equally distributed between those three groups. This suggests that the notion of Big Tech domination over AI research is oversimplified in the discourse.</description>

      <title>CrowdEgress: A Multi-Agent Simulation Platform for Pedestrian Crowd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a simulation platform to study complex crowd behavior in social context. The agent-based model is extended based on the social force model, and it mainly describes how agents interact with each other, and also with surrounding facilities such as walls, doors and exits. The simulation platform is compatible to FDS+Evac, and the input data in FDS+Evac could be imported into our simulation platform to create single-floor compartment geometry, and a flow solver is used to generate the roadmap towards exits. Most importantly, we plan to integrate advanced social and psychological theory into our simulation platform, especially investigating human behavior in emergency evacuation,such as pre-evacuation behavior, exit-selection activities, social group and herding effect and so forth.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Interstellar Sovereignty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human space exploration and settlement of other planets is becoming increasingly technologically feasible, while mission concepts for remote and crewed missions to nearby star systems continue to be developed. But the long-term success of space settlement also requires extensions and advances in models of governance. This paper provides a synthesis of the physical factors that will constrain the application of sovereignty in space as well as legal precedent on Earth that likely applies to any crewed or uncrewed missions to other stellar systems. The Outer Space Treaty limits the territorial expansion of states into space, but the requirements for oversight of nongovernmental agencies and retention of property ownership enable the extension of state jurisdiction into space. Pragmatic constraints from historical precedent on Earth suggest that new space treaties will be unlikely to succeed and new global space agencies may have limited jurisdiction over states, while hard constraints of the space environment require adherence to technical capabilities, political feasibility, and long-term sustainability. These factors form a three-prong test for assessing the viability of interstellar governance models. This discussion of interstellar governance is intended to further the conversation about sovereignty in space prior to the first intentional launch of any interstellar spacecraft.</description>

      <title>Quantifying age-specific household contacts in Aotearoa New Zealand for infectious disease modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accounting for population age structure and age-specific contact patterns is crucial for accurate modelling of human infectious disease dynamics and impact. A common approach is to use contact matrices, which estimate the number of contacts between individuals of different ages. These contact matrices are frequently based on data collected from populations with very different demographic and socioeconomic characteristics from the population of interest. Here we use a comprehensive household composition dataset based on Aotearoa New Zealand census and administrative data to construct a household contact matrix and a synthetic population that can be used for modelling. We investigate the behaviour of a compartment-based and an agent-based epidemic model parameterised using this data, compared to a commonly used contact matrix that was constructed by projecting international data onto New Zealand's population. We find that using the New Zealand household data, either in a compartment-based model or in an agent-based model, leads to lower attack rates in older age groups compared to using the projected contact matrix. This difference becomes larger when household transmission is more dominant relative to non-household transmission. We provide electronic versions of the synthetic population and household contact matrix for other researchers to use in infectious disease models.</description>

      <title>Modeling pedestrian fundamental diagram based on Directional Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01171v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding pedestrian dynamics is crucial for appropriately designing pedestrian spaces. The pedestrian fundamental diagram (FD), which describes the relationship between pedestrian flow and density within a given space, characterizes these dynamics. Pedestrian FDs are significantly influenced by the flow type, such as uni-directional, bi-directional, and crossing flows. However, to the authors' knowledge, generalized pedestrian FDs that are applicable to various flow types have not been proposed. This may be due to the difficulty of using statistical methods to characterize the flow types. The flow types significantly depend on the angles of pedestrian movement; however, these angles cannot be processed by standard statistics due to their periodicity. In this study, we propose a comprehensive model for pedestrian FDs that can describe the pedestrian dynamics for various flow types by applying Directional Statistics. First, we develop a novel statistic describing the pedestrian flow type solely from pedestrian trajectory data using Directional Statistics. Then, we formulate a comprehensive pedestrian FD model that can be applied to various flow types by incorporating the proposed statistics into a traditional pedestrian FD model. The proposed model was validated using actual pedestrian trajectory data. The results confirmed that the model effectively represents the essential nature of pedestrian dynamics, such as the capacity reduction due to conflict of crossing flows and the capacity improvement due to the lane formation in bi-directional flows.</description>
