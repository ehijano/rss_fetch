      <title>A Product Formula for Family Indices and Family Band Width Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Gromov's conjecture on the sharp estimate of band width to the family case and prove that it holds for fiber bundles having infinite A-hat area. The method we employ is based on the Dirac operators and the family index theory. Our proof relies on a product formula for index bundles established in this paper.</description>

      <title>Stratified manifolds with corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define categories of stratified manifolds (s-manifolds) and stratified manifolds with corners (s-manifolds with corners). An s-manifold $\bf X$ of dimension $n$ is a Hausdorff, locally compact topological space $X$ with a stratification $X=\coprod_{i\in I}X^i$ into locally closed subsets $X^i$ which are smooth manifolds of dimension $\le n$, satisfying some conditions.
  S-manifolds can be very singular, but still share many good properties with ordinary manifolds, e.g. an oriented s-manifold $\bf X$ has a fundamental class $[\bf X]_{\rm fund}$ in Steenrod homology $H_n^{St}(X,\mathbb Z)$, and transverse fibre products exist in the category of s-manifolds.
  S-manifolds are designed for applications in Symplectic Geometry. In future work we hope to show that after suitable perturbations, the moduli spaces $\mathcal M$ of $J$-holomorphic curves used to define Gromov-Witten invariants, Lagrangian Floer cohomology, Fukaya categories, and so on, can be made into s-manifolds or s-manifolds with corners, and their fundamental classes used to define Gromov-Witten invariants, Lagrangian Floer cohomology, ....</description>

      <title>Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles III: The Hodge Star and Hodge--de Rham Laplacians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles ($\mathbb{R}^\times := \mathbb{R}\setminus \{0\}$) offer a novel perspective on intrinsic Carrollian geometry using the powerful tools of principal bundles. Given a choice of principal connection, a canonical Lorentzian metric exists on the total space. This metric enables the development of Hodge theory on a Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundle; specifically, the Hodge star operator and Hodge--de Rham Laplacian are constructed. These constructions are obstructed on a Carrollian manifold due to the degenerate metric. The framework of Carrollian $\mathbb{R}^\times$-bundles bridges the gap between Carrollian geometry and (pseudo)-Riemannian geometry. As an example, the question of the Hodge--de Rham Laplacian on the event horizon of a Schwarzschild black hole is addressed. A Carrollian version of electromagnetism is also proposed.</description>

      <title>A quantitative approach to the regularity of a Riemannian surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two definitions with the purpose of quantifying the concept of a $C^{2,\alpha}$ surface for $0 &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$. The intrinsic definition is given in terms of the $\alpha$-H\"{o}lder norm of the Gauss curvature function. The extrinsic one relies on the existence of a smooth local representation of the Riemannian metric. We show that these definitions are equivalent up to a constant depending on $\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Constructive Quantum Field Theory on Curved Surfaces and Related Topics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the Ph.D. thesis of the author. In this thesis, we construct the $ P(\phi)_2 $ Quantum Field Theory (QFT) model on curved surfaces and show that it satisfies Segal's axioms (arXiv:2403.12804). An important ingredient in this construction is the use of a local regularization procedure to define the interaction as a random variable with respect to the Gaussian Free Field (GFF). We provide a counterexample demonstrating that spectral truncation regularization violates locality (arXiv:2312.15511). We then explain how Segal's formalism can be extended to the gluing of surfaces with slits, which offers a geometric interpretation of the entanglement entropy. Using this interpretation, we exploit the Polyakov anomaly formula in Conformal Field Theory (CFT) and apply a simple renormalization procedure to define a quantity corresponding to entanglement entropy within this geometric interpretation. We then show that this quantity behaves like a CFT correlation function. This allows us to rigorously derive an entropy calculation of Cardy and Calabrese (arXiv:2501.19014). Finally, Segal's formalism is also related to the asymptotics of zeta determinants on surfaces of large genus where the genus tends to infinity (arXiv:2505.01586). We provide a geometric proof--independent of Segal's axioms--of the corresponding result using heat kernels, in addition to another proof based on Segal's axioms. Both proofs are presented in the thesis.</description>

      <title>The conformal logarithmic Laplacian on the sphere: Yamabe-type problems and Sobolev spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the conformal logarithmic Laplacian on the sphere, an explicit singular integral operator that arises as the derivative (with respect to the order parameter) of the conformal fractional Laplacian at zero. Our analysis provides a detailed investigation of its spectral properties, its conformal invariance, and the associated \(Q\)-curvature problem. Furthermore, we establish a precise connection between this operator on the sphere and the logarithmic Laplacian in \(\mathbb{R}^N\) via stereographic projection. This correspondence bridges classification results for two Yamabe-type problems previously studied in the literature, extending one of them to the weak setting. To this end, we introduce a Hilbert space that serves as the logarithmic counterpart of the homogeneous fractional Sobolev space, offering a natural functional framework for the variational study of logarithmic-type equations in unbounded domains.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Stratified Space Structure of an RL Game with the Volume Growth Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the structure of the embedding space of a transformer model trained for playing a particular reinforcement learning (RL) game. Specifically, we investigate how a transformer-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) model embeds visual inputs in a simple environment where an agent must collect "coins" while avoiding dynamic obstacles consisting of "spotlights." By adapting Robinson et al.'s study of the volume growth transform for LLMs to the RL setting, we find that the token embedding space for our visual coin collecting game is also not a manifold, and is better modeled as a stratified space, where local dimension can vary from point to point. We further strengthen Robinson's method by proving that fairly general volume growth curves can be realized by stratified spaces. Finally, we carry out an analysis that suggests that as an RL agent acts, its latent representation alternates between periods of low local dimension, while following a fixed sub-strategy, and bursts of high local dimension, where the agent achieves a sub-goal (e.g., collecting an object) or where the environmental complexity increases (e.g., more obstacles appear). Consequently, our work suggests that the distribution of dimensions in a stratified latent space may provide a new geometric indicator of complexity for RL games.</description>

      <title>Infinite-Time Blow-up Arising in a Mean Curvature Flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.07831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a mean curvature flow in a cylinder with Robin boundary conditions, which can be used to model the interface motion in singular limit problems of the Allen-Cahn equation with nonlinear boundary conditions. It was shown in \cite{LWY} that the planar curvature flow converges to a translating Grim Reaper with {\it finite speed} and {\it fixed profile}. In this paper we study the high dimensional problem, and show surprisingly different features caused by the dimension: a radial flow $u(|x|,t)$ propagates at {\it exponential asymptotic speed}, both the gradient $|Du|$ (everywhere except for the center) and the instantaneous speed $u_t$ (everywhere) also increase to infinity exponentially as $t\to \infty$. Due to the lack of uniform-in-time $C^0, C^1$ and $C^2$ estimates, the equation is asymptotically degenerate, we will use a new approach (that is, the zero number argument) to prove the conclusions.</description>

      <title>Conformally K\"ahler structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a one-to-one correspondence between K\"ahler metrics in a given conformal class and parallel sections of a certain vector bundle with conformally invariant connection, where the parallel sections satisfy a set of non--linear algebraic constraints that we describe. The vector bundle captures 2-form prolongations and is isomorphic to $\Lambda^3(\cT)$, where ${\cT}$ is the tractor bundle of conformal geometry, but the resulting connection differs from the normal tractor connection by curvature terms.
  Our analysis leads to a set of obstructions for a Riemannian metric to be conformal to a K\"ahler metric. In particular we find an explicit algebraic condition for a Weyl tensor which must hold if there exists a conformal Killing-Yano tensor, which is a necessary condition for a metric to be conformal to K\"ahler. This gives an invariant characterisation of algebraically special Riemannian metrics of type $D$ in dimensions higher than four.</description>

Abstract: A translation surface in the three-dimensional sphere $\mathbb{S}^3$ is a surface generated by the quaternionic product of two curves, called generating curves. In this paper, we present rigidity results for such surfaces. We introduce an associated frame for curves in $\mathbb{S}^3$, and by means of it, we describe the local intrinsic and extrinsic geometry of translation surfaces in $\mathbb{S}^3$. The rigidity results, concerning minimal and constant mean curvature surfaces, are given in terms of the curvature and torsion of the generating curves and their proofs rely on the associated frame of such curves. Finally, we present a correspondence between translation surfaces in $\mathbb{S}^3$ and translation surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We show that these surfaces are locally isometric, and we present a relation between their mean curvatures.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a semi-simple real Lie group of real rank one and $\Gamma$ be a discrete subgroup in $G$ such that $\Gamma \backslash G$ has finite volume. We introduce a new group $C^*$-algebra $C^*_r(G, \Gamma)$, which provides a natural framework for defining index classes of Dirac-type operators on the locally symmetirc space $\Gamma \backslash G /K$. We show that Dirac operators define elements in the $K$-theory of $C^*_r(G, \Gamma)$ and use Hecke correspondences to study their Lefschetz numbers. Our main result is an explicit formula for the Lefschetz number of Hecke operators.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian approach for PDE constrained shape optimization over the diffeomorphism group using outer metrics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of outer metrics, in particular Sobolev-type metrics on the diffeomorphism group in the context of PDE-constrained shape optimization. Leveraging the structure of the diffeomorphism group we analyze the connection between the push-forward of a smooth function defined on the diffeomorphism group and the classical shape derivative as an Eulerian semi-derivative. We consider in particular, two predominant examples on PDE-constrained shape optimization. An electric impedance tomography inspired problem, and the optimization of a two-dimensional bridge. These problems are numerically solved using the Riemannian steepest descent method where the descent directions are taken to be the Riemannian gradients associated to various outer metrics. For comparison reasons, we also solve the problem using other previously proposed Riemannian metrics in particular the Steklov-Poincar\'e metric.</description>

      <title>Geometric effects of hyperbolic cohomology classes on K\"ahler manifolds (with an appendix by Beno\^it Claudon)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of K\"ahler topologically hyperbolic manifold, as a"topological" generalization of K\"ahler [Gro91] and weakly K\"ahler [BDET24] hyperbolic manifolds. Analogously to [BCDT24], we show the birational invariance of this property and then that K\"ahler topologically hyperbolic manifolds are not uniruled nor bimeromorphic to compact K\"ahler manifolds with trivial first real Chern class. Then, we prove spectral gap theorems for positive holomorphic Hermitian vector bundles on K\"ahler topologically hyperbolic manifolds, obtaining in particular effective non vanishing results \`a la Kawamata for adjoint line bundles. We finally explore the effects of K\"ahler topologically hyperbolicity on Ricci and scalar curvature of K\"ahler metrics. In the appendix, it is given an explicit description of degree~$2$ hyperbolic classes for finitely presented groups, and an algebro-geometric consequence for K\"ahler topologically hyperbolic surfaces: they are necessarily of general type.</description>
