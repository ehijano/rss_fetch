      <title>Equational Theories and Validity for Logically Constrained Term Rewriting (Full Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logically constrained term rewriting is a relatively new formalism where rules are equipped with constraints over some arbitrary theory. Although there are many recent advances with respect to rewriting induction, completion, complexity analysis and confluence analysis for logically constrained term rewriting, these works solely focus on the syntactic side of the formalism lacking detailed investigations on semantics. In this paper, we investigate a semantic side of logically constrained term rewriting. To this end, we first define constrained equations, constrained equational theories and validity of the former based on the latter. After presenting the relationship of validity and conversion of rewriting, we then construct a sound inference system to prove validity of constrained equations in constrained equational theories. Finally, we give an algebraic semantics, which enables one to establish invalidity of constrained equations in constrained equational theories. This algebraic semantics derive a new notion of consistency for constrained equational theories.</description>

      <title>An efficient quantifier elimination procedure for Presburger arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All known quantifier elimination procedures for Presburger arithmetic require doubly exponential time for eliminating a single block of existentially quantified variables. It has even been claimed in the literature that this upper bound is tight. We observe that this claim is incorrect and develop, as the main result of this paper, a quantifier elimination procedure eliminating a block of existentially quantified variables in singly exponential time. As corollaries, we can establish the precise complexity of numerous problems. Examples include deciding (i) monadic decomposability for existential formulas, (ii) whether an existential formula defines a well-quasi ordering or, more generally, (iii) certain formulas of Presburger arithmetic with Ramsey quantifiers. Moreover, despite the exponential blowup, our procedure shows that under mild assumptions, even NP upper bounds for decision problems about quantifier-free formulas can be transferred to existential formulas. The technical basis of our results is a kind of small model property for parametric integer programming that generalizes the seminal results by von zur Gathen and Sieveking on small integer points in convex polytopes.</description>

      <title>Reasoning About Group Polarization: From Semantic Games to Sequent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group polarization, the phenomenon where individuals become more extreme after interacting, has been gaining attention, especially with the rise of social media shaping people's opinions. Recent interest has emerged in formal reasoning about group polarization using logical systems. In this work we consider the modal logic PNL that captures the notion of agents agreeing or disagreeing on a given topic. Our contribution involves enhancing PNL with advanced formal reasoning techniques, instead of relying on axiomatic systems for analyzing group polarization. To achieve this, we introduce a semantic game tailored for (hybrid) extensions of PNL. This game fosters dynamic reasoning about concrete network models, aligning with our goal of strengthening PNL's effectiveness in studying group polarization. We show how this semantic game leads to a provability game by systemically exploring the truth in all models. This leads to the first cut-free sequent systems for some variants of PNL. Using polarization of formulas, the proposed calculi can be modularly adapted to consider different frame properties of the underlying model.</description>

      <title>Skolemisation for Intuitionistic Linear Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Focusing is a known technique for reducing the number of proofs while preserving derivability. Skolemisation is another technique designed to improve proof search, which reduces the number of back-tracking steps by representing dependencies on the term level and instantiate witness terms during unification at the axioms or fail with an occurs-check otherwise. Skolemisation for classical logic is well understood, but a practical skolemisation procedure for focused intuitionistic linear logic has been elusive so far. In this paper we present a focused variant of first-order intuitionistic linear logic together with a sound and complete skolemisation procedure.</description>

      <title>Combining Combination Properties: Minimal Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a part of an ongoing research project, with the aim of finding the connections between properties related to theory combination in Satisfiability Modulo Theories. In previous work, 7 properties were analyzed: convexity, stable infiniteness, smoothness, finite witnessability, strong finite witnessability, the finite model property, and stable finiteness. The first two properties are related to Nelson-Oppen combination, the third and fourth to polite combination, the fifth to strong politeness, and the last two to shininess. However, the remaining key property of shiny theories, namely, the ability to compute the cardinalities of minimal models, was not yet analyzed. In this paper we study this property and its connection to the others.</description>

      <title>Optimal Planning for Timed Partial Order Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of planning a sequence of tasks to be performed by multiple robots while minimizing the overall completion time subject to timing and precedence constraints. Our approach uses the Timed Partial Orders (TPO) model to specify these constraints. We translate this problem into a Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) variant with timing and precedent constraints, and we solve it as a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem. Our contributions include a general planning framework for TPO specifications, a MILP formulation accommodating time windows and precedent constraints, its extension to multi-robot scenarios, and a method to quantify plan robustness. We demonstrate our framework on several case studies, including an aircraft turnaround task involving three Jackal robots, highlighting the approach's potential applicability to important real-world problems. Our benchmark results show that our MILP method outperforms state-of-the-art open-source TSP solvers OR-Tools.</description>

      <title>Unification in the description logic $\mathcal{FL}_\bot$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Description Logics are a formalism used in the knowledge representation, where the knowledge is captured in the form of concepts constructed in a controlled way from a restricted vocabulary. This allows one to test effectively for consistency of and the subsumption between the concepts. Unification of concepts may likewise become a useful tool in analysing the relations between concepts. The unification problem has been solved for the description logics $\mathcal{FL}_0$ and $\mathcal{EL}$. These small logics do not provide any means to express negation. Here we show an algorithm solving unification in $\mathcal{FL}_\bot$, the logic that extends $\mathcal{FL}_0$ with the bottom concept. Bottom allows one to express that two concepts are disjoint. Our algorithm runs in exponential time, with respect to the size of the problem.</description>

      <title>Verification of Population Protocols with Unordered Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Population protocols are a well-studied model of distributed computation in which a group of anonymous finite-state agents communicates via pairwise interactions. Together they decide whether their initial configuration, that is, the initial distribution of agents in the states, satisfies a property. As an extension in order to express properties of multisets over an infinite data domain, Blondin and Ladouceur (ICALP'23) introduced population protocols with unordered data (PPUD). In PPUD, each agent carries a fixed data value, and the interactions between agents depend on whether their data are equal or not. Blondin and Ladouceur also identified the interesting subclass of immediate observation PPUD (IOPPUD), where in every transition one of the two agents remains passive and does not move, and they characterised its expressive power.
  We study the decidability and complexity of formally verifying these protocols. The main verification problem for population protocols is well-specification, that is, checking whether the given PPUD computes some function. We show that well-specification is undecidable in general. By contrast, for IOPPUD, we exhibit a large yet natural class of problems, which includes well-specification among other classic problems, and establish that these problems are in EXPSPACE. We also provide a lower complexity bound, namely coNEXPTIME-hardness.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Spell: A Dynamic Logic Analysis of Misdirection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Misdirection can be defined as the intentional action of causing some misrepresentation in an agent, or in a group of agents. Those misrepresentations may result from verbal actions, as in linguistic deception, or from visual actions, as in visual misdirection. Examples of visual misdirection abound (e.g. in nature, in the military), with magic tricks providing a vivid illustration. So far, various types of verbal misdirection have been investigated from a formal perspective (e.g. lying, bluffing) but little attention has been paid to the particular case of visual misdirection. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic epistemic logic to represent not only verbal misdirection on agents' beliefs but also visual misdirection on agents' observations. We illustrate the dynamics of the logic by modelling a classic magic trick known as the French Drop. We also provide a sound and complete axiom system for the logic, and discuss the strengths of the setting in terms of expressivity and scope.</description>

      <title>The Patch Topology in Univalent Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stone locales together with continuous maps form a coreflective subcategory of spectral locales and perfect maps. A proof in the internal language of an elementary topos was previously given by the second-named author. This proof can be easily translated to univalent type theory using resizing axioms. In this work, we show how to achieve such a translation without resizing axioms, by working with large and locally small frames with small bases. This requires predicative reformulations of several fundamental concepts of locale theory in predicative HoTT/UF, which we investigate systematically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.07664v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Premonoidal and Freyd categories are both generalized by non-cartesian Freyd categories: effectful categories. We construct string diagrams for effectful categories in terms of the string diagrams for a monoidal category with a freely added object. We show that effectful categories are pseudomonoids in a monoidal bicategory of promonads with a suitable tensor product.</description>

      <title>MULTIGAIN 2.0: MDP controller synthesis for multiple mean-payoff, LTL and steady-state constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MULTIGAIN 2.0, a major extension to the controller synthesis tool MULTIGAIN, built on top of the probabilistic model checker PRISM. This new version extends MULTIGAIN's multi-objective capabilities, by allowing for the formal verification and synthesis of controllers for probabilistic systems with multi-dimensional long-run average reward structures, steady-state constraints, and linear temporal logic properties. Additionally, MULTIGAIN 2.0 can modify the underlying linear program to prevent unbounded-memory and other unintuitive solutions and visualizes Pareto curves, in the two- and three-dimensional cases, to facilitate trade-off analysis in multi-objective scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Algorithms for learning database queries from examples and unique characterisations of queries by examples are prominent starting points for developing automated support for query construction and explanation. We investigate how far recent results and techniques on learning and unique characterisations of atemporal queries mediated by an ontology can be extended to temporal data and queries. Based on a systematic review of the relevant approaches in the atemporal case, we obtain general transfer results identifying conditions under which temporal queries composed of atemporal ones are (polynomially) learnable and uniquely characterisable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study initial value problems having dynamics ruled by discontinuous ordinary differential equations with the property of possessing a unique solution. We identify a precise class of such systems that we call solvable intitial value problems and we prove that for this class of problems the unique solution can always be obtained analytically via transfinite recursion. We present several examples including a nontrivial one whose solution yields, at an integer time, a real encoding of the halting set for Turing machines; therefore showcasing that the behavior of solvable systems is related to ordinal Turing computations.</description>
