      <title>Neural Multiscale Decomposition for Solving The Nonlinear Klein-Gordon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a neural multiscale decomposition method (NeuralMD) for solving the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation (NKGE) with a dimensionless parameter $\varepsilon\in(0,1]$ from the relativistic regime to the nonrelativistic limit regime. The solution of the NKGE propagates waves with wavelength at $O(1)$ and $O(\varepsilon^2)$ in space and time, respectively, which brings the oscillation in time. Existing collocation-based methods for solving this equation lead to spectral bias and propagation failure. To mitigate the spectral bias induced by high-frequency time oscillation, we employ a multiscale time integrator (MTI) to absorb the time oscillation into the phase. This decomposes the NKGE into a nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with wave operator (NLSW) with well-prepared initial data and a remainder equation with small initial data. As $\varepsilon \to 0$, the NKGE converges to the NLSW at rate $O(\varepsilon^{2})$, and the contribution of the remainder equation becomes negligible. Furthermore, to alleviate propagation failure caused by medium-frequency time oscillation, we propose a gated gradient correlation correction strategy to enforce temporal coherence in collocation-based methods. As a result, the approximation of the remainder term is no longer affected by propagation failure. Comparative experiments with existing collocation-based methods demonstrate the superior performance of our method for solving the NKGE with various regularities of initial data over the whole regime.</description>

      <title>Finite Difference Method for Global Stabilization of the Viscous Burgers' Equation with Nonlinear Neumann Boundary Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article focuses on a nonlinear Neumann boundary feedback control formulation for the viscous Burgers' equation and develops a class of finite difference schemes to achieve global stabilization. The proposed procedure, known as the $\theta$-scheme with $\theta \in [0,1]$, unifies explicit and implicit time discretizations and is suitable for handling the nonlinear boundary feedback control problem. Using the discrete energy method, we prove that the proposed difference scheme is conditionally stable for $0 \leq \theta &lt; \frac{1}{2}$ and unconditionally stable for $\theta \geq \frac{1}{2}$. In addition, we establish the exponential stability of the fully discrete solution. The error analysis shows a first-order convergence rate of the state variable in the discrete $L^{2}$-, $H^{1}$-, and $L^{\infty}$-norms for $\theta \geq \frac{1}{2}$, while preserving the exponential stability property. A first-order convergence rate for the boundary control inputs is also obtained. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the theoretical findings and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method for the inhomogeneous nonlinear Neumann boundary feedback control of the viscous Burgers' equation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a \( C^0 \)-conforming finite element method for the Chafee-Infante equation with a finite-parameter feedback control. We establish error analysis for both the state variable and the control variable for the spatially discretized solution. Furthermore, we employ the backward Euler method for time discretization and discuss the stability analysis of the fully discrete scheme. Additionally, we develop error estimates for both the state variable and the control input in the fully discrete setting. Finally, we verify our theoretical conclusions using some numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Iterative inversion schemes for the Born series and the reduced inverse Born series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear inverse problems have complicated landscapes. Hence the calculation with naive iterative schemes (e.g., Gauss-Newton or conjugate gradients) is trapped in local minima. The (first) Born approximation can avoid this trapping but linearization is required. Nonlinear inverse problems can be solved without linearization by means of the inverse Born series. However, the computational cost of its standard recursive implementation grows exponentially when nonlinear terms are taken into account. In this work we revisit a Newton-type iterative scheme to invert the Born series and develop a fast variant. The relation between this fast scheme and the reduced inverse Born series is shown.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Compatibility of the Approximate-Ball Finite Element Method for 2D Nonlocal Poisson Problem with Neumann Boundary Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, asymptotic compatibility error estimates of a finite element discretization is presented for 2D nonlocal Poisson problems with Neumann boundary conditions. To this end, we begin with deriving two kind of nonlocal Neumann boundary operators based on nonlocal Green's identities, and establish the corresponding weak convergence to the classical Neumann operator as the horizon parameter {\delta} vanishes for general convex domains. After that, we consider the asymptotic properties (i.e. the so-called local limit) of two nonlocal Neumann boundary-value problems as {\delta} approaches zero. Finally, we analyze the asymptotical compatable error estimates of the approximate-ball-strategy finite element discretization proposed by D'Elia, Gunzburger, and Vollmann (2021), and provide numerical examples to confirm the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Inverse spectral problem for glassy state relaxation approximated by Prony series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stretched exponential relaxation function is used to analyze the relaxation of the glassy state data. Due to the singularity of this function at the origin, this function is inconvenient for data analysis. Concerning this, a Prony series approximation of the stretched exponential relaxation function (J. Mauro, Y. Mauro, 2018), which is the extended Burgers model (abbreviated by EBM) known for viscoelasticity equations, was introduced. In our previous paper [arXiv:2509.16714], we gave an inversion method to identify the relaxation tensor of the EBM using clustered eigenvalues of the quasi-static EBM. As a next important research subject of this study, we numerically examine the performance of the inversion method. The performance reveals that it is a powerful method of data analysis, analyzing the relaxation of the glassy state data.</description>

      <title>Projected iterated Tikhonov regularization in low precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the regularizing behavior of an iterative Krylov subspace method for the solution of linear inverse problems in precisions lower than double. Recent works have considered the projection of iterated Tikhonov methods using Krylov subspaces for both computational efficiency and an additional regularizing effect. To investigate the regularizing behavior of this projected algorithm applied to problems that are naturally severely ill-posed, we formulate the iterates as a filtered solution using the preconditioned Landweber method with a Tikhonov-type preconditioner in a Krylov subspace. Through numerical examples simulating multiple low precision choices, we showcase the filtering properties of the method and the achievement of comparable working accuracy applied to discrete inverse problems (i.e., to within a few decimal places in relative error) compared to results computed in traditional double precision.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of an acceleration corrected diffusion approximation of Langevin dynamics with background flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating the Langevin dynamics of inertial particles being transported by a background flow. In particular, we study an acceleration corrected advection-diffusion approximation to the Langevin dynamics, a popular approximation in the study of turbulent transport. We prove error estimates in the averaging regime in which the dimensionless relaxation timescale $\varepsilon$ is the small parameter. We show that for any finite time interval, the approximation error is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ in the strong sense and $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^2)$ in the weak sense, whose optimality is checked against computational experiment. Furthermore, we present numerical evidence suggesting that this approximation also captures the long-time behavior of the Langevin dynamics.</description>

Abstract: An abstract construction of coarse spaces for non-Hermitian problems and non-Hermitian domain decomposition preconditioners based on extended generalized eigenproblems was proposed in [Nataf and Parolin, arXiv:2404.02758] and analyzed on the matrix formulation. Building upon this work, we consider instead here the specific case of heterogeneous Helmholtz problems, and the derivation and analysis is performed at the continuous level.</description>

      <title>A Provably Efficient Method for Tensor Ring Decomposition and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first deterministic, finite-step algorithm for exact tensor ring (TR) decomposition, addressing an open question about the existence of such procedures. Our method leverages blockwise simultaneous diagonalization to recover TR-cores from a limited number of tensor observations, providing both algebraic insight and practical efficiency. We extend the approach to the symmetric TR setting, where parameter complexity is significantly reduced and applications arise naturally in physics-based modeling and exchangeable data analysis. To handle noisy observations, we develop a robust recovery scheme that couples our initialization with alternating least squares, achieving faster convergence and improved accuracy compared to classic methods. As applications, we obtain new algorithms for questions in other domains where tensor ring decomposition is a key primitive, namely matrix product state tomography in quantum information, and provable learning of pushforward distributions in the foundations of machine learning. These contributions advance the algorithmic foundations of TR decomposition and open new opportunities for scalable tensor network computation.</description>

      <title>Randomized-Accelerated FEAST: A Hybrid Approach for Large-Scale Eigenvalue Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Randomized-Accelerated FEAST (RA-FEAST), a hybrid algorithm that combines contour-integration-based eigensolvers with randomized numerical linear algebra techniques for efficiently computing partial eigendecompositions of large-scale matrices arising in statistical applications. By incorporating randomized subspace initialization to enable aggressive quadrature reduction and truncated refinement iterations, our method achieves significant computational speedups (up to 38x on sparse graph Laplacian benchmarks at n = 8000) while maintaining high-accuracy approximations to the target eigenspace. We provide a probabilistic error bound for the randomized warmstart, a stability result for inexact FEAST iterations under general perturbations, and a simple complexity model characterizing the trade-off between initialization cost and solver speedup. Empirically, we demonstrate that RA-FEAST can be more than an order of magnitude faster than standard FEAST while preserving accuracy on sparse Laplacian problems representative of modern spectral methods in statistics.</description>

      <title>A high-order weighted positive and flux conservative method for the Vlasov equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-order conservative, positivity-preserving, and non-oscillatory scheme for solving the Vlasov equation. The scheme attains formal fifth-order accuracy through a convex combination of positive and non-oscillatory polynomials in substencils. Nonlinear weights for these polynomials are formulated that assign higher priority to substencils with larger L2 norm to enhance resolution while maintaining positivity and non-oscillatory properties. An approximate dispersion relation indicates that the spectral properties of the present scheme outperform those of an underlying fifth-order scheme and even surpass those of a seventh-order scheme in certain wavenumber ranges. We apply this scheme to the one-dimensional Vlasov-Ampere equations and the two-dimensional Vlasov-Maxwell equations, and demonstrate high-resolution simulations with improved conservation of entropy.</description>

      <title>A note on the central-upwind scheme for nonlocal conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The central-upwind flux is a widely used numerical flux function for local conservation laws. It has been investigated by Kurganov and Polizzi (2009) for a specific nonlocal conservation law and can be derived from a fully-discrete second-order scheme. Here, we derive this fully-discrete scheme in detail with a particular focus on the occurring nonlocal terms. In addition, we derive the central-upwind flux for a class of nonlocal conservation laws and use an estimate on the nonlocal speed which fixes the nonlocality at the cell interfaces. We prove that the resulting first-order numerical scheme converges to the correct solution. Under additional assumptions on the analytical flux we present a similar result for a second-order central-upwind scheme. Numerical examples compare the central-upwind schemes to Godunov-type schemes and the fully-discrete scheme.</description>

      <title>The Power Method for Non-Hermitian Dual Quaternion Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a power method for computing the dominant eigenvalues of a non-Hermitian dual quaternion matrix (DQM). Although the algorithmic framework parallels the Hermitian case, the theoretical analysis is substantially more complex since a non-Hermitian dual matrix may possess no eigenvalues or infinitely many eigenvalues. Besides, its eigenvalues are not necessarily dual numbers, leading to non-commutative behavior that further complicates the analysis. We first present a sufficient condition that ensures the existence of an eigenvalue whose standard part corresponds to the largest magnitude eigenvalue of the standard part matrix. Under a stronger condition, we then establish that the sequence generated by the power method converges linearly to the strict dominant eigenvalue and its associated eigenvectors. We also verify that this condition is necessary. The key to our analysis is a new Jordan-like decomposition, which addresses a gap arising from the lack of a conventional Jordan decomposition for non-Hermitian dual matrices. Our framework readily extends to non-Hermitian dual complex and dual number matrices. We also develop an adjoint method that reformulates the eigenvalue problem into an equivalent form for dual complex matrices. Numerical experiments on non-Hermitian DQMs are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the power method.</description>

      <title>Feedback Integrators Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the notion of Feedback Integrators introduced by D. E. Chang in 2016. Feedback integrators allow for numerically integrating dynamical systems on manifold while preserving the first integrals of the system. However, its performance was stated and proved in an asymptotic manner, which left a gap between its empirical success and theoretical understandings. In response, we prove preservation of first integrals over entire integration region up to arbitrarily small deviation under Feedback Integrator framework. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive gain selection scheme that significantly improves the performance. Numerical demonstrations are conducted on free rigid body motion in SO(3), the Kepler problem, and a perturbed Kepler problem with rotational symmetry. All demonstration codes are available at: https://github.com/johnbae1901/Feedback-Integrator.</description>

      <title>Tree-cotree gauging for two-dimensional hierarchical splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In magnetostatics and eddy current problems, formulated in terms of the magnetic vector potential, the solution is not unique, because the addition of an irrotational function to the solution remains a valid solution. The tree-cotree decomposition is a gauging technique to recover uniqueness when using finite elements, which consists in considering the mesh as a graph, and building a spanning tree on that graph. The idea has been recently extended to isogeometric analysis, applying the construction of the spanning tree on the control mesh, or equivalently, on the Greville grid. In the present paper we extend the construction to hierarchical splines, a set of splines with multi-level structure for adaptive refinement, by constructing a spanning tree for each single level. Since for degree $p=1$ the spaces of finite elements and hierarchical splines coincide, the presented construction is also valid for quadrilateral finite element meshes with hanging nodes.

      <title>Convergence of long-time stable variable-step arbitrary order ETD-MS scheme for gradient flows with Lipschitz nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a variable-step extension of a family of arbitrarily high-order exponential time differencing multistep (ETD-MS) schemes recently developed by the authors. We prove that the schemes are unconditionally stable in the sense that a modified energy-representing a slight perturbation of the original energy-decreases monotonically over time, provided the nonlinearity is Lipschitz continuous in some appropriate sense. Moreover, we establish optimal-order convergence under mild conditions on the time-step size and local time-step ratio. Numerical experiments on the thin film epitaxial growth model without slope selection, employing a novel variable-step second-order scheme, validate the theoretical findings as well as its potential in developing highly efficient time-adaptive solution.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and invariant measure approximation of the stochastic Cahn-Hilliard equation via an explicit fully discrete scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stochastic Cahn-Hilliard equation (SCHE) driven by additive space-time white noise. We first refine the analytical ergodic theory by proving that the continuum equation admits a unique invariant measure in the more regular state space H_\alpha, extending the classical result of Da Prato and Debussche (1996) on the negative Sobolev space $\dot{H}^{-1}_\alpha$. To approximate long-time behaviour, we introduce an explicit fully discrete scheme that combines a finite-difference spatial discretization with a strongly tamed exponential Euler method in time. Uniform-in-time moment bounds in the $L^\infty$-norm are established for the numerical solution, and a uniform strong convergence estimate with an explicit rate is derived for the fully discrete approximation. Exploiting a mass-preserving minorization tailored to Neumann boundary conditions, we further show that the numerical scheme is geometrically ergodic and possesses a unique invariant measure, together with polynomial-order error bounds for approximating the exact invariant measure. Strong laws of large numbers are proved for both the continuous and discrete systems, ensuring almost-sure convergence of temporal averages to the corresponding ergodic limits. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical findings, including the long-time strong convergence and the accuracy of invariant measure approximation. Overall, the results provide a complete analytical and numerical framework for investigating the long-time statistical behaviour of the SCHE.</description>

      <title>A Two-Stage Fourth-Order Implicit Scheme for Stiff problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel two-stage fourth-order implicit scheme designed to overcome the limitations of existing spatiotemporal coupling two-stage fourth-order methods, which have thus far been confined to explicit frameworks. In such frameworks, computational efficiency is severely constrained by the CFL condition when addressing stiff problems, and they fundamentally conflicts with spatiotemporal coupled methods whose core advantage lies in embedding stiff source terms. By fully leveraging temporal derivatives of physical variables within a rigorously derived compact mathematical framework, the scheme achieves fourth-order temporal accuracy in only two stages. Furthermore, a sufficient condition for A-stability is established through systematic theoretical and numerical investigation, and a Newton iterative procedure is provided to accelerate convergence. Extensive numerical experiments on classical stiff problems confirm the method's effectiveness and competitiveness.</description>

      <title>Two-level additive Schwarz preconditioners for reduced integration methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Incompressible fluid flow problems appear frequently in different applications. The discretization of such problems may result in large and ill-conditioned systems of linear equations. We consider the case of the Stokes equations discretized using a reduced integration method which approximates the incompressibility constraint by a penalty term thus allowing the problem to be solved only in terms of the velocity unknowns. We investigate the numerical scalability of a two-level overlapping additive Schwarz method with a reduced dimension generalized Dryja-Smith-Widlund (RGDSW) coarse space. In addition, we discuss the parallel implementation of the examples using the Fast and Robust Overlapping Schwarz (FROSch) package for additive Schwarz preconditioners and the NGSolve library, which implements multiple finite element space formulations.</description>

      <title>A decoupled, unconditionally stable and second-order integrator for the Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equation with magnetoelastic effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the numerical approximation of a nonlinear system of partial differential equations modeling magnetostriction in the small-strain regime consisting of the Landau--Lifshitz--Gilbert equation for the magnetization and the conservation of linear momentum law for the displacement. We propose a fully discrete numerical scheme based on first-order finite elements for the spatial discretization. The time discretization employs a combination of the classical Newmark-$\beta$ scheme for the displacement and the midpoint scheme for the magnetization, applied in a decoupled fashion. The resulting method is fully linear, formally of second order in time, and we prove that it is unconditionally stable. Finally, we assess the stability, accuracy, and energy conservation properties of the proposed method in a collection of numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Oseen eigenvalue problem plays a important role in the stability analysis of fluids. The problem is non-self-adjoint due to the presence of convection field. In this paper, we present a comprehensive investigation of the mixed discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method, employing Pk-Pk-1(k&gt;=1) elements to solve the Oseen eigenvalue problem in Rd(d=2,3). We first develop an adjoint-consistent DG formulation for the problem. We then derive optimal a priori error estimates for the approximate eigenpairs, and propose residual type a posteriori error estimators. Furthermore, we prove the reliability and effectiveness of these estimators for approximate eigenfunctions, as well as the reliability of the estimator for approximate eigenvalues. To validate our approach, we conduct numerical computations on both uniform and adaptively refined meshes. The numerical results demonstrate that our scheme is computationally efficient and capable of yielding high-accuracy approximate eigenvalues.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents error analysis for a finite element method applied to a two-dimensional singularly perturbed convection-diffusion turning point problem. Utilizing a layer-adapted Shishkin mesh, we prove uniform convergence in the maximum norm in the coarse layer and x-layer regions. The analysis, critically based on the properties of a discrete Green's function, guarantees the method's robustness and accuracy in capturing sharp solution layers. There is no work for the coarse region for two-dimensional singularly perturbed turning point problems, and also, we are getting a linear order of convergence better than Stynes' article.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning a Fluid--Structure Interaction Problem Using Monolithic and Block Domain Decomposition Methods for the Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problem is solved via a monolithic coupling of the fluid, structure, and geometry subproblems. The iterative GMRES solver is accelerated with the FaCSI block preconditioner. In the FaCSI factorization, the fluid subproblem is approximated using either a monolithic preconditioner or the block preconditioner SIMPLE. Two-level overlapping Schwarz methods are then used to approximate the arising inverses. The robustness and scalability of the monolithic and SIMPLE preconditioners are compared for a realistic patient-specific artery. The results indicate that the monolithic preconditioning of the fluid subproblem performs better than the SIMPLE approach. Different flow rates are tested and parallel strong scaling has been evaluated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we address the problem of uniform approximation of differential forms starting from weak data defined by integration on rectifiable sets. We study approximation schemes defined by the projection operator L given by either generalized weighted least squares or interpolation. We show that, under a natural measure theoretic condition, the norm of such operator equals the Lebesgue constant of the problem. We finally estimate how the Lebesgue constant varies under the action of smooth mappings from the reference domain to a physical one, as is customarily done e.g. in finite element method.</description>

      <title>Basis Choices for Frequency Domain Statistical Independence Tests and Algorithms for Algebraic Relation Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how different selections of basis functions impact the efficacy of frequency domain techniques in statistical independence tests, and study different algorithms for extracting low-dimensional algebraic relations from dependent data. We examine a range of complete orthonormal bases functions including the Legendre polynomials, Fourier series, Walsh functions, and standard and nonstandard Haar wavelet bases. We utilize fast transformation algorithms to efficiently transform physical domain data to frequency domain coefficients. The main focuses of this paper are the effectiveness of different basis selections in detecting data dependency using frequency domain data, e.g., whether varying basis choices significantly influence statistical power loss for small data with large noise; and on the stability of different optimization formulations for finding proper algebraic relations when data are dependent. We present numerical results to demonstrate the effectiveness of frequency domain-based statistical analysis methods and provide guidance for selecting the proper basis and algorithm to detect a particular type of relations.</description>

      <title>Necessary and Sufficient Criterion for Singular or Nonsingular of Diagonally Dominant Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of determining whether a diagonally dominant matrix is singular or nonsingular is a classical topic in matrix theory. This paper develops necessary and sufficient conditions for the singularity or nonsingularity of diagonally dominant matrices. Starting from Taussky's theorem, we establish a unified line of theory which reduces the general problem to the study of irreducible diagonally dominant matrices. A complete similarity and unitary similarity analysis is given for singular irreducible diagonally dominant matrices, leading to a necessary and sufficient condition expressed in terms of an angle equation system associated with the nonzero off-diagonal entries. Applications and motivations from network dynamical systems, affine multi-agent systems, and Kolmogorov differential equations are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Exact quantum dynamics of Fermi--Hubbard systems using the Gaussian phase-space representation with diffusion gauges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Gaussian Phase-Space Representation to solve the real-time dynamic of interacting fermions in 1D, 2D, and 3D systems. The method is exact up to a spiking point, which represents a limit on the practical simulation time. The spiking can be delayed, and the practical simulation time extended, by adjusting the gauges of the representation, resulting in different equivalent stochastic differential equations. Here, we work on the so-called diffusion gauge and propose an algorithm to find efficiently new implementations of the noise terms. Compared with our initial results [F. Rousse \textit{et al.} 2024, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. \textbf{57}, 015303], the new method achieves a significantly longer practical simulation time and can be applied to significantly larger systems.</description>

      <title>Beyond Loss Guidance: Using PDE Residuals as Spectral Attention in Diffusion Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs) are often bottle-necked by slow gradient-based test-time optimization routines that use PDE residuals for loss guidance. They additionally suffer from optimization instabilities and are unable to dynamically adapt their inference scheme in the presence of noisy PDE residuals. To address these limitations, we introduce PRISMA (PDE Residual Informed Spectral Modulation with Attention), a conditional diffusion neural operator that embeds PDE residuals directly into the model's architecture via attention mechanisms in the spectral domain, enabling gradient-descent free inference. In contrast to previous methods that use PDE loss solely as external optimization targets, PRISMA integrates PDE residuals as integral architectural features, making it inherently fast, robust, accurate, and free from sensitive hyperparameter tuning. We show that PRISMA has competitive accuracy, at substantially lower inference costs, compared to previous methods across five benchmark PDEs, especially with noisy observations, while using 10x to 100x fewer denoising steps, leading to 15x to 250x faster inference.</description>

      <title>Domain-Decomposed Graph Neural Network Surrogate Modeling for Ice Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate yet efficient surrogate models are essential for large-scale simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly for uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks that demand hundreds or thousands of evaluations. We develop a physics-inspired graph neural network (GNN) surrogate that operates directly on unstructured meshes and leverages the flexibility of graph attention. To improve both training efficiency and generalization properties of the model, we introduce a domain decomposition (DD) strategy that partitions the mesh into subdomains, trains local GNN surrogates in parallel, and aggregates their predictions. We then employ transfer learning to fine-tune models across subdomains, accelerating training and improving accuracy in data-limited settings. Applied to ice sheet simulations, our approach accurately predicts full-field velocities on high-resolution meshes, substantially reduces training time relative to training a single global surrogate model, and provides a ripe foundation for UQ objectives. Our results demonstrate that graph-based DD, combined with transfer learning, provides a scalable and reliable pathway for training GNN surrogates on massive PDE-governed systems, with broad potential for application beyond ice sheet dynamics.</description>

      <title>Topography optimization for enhancing microalgal growth in raceway ponds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.04913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.04913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modelling the evolution process for the growth of microalgae in an artificial pond is a huge challenge, given the complex interaction between hydrodynamics and biological processes occurring across various timescales. In this paper, we consider a raceway, i.e., an oval pond where the water is set in motion by a paddle wheel. Our aim is to investigate theoretically and numerically the impact of bottom topography in such raceway ponds on microalgae growth. To achieve this goal, we consider a biological model based on the Han model, coupled with the Saint--Venant systems that model the fluid. We then formulate an optimization problem, for which we apply the weak maximum principle to characterize optimal topographies that maximize biomass production over one lap of the raceway pond or multiple laps with a paddle wheel. In contrast to a widespread belief in the field of microalgae, we show that a flat topography in a periodic regime satisfies the necessary optimality condition, and observe in the numerical experiments that the flat topography is actually optimal in this case. However, non-trivial topographies may be more advantageous in alternative scenarios, such as when considering the effects of mixing devices within the model. This study sheds light on the intricate relationship between bottom topography, fluid dynamics, and microalgae growth in raceway ponds, offering valuable insights into optimizing biomass production.</description>

These bounds display higher order convergence rates and are accessible to adaptive mesh-refining algorithms. The involved constants arise from local embeddings and are available for all polynomial degrees. Applications include the linear elasticity and Steklov eigenvalue problem.</description>

      <title>Fredholm Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09484v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the family of explainable machine-learning, we present Fredholm neural networks (Fredholm NNs): deep neural networks (DNNs) architectures motivated by fixed-point iteration schemes for the solution of linear and nonlinear Fredholm integral equations (FIEs) of the second kind. We also show how the proposed framework can be used for the solution of inverse problems. Applications of FIEs include the solution of ordinary, as well as partial differential equations (ODEs, PDEs) and many more. We first prove that Fredholm NNs provide accurate solutions. We then provide insight into the values of the hyperparameters and trainable/explainable weights and biases of the DNN, by directly connecting their values to the underlying mathematical theory. For our illustrations, we use Fredholm NNs to solve both linear and nonlinear problems, including elliptic PDEs and boundary value problems. We show that the proposed scheme achieves significant numerical approximation accuracy across both the domain and boundary. The proposed methodology provides insight into the connection between neural networks and classical numerical methods, and we posit that it can have applications in fields such as Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Thus, we believe that it will trigger further advances in the intersection between scientific machine learning and numerical analysis.</description>

      <title>On properties and numerical computation of critical points of eigencurves of bivariate matrix pencils</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate critical points of eigencurves of bivariate matrix pencils $A+\lambda B +\mu C$. Points $(\lambda,\mu)$ for which $\det(A+\lambda B+\mu C)=0$ form algebraic curves in $\mathbb C^2$ and we focus on points where $\mu'(\lambda)=0$. Such points are referred to as zero-group-velocity (ZGV) points, following terminology from engineering applications. We provide a general theory for the ZGV points and show that they form a subset (with equality in the generic case) of the 2D points $(\lambda_0,\mu_0)$, where $\lambda_0$ is a multiple eigenvalue of the pencil $(A+\mu_0 C)+\lambda B$, or, equivalently, there exist nonzero $x$ and $y$ such that $(A+\lambda_0 B+\mu_0 C)x=0$, $y^H(A+\lambda_0 B+\mu_0 C)=0$, and $y^HBx=0$.
  We introduce three numerical methods for computing 2D and ZGV points. The first method calculates all 2D (ZGV) points from the eigenvalues of a related singular two-parameter eigenvalue problem. The second method employs a projected regular two-parameter eigenvalue problem to compute either all eigenvalues or only a subset of eigenvalues close to a given target. The third approach is a locally convergent Gauss--Newton-type method that computes a single 2D point from an inital approximation, the later can be provided for all 2D points via the method of fixed relative distance by Jarlebring, Kvaal, and Michiels. In our numerical examples we use these methods to compute 2D-eigenvalues, solve double eigenvalue problems, determine ZGV points of a parameter-dependent quadratic eigenvalue problem, evaluate the distance to instability of a stable matrix, and find critical points of eigencurves of a two-parameter Sturm-Liouville problem.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for the analysis of discretization methods based on the decomposition into local and global problems. We apply the framework to provide a comprehensive error analysis for the embedded Trefftz discontinuous Galerkin method, for a wide range of second-order scalar elliptic partial differential equations and a scalar reaction-advection problem. We also analyze quasi-Trefftz methods with our framework, presenting the first optimal error bounds in weaker norms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14425v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive a second-order accurate, non-staggered central scheme based on the well-known Nessyahu-Tadmor scheme to approximate solutions of coupled systems of nonlocal balance laws. We show that the approximate solutions stay bounded by an exponential $L^\infty$ bound in time. Under linearity assumptions on the flux and source terms the approximate solutions converge weakly-$*$ to weak solutions of the nonlocal balance laws. Assuming stronger regularity, in particular on the convolution kernel, we show strong convergence towards entropy weak solutions in the nonlinear case. Numerical examples validate our results and demonstrate its applicability to various systems of nonlocal problems.</description>

      <title>Uniform Poincar\'{e} inequalities for the discrete de Rham complex of differential forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove discrete Poincar\'e inequalities that are uniform in the mesh size for the discrete de Rham complex of differential forms developed in [Bonaldi, Di Pietro, Droniou, and Hu, An exterior calculus framework for polytopal methods, J. Eur. Math. Soc., to appear, arXiv preprint 2303.11093]. We unify the underlying ideas behind the Poincar\'e inequalities for all differential operators in the sequence, extending the known inequalities for the gradient, curl, and divergence in three-dimensions to polytopal domains of arbitrary dimension and general topology. A key step in the proof involves deriving specific Poincar\'e inequalities for the cochain complex supported on the polytopal mesh. These inequalities are of independent interest, as they are useful, for instance, in establishing the existence and stability, on domains of generic topology, of solutions of schemes based on Mimetic Finite Differences, Compatible Discrete Operators or Discrete Geometric Approach.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous spatial-parametric collocation approximation for parametric PDEs with log-normal random inputs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07799v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish convergence rates for a fully discrete, multi-level, linear collocation method solving parametric elliptic PDEs on bounded polygonal domains with log-normal inputs. The method uses a finite set of function evaluations in the spatial-parametric domain. Compared with the best-known fully discrete collocation rates, these rates are significantly improved and, up to logarithmic factors, match the rates of best n-term approximations. The results follow from applying general multi-level linear sampling recovery theory in abstract Bochner spaces -- via extended least-squares -- to infinite-dimensional holomorphic functions. The abstract multi-level recovery in Bochner spaces guarantees yield the improved rates when specialized to the parametric PDE setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Babu\v{s}ka or plate paradox concerns the failure of convergence when a domain with curved boundary is approximated by polygonal domains in linear bending problems with simply supported boundary conditions. It can be explained via a boundary integral representation of the total Gaussian curvature that is part of the Kirchhoff--Love bending energy. It is shown that the paradox also occurs for a nonlinear bending-folding model which enforces vanishing Gaussian curvature. A simple remedy that is compatible with simplicial finite element methods to avoid incorrect convergence is devised.</description>

Abstract: F. Stenger proposed efficient approximation formulas for derivatives over infinite intervals. These formulas were derived by combining the Sinc approximation with appropriate conformal maps. It has been demonstrated that these formulas can attain root-exponential convergence. In this study, we enhance the convergence rate by improving the conformal maps employed in those formulas. We provide a theoretical error analysis and numerical experiments that confirm the effectiveness of our new formulas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a generalized energy-based modeling framework extending recent formulations tailored for differential-algebraic equations. The proposed structure, inspired by the port-Hamiltonian formalism, ensures passivity, preserves the power balance, and facilitates the consistent interconnection of subsystems. A particular focus is put on low-frequency power applications in electrical engineering. Stranded, solid, and foil conductor models are investigated in the context of the eddy current problem. Each conductor model is shown to fit into the generalized energy-based structure, which allows their structure-preserving coupling with electrical circuits described by modified nodal analysis. Theoretical developments are validated through a numerical simulation of an oscillator circuit, demonstrating energy conservation in lossless scenarios and controlled dissipation when eddy currents are present. The applicability of the methodology towards engineering applications is studied through a numerical simulation of a nonlinear three-phase transformer.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving, second-order-in-time scheme for the von Neumann equation with power nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The von Neumann equation with power nonlinearity serves as a statistical model for nonlinear waves, and it exhibits a bifurcation between stable and unstable regimes. In ocean waves it is known as the Alber equation, and its bifurcation is considered important for understanding rogue waves, a key problem in marine safety. Despite this, only one first-order-in-time numerical method exists in the literature for its simulation.
  In this paper, we introduce a structure-preserving, linearly implicit, second-order-in-time scheme for its numerical solution. We employ fourth-order finite differences in space, allowing for much larger and faster simulations.
  As an illustrative example, we explore the onset of modulation instability. We verify that the linear stability analysis accurately predicts the initial growth phase, but find that it fails to forecast the maximum amplitude or the formation of a coherent structure in the nonlinear regime. Monte Carlo simulations with Gaussian background spectra reveal that the maximum amplitude depends solely on the homogeneous background, and not on the initial inhomogeneity. For weak instabilities, the inhomogeneity grows substantially from its initial condition, but it remains small compared to the background. On the other hand, past a critical threshold, the instability grows to yield dominant effects. Thus, beyond the onset of linear instability, the solution of the fully nonlinear problem presents a second bifurcation -- at the point which inhomogeneous features become dominant compared to the background.</description>

      <title>A mixed Petrov-Galerkin Cosserat rod finite element formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a total Lagrangian mixed Petrov-Galerkin finite element formulation that provides a computationally efficient approach for analyzing Cosserat rods that is free of singularities and locking. To achieve a singularity-free orientation parametrization of the rod, the nodal kinematical unknowns are defined as the nodal centerline positions and unit quaternions. We apply Lagrange interpolation to all nodal kinematic coordinates, and in combination with a projection of non-unit quaternions, this leads to an interpolation with orthonormal cross-section-fixed bases. To eliminate locking effects such as shear locking, the variational Hellinger-Reissner principle is applied, resulting in a mixed approach with additional fields composed of resultant contact forces and moments. Since the mixed formulation contains the constitutive law in compliance form, it naturally incorporates constrained theories, such as the Kirchhoff-Love theory. This study specifically examines the influence of the additional internal force fields on the numerical performance, including locking mitigation and robustness. Using well-established benchmark examples, the method demonstrates enhanced computational robustness and efficiency, as evidenced by the reduction in required load steps and iterations when applying the standard Newton-Raphson method.</description>

      <title>Some semi-decoupled algorithms with optimal convergence for a four-field linear thermo-poroelastic model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose three semi-decoupled algorithms for efficiently solving a four-field thermoporoelastic model. The first two algorithms adopt a sequential strategy: at the initial time step, all variables are computed simultaneously using a monolithic solver; thereafter, the system is split into a mixed linear elasticity subproblem and a coupled pressure-temperature reaction-diffusion subproblem. The two variants differ in the order in which these subproblems are solved. To further improve computational efficiency, we introduce a parallel semidecoupled algorithm. In this approach, the four-field system is solved monolithically only at the first time step, and the two subproblems are then solved in parallel at subsequent time levels. None of the three algorithms requires iterative procedures at each time step, and are free from stabilization. Rigorous analysis confirms their unconditional stability, optimal convergence rates, and robustness under a wide range of physical parameter settings. These theoretical results are further validated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and analysis of a streamline upwind/Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) method for the magnetic advection-diffusion problem. A key feature of the method is an SUPG-type stabilization term based on the residuals and weighted advection terms of the test function. By introducing a lifting operator to characterize the jumps of finite element functions across element interfaces, we define a discrete magnetic advection operator, which subsequently enables the formulation of the desired SUPG method. Under mild assumptions, we establish the stability of the scheme and derive optimal error estimates. Numerical examples in both two and three dimensions are provided to demonstrate the theoretical convergence and stabilization properties of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a localized numerical scheme with low regularity requirements for solving time-fractional integro-differential equations. First, a fully discrete numerical scheme is constructed. Specifically, for temporal discretization, we employ the contour integral method (CIM) with parameterized hyperbolic contours to approximate the nonlocal operators. For spatial discretization, the standard piecewise linear Galerkin finite element method (FEM) is used. We then provide a rigorous error analysis, demonstrating that the proposed scheme achieves high accuracy even for problems with nonsmooth/vanishing initial values or low-regularity solutions, featuring spectral accuracy in time and second-order convergence in space. Finally, a series of numerical experiments in both 1-D and 2-D validate the theoretical findings and confirm that the algorithm combines the advantages of spectral accuracy, low computational cost, and efficient memory usage.</description>

      <title>Randomized Quasi-Monte Carlo and Importance Sampling for Super-Fast Growing Functions with Applications to Finance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.06705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many problems can be formulated as high-dimensional integrals of discontinuous functions that exhibit significant boundary growth, challenging the error analysis and applications of randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) methods. This paper studies RQMC methods for super-fast growing functions satisfying generalized exponential growth conditions, with a special focus on financial derivative pricing. The main contribution of this paper is threefold. First, by combining RQMC with importance sampling (IS), we derive a new error bound for a class of integrands, whose values and derivatives are bounded by the critical growth function $e^{A|\boldsymbol{x}|^2}$ with $A = 1/2$. This result extends the existing results in the literature, which are limited to the case $A &lt; 1/2$. We demonstrate that by imposing a light-tailed condition on the proposal distribution of IS, RQMC can achieve an error rate of $O(n^{-1 + \epsilon})$ with a sample size n and an arbitrarily small $\epsilon &gt;0$. Second, we verify that the Gaussian proposals used in Optimal Drift Importance Sampling (ODIS) satisfy the required light-tailed condition, providing a rigorous theoretical guarantees for RQMC-ODIS in critical growth scenarios. Third, for discontinuous integrands from finance, we prove that the integrands after preintegration satisfy the exponential growth condition. This ensures that the preintegrated functions can be seamlessly incorporated into our RQMC-IS framework. Numerical experiments on financial derivative pricing validate our theory, showing that the RQMC-IS with preintegration is effective in handling problems with discontinuous payoffs, successfully achieving the expected convergence rates.</description>

      <title>A stochastic branching particle method for solving non-conservative reaction-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27615v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic branching particle-based method for solving nonlinear non-conservative advection-diffusion-reaction equations. The method splits the evolution into an advection-diffusion step, based on a linearized Kolmogorov forward equation and approximated by stochastic particle transport, and a reaction step implemented through a branching birth-death process that provides a consistent temporal discretization of the underlying reaction dynamics. This construction yields a mesh-free, nonnegativity-preserving scheme that naturally accommodates non-conservative systems and remains robust in the presence of singularities or blow-up. We validate the method on two representative two-dimensional systems: the Allen-Cahn equation and the Keller-Segel chemotaxis model. In both cases, the present method accurately captures nonlinear behaviors such as phase separation and aggregation, and achieves reliable performance without the need for adaptive mesh refinement.</description>

      <title>Numerical Stability of the Nystr\"om Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Nystr\"om method is a widely used technique for improving the scalability of kernel-based algorithms, including kernel ridge regression, spectral clustering, and Gaussian processes. Despite its popularity, the numerical stability of the method has remained largely an unresolved problem. In particular, the pseudo-inversion of the submatrix involved in the Nystr\"om method may pose stability issues as the submatrix is likely to be ill-conditioned, resulting in numerically poor approximation. In this work, we establish conditions under which the Nystr\"om method is numerically stable. We show that stability can be achieved through an appropriate choice of column subsets and a careful implementation of the pseudoinverse. Our results and experiments provide theoretical justification and practical guidance for the stable application of the Nystr\"om method in large-scale kernel computations.</description>

      <title>Dimension-independent convergence rates of randomized nets using median-of-means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in quasi-Monte Carlo integration demonstrate that the median of linearly scrambled digital net estimators achieves near-optimal convergence rates for high-dimensional integrals without requiring a priori knowledge of the integrand's smoothness. Building on this framework, we prove that the median estimator attains dimension-independent convergence, a property known as strong tractability in complexity theory, under tractability conditions characterized by low effective dimensionality. Using a probabilistic, integrand-specific error criterion, our analysis establishes both faster and dimension-independent convergence under weaker assumptions than previously possible in the worst-case setting.</description>

      <title>Preconditioned Langevin Dynamics with Score-Based Generative Models for Infinite-Dimensional Linear Bayesian Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing algorithms for solving high-dimensional Bayesian inverse problems directly in infinite-dimensional function spaces - where such problems are naturally formulated - is crucial to ensure stability and convergence as the discretization of the underlying problem is refined. In this paper, we contribute to this line of work by analyzing a widely used sampler for linear inverse problems: Langevin dynamics driven by score-based generative models (SGMs) acting as priors, formulated directly in function space. Building on the theoretical framework for SGMs in Hilbert spaces, we give a rigorous definition of this sampler in the infinite-dimensional setting and derive, for the first time, error estimates that explicitly depend on the approximation error of the score. As a consequence, we obtain sufficient conditions for global convergence in Kullback-Leibler divergence on the underlying function space. Preventing numerical instabilities requires preconditioning of the Langevin algorithm and we prove the existence and the form of an optimal preconditioner. The preconditioner depends on both the score error and the forward operator and guarantees a uniform convergence rate across all posterior modes. Our analysis applies to both Gaussian and a general class of non-Gaussian priors. Finally, we present examples that illustrate and validate our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Analytic and Stochastic Approach to Quantum Advantages in Ground State and Quantum State Preparation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01563v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problems of state preparation, ground state preparation and quantum state preparation. We propose an analytic approach to a stochastic quantum algorithm which prepares the ground state for $n$-qubit Hamiltonian that is represented by $\text{poly}(n)$ Pauli operators and has an inverse-polynomial gap, requiring only $\text{poly}(n)$ Pauli rotations, measurements, and classical time complexity when $n$ exceeds a threshold, to inverse-polynomial precision given the initial overlap being lower bounded by $\frac{1}{2^n}$. Extending this result, we prove that any $n$-qubit quantum state can be prepared in two regimes: (1) with a constant number of Pauli rotations to constant precision, or (2) with a polynomial number of rotations to inverse-polynomial precision. Our results improve over previous approaches to quantum state preparation in terms of gate complexity, thereby yielding quantum space advantage. As an application, we identify a practical condition under which quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems can be solved with exponential quantum speedups.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Multilevel Splitting: First Application to Rare-Event Derivative Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the computational burden of pricing binary options in rare event regimes and introduces an adaptation of the adaptive multilevel splitting (AMS) method for financial derivatives. Standard Monte Carlo becomes inefficient for deep out-of-the-money binaries due to discontinuous payoffs and extremely small exercise probabilities, requiring prohibitively large sample sizes for accurate estimation. The proposed AMS framework reformulates the rare-event problem as a sequence of conditional events and is applied under both Black-Scholes and Heston dynamics. Numerical experiments cover European, Asian, and up-and-in barrier digital options, together with a multidimensional digital payoff designed as a stress test. Across all contracts, AMS achieves substantial gains, reaching up to 200-fold improvements over standard Monte Carlo, while preserving unbiasedness and showing robust performance with respect to the choice of importance function. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of AMS to derivative pricing. An open-source Rcpp implementation is provided, supporting multiple discretisation schemes and alternative importance functions.</description>

      <title>Extended Physics Informed Neural Network for Hyperbolic Two-Phase Flow in Porous Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate solution of nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) remains challenging due to steep gradients, discontinuities, and multiscale structures that make conventional solvers computationally demanding. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embed the governing equations into the learning process, enabling mesh-free solution of PDEs, yet they often struggle to capture steep gradients, discontinuities, and complex nonlinear wave interactions. To address these limitations, we employ the Extended Physics-Informed Neural Network (XPINN) framework to solve the nonlinear Buckley-Leverett equation with a nonconvex flux, modeling immiscible two-phase flow in porous media. The computational domain is dynamically decomposed in space and time into evolving pre-shock and post-shock subdomains, allowing localized subnetworks to efficiently learn distinct flow behaviors, with coupling enforced via the Rankine-Hugoniot jump condition to ensure physically consistent flux continuity. We compare XPINN with standard PINNs and its variants, including PINN with artificial viscosity, PINN with Welge construction, and PINN with the Oleinik entropy condition, and across all cases, XPINN consistently outperforms the other methods, accurately resolving sharp fronts and capturing the correct physical behavior. Importantly, XPINN achieves this using the simpler Adam optimizer, whereas some PINN variants require more complex or higher-order strategies such as L-BFGS to reach comparable accuracy, demonstrating that XPINN is a robust and scalable approach for challenging hyperbolic PDEs without artificial diffusion or entropy corrections. The code is available at github.com/saifkhanengr/XPINN-for-Buckley-Leverett.</description>

      <title>Convergence of a Sequential Monte Carlo algorithm towards multimodal distributions on Rd</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an earlier joint work, we studied a sequential Monte Carlo algorithm to sample from the Gibbs measure supported on torus with a non-convex energy function at a low temperature, where we proved that the time complexity of the algorithm is polynomial in the inverse temperature. However, the analysis in that torus setting relied crucially on compactness and does not directly extend to unbounded domains. This work introduces a new approach that resolves this issue and establishes a similar result for sampling from Gibbs measures supported on Rd.
  In particular, our main result shows that when the energy function is double-well with equal depth, the time complexity scales as seventh power of the inverse temperature, and quadratically in both the inverse allowed absolute error and probability error.</description>
