      <title>Thermodynamic properties of an electron gas in a two-dimensional quantum dot: an approach using density of states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potential applications of quantum dots in the nanotechnology industry make these systems an important field of study in various areas of physics. In particular, thermodynamics has a significant role in technological innovations. With this in mind, we studied some thermodynamic properties in quantum dots, such as entropy and heat capacity, as a function of the magnetic field over a wide range of temperatures. The density of states plays an important role in our analyses. At low temperatures, the variation in the magnetic field induces an oscillatory behavior in all thermodynamic properties. The depopulation of subbands is the trigger for the appearance of the oscillations.</description>

      <title>Extreme anti-ohmic conductance enhancement in neutral diradical acene-like molecular junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We achieve, at room temperature, conductance enhancements over two orders of magnitude in single molecule circuits formed with polycyclic benzoquinoidal (BQn) diradicals upon increasing molecular length by ~0.5 nm. We find that this extreme and atypical anti-ohmic conductance enhancement at longer molecular lengths is due to the diradical character of the molecules, which can be described as a topologically non-trivial electronic state. We adapt the 1D-SSH model originally developed to examine electronic topological order in linear carbon chains to the polycyclic systems studied here and find that it captures the anti-ohmic trends in this molecular series. The mechanism of conductance enhancement with length is revealed to be constructive quantum interference (CQI) between the frontier orbitals with non-trivial topology, which is present in acene-like, but not in linear, molecular systems. Importantly, we predict computationally and measure experimentally that anti-ohmic trends can be engineered through synthetic adjustments of the diradical character of the acene-like molecules. Overall, we achieve an experimentally unprecedented anti-ohmic enhancement and mechanistic insight into electronic transport in a class of materials that we identify here as promising candidates for creating highly conductive and tunable nanoscale wires.</description>

      <title>The role of Rashba spin-orbit induced spin textures in the anomalous Josephson effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports the theoretical investigation into the mechanism underpinning the anomalous Josephson effect. The prototypical system we study is a ballistic two-dimensional junction containing a two-dimensional Rashba spin-orbit interaction. In this paper we demonstrate how this two-dimensional Rashba interaction mixes the spins of adjacent transverse subbands which leads to significant spin-asymmetry within the junction. Under an external magnetic field, applied perpendicular to both the axis of transport and the normal vector of the junction, the sinusoidal Josephson current can then experience an anomalous phase shift. The role of this spin mixing in the limit of a single sub-band is initially explored by deriving an analytical expression for the resulting anomalous phase shift. The analysis is then extended to systems with multiple occupied sub-bands; in this later section, starting from a microscopic model, we derive an analytic formula for the resulting anomalous phase shift indicating it is linear in both magnetic field and spin-orbit strength. We then verify and validate all findings by comparing them with numerical results evaluated by a tight-binding model.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic anomalous Hall effect arising from antiferromagnetic structure revealed by high-quality NbMnP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in antiferromagnetic (AF) materials arises from symmetry breaking equivalent to a ferromagnetic (FM) state. Consequently, this suggests that the observed AHE is induced by the intrinsic mechanism of the band structure effect, which in turn induces dissipationless transverse conductivity. Confirmation of impurity-insensitive anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) is crucial to conclude this interpretation; however, experimental investigations in AF materials are limited by the lack of high quality systems. In this study, we show that the AF material NbMnP, which exhibits a large AHE, offers a high quality single crystal. Our findings clearly revealed that the large AHC and the tiny net magnetization of $\sim10^{-3} \mu_{\mathrm{B}}$/Mn are inherent in this material, irrespective of disorder. NbMnP is a novel AF material that generates FM responses in the regime where there is less impurity scattering.</description>

      <title>Imprinting of Antiferromagnetic Vortex States in NiO-Fe Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic vortices are topological spin structures frequently found in ferromagnets, yet novel to antiferromagnets. By combining experiment and theory, we demonstrate that in a nanostructured antiferromagnetic-ferromagnetic NiO(111)-Fe(110) bilayer, a magnetic vortex is naturally stabilized by magnetostatic interactions in the ferromagnet and is imprinted onto the adjacent antiferromagnet via interface exchange coupling. We use micromagnetic simulations to construct a corresponding phase diagram of the stability of the imprinted antiferromagnetic vortex state. Our in depth analysis reveals that the interplay between interface exchange coupling and the antiferromagnet magnetic anisotropy plays a crucial role in locally reorienting the N\'eel vector out-of-plane in the prototypical in-plane antiferromagnet NiO and thereby stabilizing the vortices in the antiferromagnet.</description>

Abstract: For a smooth map $g\colon X \to U(N)$, where $X$ is a three-dimensional, oriented, and closed manifold, the winding number or the map's degree is defined by $W_3 = \frac{1}{24\pi^2} \int_{X} \mathrm{Tr}\left[(g^{-1}dg)^3\right]$. We introduce a method to compute $W_3$ using a discrete approximation of $X$. in which the result is manifestly This approach provides a formulation in which quantization is manifest.</description>

      <title>Experimental set-up for thermal measurements at the nanoscale using an SThM probe with niobium nitride thermometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) has become an important measurement tool for characterizing the thermal properties of materials at the nanometer scale. This technique requires a SThM probe that combines an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) probe and a very sensitive resistive thermometry; the thermometer being located at the apex of the probe tip allows the mapping of temperature or thermal properties of nanostructured materials with very high spatial resolution. The high interest of the SThM technique in the field of thermal nanoscience currently suffers from a low temperature sensitivity despite its high spatial resolution. To address this challenge, we developed a high vacuum-based AFM system hosting a highly sensitive niobium nitride (NbN) SThM probe to demonstrate its unique performance. As a proof of concept, we utilized this custom-built system to carry out thermal measurements using the 3$\omega$ method. By measuring the $V_{3\omega}$ voltage on the NbN resistive thermometer in vacuum conditions we were able to determine the SThM probe's thermal conductance and thermal time constant. The performance of the probe is demonstrated by doing thermal measurements in-contact with a sapphire sample.</description>

      <title>3d-oxide molecules to tailor large magnetic anisotropy energies on MgO films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing systems with large magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) is desirable and critical for nanoscale magnetic devices. A recent breakthrough achieved the theoretical limit of the MAE for 3$d$ transition metal atoms by placing a single Co atom on a MgO(100) surface, a result not replicated by standard first-principles simulations. Our study, incorporating Hubbard-$U$ correction and spin-orbit coupling, successfully reproduces and explains the high MAE of a Co adatom on a MgO (001) surface. We go further by exploring ways to enhance MAE in 3d transition metal adatoms through different structural geometries of 3d--O molecules on MgO. One promising structure, with molecules perpendicular to the surface, enhances MAE while reducing substrate interaction, minimizing spin fluctuations, and boosting magnetic stability. Additionally, we demonstrate significant control over MAE by precisely placing 3d--O molecules on the substrate at the atomic level.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Hall effect from long-lived valley-polarizing relaxons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect has attracted much attention due to the famous, widely adopted interpretation in terms of the Berry curvature dipole in momentum space. Using \textit{ab initio} Boltzmann transport equations, we find a 60\% enhancement in the nonlinear Hall effect of $n$-doped GeTe and its noticeable frequency dependence, qualitatively different from the predictions based on the Berry curvature dipole. The origin of these differences is long-lived valley polarization in the electron distribution arising from electron-phonon scattering. Our findings await immediate experimental confirmation.</description>

Abstract: C.V. Raman (1888 - 1970) was a creative scientist, enthusiastic teacher and a science celebrity in India. In all these roles, he communicated science effectively. In this essay, I ask how and why did he communicate science. I take a few examples from his research writings and show his ability to explain science lucidly. By looking into his thoughts on teaching and those of his students, I explore Raman, the teacher. Finally, I discuss a few aspects of his methods to communicate science to the public. I emphasize his exposition and reveal a dichotomy.</description>

      <title>Atomistic investigation of deformation and fracture of individual structural components of metal matrix composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the development of the atomistic framework for determining the lower scale mechanical parameters of single components of a metal matrix composite for final application to a micromechanical damage model. Here, the deformation and failure behavior of NiAl-Al$_2$O$_3$ interfaces and their components, metal and ceramic, are analyzed in depth using molecular statics calculations. A number of atomistic simulations of strength tests, uniaxial tensile, uniaxial compressive and simple shear, have been performed in order to obtain a set of stiffness tensors and strain-stress characteristics up to failure for 30 different crystalline and amorphous systems. Characteristic points on the strain-stress curves in the vicinity of failure are further analyzed at the atomistic level, using local measures of lattice disorder. Numerical results are discussed in the context of composite damage at upper microscopic scale based on images of the fracture surface of NiAl-Al$_2$O$_3$ composites.</description>

      <title>Bond Dipole Theory of Band Offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the band offset between materials is pivotal for electronic device functionality. While traditional theories attribute this offset solely to intrinsic properties of constituent materials, interfacial chemistry introduces complexities, including charge transfer dipoles. We address this challenge by defining a reference system based on Wigner-Seitz atoms, which is a charge partitioning that tessellates space while retaining bulk crystal symmetry. The interfacial dipole is then expressed entirely by localized dipoles along interfacial bonds. Geometric analysis reveals that for isotropic materials, both bulk and interfacial contributions to the band offset are orientation independent. This finding is confirmed through first-principles calculations and analysis of 28 distinct interfaces, which show very little (&lt; 0.1 eV) dependence on orientation. Furthermore, the direction dependence of anisotropic materials is well captured by the theory. This work provides crucial insights into the geometric underpinnings of band offset, offering a comprehensive understanding essential for advancing materials design in electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Hall Crystals in Rhombohedral Multilayer Graphene II: General Mechanism and a Minimal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a minimal "three-patch model" for the anomalous Hall crystal (AHC), a topological electronic state that spontaneously breaks both time-reversal symmetry and continuous translation symmetry. The proposal for this state is inspired by the recently observed integer and fractional quantum Hall states in rhombohedral multilayer graphene at zero magnetic field. There, interaction effects appear to amplify the effects of a weak moir\'e potential, leading to the formation of stable, isolated Chern bands. It has been further shown that Chern bands are stabilized in mean field calculations even without a moir\'e potential, enabling a realization of the AHC state. Our model is built upon the dissection of the Brillouin zone into patches centered around high symmetry points. Within this model, the wavefunctions at high symmetry points fully determine the topology and energetics of the state. We extract two quantum geometrical phases of the non-interacting wavefunctions that control the stability of the topologically nontrivial AHC state. The model predicts that the AHC state wins over the topological trivial Wigner crystal in a wide range of parameters, and agrees very well with the results of full self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations of the rhombohedral multilayer graphene Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Cornertronics in Two-Dimensional Second-Order Topological Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional electronic devices rely on electron's intrinsic degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) to process information. However, additional d.o.f. like the valley, can emerge in the low-energy states of certain systems. Here, we show that the quantum dots (QDs) constructed from two-dimensional (2D) second-order topological insulator (SOTI) posses a new kind of d.o.f., namely corner freedom, related to the topological corner states that reside at different corners of the systems. Since the corner states are well separated in real space, they can be intuitively addressed and manipulated individually, giving rise to the concept of cornertronics. Via symmetry analysis and material search, we identify the TiSiCO-family monolayers as the first prototype of cornertronics materials, where the corner states can be controlled by both electric and optical fields, due to the novel corner-layer coupling (CLC) effect and the corner-contrasted optical selection rules. Furthermore, we find that the band gap of the TiSiCO nanodisk lies in the terahertz region and is robust to size reduction. These results indicate that the TiSiCO nanodisks can be used to design terahertz devices with ultrasmall size, electric-field tunable band gap, and the ability to simultaneously detect the strength and polarization of terahertz waves, which is not possible for previously reported QDs. Our findings not only pave the way for the cornertronics, but also open a new direction for the research in 2D SOTI, QD and terahertz electronics.</description>

      <title>Engineering the in-plane anomalous Hall effect in Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We predict two topological phase transitions for cadmium arsenide (\ce{Cd3As2}) thin films under in-plane magnetic field, taking advantage of a four-band $k\cdot p$ model and effective $g$ factors calculated from first principles. Film thickness, growth direction and in-plane Zeeman coupling strength can all serve as control parameters to drive these phase transitions. For (001) oriented \ce{Cd3As2} thin films, a two dimensional Weyl semimetal phase protected by $C_{2z}\mathcal{T}$ symmetry can be realized using an in-plane magnetic field, which has recently been reported in our companion paper. We then put forth two pathways to achieve in-plane anomalous Hall effects (IPAHE). By either introducing a trigonal warping term or altering the growth orientation, the emergent $C_{2z} \mathcal{T}$ symmetry can be broken. Consequently, in the clean limit and at low temperatures, quantized Hall plateaus induced by in-plane Zeeman fields become observable.</description>

Abstract: Measurements of the Fermi surface are a fundamental technique for determining the electrical and magnetic properties of solids. In 2D systems, the area and diameter of the Fermi surface is typically measured using Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and commensurability oscillations respectively. However, these techniques are unable to detect changes in the parity of the Fermi surface (i.e. when +k $\neq$ -k). Here, we show that transverse magnetic focussing can be used to detect such changes, because focussing only measures a well defined section of the Fermi surface and does not average over +k and -k. Furthermore, our results show that focussing is an order of magnitude more sensitive to changes in the Fermi surface than other 2D techniques, and could be used to investigate similar Fermi surface changes in other 2D systems.</description>

      <title>Inheritance of the exciton geometric structure from Bloch electrons in two-dimensional layered semiconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically studied the exciton geometric structure in layered semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides. Based on a three-orbital tight-binding model for Bloch electrons which incorporates their geometric structures, an effective exciton Hamiltonian is constructed and solved perturbatively to reveal the relation between the exciton and its electron/hole constituent. We show that the electron-hole Coulomb interaction gives rise to a non-trivial inheritance of the exciton geometric structure from Bloch electrons, which manifests as a valley-dependent center-of-mass anomalous Hall velocity of the exciton when two external fields are applied on the electron and hole constituents, respectively. The obtained center-of-mass anomalous velocity is found to exhibit a non-trivial dependence on the fields, as well as the wave function and valley index of the exciton. These findings can serve as a general guide for the field-control of the valley-dependent exciton transport, enabling the design of novel quantum optoelectronic and valleytronic devices.</description>

      <title>Circuit realisation of a two-orbital non-Hermitian tight-binding chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15014v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a non-Hermitian (NH) tight-binding system comprising of two orbitals per unit cell and their electrical circuit analogues. We distinguish the PT-symmetric and non-PT symmetric cases characterised by non-reciprocal nearest neighbour couplings and onsite gain/loss terms, respectively. The localisation of the edge modes or the emergence of the topological properties are determined via the maximum inverse participation ratio, which has distinct dependencies on the parameters that define the Hamiltonian. None of the above scenarios exhibits the non-Hermitian skin effect. We investigate the boundary modes corresponding to the topological phases in a suitably designed electrical circuit by analyzing the two-port impedance and retrieve the admittance band structure of the circuit via imposing periodic boundary conditions. The obtained results are benchmarked against the Hermitian version of the two-orbital model to compare and discriminate against those obtained for the NH variants.</description>

      <title>Four-dimensional Floquet topological insulator with an emergent second Chern number</title>

Abstract: Floquet topological insulators have been widely investigated in lower-dimensional systems. However, Floquet topological insulators induced by time-periodic driving in higher-dimensional systems remain unexplored. In this work, we study the effects of time-periodic driving in a four-dimensional (4D) normal insulator, focusing on topological phase transitions at the resonant quasienergy gap. We consider two types of time-periodic driving, including a time-periodic onsite potential and a time-periodic vector potential. We reveal that both types of time-periodic driving can transform the 4D normal insulator into a 4D Floquet topological insulator characterized by an emergent second Chern number. Moreover, it is found that the topological phase of the 4D system can be modulated by tuning the strength and frequency of the time-periodic driving. Our work will be helpful for the future investigation of Floquet topological insulators in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>3D ferroelectric phase field simulations of polycrystalline multi-phase hafnia and zirconia based ultra-thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: HfO$_2$- and ZrO$_2$-based ferroelectric thin films have emerged as promising candidates for the gate oxides of next generation electronic devices. Recent work has experimentally demonstrated that a tetragonal/orthorhombic (t/o-) phase mixture with partially in-plane polarization can lead to negative capacitance (NC) stabilization. However, there is a discrepancy between experiments and the theoretical understanding of domain formation and domain wall motion in these multi-phase, polycrystalline materials. Furthermore, the effect of anisotropic domain wall coupling on NC has not been studied so far. Here we apply 3D phase field simulations of HfO$_2$- and ZrO$_2$-based mixed-phase ultra-thin films on silicon to understand the necessary and beneficial conditions for NC stabilization. We find that smaller ferroelectric grains and a larger angle of the polar axis with respect to the out-of-plane direction enhances the NC effect. Furthermore, we show that theoretically predicted negative domain wall coupling even along only one axis prevents NC stabilization. Therefore, we conclude that topological domain walls play a critical role in experimentally observed NC phenomena in HfO$_2$- and ZrO$_2$-based ferroelectrics.</description>

Abstract: Atomic motion in nanopillars standing on the surface of a silicon membrane generates vibrons, which are wavenumber-independent phonons that act as local resonances. These vibrons couple with heat-carrying phonons traveling along the base membrane causing a reduction in the in-plane lattice thermal conductivity. In this work, we examine isolated silicon and gallium nitride nanopillars and for each compare the vibrons density of states (DOS) to those of phonons in an isolated uniform silicon membrane. We show that while the phonon-vibron DOS conformity across the full spectrum is a key factor in reducing the thermal conductivity of the assembled nanostructure, the presence of an intense vibron population at more dominant low frequencies plays a competing role. We report predictions from molecular dynamics simulations showing lower thermal conductivities for a silicon membrane with gallium-nitride nanopillars compared to a silicon membrane with silicon nanopillars.</description>

      <title>Optical and thermal characterization of a group-III nitride semiconductor membrane by microphotoluminescence spectroscopy and Raman thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the simultaneous optical and thermal analysis of a freestanding photonic semiconductor membrane made from wurtzite III-nitride material. By linking micro-photoluminescence ($\mu$PL) spectroscopy with Raman thermometry, we demonstrate how a robust value for the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ can be obtained using only optical, non-invasive means. For this, we consider the balance of different contributions to thermal transport given by, e.g., excitons, charge carriers, and heat carrying phonons. Further complication is given by the fact that this membrane is made from direct bandgap semiconductors, designed to emit light based on an In$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$N ($x=0.15$) quantum well embedded in GaN. To meet these challenges, we designed a novel experimental setup that enables the necessary optical and thermal characterizations in parallel. We perform micro-Raman thermometry, either based on a heating laser that acts as a probe laser (1-laser Raman thermometry), or based on two lasers, providing the heating and the temperature probe separately (2-laser Raman thermometry). For the latter technique, we obtain temperature maps over tens of micrometers with a spatial resolution less than $1\,\mu\text{m}$, yielding $\kappa\,=\,95^{+11}_{-7}\,\frac{\text{W}}{\text{m}\cdot \text{K}}$ for the $\textit{c}$-plane of our $\approx\,250\text{-nm}$-thick membrane at around room temperature, which compares well to our $\textit{ab initio}$ calculations applied to a simplified structure. Based on these calculations, we explain the particular relevance of the temperature probe volume, as quasi-ballistic transport of heat-carrying phonons occurs on length scales beyond the penetration depths of the heating laser and even its focus spot radius. The present work represents a significant step towards non-invasive, highly spatially resolved, and still quantitative thermometry performed on a photonic membrane.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Bound States in the Continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bound states in the continuum (BICs) and exceptional points (EPs) are unique singularities of non-Hermitian systems. BICs demonstrate enhancement of the electromagnetic field at the nanoscale, while EPs exhibit high sensitivity to small perturbations. Here, we demonstrate that several BICs can be merged into one EP, forming an EP-BIC. The resulting state inherits properties from both BICs and EP, namely, it does not radiate and shows extremely high sensitivity to perturbations. We validate the developed theory with numerical simulations and demonstrate the formation of second and third-order EP-BICs in stacked dielectric metasurfaces. We also show that the losses of the resulting leaky resonances exhibit an anomalous behavior when the unit cell is broken, which differs from the asymptotics commonly attributed to BICs.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian bath-induced coupling revealed by two-dimensional spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Problems in the field of open quantum systems often involve an environment that greatly impacts excitation dynamics. Here we show that there can be coherent coupling between different system states of a form that only occurs in a non-Markovian treatment of the bath. Because this involves entangled system-bath states, we demonstrate that there are distinct signatures of this physics in simple absorption spectra and two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy. To do this we introduce a numerical method to simulate optical spectra of non-Markovian open quantum systems. The method employs a process tensor framework to efficiently compute multi-time correlation in a numerically exact way.</description>

      <title>Triplet fermions in MXenes: The Applications for spintronic-based devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic properties of MXenes by three bands tight-binding model of \d_{z^2} , \d_{xy} , and \d_{x^2-y^2} orbitals. The three corresponding bands touch each other at high symmetry K point in the case of absence of spin-orbit interaction. The proper parameters can be obtained by Slater-Koster parameters related to chemical bonding, \pi, \sigma, and \delta bonds. The model calculated for these band structures make an agreement with the same trend as discussed in DFT calculation which the hopping parameters may be identified roughly by fermi velocity. Furthermore, the triplet fermion occurs around K point hosting by flat band, leading to super-Klein tunnelling and anti-super-Klein tunnelling for gapped and gapless pseudospin-1 fermion, respectively. These may apply for nanodevices operated by spin polarization which is more stable than that of the conventional two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Green's function approach to low-energy fission dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The concept of a compound nucleus was proposed by Bohr in 1936 to explain narrow resonances in neutron scattering off a nucleus. While a compound nucleus has been understood in terms of statistical mechanics, its description based on a many-body Hamiltonian has yet to be developed. Here we present a microscopic modeling of a compound nucleus starting from a nucleonic degree of freedom. We focus in particular on a decay of a heavy compound nucleus, that is, fission and radiative capture. To this end, we develop an approach based on a non-equilibrium Green's function, which is combined with a configuration interaction (CI) approach based on a constrained density-functional theory (DFT). We apply this approach to a barrier-top fission of $^{236}$U, restricting the model space to seniority zero configurations of neutrons and protons. Our calculation with a Skyrme energy functional yields the fission-to-capture branching ratio of around 0.07. While this value is still reasonable, the calculation underestimates the branching ratio by about a factor of 40 as compared to the empirical value, indicating a necessity of seniority non-zero configurations in the model space. We also find that the distribution of the fission probability approximately follows the chi-squared distribution with the number of degrees of freedom of the order of 1, which is consistent with the experimental finding.</description>
