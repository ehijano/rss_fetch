      <title>From Delay to Inertia and Triadic Interactions: A Reduction of Coupled Time-Delayed Oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time-delayed phase-oscillator networks model diverse biological and physical systems, yet standard first-order phase reductions cannot adequately capture their high-dimensional collective dynamics. In this Letter, we develop a second-order reduction for a broad class of time-delayed Kuramoto-Daido networks, transforming the original delayed system of one-dimensional phase oscillators into a delay-free network of two-dimensional rotators. The resulting model shows that coupling delay generates inertial terms in the intrinsic dynamics and higher-order (triadic) interactions, and it accurately predicts the emergence of complex collective patterns such as splay, cyclops, and chimera states. The reduction further reveals a qualitative division of roles: time delay acts primarily as effective inertia for higher-dimensional dynamics, including splay states, whereas the induced triadic interactions are decisive for lower-dimensional patterns such as chimeras. The method applies to networks with arbitrary topology, higher-harmonic coupling, and intrinsic-frequency heterogeneity, yielding a compact, parameter-explicit reduced model. This universal reduced description of time-delayed oscillator networks opens the door to systematic prediction and analysis of nontrivial collective dynamics in delay-coupled systems.</description>

      <title>Heteronuclear and Homonuclear Vector Solitons in Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector solitons (VSs), being observed across various fields from optics to Bose-Einstein condensates, are localized structures composed of orthogonal modes bound by nonlinear couplings. Nevertheless, the influence of intermodal linear coupling on the physical properties of this bimodal structure remains to be decently revealed and harnessed. Utilizing an ultrafast fiber laser as a platform, we predict and demonstrate that the linear mode coupling (LMC) induces the deformable VS in terms of the temporal and spectral structures. Weak LMC supports heteronuclear vector solitons built of dissimilar polarization modes, i.e., a single pulse coupled to an orthogonal damped pulse chain. On the other hand, strong LMC facilitates the homonuclear VS composed of polarization modes with similar structures, in the form of soliton compounds featuring caterpillar motions. Our findings reveal new patterns of VSs and open an effective avenue for versatile ultrafast optical sources.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of Dirac-Bianconi driven oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20163v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In dynamical systems on networks, one assigns the dynamics to nodes, which are then coupled via links. This approach does not account for group interactions and dynamics on links and other higher dimensional structures. Higher-order network theory addresses this by considering variables defined on nodes, links, triangles, and higher-order simplices, called topological signals (or cochains). Moreover, topological signals of different dimensions can interact through the Dirac-Bianconi operator, which allows coupling between topological signals defined, for example, on nodes and links. Such interactions can induce various dynamical behaviors, for example, periodic oscillations. The oscillating system consists of topological signals on nodes and links whose dynamics are driven by the Dirac-Bianconi coupling, hence, which we call it Dirac-Bianconi driven oscillator. Using the phase reduction method, we obtain a phase description of this system and apply it to the study of synchronization between two such oscillators. This approach offers a way to analyze oscillatory behaviors in higher-order networks beyond the node-based paradigm, while providing a ductile modeling tool for node- and edge-signals.</description>
