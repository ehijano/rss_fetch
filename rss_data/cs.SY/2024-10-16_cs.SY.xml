      <title>Multi-Objective Multidisciplinary Optimization of Wave Energy Converter Array Layout and Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study utilizes multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO) to design an array of heaving wave energy converters (WECs) for grid-scale energy production with decision variables and parameters chosen from the coupled disciplines of geometry, hydrodynamics, layout, motor-actuated reactive controls (with a force maximum constraint) and economics. We vary a WEC's dimensions, array layout, and control gain to minimize two objectives: the levelized cost of energy (LCOE) and the maximum separation distance. This multi-objective optimization approach results in a set of optimal design configurations that stakeholders can choose from for their specific application and needs. The framework yields a range of optimal (minimum) LCOE values from 0.21 to 0.23 \$/kWh and a separation distance ranging from 97 to 62 meters. The WEC radius of 4m is found to be optimal, and the q-factor for optimal designs are greater than 1 up to 1.06 for a rhombus-like layout. Additionally, a post-optimality global sensitivity analysis of a design shows that wave heading, wave frequency, WEC lifetime, amplitude and interest rate accounts for most of the variance. Different designs in the Pareto set may be appealing for different decision makers based on their trade-off analysis. To that end, regression model is developed for design heuristics.</description>

      <title>EFILN: The Electric Field Inversion-Localization Network for High-Precision Underwater Positioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate underwater target localization is essential for underwater exploration. To improve accuracy and efficiency in complex underwater environments, we propose the Electric Field Inversion-Localization Network (EFILN), a deep feedforward neural network that reconstructs position coordinates from underwater electric field signals. By assessing whether the neural network's input-output values satisfy the Coulomb law, the error between the network's inversion solution and the equation's exact solution can be determined. The Adam optimizer was employed first, followed by the L-BFGS optimizer, to progressively improve the output precision of EFILN. A series of noise experiments demonstrated the robustness and practical utility of the proposed method, while small sample data experiments validated its strong small-sample learning (SSL) capabilities. To accelerate relevant research, we have made the codes available as open-source.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective-Optimization Multi-AUV Assisted Data Collection Framework for IoUT Based on Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) offers significant potential for ocean exploration but encounters challenges due to dynamic underwater environments and severe signal attenuation. Current methods relying on Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) based on online reinforcement learning (RL) lead to high computational costs and low data utilization. To address these issues and the constraints of turbulent ocean environments, we propose a multi-AUV assisted data collection framework for IoUT based on multi-agent offline RL. This framework maximizes data rate and the value of information (VoI), minimizes energy consumption, and ensures collision avoidance by utilizing environmental and equipment status data. We introduce a semi-communication decentralized training with decentralized execution (SC-DTDE) paradigm and a multi-agent independent conservative Q-learning algorithm (MAICQL) to effectively tackle the problem. Extensive simulations demonstrate the high applicability, robustness, and data collection efficiency of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Communication-Control Codesign for Large-Scale Wireless Networked Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs) are essential to Industry 4.0, enabling flexible control in applications, such as drone swarms and autonomous robots. The interdependence between communication and control requires integrated design, but traditional methods treat them separately, leading to inefficiencies. Current codesign approaches often rely on simplified models, focusing on single-loop or independent multi-loop systems. However, large-scale WNCSs face unique challenges, including coupled control loops, time-correlated wireless channels, trade-offs between sensing and control transmissions, and significant computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a practical WNCS model that captures correlated dynamics among multiple control loops with spatially distributed sensors and actuators sharing limited wireless resources over multi-state Markov block-fading channels. We formulate the codesign problem as a sequential decision-making task that jointly optimizes scheduling and control inputs across estimation, control, and communication domains. To solve this problem, we develop a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm that efficiently handles the hybrid action space, captures communication-control correlations, and ensures robust training despite sparse cross-domain variables and floating control inputs. Extensive simulations show that the proposed DRL approach outperforms benchmarks and solves the large-scale WNCS codesign problem, providing a scalable solution for industrial automation.</description>

      <title>FBC-Enhanced {\epsilon}-Effective Capacity Optimization for NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of massive ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (mURLLC) has introduced a critical class of time- and reliability-sensitive services within next-generation wireless networks. This shift has attracted significant research attention, driven by the need to meet stringent quality-of-service (QoS) requirements. In this context, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) systems have emerged as a promising solution to enhance mURLLC performance by providing substantial enhancements in both spectral efficiency and massive connectivity, particularly through the development of finite blocklength coding (FBC) techniques. Nevertheless, owing to the dynamic nature of wireless network environments and the complex architecture of FBC-enhanced NOMA systems, the research on the efficient design of optimizing the system performance for maximizing system capacity while guaranteeing the tail distributions in terms of new statistical QoS constraints for delay and error-rate is still in its infancy. In an effort to address these challenges, we put forth the formulation and solution of {\epsilon}-effective capacity problems tailored for uplink FBC-enhanced NOMA systems, specifically catering to ensure statistical delay and error-rate bounded QoS requirements. In particular, we establish uplink two-user FBC-enhanced NOMA system models by applying the hybrid successive interference cancellation (SIC). We also develop the concept of the {\epsilon}-effective capacity and propose the optimal power allocation policies to maximize the {\epsilon}-effective capacity and {\epsilon}-effective energy efficiency while upper-bounding both delay and error-rate. We conduct a set of simulations to validate and evaluate our developed optimization schemes over FBC-enhanced NOMA systems.</description>

      <title>pycvxset: A Python package for convex set manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces pycvxset, a new Python package to manipulate and visualize convex sets. We support polytopes and ellipsoids, and provide user-friendly methods to perform a variety of set operations. For polytopes, pycvxset supports the standard halfspace/vertex representation as well as the constrained zonotope representation. The main advantage of constrained zonotope representations over standard halfspace/vertex representations is that constrained zonotopes admit closed-form expressions for several set operations. pycvxset uses CVXPY to solve various convex programs arising in set operations, and uses pycddlib to perform vertex-halfspace enumeration. We demonstrate the use of pycvxset in analyzing and controlling dynamical systems in Python. pycvxset is available at https://github.com/merlresearch/pycvxset under the AGPL-3.0-or-later license, along with documentation and examples.</description>

      <title>Quantification of Non-stationary Power Quality Events: A New Index Based on $\ell_p$-norm of Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study proposes a new index to quantify the severity of non-stationary power quality (PQ) disturbance events. In particular, the severity of PQ events is estimated from their energy distribution in temporal-frequency space. The index essentially measures the $\ell_p$-norm between the energy distributions of an event and the nominal voltage signal. The efficacy of the new index is demonstrated considering a wide class of major non-stationary PQ events, including sag, swell, interruptions, oscillatory transients, and simultaneous events. The results of this investigation, with simulated, real and experimental data, convincingly demonstrate that the proposed index is generic, monotonic, easy to interpret, and can accurately quantify the severity of non-stationary events.</description>

      <title>Survey on Neighbor Discovery and Beam Alignment in mmWave-Enabled UAV Swarm Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave)-enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm networks (UAVSNs) can utilize a large spectrum of resources to provide low latency and high data transmission rate. Additionally, owing to the short wavelength, UAVs equipped with large antenna arrays can form secure narrow directive beam to establish communication with less interference. However, due to the high UAV mobility, limited beam coverage, beam misalignment, and high path loss, it is very challenging to adopt the mmWave communication in UAVSNs. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey on neighbor discovery and beam alignment techniques for directional communication in mmWave-enabled UAVSNs. The existing techniques are reviewed and compared with each other. We also discuss key open issues and challenges with potential research direction.</description>

      <title>Attitude Estimation via Matrix Fisher Distributions on SO(3) Using Non-Unit Vector Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11566v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note presents a novel Bayesian attitude estimator with the matrix Fisher distribution on the special orthogonal group, which can smoothly accommodate both unit and non-unit vector measurements. The posterior attitude distribution is proven to be a matrix Fisher distribution with the assumption that non-unit vector measurement errors follow the isotropic Gaussian distributions and unit vector measurements follow the von-Mises Fisher distributions. Next, a global unscented transformation is proposed to approximate the full likelihood distribution with a matrix Fisher distribution for more generic cases of vector measurement errors following the non-isotropic Gaussian distributions. Following these, a Bayesian attitude estimator with the matrix Fisher distribution is constructed. Numerical examples are then presented. The proposed estimator exhibits advantageous performance compared with the previous attitude estimator with matrix Fisher distributions and the classic multiplicative extended Kalman filter in the case of non-unit vector measurements.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid development and expansion of the EV market marked by the advent of third decade of the 21st century has improved the possibility of a sustainable automotive future. The present EV drivetrain run by BLDC motor has become increasingly complicated thus requiring efficient and accurate controls. The paper begins with discussing the problems in existing models, the research then focuses on increasing the robustness of the system towards disturbances and uncertainties by using Sliding Mode Control to control the ZSI, which has been chosen as the main power converter topology in place of VSI or CSI. The introduction of SMC has improved the performance of the drivetrain when applied with Vehicle dynamics over a Drive Cycle.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present work is an attempt to understand and review existing methods of energy generation in electric vehicles in the modern day context. Previous works in the field have proposed various mechanisms of energy generation that are very well adaptable to commercial scale uses and can be used as alternative power sourcing for electric vehicles having nil or very low environmental impact. The paper discusses strategies such as photovoltaic cell systems, regenerative braking, fuel cell, thermoelectric generators and micro wind-turbines with adequate propositions to select them on the basis of their suitability. The document also includes important formulas that can be used for individual modeling and designing. The paper emphasises on introducing the mechanisms that can be introduced as assistive mechanisms or secondary sources so that the range and other parameters are not compromised.</description>

      <title>PD-Based and SINDy Nonlinear Dynamics Identification of UAVs for MPC Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive approach to nonlinear dynamics identification for UAVs using a combination of data-driven techniques and theoretical modeling. Two key methodologies are explored: Proportional-Derivative (PD) approximation and Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy). The UAV dynamics are first modeled using the Euler-Lagrange formulation, providing a set of generalized coordinates. However, platform constraints limit the control inputs to attitude angles, and linear and angular velocities along the z-axis. To accommodate these limitations, thrust and torque inputs are approximated using a PD controller, serving as the foundation for nonlinear system identification. In parallel, SINDy, a data-driven method, is employed to derive a compact and interpretable model of the UAV dynamics from experimental data. Both identified models are then integrated into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for accurate trajectory tracking, where model accuracy, informed by data-driven insights, plays a critical role in optimizing control performance. This fusion of data-driven approaches and theoretical modeling enhances the system's robustness and adaptability in real-world conditions, offering a detailed analysis of the UAV's dynamic behavior.</description>

      <title>A Structural Analysis of the User Behavior Dynamics for Environmentally Sustainable ICT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sector of information and communication technology (ICT) can contribute to the fulfillment of the Paris agreement and the sustainable development goals (SDGs) through the introduction of sustainability strategies. For environmental sustainability, such strategies should contain efficiency, sufficiency, and consistency measures. To propose such, a structural analysis of ICT is undertaken in this manuscript. Thereby, key mechanisms and dynamics behind the usage of ICT and the corresponding energy and resource use are analyzed by describing ICT as a complex system. The system contains data centers, communication networks, smartphone hardware, apps, and the behavior of the users as sub-systems, between which various Morinian interactions are present. Energy and non-energy resources can be seen as inputs of the system, while e-waste is an output. Based on the system description, we propose multiple measures for efficiency, sufficiency and consistency to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts.</description>

      <title>Recursively Feasible Stochastic Model Predictive Control for Time-Varying Linear Systems Subject to Unbounded Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model predictive control solves a constrained optimization problem online in order to compute an implicit closed-loop control policy. Recursive feasibility -- guaranteeing that the optimal control problem will have a solution at every time step -- is an important property to guarantee the success of any model predictive control approach. However, recursive feasibility is difficult to establish in a stochastic setting and, in particular, in the presence of disturbances having unbounded support (e.g., Gaussian noise). The problem is further exacerbated for time-varying systems, in which case recursive feasibility must be established also in a robust sense, over all possible future time-varying parameter values, as well as in a stochastic sense, over all potential disturbance realizations. This work presents a method for ensuring the recursive feasibility of a convex, affine-feedback stochastic model predictive control problem formulation for systems with time-varying system matrices and unbounded disturbances using ideas from covariance steering stochastic model predictive control. It is additionally shown that the proposed approach ensures the closed-loop operation of the system will satisfy the desired chance constraints in practice, and that the stochastic model predictive control problem may be formulated as a convex program so that it may be efficiently solved in real-time.</description>

Abstract: Wind energy has emerged as one of the most vital and economically viable forms of renewable energy. The integration of wind energy sources into power grids across the globe has been increasing substantially, largely due to the higher levels of uncertainty associated with wind energy compared to other renewable energy sources. This study focuses on analyzing the Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) market model, with particular emphasis on the integration of wind power plants into substations. Furthermore, it examines a two-stage stochastic model for electricity markets employing LMP pricing, utilizing the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) method for the analysis.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning Based Bidding Framework with High-dimensional Bids in Power Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, bidding in power markets has attracted widespread attention. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been widely used for power market bidding as a powerful AI tool to make decisions under real-world uncertainties. However, current RL methods mostly employ low dimensional bids, which significantly diverge from the N price-power pairs commonly used in the current power markets. The N-pair bidding format is denoted as High Dimensional Bids (HDBs), which has not been fully integrated into the existing RL-based bidding methods. The loss of flexibility in current RL bidding methods could greatly limit the bidding profits and make it difficult to tackle the rising uncertainties brought by renewable energy generations. In this paper, we intend to propose a framework to fully utilize HDBs for RL-based bidding methods. First, we employ a special type of neural network called Neural Network Supply Functions (NNSFs) to generate HDBs in the form of N price-power pairs. Second, we embed the NNSF into a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to make it compatible with most existing RL methods. Finally, experiments on Energy Storage Systems (ESSs) in the PJM Real-Time (RT) power market show that the proposed bidding method with HDBs can significantly improve bidding flexibility, thereby improving the profit of the state-of-the-art RL bidding methods.</description>

      <title>Guarantees for Nonlinear Representation Learning: Non-identical Covariates, Dependent Data, Fewer Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A driving force behind the diverse applicability of modern machine learning is the ability to extract meaningful features across many sources. However, many practical domains involve data that are non-identically distributed across sources, and statistically dependent within its source, violating vital assumptions in existing theoretical studies. Toward addressing these issues, we establish statistical guarantees for learning general $\textit{nonlinear}$ representations from multiple data sources that admit different input distributions and possibly dependent data. Specifically, we study the sample-complexity of learning $T+1$ functions $f_\star^{(t)} \circ g_\star$ from a function class $\mathcal F \times \mathcal G$, where $f_\star^{(t)}$ are task specific linear functions and $g_\star$ is a shared nonlinear representation. A representation $\hat g$ is estimated using $N$ samples from each of $T$ source tasks, and a fine-tuning function $\hat f^{(0)}$ is fit using $N'$ samples from a target task passed through $\hat g$. We show that when $N \gtrsim C_{\mathrm{dep}} (\mathrm{dim}(\mathcal F) + \mathrm{C}(\mathcal G)/T)$, the excess risk of $\hat f^{(0)} \circ \hat g$ on the target task decays as $\nu_{\mathrm{div}} \big(\frac{\mathrm{dim}(\mathcal F)}{N'} + \frac{\mathrm{C}(\mathcal G)}{N T} \big)$, where $C_{\mathrm{dep}}$ denotes the effect of data dependency, $\nu_{\mathrm{div}}$ denotes an (estimatable) measure of $\textit{task-diversity}$ between the source and target tasks, and $\mathrm C(\mathcal G)$ denotes the complexity of the representation class $\mathcal G$. In particular, our analysis reveals: as the number of tasks $T$ increases, both the sample requirement and risk bound converge to that of $r$-dimensional regression as if $g_\star$ had been given, and the effect of dependency only enters the sample requirement, leaving the risk bound matching the iid setting.</description>

      <title>Strategic and Fair Aggregator Interactions in Energy Markets: Mutli-agent Dynamics and Quasiconcave Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of aggregator structures has proven effective in bringing fairness to energy resource allocation by negotiating for more resources and economic surplus on behalf of users. This paper extends the fair energy resource allocation problem to a multi-agent setting, focusing on interactions among multiple aggregators in an electricity market.
  We prove that the strategic optimization problems faced by the aggregators form a quasiconcave game, ensuring the existence of a Nash equilibrium. This resolves complexities related to market price dependencies on total purchases and balancing fairness and efficiency in energy allocation. In addition, we design simulations to characterize the equilibrium points of the induced game, demonstrating how aggregators stabilize market outcomes, ensure fair resource distribution, and optimize user surplus. Our findings offer a robust framework for understanding strategic interactions among aggregators, contributing to more efficient and equitable energy markets.</description>

      <title>Hessian-Informed Flow Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling complex systems that evolve toward equilibrium distributions is important in various physical applications, including molecular dynamics and robotic control. These systems often follow the stochastic gradient descent of an underlying energy function, converging to stationary distributions around energy minima. The local covariance of these distributions is shaped by the energy landscape's curvature, often resulting in anisotropic characteristics. While flow-based generative models have gained traction in generating samples from equilibrium distributions in such applications, they predominately employ isotropic conditional probability paths, limiting their ability to capture such covariance structures.
  In this paper, we introduce Hessian-Informed Flow Matching (HI-FM), a novel approach that integrates the Hessian of an energy function into conditional flows within the flow matching framework. This integration allows HI-FM to account for local curvature and anisotropic covariance structures. Our approach leverages the linearization theorem from dynamical systems and incorporates additional considerations such as time transformations and equivariance. Empirical evaluations on the MNIST and Lennard-Jones particles datasets demonstrate that HI-FM improves the likelihood of test samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the real-time remote tracking of a two-state Markov process by an energy harvesting source. The source decides whether to transmit over an unreliable channel based on the state. We formulate this scenario as a Markov decision process (MDP) to determine the optimal transmission policy that minimizes the average Version Innovation Age (VIA) as a performance metric. We demonstrate that the optimal transmission policy is threshold-based, determined by the battery level, source state, and VIA value. We numerically verify the analytical structure of the optimal policy and compare the performance of our proposed policy against two baseline policies across various system parameters, establishing the superior performance of our approach.</description>

Abstract: 6G networks will be highly dynamic, re-configurable, and resilient. To enable and support such features, employing AI has been suggested. Integrating AIin networks will likely require distributed AI deployments with resilient connectivity, e.g., for communication between RL agents and environment. Such approaches need to be validated in realistic network environments. In this demo, we use ContainerNet to emulate AI-capable and autonomic networks that employ the routing protocol KIRA to provide resilient connectivity and service discovery. As an example AI application, we train and infer deep RL agents learning medium access control (MAC) policies for a wireless network environment in the emulated network.</description>

      <title>A Data-Driven Aggressive Autonomous Racing Framework Utilizing Local Trajectory Planning with Velocity Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of autonomous driving has boosted the research on autonomous racing. However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contour Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits. The released code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC.</description>

      <title>Safety Filtering While Training: Improving the Performance and Sample Efficiency of Reinforcement Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) controllers are flexible and performant but rarely guarantee safety. Safety filters impart hard safety guarantees to RL controllers while maintaining flexibility. However, safety filters can cause undesired behaviours due to the separation between the controller and the safety filter, often degrading performance and robustness. In this paper, we propose several modifications to incorporating the safety filter in training RL controllers rather than solely applying it during evaluation. The modifications allow the RL controller to learn to account for the safety filter, improving performance. Additionally, our modifications significantly improve sample efficiency and eliminate training-time constraint violations. We verified the proposed modifications in simulated and real experiments with a Crazyflie 2.0 drone. In experiments, we show that the proposed training approaches require significantly fewer environment interactions and improve performance by up to 20% compared to standard RL training.</description>

      <title>Improving the Accuracy of DC Optimal Power Flow Formulations via Parameter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DC Optimal Power Flow (DC-OPF) problems optimize the generators' active power setpoints while satisfying constraints based on the DC power flow linearization. The computational tractability advantages of DC-OPF problems come at the expense of inaccuracies relative to AC Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) problems which accurately model the nonlinear steady-state behavior of power grids. This paper proposes an algorithm that significantly improves the accuracy of the generators' active power setpoints from DC-OPF problems with respect to the corresponding AC-OPF problems over a specified range of operating conditions. Using sensitivity information in a machine learning-inspired methodology, this algorithm tunes coefficient and bias parameters in the DC power flow approximation to improve the accuracy of the resulting DC-OPF solutions. Employing the Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) method -- a Quasi-Newton optimization technique -- this parameter tuning occurs during an offline training phase, with the resulting parameters then used in online computations. Numerical results underscore the algorithm's efficacy with accuracy improvements in squared two-norm and $\infty$-norm losses of up to $90\%$ and $79\%$, respectively, relative to traditional DC-OPF formulations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep learning based performance testing framework to minimize the number of required test modules while guaranteeing the accuracy requirement, where a test module corresponds to a combination of one circuit and one stimulus. First, we apply a deep neural network (DNN) to establish the mapping from the response of the circuit under test (CUT) in each module to all specifications to be tested. Then, the required test modules are selected by solving a 0-1 integer programming problem. Finally, the predictions from the selected test modules are combined by a DNN to form the specification estimations. The simulation results validate the proposed approach in terms of testing accuracy and cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frequency domain sweeps of array antennas are well-known to be time-intensive, and different surrogate models have been used to improve the performance. Data-driven model order reduction algorithms, such as the Loewner framework and vector fitting, can be integrated with these adaptive error estimates, in an iterative algorithm, to reduce the number of full-wave simulations required to accurately capture the requested frequency behavior of multiport array antennas. In this work, we propose two novel adaptive methods exploiting a block matrix function which is a key part of the Loewner framework generating system approach. The first algorithm leverages an inherent matrix parameter freedom in the block matrix function to identify frequency points with large errors, whereas the second utilizes the condition number of the block matrix function. Both methods effectively provide frequency domain error estimates, which are essential for improved performance. Numerical experiments on multiport array antenna S-parameters demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms within the Loewner framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death and premature mortality worldwide, with occupational environments significantly influencing CVD risk, underscoring the need for effective cardiac monitoring and early warning systems. Existing methods of monitoring vital signs require subjects to remain stationary, which is impractical for daily monitoring as individuals are often in motion. To address this limitation, we propose MERIT, a multimodality-based wearable system designed for precise ECG waveform monitoring without movement restrictions. Daily activities, involving frequent arm movements, can significantly affect sensor data and complicate the reconstruction of accurate ECG signals. To mitigate motion impact and enhance ECG signal reconstruction, we introduce a deep independent component analysis (Deep-ICA) module and a multimodal fusion module. We conducted experiments with 15 subjects. Our results, compared with commercial wearable devices and existing methods, demonstrate that MERIT accurately reconstructs ECG waveforms during various office activities, offering a reliable solution for fine-grained cardiac monitoring in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Environmental management and restoration under unified risk and uncertainty using robustified dynamic Orlicz risk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Environmental management and restoration should be designed such that the risk and uncertainty owing to nonlinear stochastic systems can be successfully addressed. We apply the robustified dynamic Orlicz risk to the modeling and analysis of environmental management and restoration to consider both the risk and uncertainty within a unified theory. We focus on the control of a jump-driven hybrid stochastic system that represents macrophyte dynamics. The dynamic programming equation based on the Orlicz risk is first obtained heuristically, from which the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is derived. In the proposed Orlicz risk, the risk aversion of the decision-maker is represented by a power coefficient that resembles a certainty equivalence, whereas the uncertainty aversion is represented by the Kullback-Leibler divergence, in which the risk and uncertainty are handled consistently and separately. The HJB equation includes a new state-dependent discount factor that arises from the uncertainty aversion, which leads to a unique, nonlinear, and nonlocal term. The link between the proposed and classical stochastic control problems is discussed with a focus on control-dependent discount rates. We propose a finite difference method for computing the HJB equation. Finally, the proposed model is applied to an optimal harvesting problem for macrophytes in a brackish lake that contains both growing and drifting populations.</description>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on vast internet-scale data have showcased remarkable capabilities across diverse domains. Recently, there has been escalating interest in deploying LLMs for robotics, aiming to harness the power of foundation models in real-world settings. However, this approach faces significant challenges, particularly in grounding these models in the physical world and in generating dynamic robot motions. To address these issues, we introduce a novel paradigm in which we use few-shot prompts collected from the physical environment, enabling the LLM to autoregressively generate low-level control commands for robots without task-specific fine-tuning. Experiments across various robots and environments validate that our method can effectively prompt a robot to walk. We thus illustrate how LLMs can proficiently function as low-level feedback controllers for dynamic motion control even in high-dimensional robotic systems.

      <title>Solving Offline Reinforcement Learning with Decision Tree Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11630v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to addressing offline reinforcement learning (RL) problems by reframing them as regression tasks that can be effectively solved using Decision Trees. Mainly, we introduce two distinct frameworks: return-conditioned and return-weighted decision tree policies (RCDTP and RWDTP), both of which achieve notable speed in agent training as well as inference, with training typically lasting less than a few minutes. Despite the simplification inherent in this reformulated approach to offline RL, our agents demonstrate performance that is at least on par with the established methods. We evaluate our methods on D4RL datasets for locomotion and manipulation, as well as other robotic tasks involving wheeled and flying robots. Additionally, we assess performance in delayed/sparse reward scenarios and highlight the explainability of these policies through action distribution and feature importance.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Driven Global Optimisation Framework for Analog Circuit Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a machine learning-driven optimisation framework for analog circuit design in this paper. The primary objective is to determine the device sizes for the optimal performance of analog circuits for a given set of specifications. Our methodology entails employing machine learning models and spice simulations to direct the optimisation algorithm towards achieving the optimal design for analog circuits. Machine learning based global offline surrogate models, with the circuit design parameters as the input, are built in the design space for the analog circuits under study and is used to guide the optimisation algorithm, resulting in faster convergence and a reduced number of spice simulations. Multi-layer perceptron and random forest regressors are employed to predict the required design specifications of the analog circuit. Since the saturation condition of transistors is vital in the proper working of analog circuits, multi-layer perceptron classifiers are used to predict the saturation condition of each transistor in the circuit. The feasibility of the candidate solutions is verified using machine learning models before invoking spice simulations. We validate the proposed framework using three circuit topologies--a bandgap reference, a folded cascode operational amplifier, and a two-stage operational amplifier. The simulation results show better optimum values and lower standard deviations for fitness functions after convergence. Incorporating the machine learning-based predictions proposed in the optimisation method has resulted in the reduction of spice calls by 56%, 59%, and 83% when compared with standard approaches in the three test cases considered in the study.</description>

      <title>Mobile Edge Generation-Enabled Digital Twin: Architecture Design and Research Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel paradigm of mobile edge generation (MEG)-enabled digital twin (DT) is proposed, which enables distributed on-device generation at mobile edge networks for real-time DT applications. First, an MEG-DT architecture is put forward to decentralize generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models onto edge servers (ESs) and user equipments (UEs), which has the advantages of low latency, privacy preservation, and individual-level customization. Then, various single-user and multi-user generation mechanisms are conceived for MEG-DT, which strike trade-offs between generation latency, hardware costs, and device coordination. Furthermore, to perform efficient distributed generation, two operating protocols are explored for transmitting interpretable and latent features between ESs and UEs, namely sketch-based generation and seed-based generation, respectively. Based on the proposed protocols, the convergence between MEG and DT are highlighted. Considering the seed-based image generation scenario, numerical case studies are provided to reveal the superiority of MEG-DT over centralized generation. Finally, promising applications and research opportunities are identified. Code is available at https://github.com/xiaoxiaxusummer/MEG_DT</description>

      <title>The Reachability Problem for Neural-Network Control Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A control system consists of a plant component and a controller which periodically computes a control input for the plant. We consider systems where the controller is implemented by a feedforward neural network with ReLU activations. The reachability problem asks, given a set of initial states, whether a set of target states can be reached. We show that this problem is undecidable even for trivial plants and fixed-depth neural networks with three inputs and outputs. We also show that the problem becomes semi-decidable when the plant as well as the input and target sets are given by automata over infinite words.</description>

      <title>Mindalogue: LLM-Powered Nonlinear Interaction for Effective Learning and Task Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current generative AI models like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini are widely used for knowledge dissemination, task decomposition, and creative thinking. However, their linear interaction methods often force users to repeatedly compare and copy contextual information when handling complex tasks, increasing cognitive load and operational costs. Moreover, the ambiguity in model responses requires users to refine and simplify the information further. To address these issues, we developed "Mindalogue", a system using a non-linear interaction model based on "nodes + canvas" to enhance user efficiency and freedom while generating structured responses. A formative study with 11 users informed the design of Mindalogue, which was then evaluated through a study with 16 participants. The results showed that Mindalogue significantly reduced task steps and improved users' comprehension of complex information. This study highlights the potential of non-linear interaction in improving AI tool efficiency and user experience in the HCI field.</description>
