      <title>A Unified Variational Framework for Planar Elastica with General Distributed Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple variational framework for planar elastica that enables distributed energies, such as gravitational loading or magnetic body torques, to be incorporated in a modular and unified manner. The formulation is based on expressing all load induced contributions directly at the level of the energy functional, which avoids the force balance constructions used in classical treatments such as Wang (1986) and makes the inclusion of additional physical effects straightforward. The resulting planar energy functional yields compact governing equations in which the contributions of individual load types remain clearly separated. We demonstrate that the framework reproduces the classical heavy elastica equations exactly and naturally accommodates magnetic energy terms commonly used in hard magnetic rod models. Although mathematically elementary, the formulation provides a clean and extensible structure for describing planar rod deformations under general distributed loads.</description>

      <title>High-throughput characterization of snap-through stability boundaries of bistable beams in a programmable rotating platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a high-throughput platform that enables simultaneous, parallel testing of six bistable beams via programmable motion of a rotating disk. By prescribing harmonic angular dynamics, the platform explores the phase space of angular velocity and acceleration $(\Omega,\,\dot{\Omega})$, producing continuously varying centrifugal and Euler force fields that act as tunable body forces in our specimens. Image processing extracts beam kinematics with sub-pixel accuracy, enabling precise identification of snap-through events. By testing six beams in parallel, the platform allows systematic variation of beam thickness, pre-compression, tilt angle, and clamp orientations across 65 distinct configurations, generating 23,400 individual experiments. We construct stability boundaries and quantitatively parameterize them as parabolic functions, characterized by a vertical offset and a curvature parameter. Tilt angle provides the most robust mechanism for tuning the curvature parameter, while beam thickness and pre-compression modulate vertical offset. Modal decomposition analysis reveals that antisymmetric clamp configurations can trigger mode switching, in which competing geometric and inertial effects drive transitions through different deformation pathways. Our work establishes a scalable experimental framework for high-throughput characterization of dynamic nonlinear instabilities in mechanics. The complete experimental dataset is made publicly available to support data-driven design and machine learning models for nonlinear mechanics with applications to bistability-based metamaterials, mechanical memory, and electronics-free sensing systems.</description>

      <title>Effective Operators in the Theory of Composites: Hilbert Space Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this chapter, the Hilbert space framework in the mathematical theory of composite materials is introduced for studying the properties of effective operators. The goal is to introduce some of the key concepts and fundamental theorems in this area while showing that they follow naturally from using only basic results in operator theory on Hilbert spaces. These concepts include the $Z$-problem as an abstraction of a constitutive equation defined in terms of a bounded linear operator on a Hilbert space with a Hodge decomposition, direct and dual $Z$-problems with the duality interpretation of the inverse of an effective operator, and the notion of an $n$-phase composite with orthogonal $Z(n)$-subspace collection. These theorems include sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of both the solution of a $Z$-problem and the effective operator of a $Z$-problem, a representation formula for the effective operator as an operator Schur complement, the Dirichlet and Thomson minimization principles for the effective operator, the result on monotonicity and concavity of the effective operator map, and the Keller-Dykhne-Mendelson duality relations. Moreover, another important theorem given here (which may also be of independent interest to systems theorists) says that an effective operator of an $n$-phase composite with orthogonal $Z(n)$-subspace collection is the Schur complement of a normalized homogeneous semidefinite operator pencil (in particular, has a Bessmertny\u{\i} realization) and, up to a unitary equivalence, the converse is also true. Finally, the general theory presented here is shown to recover classical results dealing with effective conductivity but can also be applied to many other important problems involving composites in physics and engineering, e.g., in elasticity and electromagnetism.</description>
