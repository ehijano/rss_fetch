      <title>Embedding calculus for parallelized manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variant of the embedding functor $\mathop{\mathrm{Emb}}(M, N)$ that incorporates homotopical data from the frame bundle of the target manifold $N$. Given a parallelized $m$-manifold $M$ and an $n$-manifold $N$ equipped with a section of its $m$-frame bundle, we define a modified embedding functor $\widetilde{\mathop{\mathrm{Emb}}}(M, N)$ that interpolates between the standard embedding and a reference framing. Using the manifold calculus of functors, we identify the Taylor tower of $\widetilde{\mathop{\mathrm{Emb}}}(M, N)$ with a mapping space of right modules over the Fulton-MacPherson operad. We prove a convergence theorem under a codimension condition, establishing a weak equivalence between $\widetilde{\mathop{\mathrm{Emb}}}(M, N)$ and its Taylor approximation. Finally, under rationalization, we describe the derived mapping space in terms of a combinatorial hairy graph complex, enabling computational access to the rational homotopy type of the space of embeddings.</description>

      <title>Directed LS category and directed parametrized topological complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a parametrized analogue of the directed topological complexity, originally developed by Goubault, Farber, and Sagnier. We establish the fibrewise basic dihomotopy invariance of directed parametrized topological complexity and explore its relationship with the parametrized topological complexity. In addition, we introduce the concept of the directed Lusternik$-$Schnirelmann (LS) category, prove its basic dihomotopy invariance, and investigate its connections with both directed topological complexity and directed parametrized topological complexity. As an application, we show that the directed LS category of the directed spheres is equal to two.</description>

      <title>A spine for the decorated Teichm\"uller space of a punctured non-orientable surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on work of Harer \cite{Ha86}, we construct a spine for the decorated Teichm\"uller space of a non-orientable surface with at least one puncture and negative Euler characteristic. We compute its dimension, and show that the deformation retraction onto this spine is equivariant with respect to the pure mapping class group of the non-orientable surface. As a consequence, we obtain a model for the classifying space for proper actions of the pure mapping class group of a punctured non-orientable surface, which is of minimal dimension in the case there is a single puncture.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the locality of generalized global symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine generalized global symmetries as a kind of compactly supported cohomology, and so are led to revisit questions about the locality of quantum field theory, following Segal. Physics naturally suggests a generalization of factorization algebras, aimed at capturing nonperturbative information, and we explain how higher group symmetries offer examples of this generalization, providing an extension of the nonabelian Poincar\'e duality of Salvatore and Lurie. Finally, we explore how continuous generalized symmetries and anomalies can be cast in this framework.</description>

      <title>Coding with the transverse intersection algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of a fluid algebra was introduced by Sullivan over a decade ago as an algebraic construct which contains everything necessary in order to write down a form of the Euler equation, as an ODE whose solutions have invariant quantities which can be identified as energy and enthalpy. The natural (infinite-dimensional) fluid algebra on co-exact 1-forms on a three-dimensional closed oriented Riemannian manifold leads to an Euler equation which is equivalent to the classical Euler equation which describes non-viscous fluid flow. In this paper, the recently introduced transverse intersection algebra associated to a cubic lattice of An-Lawrence-Sullivan is used to construct a finite-dimensional fluid algebra on a cubic lattice (with odd periods). The corresponding Euler equation is an ODE which it is proposed is a `good' discretisation of the continuum Euler equation. This paper contains all the explicit details necessary to implement numerically the corresponding Euler equation. Such an implementation has been carried out by our team and results are pending.</description>

      <title>Grassmannian Persistence Diagrams of 1-Parameter Filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the discriminative power of Grassmannian persistence diagrams of 1-parameter filtrations, examine their relationships with other related constructions, and study their computational aspects. Grassmannian persistence diagrams are defined through Orthogonal Inversion, a notion analogous to M\"obius inversion. We focus on the behavior of this inversion for the poset of segments of a linear poset. We demonstrate how Grassmannian persistence diagrams of 1-parameter filtrations are connected to persistent Laplacians via a variant of orthogonal inversion tailored for the reverse-inclusion order on the poset of segments. Additionally, we establish an explicit isomorphism between Grassmannian persistence diagrams and Harmonic Barcodes via a projection. Finally, we show that degree-0 Grassmannian persistence diagrams are equivalent to treegrams, a generalization of dendrograms. Consequently, we conclude that finite ultrametric spaces can be recovered from the degree-0 Grassmannian persistence diagram of their Vietoris-Rips filtrations.</description>

      <title>Positive 3-braids, Khovanov homology and Garside theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Khovanov homology is a powerful invariant of oriented links that categorifies the Jones polynomial. Nevertheless, computing Khovanov homology of a given link remains challenging in general with current techniques. In this work we focus on links that are the closure of positive 3-braids. Starting with a classification of conjugacy classes of 3-braids arising from the Garside structure of braid groups, we compute, for any closed positive 3-braid, the first four columns (homological degree) and the three lowest rows (quantum degree) of the associated Khovanov homology table. Moreover, the number of rows and columns we can describe increases with the infimum of the positive braid (a Garside theoretical notion). We will show how to increase the infimum of a 3-braid to its maximal possible value by a conjugation, maximizing the number of cells in the Khovanov homology of its closure that can be determined, and show that this can be done in linear time.</description>

      <title>An $A_\infty$-version of the Eilenberg-Moore theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an $A_\infty$-structure on the two-sided bar construction involving homotopy Gerstenhaber algebras (hgas). It extends the non-associative product defined by Carlson and the author and generalizes the dga structure on the one-sided bar construction due to Kadeishvili-Saneblidze. As a consequence, the multiplicative cohomology isomorphism from the Eilenberg-Moore theorem is promoted to a quasi-isomorphism of $A_\infty$-algebras.
  We also show that the resulting product on the differential torsion product involving cochain algebras agrees with the one defined by Eilenberg-Moore and Smith, for all triples of spaces. This is a consequence of the following result, which is of independent interest: The strongly homotopy commutative (shc) structure on cochains inductively constructed by Gugenheim-Munkholm agrees with the one previously defined by the author for all hgas.</description>

      <title>Homotopy coherent companionships and conjunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that companionships and conjunctions in double $\infty$-categories -- and more generally, in double Segal spaces -- extend to functors out of the free-living companionship and conjunction respectively. Specifically, we prove that these extensions are (homotopically) unique: the corresponding spaces of extensions are contractible under suitable completeness assumptions. The developed theory is then put to use to give a characterization of companions and conjoints in functor double Segal spaces in terms of so-called companionable and conjointable 2-cells. We end with an application of our results to $(\infty,2)$-category theory.</description>

      <title>Topological Approach for Data Assimilation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many dynamical systems are difficult or impossible to model using high fidelity physics based models. Consequently, researchers are relying more on data driven models to make predictions and forecasts. Based on limited training data, machine learning models often deviate from the true system states over time and need to be continually updated as new measurements are taken using data assimilation. Classical data assimilation algorithms typically require knowledge of the measurement noise statistics which may be unknown. In this paper, we introduce a new data assimilation algorithm with a foundation in topological data analysis. By leveraging the differentiability of functions of persistence, gradient descent optimization is used to minimize topological differences between measurements and forecast predictions by tuning data driven model coefficients without using noise information from the measurements. We describe the method and focus on its capabilities performance using the chaotic Lorenz 63 system as an example and we also show that the method works on a higher dimensional example with the Lorenz 96 system.</description>
