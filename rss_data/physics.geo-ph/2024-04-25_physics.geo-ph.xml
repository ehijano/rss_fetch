      <title>Site-Specific Ground Motion Generative Model for Crustal Earthquakes in Japan Based on Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a site-specific ground-motion model (GMM) for crustal earthquakes in Japan that can directly model the probability distribution of ground motion acceleration time histories based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). The proposed model can generate ground motions conditioned on moment magnitude, rupture distance, and detailed site conditions defined by the average shear-wave velocity in the top 5 m, 10 m, and 20 m ($V_{\mathrm{S}5}$, $V_{\mathrm{S}10}$, $V_{\mathrm{S}20}$) and the depth to shear-wave velocities of 1.0 km/s and 1.4 km/s ($Z_{1.0}$, $Z_{1.4}$). We construct the neural networks based on styleGAN2 and introduce a novel neural network architecture to generate ground motions considering the effect of source, path, and such detailed site conditions. 5% damped spectral acceleration of ground motions generated by the proposed GMM is consistent with empirical GMMs in terms of magnitude and distance scaling. The proposed GMM can also generate ground motions accounting for the shear-wave velocity profiles of surface soil with different magnitudes and distances, and represent characteristic that are not explained solely by $V_{\mathrm{S}30}$.</description>

      <title>A positive answer on the existence of correlations between positive earthquake magnitude differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of patterns in space, time, and magnitude, which could potentially encode the subsequent earthquake magnitude, represents a significant challenge in earthquake forecasting. A pivotal aspect of this endeavor involves the search for correlations between earthquake magnitudes, a task greatly hindered by the incompleteness of instrumental catalogs. A novel strategy to address this challenge is provided by the groundbreaking observation by Van der Elst (Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth, 2021), that positive magnitude differences, under certain conditions, remain unaffected by incompleteness. In this letter we adopt this strategy which provides a clear and unambiguous proof regarding the existence of correlations between subsequent positive magnitude differences. Our results are consistent with a time-dependent b-value in the Gutenberg-Richter law, significantly enhancing existing models for seismic forecasting.</description>

      <title>Parts-per-billion Trace Element Detection in Anhydrous Minerals by Micro-scale Quantitative NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nominally anhydrous minerals (NAMs) composing Earth's and planetary rocks incorporate microscopic amounts of volatiles. However, volatile distribution in NAMs and their effect on physical properties of rocks remain controversial. Thus, constraining trace volatile concentrations in NAMs is tantamount to our understanding of the evolution of rocky planets and planetesimals. Here, we present a novel approach of trace-element quantification using micro-scale Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This approach employs the principle of enhanced mass-sensitivity in NMR microcoils formerly used in \textit{in-situ} high pressure experiments. We were able to demonstrate that this method is in excellent agreement with standard methods across their respective detection capabilities. We show that by simultaneous detection of internal reference nuclei, the quantification sensitivity can be substantially increased, leading to quantifiable trace volatile element amounts of about $50$ wt-ppb measured in a micro-meter sized single anorthitic mineral grain, greatly enhancing detection capabilities of volatiles in geologically important systems.</description>

      <title>Modeling liquefaction-induced runout of a tailings dam using a hybrid finite element and material point method approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tailings dams impound large amounts of saturated soil which can be highly susceptible to liquefaction. Liquefaction results in a severe loss of strength in the retained soil and potentially failure of the dam. If the dam is breached, a massive debris flow of liquefied soil is then released with potentially disastrous consequences downstream. Numerical models are frequently utilized to predict the liquefaction response of tailings dams and the potential runout, and these analyses inform engineering decisions regarding hazard avoidance and mitigation. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is a widespread tool which excels at modeling liquefaction triggering and initial movements, but it quickly loses accuracy when modeling large deformations due to mesh distortion. Conversely, the Material Point Method (MPM), a hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian method, employs particles that move freely across a background grid and can account for large deformations without losing accuracy. However, issues with the accuracy of MPM's stress distributions and limits associated with the available boundary conditions impair its ability to predict liquefaction initiation. In this paper, we utilize a sequential hybridization of the FEM and MPM methods as a superior alternative to either individually. To demonstrate the efficacy of this hybrid method to simulate the entire process of tailings dam failures from initiation to runout, we model the 1978 Mochikoshi Tailings Dam failure.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI models for predicting liquefaction-induced lateral spreading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earthquake-induced liquefaction can cause substantial lateral spreading, posing threats to infrastructure. Machine learning (ML) can improve lateral spreading prediction models by capturing complex soil characteristics and site conditions. However, the "black box" nature of ML models can hinder their adoption in critical decision-making. This study addresses this limitation by using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to interpret an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) model for lateral spreading prediction, trained on data from the 2011 Christchurch Earthquake. SHAP analysis reveals the factors driving the model's predictions, enhancing transparency and allowing for comparison with established engineering knowledge. The results demonstrate that the XGB model successfully identifies the importance of soil characteristics derived from Cone Penetration Test (CPT) data in predicting lateral spreading, validating its alignment with domain understanding. This work highlights the value of explainable machine learning for reliable and informed decision-making in geotechnical engineering and hazard assessment.</description>

      <title>Host Stars and How Their Compositions Influence Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has become a common practice within the exoplanet field to say that "to know the star is to know the planet." The properties of the host star have a strong, direct influence on the interior and surface conditions of the orbiting planet and oftentimes measurements of planetary properties are made relative to the star's properties. Not only are observational measurements of the star necessary to determine even the most basic aspects of the planet (such as mass and radius), but the stellar environment influences how the planet evolves. Therefore, in this chapter, we begin by discussing the basics of stars, providing an overview of stellar formation, structure, photon and particle emissions, and evolution. Next, we go over the possible ways to determine the age of a star. We then outline how different kinds of stars are distributed within the Milky Way galaxy. Afterwards, we explain how to measure the composition of stars and the underlying math inherent to those observations, including caveats that are important when using the data for research applications. Finally, we explain the underlying physics and observations that enable stellar composition to be used as a proxy for planetary composition. In addition, given that this chapter focuses more on astronomy/astrophysics and uses a variety of important terms that may not be familiar to all readers, we have defined many terms either within the text or as a footnote for better interdisciplinary comprehension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets are formed inside disks around young stars. The gas, dust, and ice in these natal disks are the building materials of planets, and therefore their compositions fundamentally shape the final chemical compositions of planets. In this review, we summarize current observations of molecular lines in protoplanetary disks, from near-infrared to millimeter wavelengths. We discuss the basic types of chemical reactions in disks and the current development of chemical modeling. In particular, we highlight the progress made in understanding snowline locations, abundances of main carriers of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, and complex organic molecules in disks. Finally, we discuss efforts to trace planet formation history by combining the understanding of disk chemistry and planet formation processes.</description>

      <title>Meteorites and Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meteorites are a remarkable resource. They capture the imagination of people worldwide with their spectacular entry through Earth's atmosphere as fireballs, and their exotic character of being pieces of other worlds. Scientifically, they are critical to interpreting the early stages of formation of the Solar System, as well as the geological evolution of asteroids, the Moon, and Mars, and they are vital to understanding planetary formation processes. With the burgeoning exploration of extrasolar planetary systems, knowledge of the fundamental process of planetary growth from protoplanetary disks has taken on a new significance. Meteorites provide essential and detailed insight into the formation of planetary systems, although we must bear in mind that they only represent one reference point (our own Solar System) in what is clearly a wide spectrum of possible chemical and physical parameters governing the diverse realm of extrasolar planets. This chapter summarises the nature of our meteorite collections, and the ways in which meteorites contribute to our understanding of the formation and evolution of our own Solar System, with broader implications for planetary systems in general.</description>

      <title>The chemistry of extra-solar materials from white dwarf planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarf planetary systems provide a unique way to measure the bulk composition of exoplanetary material. Extrasolar asteroids/comets/moons which have survived the evolution of their host star can end up in the atmosphere of the white dwarf. Asteroids and boulders appear to be the most common pollutants, where we use the term "asteroids" to refer to the parent body that is polluting the atmosphere. The presence of the planetary material is detected via absorption lines of heavy elements. White dwarfs with these absorption features are called "polluted" white dwarfs. Polluted white dwarfs were expected to be rare objects because white dwarfs have high surface gravities, therefore, these heavy elements will settle out of the white dwarf's atmospheres in a short amount of time (Paquette et al. 1986). However, high-resolution spectroscopic surveys found that 25-50% of white dwarfs are polluted (Zuckerman et al. 2003, 2010; Koester et al. 2014). The mechanism responsible for making a polluted white dwarf must be common and efficient. There is strong theoretical and observational evidence that white dwarfs are accreting from planetary material. There are different mechanisms that can deliver exoplanetary material into the Roche lobe of the white dwarf. Debris disks, transits from disintegrating bodies, and intact planets have all been detected around white dwarfs (e.g., Jura et al. 2007; Vanderburg et al. 2015, 2020). This chapter will describe how the chemical autopsies are conducted, and what is learnt about exoplanetary material from polluted white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Mineralogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter begins with some basic concepts regarding the structure and mineralogy of rocky planets, how to read and construct ternary diagrams, and why partial melting occurs when plate tectonics is operative. Partial melting is a key concept in that it governs crust and core formation, which in turn control mineralogy. These sections are for astronomers, or geologists new to the study of igneous petrology. From there, computational approaches for estimating planetary mineral assemblages will be introduced. These quantitative methods are simple, consonant with the level of information currently available on exoplanet compositions, and while largely intended for mineralogists, should be accessible to non-specialists as well. Such methods are followed by a study of error when plotting mineral abundances in ternary diagrams, for mineralogists and petrologists who construct such diagrams. The chapter concludes with caveats, and the ways in which exoplanets might surprise us.</description>

      <title>From stars to diverse mantles, melts, crusts and atmospheres of rocky exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review is focused on describing the logic by which we make predictions of exoplanetary compositions and mineralogies, and how these processes could lead to compositional diversity among rocky exoplanets. We use these predictions to determine the sensitivity of present-day and future observations to detecting compositional differences between rocky exoplanets and the four terrestrial planets. First, we review data on stellar abundances and infer how changes in composition may manifest themselves in the expected bulk compositions of rocky exoplanets (section 2). Converting this information in mass-radius relationships requires calculation of the stable mineral assemblages at a given temperature-pressure-composition (T-P-X), an exercise we describe in section 3. Should the planet be hot enough to engender partial melting of the mantle, then these liquids are likely to rise to the surface and erupt to form planetary crusts; the possible compositional and mineralogical variability of which we examine in section 4. Finally, the expected spectroscopic responses of such crusts are examined in section 5.</description>

      <title>Some Tectonic Concepts Relevant to the Study of Rocky Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We'll examine plate tectonics on Earth -- its features and forces -- and examine some concepts that may allow astronomers to ask useful questions regarding numeric models that putatively predict tectonic activity. But exo-planetologists should be aware that geologists are still attempting to understand: why does Earth operates as it does, and so much differently than its neighbors? Has it always operated this way and have other planets of the inner Solar System ever mimicked Earth's behavior in their past? These problems are unsolved, though some interesting speculative notions have emerged. Studies by Foley et al. et al. (2012) and Weller and Lenardic (2018), for example, attempt to distill the essential planetary properties that may influence if not dictate possible tectonic states, while Yin et al. (2016) propose a model of planetary tectonic surface features that appears remarkably precise. These studies yield some compelling expedients for analyses of planetary objects both within and outside our Solar System.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetary magnetic fields are important indicators of planetary processes and evolution, from a planet's outer core to its surface (if it possesses one) to its atmosphere and near-space environment. Magnetic fields are most directly measured in situ, and determining whether distant planetary objects possess magnetic fields can be challenging. At present we have no unambiguous measurements of magnetic fields on exoplanets. Nevertheless, it would be surprising if at least some exoplanets did not generate a magnetic field, like many planetary bodies in the solar system. This chapter provides an overview of the current understanding of exoplanetary magnetic fields and their consequences. In the next section we review the current understanding of planetary dynamo generation as it applies to solar system objects and discuss the implications for exoplanetary magnetic field generation. Following this, we describe seven methods for determining the existence and strength of an exoplanetary magnetic field and discuss the near-term prospects for each method. We close by highlighting four main consequences of exoplanetary magnetic fields for a planet and its evolution.</description>

      <title>Transiting Exoplanet Atmospheres in the Era of JWST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of exoplanet atmospheric characterization has recently made considerable advances with the advent of high-resolution spectroscopy from large ground-based telescopes and the commissioning of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We have entered an era in which atmospheric compositions, aerosol properties, thermal structures, mass loss, and three-dimensional effects can be reliably constrained. While the challenges of remote sensing techniques imply that individual exoplanet atmospheres will likely never be characterized to the degree of detail that is possible for solar system bodies, exoplanets present an exciting opportunity to characterize a diverse array of worlds with properties that are not represented in our solar system. This review article summarizes the current state of exoplanet atmospheric studies for transiting planets. We focus on how observational results inform our understanding of exoplanet properties and ultimately address broad questions about planetary formation, evolution, and diversity. This review is meant to provide an overview of the exoplanet atmospheres field for planetary- and geo-scientists without astronomy backgrounds, and exoplanet specialists, alike. We give special attention to the first year of JWST data and recent results in high-resolution spectroscopy that have not been summarized by previous review articles.</description>

Abstract: This chapter reviews proposed exoplanet biosignatures, including their biological origins, observable features, atmospheric sinks, and potentially confounding abiotic sources. Emphasis is placed on material published since past comprehensive reviews while providing a foundational understanding of each named biosignature. Topics include possible gaseous biosignatures (e.g., O$_2$, O$_3$, CH$_4$, N$_2$O, DMS, CH$_3$Cl, C$_5$H$_8$, NH$_3$, PH$_3$), surface biosignatures (e.g., vegetation red edge, other pigment features, polarization signatures), and temporal biosignatures (e.g., atmospheric seasonality). Potential frameworks for assessing remote biosignatures are described. Text and table summaries provide references to relevant original research articles.</description>

Abstract: Planet Earth has evolved from an entirely anoxic planet with possibly a different tectonic regime to the oxygenated world with horizontal plate tectonics that we know today. For most of this time, Earth has been inhabited by a purely microbial biosphere albeit with seemingly increasing complexity over time. A rich record of this geobiological evolution over most of Earth's history provides insights into the remote detectability of microbial life under a variety of planetary conditions. We leverage Earth's geobiological record with the aim of a) illustrating the current state of knowledge and key knowledge gaps about the early Earth as a reference point in exoplanet science research; b) compiling biotic and abiotic mechanisms that controlled the evolution of the atmosphere over time; and c) reviewing current constraints on the detectability of Earth's early biosphere with state-of-the-art telescope technology. We highlight that life may have originated on a planet with a different tectonic regime and strong hydrothermal activity, and under these conditions, biogenic CH$_4$ gas was perhaps the most detectable atmospheric biosignature. Oxygenic photosynthesis, which is responsible for essentially all O$_2$ gas in the modern atmosphere, appears to have emerged concurrently with the establishment of modern plate tectonics and the continental crust, but O$_2$ accumulation to modern levels only occurred late in Earth's history, perhaps tied to the rise of land plants. Nutrient limitation in anoxic oceans, promoted by hydrothermal Fe = fluxes, may have limited biological productivity and O$_2$ production. N$_2$O is an alternative biosignature that was perhaps significant on the redox-stratified Proterozoic Earth. We conclude that the detectability of atmospheric biosignatures on Earth was not only dependent on biological evolution but also strongly controlled by the evolving tectonic context.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Geology: What can we learn from current and future observations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearly 30 years after the discovery of the first exoplanet around a main sequence star, thousands of planets have now been confirmed. These discoveries have completely revolutionized our understanding of planetary systems, revealing types of planets that do not exist in our solar system but are common in extrasolar systems, and a wide range of system architectures. Our solar system is clearly not the default for planetary systems. The community is now moving beyond basic characterization of exoplanets (mass, radius, and orbits) towards a deeper characterization of their atmospheres and even surfaces. With improved observational capabilities there is potential to now probe the geology of rocky exoplanets; this raises the possibility of an analogous revolution in our understanding of rocky planet evolution. However, characterizing the geology or geological processes occurring on rocky exoplanets is a major challenge, even with next generation telescopes. This chapter reviews what we may be able to accomplish with these efforts in the near-term and long-term. In the near-term, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revealing which rocky planets lose versus retain their atmospheres. This chapter discusses the implications of such discoveries, including how even planets with no or minimal atmospheres can still provide constraints on surface geology and long-term geological evolution. Longer-term possibilities are then reviewed, including whether the hypothesis of climate stabilization by the carbonate-silicate cycle can be tested by next generation telescopes. New modeling strategies sweeping through ranges of possibly evolutionary scenarios will be needed to use the current and future observations to constrain rocky exoplanet geology and evolution.</description>

      <title>Planet formation -- observational constraints, physical processes, and compositional patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of planet formation as a field of study is not only to provide the understanding of how planets come into existence. It is also an interdisciplinary bridge which links astronomy to geology and mineralogy. Recent observations of young stars accompanied by their protoplanetary disks (Manara et al. 2022) provide direct insights into the conditions at which planets are forming. These astronomical observations can be taken as initial conditions for the models of planet formation. In this chapter, we first give an brief overview of key observational constraints for planet formation theory derived from both the solar system and from the exoplanet population. We then review physical mechanisms governing planetary system formation and discuss how they can be put together to form global planet formation models. Finally, we discuss how the compositional links from protoplanetary disks to planetary atmospheres put novel constraints on planet formation theory. In particular, we are currently gaining insights into the composition of the inner, planet-forming region within the disks thanks to observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (Grant et al. 2023; Perotti et al. 2023). The task for planet formation modelling is then to link these observational properties and compositional content to the physical properties, and also the elementary inventory of meteorites, the Moon, Earth, and the other planets. If successful, this global approach can provide useful constraints for geological studies.</description>

      <title>Number of aftershocks in epidemic-type seismicity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18526v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $V_M,(m_0)$ be the number of m&gt;M aftershocks caused by $m_0$ event. We consider the $V_M,(m_0)$ distribution within epidemic-type seismicity models, ETAS(F). These models include the Gutenberg-Richter law for magnitude and Utsu law for average productivity of m0, but differ in the type of F distribution for the number v(m0) of direct aftershocks. The class of F is quite broad and includes both the Poisson distribution, which is the basis for the regular ETAS model, and its possible alternative, the Geometric distribution. Instead of the traditional threshold $M=m_0-\Delta$, we consider $M=m_a-\Delta$, where $m_a$ is the mode in the distribution of the strongest aftershock. Under these conditions we find the limit $V_M,(m_0)$ distribution at $m_0\gg1$. In the subcritical case, the limit distribution is extremely simple and identical to the $v(m_\Delta)$ distribution with a suitable magnitude $m=m_\Delta$. Theoretical results of this kind are lacking even for the regular ETAS model. Our results provide an additional opportunity to test the type of F-distribution, Bath law, and the very concept of epidemic-type clustering.</description>

      <title>Comparative analysis for the behavior of beryllium and magnesium crystals at ultrahigh pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper presents ab initio results on the structural phase stability of beryllium and magnesium crystals under high and ultrahigh pressures (multi-terapascal regime). Magnesium is shown to undergo a number of structural transformations which markedly reduce the crystal packing factor. As for beryllium, its high-pressure body-centered cubic phase remains stable even under ultrahigh pressures. Changes in the electronic structure of Be and Mg crystals under compression are analyzed and some interesting effects are revealed. Specifically, a narrow band gap appears in the electronic structure of magnesium under pressures above 2.5 TPa. For the metals of interest, PT-diagrams are constructed and compared with available experimental and theoretical results from other investigations.</description>

      <title>The evolution and delivery of rocky extra-solar materials to white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding stellar evolution and its effect on planetary systems is crucial for correctly interpreting the chemical constraints of exo-planetary material that can be given to us by white dwarfs. This article will describe how asteroids, moons, and comets, as well as boulders, pebbles and dust, evolve into eventual targets for chemical spectroscopy, and how planets and companion stars play a vital role in reshaping system architectures for this purpose.</description>
