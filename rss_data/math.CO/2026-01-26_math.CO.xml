      <title>Weyl groups and the Kostant game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a novel combinatorial framework at the intersection of Lie theory and algebraic combinatorics, based on a generalization of the Kostant game. We begin by reviewing the foundations of root systems, the classification of Dynkin diagrams, and the structure of Weyl groups. Subsequently, we analyze the original Kostant game as a tool for generating positive roots, demonstrating its unique termination on simply-laced diagrams and its role in an alternative classification thereof.
  The main contribution of this work -- which, to our knowledge, has not been studied before -- is a multi-vertex generalization of the game that allows for the simultaneous modification of multiple vertices of a Dynkin diagram. We prove that the resulting configurations of this new game establish a natural bijection with the elements of the quotient W/W_J of Weyl groups by parabolic subgroups. This formalism is applied to problems in algebraic geometry, specifically addressing cases of the Mukai conjecture via Hilbert polynomials, and is accompanied by a computational implementation in Java. These results offer new combinatorial perspectives for studying root counting problems, the regularity of reduced word languages, and the construction of Young Tableaux.</description>

      <title>A note on vertex-critical induced subgraphs of shift graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shift graphs, introduced by Erd\H{o}s and Hajnal in 1964, form one of the simplest known non-recursive constructions of triangle-free graphs with arbitrarily large chromatic number. In this note, we identify a suprising property: for each integer $k \geq 1$, the smallest $k$-chromatic shift graph contains a unique $k$-vertex-critical subgraph. We give an explicit description of this subgraph and prove its uniqueness. This provides a new and remarkably simple family of triangle-free vertex-critical graphs of arbitrarily large chromatic number.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Expressions for Symmetric Group Characters on Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{[CZ]}, Cohen and Zemel showed that for a partition $\lambda \vdash k$, the dimension of the irreducible representation of $S_{n}$ corresponding to the partition $(n-k,\lambda) \vdash n$ is a polynomial of degree $k$ in $n$, whose coefficients in the binomial basis count standard Young tableaux of shape $\lambda$ with special restrictions. In this paper, we generalize their results on the representation's dimension to character values on arbitrary cycles.</description>

      <title>Extremal eigenvalues of graphs embedded on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph theory on surfaces extends classical graph structures to topological surfaces, providing a theoretical foundation for characterizing the embedding properties of complex networks in constrained spaces. The study of bounding the spectral radius $\rho(G)$ of graphs on surfaces has a rich history that dates back to the 1990s. In this paper, we establish tight bounds for graphs of order $n$ that are embeddable on a surface with Euler genus $\gamma$. Specifically, if graph $G$ achieves the maximum spectral radius, then \begin{equation*} \begin{array}{ll} \frac32\!+\!\sqrt{2n\!-\!\frac{15}4}\!+\!\frac{3\gamma\!-\!1}{n}&lt;\rho(G)&lt;\frac32\!+\!\sqrt{2n\!-\!\frac{15}4}\!+\!\frac{3\gamma\!-\!0.95}{n}, \end{array} \end{equation*} which improves upon the earlier bound $\rho(G)\leq2+\sqrt{2n+8\gamma-6}$ by Ellingham and Zha [JCTB, 2000]. Furthermore, we prove that any extremal graph is obtained from $K_2 \nabla P_{n-2}$ by adding exactly $3\gamma$ edges, where `$\nabla$' means the join product. As a corollary, for $\gamma = 0$ and $n \geq 4.5 \times 10^6$, the graph $K_2 \nabla P_{n-2}$ is the unique planar extremal graph, thereby confirming a long-standing conjecture resolved by Tait and Tobin [JCTB, 2017].
  Let $K_r^n$ be the graph of order $n$ obtained by attaching two paths of nearly equal length to two distinct vertices of $K_r$. Integrating spectral techniques with considerable structural analysis on surface graphs, we further derive the following sharp bounds: $\rho(G) \leq \rho(K_2 \nabla K_4^{n-2})$ for projective-planar graphs, and $\rho(G) \leq \rho(K_2 \nabla K_5^{n-2})$ for toroidal graphs. Our study presents a novel framework for exploring the eigenvalue-extremal problem on surface graphs with high Euler genus.</description>

      <title>Card guessing after an asymmetric riffle shuffle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a card guessing game with complete feedback. An ordered deck of $n$ cards labeled $1$ up to $n$ is riffle-shuffled exactly one time. Given a value $p\in(0{,}1)\setminus\{\frac12\}$, the riffle shuffle is assumed to be unbalanced, such that the cut is expected to happen at position $p\cdot n$. The goal of the game is to maximize the number of correct guesses of the cards: one after another a single card is drawn from the top, and shown to the guesser until no cards remain. We provide a detailed analysis of the optimal guessing strategy and study the distribution of the number of correct guesses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Erd\H{o}s, S\'ark\"ozy, and S\'os studied the asymptotics of the maximum size of a subset of $\{1,2,\ldots, N\}$ such that it does not contain $k$ distinct elements whose product is a perfect square. More generally, Verstra\"ete proposed a conjecture regarding the asymptotic behavior of the same quantity with the set of perfect squares replaced by the value set of a polynomial in $\mathbb{Z}[x]$. In this paper, we study a finite field analogue of Verstra\"ete's conjecture.</description>

      <title>New Method for Constructing Complete Cap Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cap set in projective or affine geometry over a finite field is a set of points no three of which are collinear. In this paper, we propose a new construction for complete cap sets that yields a cap set of size 124928 in the affine geometry AG(15,3). It should be noted that the constructed cap set in AG(15,3) is more powerful and exceeds at least by 4096 points than those that can be obtained from the previously known ones using the product or doubling constructions.</description>

      <title>Distribution of independent sets in perfect $r$-ary trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the family of all independent sets of size $k$ containing a fixed vertex $v$ is called a star with centre $v$, and is denoted by $\mathcal{I}_G^k(v)$. Motivated by a generalisation of the Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado Theorem to the setting of independent sets in graphs, Hurlbert and Kamat conjectured that for every tree $T$ and every $k$, the maximum of $|\mathcal{I}_T^k(v)|$ can always be attained by a leaf of $T$. While this conjecture turns out to be false in general, it is known to hold for specific families of trees like spiders and caterpillars. In this paper, we prove that this conjecture holds for a new family of trees, the perfect $r$-ary trees, by constructing injections from stars centred at arbitrary vertices to stars centred at leaves. We also show that the analogous property holds for every forest $\mathcal{T}$ that is the disjoint union of perfect trees with possibly varying sizes and arities, and determine the leaf that maximises $|\mathcal{I}_{\mathcal{T}}^k(v)|$.</description>

Abstract: Introduced in [BB], simplicially stable spaces are alternative compactifications of $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ generalizing Hassett's moduli spaces of weighted stable curves. We give presentations of the Chow rings of these spaces in genus $0$ using techniques developed by the author in [New25]. When considering the special case of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}$, this gives a new proof of Keel's presentation of $\operatorname{CH}(\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n})$.</description>

Abstract: We construct an explicit isomorphism between the HOMFLY-PT homology of $(n,n+1)$ torus knots and the direct sum of hook isotypic components of the space of diagonal coinvariants. As a consequence, we compute the action of tautological classes in HOMFLY-PT homology of $(n,n+1)$ torus knots and prove that it extends to an action of the Lie algebra of Hamiltonian vector fields on the plane. We also compute the action of differentials $d_N$ in Rasmussen spectral sequences from HOMLFY-PT to $\mathfrak{gl}(N)$ homology of $(n,n+1)$ torus knots.</description>

      <title>Planar algebras for the Young graph and the Khovanov Heisenberg category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies planar algebras of Jones' style associated with the Young graph. We first see that, given a positive real valued function on the Young graph, we may obtain a planar algebra whose structure is defined in terms of a state sum over the ways of filling planar tangles with Young diagrams. We delve into the case that the function is harmonic and related to the Plancherel measures on Young diagrams. Along with an element that is depicted as a cross of two strings, we see that the defining relations among morphisms for the Khovanov Heisenberg category are recovered in the planar algebra. We also identify certain elements in the planar algebra with particular functions of Young diagrams that include the moments, Boolean cumulants and normalized characters. This paper thereby bridges diagramatical categorification and asymptotic representation theory. In fact, the Khovanov Heisenberg category is one of the most fundamental examples of diagramatical categorification whereas the harmonic functions on the Young graph have been a central object in the asymptotic representation theory of symmetric groups.</description>

Abstract: Given a class of (undirected) graphs $\mathcal{C}$, we say that a Feedback Arc Set (FAS for short) $F$ is a $\mathcal{C}$-FAS if the graph induced by the edges of $F$ (forgetting their orientations) belongs to $\mathcal{C}$. We show that deciding if a tournament has a $\mathcal{C}$-FAS is NP-complete when $\mathcal{C}$ is the class of all forests. We are motivated by connections between $\mathcal{C}$-FAS and structural parameters of tournaments, such as the dichromatic number, the clique number of tournaments, and the strong Erd\H{o}s-Hajnal property.</description>

      <title>A necessary and sufficient condition for $k$-transversals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve a long-standing open problem posed by Goodman \&amp; Pollack in 1988 by establishing a necessary and sufficient condition for a family of convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ to admit a $k$-transversal for any $0 \le k \le d-1$. This result is a common generalization of Helly's theorem ($k=0$) and the Goodman-Pollack-Wenger theorem ($k=d-1$). Additionally, we obtain an analogue in the complex setting by characterizing the existence of a complex $k$-transversal to a family of convex sets in $\mathbb{C}^d$, extending the work of McGinnis ($k=d-1$). Our approach is topological and employs a Borsuk-Ulam-type theorem on Stiefel manifolds. Finally, we demonstrate how our results imply the central transversal theorems of \v{Z}ivaljevi\'c-Vre\'cica and Dol'nikov in the real case and of Sadovek-Sober\'on in the complex case.</description>

      <title>Target Pebbling in Trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph pebbling is a game played on graphs with pebbles on their vertices. A pebbling move removes two pebbles from one vertex and places one pebble on an adjacent vertex. A configuration $C$ is a supply of pebbles at various vertices of a graph $G$, and a distribution $D$ is a demand of pebbles at various vertices of $G$. The $D$-pebbling number, $\pi(G, D)$, of a graph $G$ is defined to be the minimum number $m$ such that every configuration of $m$ pebbles can satisfy the demand $D$ via pebbling moves. The special case in which $t$ pebbles are demanded on vertex $v$ is denoted $D=v^t$, and the $t$-fold pebbling number, $\pi_{t}(G)$, equals $\max_{v\in G}\pi(G,v^t)$. It was conjectured by Alc\'on, Gutierrez, and Hurlbert that the pebbling numbers of chordal graphs forbidding the pyramid graph can be calculated in polynomial time. Trees, of course, are the most prominent of such graphs. In 1989, Chung determined $\pi_t(T)$ for all trees $T$. In this paper, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to compute the pebbling numbers $\pi(T,D)$ for all distributions $D$ on any tree $T$, and characterize maximum-size configurations that do not satisfy $D$.</description>

Abstract: A graph is perfectly divisible if for each of its induced subgraph $H$, $V(H)$ can be partitioned into $A$ and $B$ such that $H[A]$ is perfect and $\omega(H[B]) &lt; \omega(H)$. A graph $G$ is perfectly weight divisible if for every positive integral weight function on $V(G)$ and each of its induced subgraph $H$, $V(H)$ can be partitioned into $A$ and $B$ such that $H[A]$ is perfect and the maximum weight of a clique in $H[B]$ is smaller than the maximum weight of a clique in $H$. In this paper, we prove that the perfect divisibility of a graph is equivalent to its perfect weighted divisibility.</description>

Abstract: D-finite power series appear ubiquitously in combinatorics, number theory, and mathematical physics. They satisfy systems of linear partial differential equations whose solution spaces are finite-dimensional, which makes them enjoy a lot of nice properties. After attempts by others in the 1980s, Lipshitz was the first to prove that the class they form in the multivariate case is closed under the operation of diagonal. In particular, an earlier work by Gessel had addressed the D-finiteness of the diagonals of multivariate rational power series. In this paper, we give another proof of Gessel's result that fixes a gap in his original proof, while extending it to the full class of D-finite power series. We also provide a single exponential bound on the degree and order of the defining differential equation satisfied by the diagonal of a D-finite power series in terms of the degree and order of the input differential system.</description>

      <title>On lower bounds for the distances between APN functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whether two distinct APN functions can have a Hamming distance of $1$ remains an open problem. In 2020, L. Budaghyan et al. introduced a new CCZ-invariant $\Pi_F$ which can be used to provide lower bounds on the Hamming distance between a given APN function $F \colon \mathbb{F}_2^n \to \mathbb{F}_2^n$ and other APN functions. Lower bounds on the distance from an APN function $F$ to any other are known for almost bent (AB) functions and when $F$ is a 3-to-1 quadratic function with $n$ even. In this paper, we reinterpret $\Pi_F$ in terms of the exclude multiplicities of the graph $\mathcal{G}_F=\{(x, F(x)) : x \in \mathbb{F}_2^n\}$ of $F$ as a Sidon set. We establish lower bounds on the distance for even $n$ when $F$ is plateaued APN, generalize the known lower bounds for quadratic $3$-to-$1$ function to all 3-to-1 plateaued functions (e.g. Kasami functions), and derive new lower bounds for when $F$ is the APN inverse function over $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ for $n$ odd. We also study how the exclude multiplicities of $\mathcal{G}_F$ are directly connected to the existence of linear structures of $\gamma_F$ when $F$ is plateaued and APN and the ortho-derivative when $F$ is a quadratic APN function. We also use the CCZ-invariance of exclude multiplicities to prove that the Brinkmann-Leander-Edel-Pott function is not CCZ-equivalent to a plateaued function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Halin characterised the chordal locally finite graphs as those that admit a tree-decomposition into cliques. We show that these tree-decompositions can be chosen to be canonical, that is, so that they are invariant under all the graph's automorphisms. As an application, we show that a locally finite, connected graph $G$ is $r$-locally chordal (that is, its $r/2$-balls are chordal) if and only if the unique canonical graph-decomposition $\mathcal{H}_r(G)$ of $G$ which displays its $r$-global structure is into cliques. Our results also serve as tools for further characterisations of $r$-locally chordal graphs.</description>

      <title>Existence of K\"ahler algebras with Chow polynomials as Hilbert series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study Chow polynomials of weakly ranked posets and prove the existence of Gorenstein algebras with the K\"ahler package such that their Hilbert--Poincar\'e series agrees with the Chow polynomial. Our statement provides evidence in support of a conjecture by Ferroni, Matherne and the second author about the existence of an algebra for every weakly ranked poset that generalizes the Feichtner--Yuzvinsky Chow ring for matroids. This allows us to prove strong inequalities for the coefficients of Chow polynomials; we prove log-concavity for all posets of weak rank at most six and provide counterexamples to log-concavity for any higher rank. For ranked posets we recover an even stronger condition, showing that the differences between consecutive coefficients constitute a pure O-sequence.</description>

Abstract: The celebrated Mason's conjecture states that the sequence of independent set numbers of any matroid is log-concave, and even ultra log-concave. The strong form of Mason's conjecture was independently solved by Anari, Liu, Oveis Gharan and Vinzant, and by Br\"and\'en and Huh. The weak form of Mason's conjecture was also generalized to a polynomial version by Dowling in 1980 by considering certain polynomial analogue of independent set numbers. In this paper we completely solve Dowling's polynomial conjecture by using the theory of Lorentzian polynomials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a one-parameter family of binomial-convolution operators acting on sequences. These operators form an additive semigroup with an explicit inverse, and they subsume iterated classical binomial transforms as a special case. We describe the action in terms of ordinary and exponential generating functions, interpret the transform in the Riordan-array framework, and prove a general root-shift principle for constant-coefficient linear recurrences: applying the transform shifts the characteristic roots by a fixed amount. Several classical families (Fibonacci, Lucas, Pell, Jacobsthal, Mersenne) are treated uniformly as illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Sparse Hanson-Wright Inequalities with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15652v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive new Hanson-Wright-type inequalities tailored to the quadratic forms of random vectors with sparse independent components. Specifically, we consider cases where the components of the random vector are sparse $\alpha$-subexponential random variables with $\alpha&gt;0$. When $\alpha=\infty$, these inequalities can be seen as quadratic generalizations of the classical Bernstein and Bennett inequalities for sparse bounded random vectors. To establish this quadratic generalization, we also develop new Bernstein-type and Bennett-type inequalities for linear forms of sparse $\alpha$-subexponential random variables that go beyond the bounded case $(\alpha=\infty)$. Our proof relies on a novel combinatorial method for estimating the moments of both random linear forms and quadratic forms.
  We present two key applications of these new sparse Hanson-Wright inequalities: (1) A local law and complete eigenvector delocalization for sparse $\alpha$-subexponential Hermitian random matrices, generalizing the result of He et al. (2019) beyond sparse Bernoulli random matrices. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first local law and complete delocalization result for sparse $\alpha$-subexponential random matrices down to the near-optimal sparsity $p\geq \frac{\mathrm{polylog}(n)}{n}$ when $\alpha\in (0,2)$ as well as for unbounded sparse sub-gaussian random matrices down to the optimal sparsity $p\gtrsim \frac{\log n}{n}.$ (2) Concentration of the Euclidean norm for the linear transformation of a sparse $\alpha$-subexponential random vector, improving on the results of G{\"o}tze et al. (2021) for sparse sub-exponential random vectors.</description>

      <title>Complexity Gaps between Point and Interval Temporal Graphs for some Reachability Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal graphs arise when modeling interactions that evolve over time. They usually come in several flavors, depending on the number of parameters used to describe the temporal aspects of the interactions: time of appearance, duration, delay of transmission. In the point model, edges appear at specific points in time, whereas in the more general interval model, edges can be present over specific time intervals. In both models, the delay for traversing an edge can change with each edge appearance. When time is discrete, the two models are equivalent in the sense that the presence of an edge during an interval is equivalent to a sequence of point-in-time occurrences of the edge. However, this transformation can drastically change the size of the input and has implications for complexity. Indeed, we show a gap between the two models with respect to the complexity of the classical problem of computing a fastest temporal path from a source vertex to a target vertex, i.e. a path where edges can be traversed one after another in time and such that the total duration from source to target is minimized. It can be solved in near-linear time in the point model, while we show that the interval model requires quadratic time under classical assumptions of fine-grained complexity. With respect to linear time, our lower bound implies a factor of the number of vertices, while the best known algorithm has a factor of the number of underlying edges. We also show a similar complexity gap for computing a shortest temporal path, i.e. a temporal path with a minimum number of edges. Here our lower bound matches known upper bounds up to a logarithmic factor. Interestingly, we show that near-linear time for fastest temporal path computation is possible in the interval model when it is restricted to uniform delay zero, i.e., when traversing an edge is instantaneous. However, this special case is not exempt from our lower bound for shortest temporal path computation. These two results should be contrasted with the computation of a foremost temporal path, i.e., a temporal path that arrives as early as possible. It is well known that this computation can be solved in near-linear time in both models. We also show that there is no gap in testing the all-to-all temporal connectivity of a temporal graph. We demonstrate a quadratic lower bound that applies to both the interval and point models and aligns with the existing upper bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19368v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Onsager reciprocal relations model physical irreversible processes from complex systems. Recently, it has been shown that Onsager principles for master equations on finite states introduce a class of Riemannian metrics on the probability simplex, leading to probability manifolds or finite-state Wasserstein--2 spaces. In this paper, we study geometric calculations on probability manifolds, deriving the Levi-Civita connection, gradient, Hessian operators of energies, parallel transport, and calculating both the Riemannian and sectional curvatures. We present two examples of geometric quantities in probability manifolds. One example is the Levi-Civita connection from the chemical monomolecular triangle reaction. The other example is the sectional, Ricci, and scalar curvatures in Wasserstein space on a three-point lattice graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct automata with input(s) in base $k$ recognizing some basic relations and study their number of states. We also consider some basic operations on $k$-automatic sequences and discuss their state complexity. We find a relationship between subword complexity of the interior sequence $(h'(i))_{i \geq 0}$ and state complexity of the linear subsequence $(h(ni+c))_{i \geq 0}$. We resolve a recent question of Zantema and Bosma about linear subsequences of $k$-automatic sequences with input in most-significant-digit-first format. We also discuss the state complexity and runtime complexity of using a reasonable interpretation of B\"uchi arithmetic to actually construct some of the studied automata recognizing relations or carrying out operations on automatic sequences.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of monadically dependent tree-ordered weakly sparse structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A class of structures is monadically dependent if one cannot interpret all graphs in colored expansions from the class using a fixed first-order formula. A tree-ordered $\sigma$-structure is the expansion of a $\sigma$-structure with a tree-order. A tree-ordered $\sigma$-structure is weakly sparse if the Gaifman graph of its $\sigma$-reduct excludes some biclique (of a given fixed size) as a subgraph. Tree-ordered weakly sparse graphs are commonly used as tree-models (for example for classes with bounded shrubdepth, structurally bounded expansion, bounded cliquewidth, or bounded twin-width), motivating their study on their own. In this paper, we consider several constructions on tree-ordered structures, such as tree-ordered variants of the Gaifman graph and of the incidence graph, induced and non-induced tree-ordered minors, and generalized fundamental graphs. We provide characterizations of monadically dependent classes of tree-ordered weakly sparse $\sigma$-structures based on each of these constructions, some of them establishing unexpected bridges with sparsity theory. As an application, we prove that a class of tree-ordered weakly sparse structures is monadically dependent if and only if its sparsification is nowhere-dense. Moreover, the sparsification transduction translates boundedness of clique-width and linear clique-width into boundedness of tree-width and path-width. We also prove that first-order model checking is not fixed parameter tractable on independent hereditary classes of tree-ordered weakly sparse graphs (assuming $\mathsf{AW}[*]\neq \mathsf{FPT}$) and give what we believe is the first model-theoretical characterization of classes of graphs excluding a minor, thus opening a new perspective of structural graph theory.</description>
