      <title>A Comprehensive Survey on Generative AI for Video-to-Music Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The burgeoning growth of video-to-music generation can be attributed to the ascendancy of multimodal generative models. However, there is a lack of literature that comprehensively combs through the work in this field. To fill this gap, this paper presents a comprehensive review of video-to-music generation using deep generative AI techniques, focusing on three key components: visual feature extraction, music generation frameworks, and conditioning mechanisms. We categorize existing approaches based on their designs for each component, clarifying the roles of different strategies. Preceding this, we provide a fine-grained classification of video and music modalities, illustrating how different categories influence the design of components within the generation pipelines. Furthermore, we summarize available multimodal datasets and evaluation metrics while highlighting ongoing challenges in the field.</description>

      <title>SEA: Low-Resource Safety Alignment for Multimodal Large Language Models via Synthetic Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have serious security vulnerabilities.While safety alignment using multimodal datasets consisting of text and data of additional modalities can effectively enhance MLLM's security, it is costly to construct these datasets. Existing low-resource security alignment methods, including textual alignment, have been found to struggle with the security risks posed by additional modalities. To address this, we propose Synthetic Embedding augmented safety Alignment (SEA), which optimizes embeddings of additional modality through gradient updates to expand textual datasets. This enables multimodal safety alignment training even when only textual data is available. Extensive experiments on image, video, and audio-based MLLMs demonstrate that SEA can synthesize a high-quality embedding on a single RTX3090 GPU within 24 seconds. SEA significantly improves the security of MLLMs when faced with threats from additional modalities. To assess the security risks introduced by video and audio, we also introduced a new benchmark called VA-SafetyBench. High attack success rates across multiple MLLMs validate its challenge. Our code and data will be available at https://github.com/ZeroNLP/SEA.</description>

      <title>DeepResonance: Enhancing Multimodal Music Understanding via Music-centric Multi-way Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in music large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved music understanding tasks, which involve the model's ability to analyze and interpret various musical elements. These improvements primarily focused on integrating both music and text inputs. However, the potential of incorporating additional modalities such as images, videos and textual music features to enhance music understanding remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose DeepResonance, a multimodal music understanding LLM fine-tuned via multi-way instruction tuning with multi-way aligned music, text, image, and video data. To this end, we construct Music4way-MI2T, Music4way-MV2T, and Music4way-Any2T, three 4-way training and evaluation datasets designed to enable DeepResonance to integrate both visual and textual music feature content. We also introduce multi-sampled ImageBind embeddings and a pre-alignment Transformer to enhance modality fusion prior to input into text LLMs, tailoring DeepResonance for multi-way instruction tuning. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performances across six music understanding tasks, highlighting the benefits of the auxiliary modalities and the structural superiority of DeepResonance. We plan to open-source the models and the newly constructed datasets.</description>

      <title>STEFANN: Scene Text Editor using Font Adaptive Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01192</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.01192v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Textual information in a captured scene plays an important role in scene interpretation and decision making. Though there exist methods that can successfully detect and interpret complex text regions present in a scene, to the best of our knowledge, there is no significant prior work that aims to modify the textual information in an image. The ability to edit text directly on images has several advantages including error correction, text restoration and image reusability. In this paper, we propose a method to modify text in an image at character-level. We approach the problem in two stages. At first, the unobserved character (target) is generated from an observed character (source) being modified. We propose two different neural network architectures - (a) FANnet to achieve structural consistency with source font and (b) Colornet to preserve source color. Next, we replace the source character with the generated character maintaining both geometric and visual consistency with neighboring characters. Our method works as a unified platform for modifying text in images. We present the effectiveness of our method on COCO-Text and ICDAR datasets both qualitatively and quantitatively.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Attention Guided Pose Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pose transfer refers to the probabilistic image generation of a person with a previously unseen novel pose from another image of that person having a different pose. Due to potential academic and commercial applications, this problem is extensively studied in recent years. Among the various approaches to the problem, attention guided progressive generation is shown to produce state-of-the-art results in most cases. In this paper, we present an improved network architecture for pose transfer by introducing attention links at every resolution level of the encoder and decoder. By utilizing such dense multi-scale attention guided approach, we are able to achieve significant improvement over the existing methods both visually and analytically. We conclude our findings with extensive qualitative and quantitative comparisons against several existing methods on the DeepFashion dataset.</description>

      <title>Scene Aware Person Image Generation through Global Contextual Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.02717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Person image generation is an intriguing yet challenging problem. However, this task becomes even more difficult under constrained situations. In this work, we propose a novel pipeline to generate and insert contextually relevant person images into an existing scene while preserving the global semantics. More specifically, we aim to insert a person such that the location, pose, and scale of the person being inserted blends in with the existing persons in the scene. Our method uses three individual networks in a sequential pipeline. At first, we predict the potential location and the skeletal structure of the new person by conditioning a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) on the existing human skeletons present in the scene. Next, the predicted skeleton is refined through a shallow linear network to achieve higher structural accuracy in the generated image. Finally, the target image is generated from the refined skeleton using another generative network conditioned on a given image of the target person. In our experiments, we achieve high-resolution photo-realistic generation results while preserving the general context of the scene. We conclude our paper with multiple qualitative and quantitative benchmarks on the results.</description>

      <title>TIPS: Text-Induced Pose Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In computer vision, human pose synthesis and transfer deal with probabilistic image generation of a person in a previously unseen pose from an already available observation of that person. Though researchers have recently proposed several methods to achieve this task, most of these techniques derive the target pose directly from the desired target image on a specific dataset, making the underlying process challenging to apply in real-world scenarios as the generation of the target image is the actual aim. In this paper, we first present the shortcomings of current pose transfer algorithms and then propose a novel text-based pose transfer technique to address those issues. We divide the problem into three independent stages: (a) text to pose representation, (b) pose refinement, and (c) pose rendering. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first attempts to develop a text-based pose transfer framework where we also introduce a new dataset DF-PASS, by adding descriptive pose annotations for the images of the DeepFashion dataset. The proposed method generates promising results with significant qualitative and quantitative scores in our experiments.</description>

      <title>Semantically Consistent Person Image Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven approach for context-aware person image generation. Specifically, we attempt to generate a person image such that the synthesized instance can blend into a complex scene. In our method, the position, scale, and appearance of the generated person are semantically conditioned on the existing persons in the scene. The proposed technique is divided into three sequential steps. At first, we employ a Pix2PixHD model to infer a coarse semantic mask that represents the new person's spatial location, scale, and potential pose. Next, we use a data-centric approach to select the closest representation from a precomputed cluster of fine semantic masks. Finally, we adopt a multi-scale, attention-guided architecture to transfer the appearance attributes from an exemplar image. The proposed strategy enables us to synthesize semantically coherent realistic persons that can blend into an existing scene without altering the global context. We conclude our findings with relevant qualitative and quantitative evaluations.</description>
