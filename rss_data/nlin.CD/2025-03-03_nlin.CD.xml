      <title>Anomalous correlators, negative frequencies and non-phase-invariant Hamiltonians in random waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a generic non-phase invariant Hamiltonian model that governs the dynamics of nonlinear dispersive waves. We give evidence that initial data characterized by random phases naturally evolve into phase correlations between positive and negative wavenumbers, leading to the emergence of non-zero anomalous correlators and negative frequencies. Using analytical techniques, we show that anomalous correlators develop on a timescale of $O(1/\epsilon)$, earlier than the kinetic timescale. Our theoretical predictions are validated through direct numerical simulations of the deterministic system.</description>

      <title>On the role of 5-wave resonances in the nonlinear dynamics of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the $(\alpha+\beta)$ Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou lattice (FPUT lattice, for short) for an arbitrary number $N$ of interacting particles, in regimes of small enough nonlinearity so that a Birkhoff-Gustavson type of normal form can be found using tools from wave-turbulence theory. Specifically, we obtain the so-called Zakharov equation for $4$-wave resonant interactions and its extension to $5$-wave resonant interactions by Krasitskii, but we introduce an important new feature: even the generic terms in these normal forms contain $resonant$ $interactions$ $only$, via a $unique$ canonical transformation. The resulting normal forms provide an approximation to the original FPUT lattice that possesses a significant number of exact quadratic conservation laws, beyond the quadratic part of the Hamiltonian. We call the new equations "exact-resonance evolution equations" and examine their properties: (i) Heisenberg representation's slow evolution allows us to implement numerical methods with large time steps to obtain relevant dynamical information, such as Lyapunov exponents. (ii) We introduce tests, such as convergence of the normal form transformation and truncation error verification, to successfully validate our exact-resonance evolution equations. (iii) The systematic construction of new quadratic invariants (via the resonant cluster matrix) allows us to use finite-time Lyapunov exponent calculations to quantify the level of nonlinearity at which the original FPUT lattice is well approximated by the exact-resonance evolution equations. We show numerical experiments in the case $N=9$, but the theory and numerical methods are valid for arbitrary values of $N$. We conclude that, when $3$ divides $N$, at small enough nonlinearity the FPUT lattice's dynamics and nontrivial hyperchaos are governed by $5$-wave resonant interactions.</description>

      <title>Noise induced extreme events in single Fitzhugh-Nagumo oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model serves as a fundamental neuronal model which is extensively studied across various dynamical scenarios, we explore the dynamics of a scalar FHN oscillator under the influence of white noise. Unlike previous studies, in which extreme events (EE) were observed solely in coupled FHN oscillators, we demonstrate that a single system can exhibit EE induced by noise. Perturbation of the deterministic model in its steady state by random fluctuations reveals the emergence of subthreshold/small-amplitude oscillations (SAO), eventually leading to rare and extreme large-amplitude oscillations (LAO), which become particularly evident at minimal noise intensities. We elucidate the route by which these EE emerge, confirming their occurrence through probability calculations of trajectories in phase space. Additionally, our investigation reveals bursting phenomena in the system, which are characterized by specific levels of noise amplitude and elucidated using inter-spike interval statistics. At higher noise amplitudes, frequent LAO production is observed and attributed to self-induced stochastic resonance. The emergence of EE is explained through the theory of large fluctuations, with the escape rates of trajectories estimated via both analytical and numerical approaches. This study is significant because it reveals EE and bursting phenomena in a single FHN oscillator, offering potential new insights into the dynamics of neuronal populations.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning of the Evolution Operator Enables Forecasting of Out-of-Training Dynamics in Chaotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a deep learning emulator for chaotic systems can forecast phenomena absent from training data. Using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky and beta-plane turbulence models, we evaluate the emulator through scenarios probing the fundamental phenomena of both systems: forecasting spontaneous relaminarisation, capturing initialisation of arbitrary chaotic states, zero-shot prediction of dynamics with parameter values outside of the training range, and characterisation of dynamical statistics from artificially restricted training datasets. Our results show that deep learning emulators can uncover emergent behaviours and rare events in complex systems by learning underlying mathematical rules, rather than merely mimicking observed patterns.</description>

      <title>Synchronization in the complexified Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider an $N$-oscillators complexified Kuramoto model. When the coupling strength $\lambda$ is strong, sufficient conditions for various types of synchronization are established for general $N \geq 2$. On the other hand, we analyze the case when the coupling strength is weak. For $N=2$, when the coupling strength is below a critical coupling strength $\lambda_c$, we show that periodic orbits emerge near each equilibrium point, and hence full phase-locking state exists. This phenomenon significantly differentiates the complexified Kuramoto model from the real Kuramoto system, as synchronization never occurs when $\lambda&lt;\lambda_c$ in the latter. For $N=3$, we demonstrate that if the natural frequencies are in arithmetic progression, non-trivial synchronization states can be achieved for certain initial conditions even when the coupling strength is weak. In particular, we characterize the critical coupling strength ($\lambda/\lambda_c = 0.85218915...$) such that a semistable equilibrium point in the real Kuramoto model bifurcates into a pair of stable and unstable equilibria, marking a new phenomenon in complexified Kuramoto models.</description>

      <title>Constructing Linear Operators Using Classical Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a methodology for generating linear operators that approximately represent nonlinear systems of perturbed ordinary differential equations. This is done through the application of classical perturbation theory via the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e expansion, followed by an extension of the space of configuration that guarantees the linear representation of the expanded system of differential equations. To ensure that such a linear representation exists, this paper uses polynomial basis functions. Pseudo-code describing the implementation of the proposed method is listed. The method is applied to the Duffing oscillator as well as to the J2 problem, with and without atmospheric drag, both analyzed using an osculating formulation. Additionally, conditions on the osculating Keplerian elements that produce low-eccentricity frozen orbits are presented, and a modification of the Lindstedt-Poincar\'e method is proposed to enable the generation of linear operators that dynamically adapt to changes in the frequency of the motion. Finally, the proposed method is compared with alternatives in the literature.</description>

      <title>A Fokker-Planck-Based Loss Function that Bridges Dynamics with Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have derived a novel loss function from the Fokker-Planck equation that links dynamical system models with their probability density functions, demonstrating its utility in model identification and density estimation. In the first application, we show that this loss function can enable the extraction of dynamical parameters from non-temporal datasets, including timestamp-free measurements from steady non-equilibrium systems such as noisy Lorenz systems and gene regulatory networks. In the second application, when coupled with a density estimator, this loss facilitates density estimation when the dynamic equations are known. For density estimation, we propose a density estimator that integrates a Gaussian Mixture Model with a normalizing flow model. It simultaneously estimates normalized density, energy, and score functions from both empirical data and dynamics. It is compatible with a variety of data-based training methodologies, including maximum likelihood and score matching. It features a latent space akin to a modern Hopfield network, where the inherent Hopfield energy effectively assigns low densities to sparsely populated data regions, addressing common challenges in neural density estimators. Additionally, this Hopfield-like energy enables direct and rapid data manipulation through the Concave-Convex Procedure (CCCP) rule, facilitating tasks such as denoising and clustering. Our work demonstrates a principled framework for leveraging the complex interdependencies between dynamics and density estimation, as illustrated through synthetic examples that clarify the underlying theoretical intuitions.</description>
