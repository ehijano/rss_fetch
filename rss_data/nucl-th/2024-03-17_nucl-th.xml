      <title>Effects of Finite Temperature and Pairing Correlations in Multi-$\Lambda$ Hypernuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The influence of finite temperatures and pairing correlations on the ground state properties of multi $\Lambda$- Ca, Sn and Pb hypernuclei is explored using finite temperature Hartree Fock Bogoliubov approach and contact pairing interaction. A critical temperature is predicted and is in agreement with the Bardeen Cooper Schrieffer relationship $k_B T_C^\Lambda \approx 0.5 \Delta^{T=0}_\Lambda$, beyond which pairing correlations drop to zero. Particle densities, $\Lambda$ single particle energies, and nuclear radii are weakly impacted by pairing as well as by finite temperatures. However, other nuclear properties which are more sensitive to pairing correlations, such as $\Lambda$ pairing gaps, condensation energies, and abnormal densities are also more impacted by finite temperature, especially around the critical temperature. Furthermore, calculations show the occurrence of the pairing re-entrance effect in the $^{280}_{70\Lambda}$Pb hyperon drip line hypernucleus. Our study provides insight into the thermal evolution of $\Lambda$ pairing, i.e. the emergence and vanishing of pairing correlations in multi $\Lambda$ hypernuclei as a function of temperature.</description>

      <title>Role of magnetic fields on the outer crust in a magnetar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the properties of 4110 nuclides from Z = 5 to Z = 82 with the Sky3D code and the composition of the outer crust in the magnetars under extreme magnetic fields. The effects of the variation of the nuclear masses due to the magnetic fields on the outer crust are comprehensively studied. The neutron-drip transition pressure, the equation of state and neutron fraction in the outer crust have also been discussed.</description>

      <title>Low-energy theorems for neutron-proton scattering in $\chi$EFT using a perturbative power counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-energy theorems (LETs) for effective-range parameters in nucleon-nucleon scattering encode properties of the long-range part of the nuclear force. We compute LETs for \textit{S}-wave neutron-proton scattering using chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT) with a modified version of Weinberg power counting. Corrections to the leading order amplitude are included in distorted-wave perturbation theory and we include contributions up to the third order in the power counting. We find that LETs in the $^3S_1$ partial wave agree excellently with the empirical effective-range parameters while LETs in the $^1S_0$ partial wave show a fairly good agreement. At the same time, phase shifts up to laboratory scattering energies of about 100 MeV can be reproduced. The contributions from two-pion exchange do not improve the LETs in the $^1S_0$ partial wave, and a noticeable dependence on the employed momentum space cutoff emerges in the $^3S_1$ partial wave for cutoffs smaller than 750 MeV. The results show that empirical effective-range parameters and phase shifts can be reproduced simultaneously in the employed power counting and that LETs might be useful when inferring low-energy constants in power countings where corrections are added perturbatively.</description>

      <title>Triplet-odd pairing in finite nuclear systems: Even-even singly closed nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02617v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: The appearance of the pairing condensate is an essential feature of many-fermion systems. There are two possible types of pairing: spin-singlet and spin-triplet. However, an open question remains as to whether the spin-triplet pairing condensate emerges in finite nuclei. Purpose: The aim of this work is to examine the coexistence of the spin-singlet and spin-triplet like-particle pairing condensates in nuclei. We also discuss the dependence on the type of pairing functional. Method: The Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov calculations with a Skyrme $+$ local-pair energy-density functional (EDF) are performed to investigate the pairing condensate in the spherical ground states of Ca and Sn isotopes. Results: The spin-singlet pair EDF induces not only the spin-singlet but also the spin-triplet pairing condensates due to a strong spin-orbit splitting. By discarding the spin-orbit EDF, only the spin-singlet pairing condensate appears. The spin-triplet pair EDF, however, induces the spin-orbit splitting and accordingly the spin-singlet pairing condensate. Conclusions: The spin-orbit splitting plays an essential role in the coexistence of the spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing condensates in nuclei.</description>

      <title>Pauli resonance states in light nuclei: how they appear and how they can be eliminated</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16373v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Systematic analysis of parameters and properties of the Pauli resonance states are performed for light nuclei $^{6}$Li, $^{7}$Li, $^{8}$Be, $^{9}$Be and $^{10}$B, which are treated as two-cluster systems. The Pauli resonance states are redundant solutions of the resonating group method appearing when one try use more advanced description of the internal structure of interacting clusters. Our calculations are performed in a standard and advanced versions of the resonating group method. The standard version employs wave functions of many-particle shell model to describe internal motion of nucleons within each cluster. The advanced version is based on three-cluster resonating group method. As in the standard version, the internal wave functions of three clusters are approximated by wave functions of many-particle shell model model. However, in advanced version one of pair of clusters forms a bound state, and third cluster is considered to interact with such state. It is found that the Pauli resonance states in nuclei under consideration have energy between 11 and 46 MeV, and their widths vary from 8 keV to 6.7 MeV. Analysis of wave functions of Pauli resonance states and matrix elements of norm kernel allowed us to formulate an effective method for eliminating Pauli resonance states. It is demonstrated that this method effectively eliminate all determined the Pauli resonance states.</description>

      <title>Strong Gravity Extruding Peaks in Speed of Sound Profiles of Massive Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The speed of sound squared (SSS) $s^2$ in massive neutron stars (NSs) characterizes not only the stiffness of supradense neutron-rich matter within but also equivalently properties of the curved geometry due to the strong-field gravity and matter-geometry coupling. A peaked density or radius profile of $s^2$ has been predicted for massive NSs using various NS Equation of State (EOS) models. However, the nature, cause, location and size of the peak in $s^2$ profiles are still very EOS model dependent. In this work, we investigate systematically $s^2$ profiles in massive NSs in a new approach that is independent of the nuclear EOS model and without any presumption about the NS structure and/or composition. In terms of the small quantities (reduced radius, the energy density and pressure scaled by their central values), we perform double-element perturbative expansions in solving perturbatively the scaled Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff (TOV) equations and analyzing $s^2$ profiles from the Newtonian limit to the general relativistic (GR) case. The GR term in the TOV equations plays a twofold role: it compresses NS matter and modifies the pressure/energy density ratio from small values in Newtonian stars showing no $s^2$ peak to large ones for massive NSs possessing a peak in their $s^2$ profiles, and eventually takes away the peak in extremely compact/massive NSs approaching the causality limit. {In particular, the peaked behavior in $s^2$ is expected to emerge near the center of massive NSs like PSR J0740+6620, while a sharp phase transition is unlikely to occur there.} These features revealed from our analyses are universal as they are intrinsic properties of the GR stellar structure equations independent of the still very uncertain EOS of supradense neutron-rich matter in NSs.</description>

      <title>Exploring the compactness of $\alpha$ cluster in the $^{16}$O nuclei with relativistic $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15723v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probing the $\alpha$ cluster of $^{16}$O with the relativistic $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions has raised great interest in the heavy ion community. However, the effects of the $\alpha$ cluster on the soft hadron observables are largely different for these previous studies. In this paper, we explain the differences by the compactness of the $\alpha$ cluster in oxygen, using iEBE-VISHNU hydrodynamic simulations with different initial state $\alpha$ cluster configurations. We also find several observables, such as the intensive skewness of the $[p_{\rm T}]$ correlator $\Gamma_{p_{\rm T}}$, the harmonic flows $v_2\{2\}$, $v_2\{4\}$, $v_3\{2\}$, and the $v_n^2-\delta[p_{\rm T}]$ correlations $\rho(v_{2}^{2}, [p_{\rm T}])$, $\rho(v_{3}^{2}, [p_{\rm T}])$ in $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions are sensitive to the compactness of the $\alpha$ cluster in the colliding nuclei, which can be used to constrain the configurations of $^{16}$O in the future. Our study serves as an important step toward the quantitative exploration of the $\alpha$ cluster configuration in the light nuclei with relativistic heavy ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing fission-like events from deep-inelastic collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15224v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose two functions to distinguish fission-like events from quasi-elastic (QE) scattering and deep inelastic collisions (DIC), for a better analysis of the measured mass-total kinetic energy distributions of binary fragments formed in fusion-fission reactions. We note that the ratio of capture to DIC events evidently decreases with the decreasing of the depth of the capture pocket predicted from the Skyrme energy density functional, with which the capture pocket could be extracted from the measured mass-energy distributions. Together with the improved quantum molecular dynamics simulations, in which the typical contact time of the reaction partners is smaller than 200 fm/c for QE and is larger than 600 fm/c for fission-like events, we find that the ratio of capture to touching cross section systematically increases with the pocket depth.</description>

      <title>Full leading-order nuclear polarization in highly charged ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nuclear-polarization corrections to the energy levels of highly charged ions are systematically investigated to leading order in the fine-structure constant. To this end, the notion of effective photon propagators with nuclear-polarization insertions is employed, where the nuclear excitation spectrum is calculated by means of the Hartree-Fock-based random-phase approximation. The effective Skyrme force is used to describe the interaction between nucleons, and the model dependence is analyzed. To leading order, the formalism predicts two contributions given by the effective vacuum-polarization and self-energy diagrams. The existing ambiguity around the vacuum-polarization term is resolved by demonstrating that it is effectively absorbed in the standard finite-nuclear-size correction. The self-energy part is evaluated with the full electromagnetic electron-nucleus interaction taken into account, where the importance of the effects of the nuclear three-currents is emphasized.</description>
