      <title>Rigorous quantum calculations for atom-molecule chemical reactions in electric fields: from single to multiple partial wave regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient method for rigorous quantum calculations of cross sections for atom-molecule reactive scattering in the presence of a dc electric field. The wavefunction of the reaction complex is expanded in an overcomplete set of arrangement-dependent Fock-Delves hyperspherical basis functions and the interactions of the reactants and products with electric fields are accounted for in the total angular momentum representation. A significant computational challenge affecting our previously developed approach [Phys. Rev. Lett. $\mathbf{115}$, 023201 (2015)] is addressed by an efficient asymptotic frame transformation between the hyperspherical and Jacobi coordinates in the presence of an external field. Using accurate {\it ab initio} potential energy surfaces, we calculate total and state-resolved cross sections for the chemical reactions LiF$(v=1,j=0)$ + H $\to$ Li + HF($v'=0,j'$) and F + HD$(v=0,j=0)$ $\to$ HF + D, DF + H as functions of collision energy and electric field strength. The field dependence of the cross sections for the LiF + H chemical reaction exhibits resonance structure mediated by tunneling-driven interactions between reactants and products. No significant field effects are found for the F + HD $\to$ HF + D, DF + H chemical reaction at 1 Kelvin, even for state-resolved transitions and with field magnitudes reaching 200 kV/cm. Our calculations illustrate the essential role of basis set convergence for the proper interpretation of external field effects on chemical reaction dynamics. While reduced-basis calculations for the F + HD reaction indicate significant effects of electric fields on product state distributions, these effects vanish when the number of total angular momentum basis states is increased.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic properties of high-harmonic generation from molecular ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the existing framework of macroscopic HHG to combine it with high-accuracy ab initio calculations for molecules as microscopic input. This approach is applied to HHG spectra exhibiting Mollow sidebands, for open shell molecules undergoing nonadiabatic dynamics. We demonstrate the details of the method and analyze how the predicted features in the microscopic HHG response unambiguously survive macroscopic response calculations, and furthermore they exhibit a interesting angular pattern in the far-field. We calculate the macroscopic harmonic spectrum by combining many single-molecule calculations at different intensities, obtained in one case from time-dependent density functional theory calculations for N+ 2 , in second case for one electron time dependent Schr\"odinger equation for a 1D double well model potential. For both cases one can observe that the resulting macroscopic spectra exhibit Mollow sidebands of approximately the same intensity as the main harmonics, while being radiated at wider angles, meaning they could be isolated more easily in an experiment.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Free Precession NMR in the Presence of Heteronuclear Couplings and Decoupling: More Than Meets the Eye</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fourier Transform (FT) has been a mainstay of analytical 13C and 15N NMR. On the other hand it has been shown that Steady State Free Precession (SSFP) experiments which depart from this scheme can, under certain conditions, endow 13C and 15N small molecule NMR with comparable sensitivity and resolution. SSFP is one of the earliest and most widely used NMR pulse sequences, yet its analyses have focused on isolated spin-half ensembles such as water. The present study demonstrates that significant deviations from such isolated spin-half behavior may occur when SSFP is applied in the presence of spin-spin couplings. Even in the simplest case supporting such couplings, a single 13C J coupled to a 1H, departures from the isolated spin-half behavior arise in the 13C SSFP response, both in the absence and in the presence of 1H spin decoupling. In the former case deviations are produced by the differential relaxation of antiphase two-spin terms generated by the pulse train; in the latter case, magnified interferences may arise between the SSFP pulses and the coherent perturbation arising upon 1H decoupling. Although both phenomena are also known in FT NMR, the spectral distortions that they will originate may be much larger in the SSFP case, particularly if interpulse delays in large flip angle SSFP pulse trains resonate with the coupling perturbations. The origins of these effects are here analyzed for heteronuclear spin-half systems and corroborated with 13C NMR SSFP experiments recorded under different conditions. Additional considerations aimed at magnifying or suppressing these effects, as well as extensions to more complex scenarios, are also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Towards all-optical spin manipulation in single molecules: a refined region for locating a dark resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The on-demand manipulation of triplet states in closed-shell single molecules is still out of reach due to a lack of information about the energy of those triplet states. Yet, the access to triplet states would open up a route towards an all-optical single-molecule photonic switch/transistor and, moreover, would provide a way of performing coherent spin operations from the spin-less ground state. In this work, we take an important step towards those aims by measuring the triplet energy from the weak phosphorescence signal of perdeuterated perylene, embedded as a guest molecule in a dibenzothiophene host matrix, which well preserves the coherence properties of the perylene guest. We find that perylene's phosphorescence can be enhanced in this host matrix, when acting as an intermediary for the generation of triplet excitons. The triplet energy that we find can be used to significantly narrow down the search for the ultra-weak spin-forbidden transitions from the ground singlet to the triplet states of a single molecule.</description>

      <title>Production and spectroscopy of cold radioactive molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecules with heavy, radioactive nuclei promise extreme sensitivity to fundamental nuclear and particle physics. However, these nuclei are available in limited quantities, which challenges their use in precision measurements. Here we demonstrate the gas-phase synthesis, cryogenic cooling, and high-resolution laser spectroscopy of radium monohydroxide, monodeuteroxide, and monofluoride molecules ($^{226}$RaOH, $^{226}$RaOD, and $^{226}$RaF) in a tabletop apparatus by combining novel radioactive target production protocols, optically driven chemistry in a cryogenic buffer gas, and low-background spectroscopic detection methods. The molecules are cooled in the lab frame, creating conditions that are the same starting points as many current molecular precision measurement and quantum information experiments. This approach is readily applied to a wide range of species and establishes key capabilities for molecular quantum sensing of exotic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Warm, water-depleted rocky exoplanets with surface ionic liquids: A proposed class for planetary habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of thousands of exoplanets and the emergence of telescopes capable of exoplanet atmospheric characterization have intensified the search for habitable worlds. Due to selection biases, many exoplanets under study are planets deemed inhospitable because their surfaces are too warm to support liquid water. We propose that such planets could still support life through ionic liquids: Liquid salts with negligible vapor pressure that can persist on warm planets with thin atmospheres, where liquid water cannot. Ionic liquids have not previously been considered as naturally occurring substances, and thus have not been discussed in planetary science. We demonstrate in laboratory experiments that ionic liquids can form from planetary materials: Sulfuric acid combined with nitrogen-containing organic molecules. Sulfuric acid can be volcanic in origin, and organic compounds are commonly found on planetary bodies. The required planetary surface is water-depleted and must support sulfuric acid transiently in liquid phase to dissolve organics, followed by evaporation of excess liquid, conditions spanning approximately 300 K at 10^-7 atm to 350-470 K at 0.01 atm. Because ionic liquids have extremely low vapor pressures, they are not prone to evaporation, allowing small droplets or pools to persist without ocean-like reservoirs. Ionic liquids' minuscule vapor pressure at room temperature suggests possible stability on planets with negligible atmospheres, shielded by magnetic fields or rock crevices against harsh cosmic radiation. Ionic liquids can stably dissolve enzymes and other biomolecules, enabling biocatalysis and offering a plausible solvent for life, broadening the definition of habitable worlds.</description>

      <title>Bridging Quantum Mechanics to Organic Liquid Properties via a Universal Force Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential tools for unraveling atomistic insights into the structure and dynamics of condensed-phase systems. However, the universal and accurate prediction of macroscopic properties from ab initio calculations remains a significant challenge, often hindered by the trade-off between computational cost and simulation accuracy. Here, we present ByteFF-Pol, a graph neural network (GNN)-parameterized polarizable force field, trained exclusively on high-level quantum mechanics (QM) data. Leveraging physically-motivated force field forms and training strategies, ByteFF-Pol exhibits exceptional performance in predicting thermodynamic and transport properties for a wide range of small-molecule liquids and electrolytes, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) classical and machine learning force fields. The zero-shot prediction capability of ByteFF-Pol bridges the gap between microscopic QM calculations and macroscopic liquid properties, enabling the exploration of previously intractable chemical spaces. This advancement holds transformative potential for applications such as electrolyte design and custom-tailored solvent, representing a pivotal step toward data-driven materials discovery.</description>

      <title>Probing spin-motion coupling of two Rydberg atoms by a Stern-Gerlach-like experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement a protocol to measure the state-dependent motion of Rydberg atoms induced by dipole-dipole interactions. Our setup enables simultaneous readout of both the atomic internal state and position on a one-dimensional array of optical tweezers. We benchmark the protocol using two atoms in the same Rydberg state, which experience van der Waals repulsion, and measure velocities in agreement with theoretical predictions. When preparing the atoms in a different pair state, we observe an oscillatory dynamics that we attribute to the proximity of a macrodimer bound state. Finally, we perform a Stern-Gerlach-like experiment in which a superposition of the two previous pair states results in the separation of the atomic wavepacket into two macroscopically distinct trajectories, thereby demonstrating spin-motion coupling mediated by the interactions.</description>

      <title>A simple approach to rotationally invariant machine learning of avector quantity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13468v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unlike with the energy, which is a scalar property, machine learning (ML) predictions of vector or tensor properties poses the additional challenge of achieving proper invariance (covariance) with respect to molecular rotation. If the properties cannot be obtained by differentiation, other appropriate methods should be applied to retain the covariance. There have been several approaches suggested to properly treat this issue. For nonadiabatic couplings and polarizabilities, for example, it was possible to construct virtual quantities from which the above tensorial properties are obtained by differentiation and thus guarantee the covariance. Here we propose a simpler alternative technique, which does not require construction of auxiliary properties or application of special equivariant ML techniques. We suggest a three-step approach, using the molecular tensor of inertia. In the first step, the molecule is rotated using the eigenvectors of this tensor to its principal axes. In the second step, the ML procedure predicts the vector property relative to this orientation, based on a training set where all vector properties were in this same coordinate system. As third step, it remains to transform the ML estimate of the vector property back to the original orientation. This rotate-predict-rotate (RPR) procedure should thus guarantee proper covariance of a vector property and is trivially extensible also to tensors such as polarizability. The PRP procedure has an advantage that the accurate models can be trained very fast for thousands of molecular configurations which might be beneficial where many trainings are required (e.g., in active learning). We have implemented the RPR technique, using the MLatom and Newton-X programs for ML and MD and performed its assessment on the dipole moment along MD trajectories of 1,2-dichloroethane.</description>

      <title>Depth-resolved measurement of solvation entropy, interfacial transport and charge-transfer kinetics of practical lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the performance of electrochemical energy storage systems requires probing the electrochemical properties at each layer and interface during cell operation. While traditional onboard and operando methods can measure impedance, voltage, or capacity, they lack spatial resolution to pinpoint the properties to specific layers and interfaces. In this work, we describe an approach of using thermal waves to measure entropy change, transport resistance, and charge-transfer resistance with depth resolution of a few microns within an electrochemical cell. We achieve this by relating heat generation at multiple harmonics of an AC current to electrochemical processes and leveraging frequency dependence of thermal penetration depth for spatial resolution. We name this frequency domain spectroscopy of the thermal signatures of the electrochemical processes measured at multiple harmonics of the alternating current as Multi-harmonic ElectroThermal Spectroscopy (METS). This technique enables isolation and measurement of solvation entropy at individual electrode-electrolyte interfaces from the first harmonic (1{\omega}) thermal signature and resolution of the overall interfacial impedance into charge-transfer and interface transport resistance components from the second harmonic (2{\omega}) thermal signature. From this, we also demonstrate an operando measurement of the growth of the solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer at the lithium-electrolyte interface and show that two chemically similar electrodes can have significantly different interfacial transport resistance based on the preparation of the electrodes. Additionally, the method is not specific to lithium-ion chemistry and can therefore be generalized for all electrochemical systems of interest.</description>

      <title>Mixed Planewave and Localized Orbital Basis for Sparse-Stochastic Hybrid TDDFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a mixed basis-set approach to obtain optical absorption spectra within a generalized Kohn-Sham time-dependent density functional theory framework. All occupied valence molecular orbitals (MOs) are expanded in a plane-wave (PW) basis, while unoccupied MOs are derived primarily from localized atomic basis functions. The method accelerates spectral convergence when compared to fully PW-based simulations, with a $2-3$ fold reduction in the number of unoccupied MOs entering the Casida equation. The mixed-basis is placed on a common real-space grid, enabling our previously developed deterministic/sparse-stochastic evaluation of the exact exchange operator (J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2023, 19, 9239-9247). This chemically intuitive and computationally efficient approach is validated across various molecular systems, including $\pi$-conjugated polymethine dyes, aromatic hydrocarbons, and a chlorophyll monomer.</description>

      <title>Uni-Mol3: A Multi-Molecular Foundation Model for Advancing Organic Reaction Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Organic reaction, the foundation of modern chemical industry, is crucial for new material development and drug discovery. However, deciphering reaction mechanisms and modeling multi-molecular relationships remain formidable challenges due to the complexity of molecular dynamics. While several state-of-the-art models like Uni-Mol2 have revolutionized single-molecular representation learning, their extension to multi-molecular systems, where chemical reactions inherently occur, has been underexplored. This paper introduces Uni-Mol3, a novel deep learning framework that employs a hierarchical pipeline for multi-molecular reaction modeling. At its core, Uni-Mol3 adopts a multi-scale molecular tokenizer (Mol-Tokenizer) that encodes 3D structures of molecules and other features into discrete tokens, creating a 3D-aware molecular language. The framework innovatively combines two pre-training stages: molecular pre-training to learn the molecular grammars and reaction pre-training to capture fundamental reaction principles, forming a progressive learning paradigm from single- to multi-molecular systems. With prompt-aware downstream fine-tuning, Uni-Mol3 demonstrates exceptional performance in diverse organic reaction tasks and supports multi-task prediction with strong generalizability. Experimental results across 10 datasets spanning 4 downstream tasks show that Uni-Mol3 outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in modeling complex organic reactions. This work not only ushers in an alternative paradigm for multi-molecular computational modeling but also charts a course for intelligent organic reaction by bridging molecular representation with reaction mechanism understanding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beam deflection is capable of providing valuable information about the magnetic moments of molecules and clusters as well as the relaxation dynamics of their spins. However, observations have been hampered by magnetic couplings to excited vibrational and rotational states of polyatomic systems, which are challenging to control, characterize, and systematize. In this work, we carried out deflection measurements on superfluid helium nanodroplets doped with high-spin FeCl2 and CoCl2 molecules and their complexes. This enabled quantitative determination of the magnetic moments of molecules and clusters at extremely low, and fully defined, temperature of all of their degrees of freedom. The spin magnetic moments become thermalized and oriented along the applied field. Dimers and trimers are found to be antiferromagnetically ordered. The issue of rates and mechanisms of molecular spin relaxation within the cryogenic helium matrix is highlighted.</description>

Abstract: Entropy-stabilized oxides (ESOs), driven by high configurational entropy, have gained phenomenological research interest due to their potential for tailoring structure property relationships. However, the chemical short range ordering (SRO) and its interplay with local lattice distortion (LD) remain to be explored, although they could diminish the configurational entropy and potentially impact structure property relationships. A combination of experimental and theoretical approaches are employed to investigate the SRO and LD in the prototype ESO, Mg0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2Zn0.2O, generally referred to as J14. We demonstrate that the efficiency and accuracy of density functional theory (DFT) relaxed special quasirandom structures (SQS) enhances the analysis of the local structure of J14, unveiling the unique local cationic environments. Importantly, this joint experimental and computational approach sheds light on the understanding of local structure and structure property relationships in J14, demonstrating the necessity for further research into other high entropy and compositionally complex materials.</description>
