      <title>Pseudorandom bits for non-commutative programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain new explicit pseudorandom generators for several computational models involving groups. Our main results are as follows:
  1. We consider read-once group-products over a finite group $G$, i.e., tests of the form $\prod_{i=1}^n g_i^{x_i}$ where $g_i\in G$, a special case of read-once permutation branching programs. We give generators with optimal seed length $c_G \log(n/\varepsilon)$ over any $p$-group. The proof uses the small-bias plus noise paradigm, but derandomizes the noise to avoid the recursion in previous work. Our generator works when the bits are read in any order. Previously for any non-commutative group the best seed length was $\ge\log n\log(1/\varepsilon)$, even for a fixed order.
  2. We give a reduction that "lifts" suitable generators for group products over $G$ to a generator that fools width-$w$ block products, i.e., tests of the form $\prod g_i^{f_i}$ where the $f_i$ are arbitrary functions on disjoint blocks of $w$ bits. Block products generalize several previously studied classes. The reduction applies to groups that are mixing in a representation-theoretic sense that we identify.
  3. Combining (2) with (1) and other works we obtain new generators for block products over the quaternions or over any commutative group, with nearly optimal seed length. In particular, we obtain generators for read-once polynomials modulo any fixed $m$ with nearly optimal seed length. Previously this was known only for $m=2$.
  4. We give a new generator for products over "mixing groups." The construction departs from previous work and uses representation theory. For constant error, we obtain optimal seed length, improving on previous work (which applied to any group).
  This paper identifies a challenge in the area that is reminiscent of a roadblock in circuit complexity -- handling composite moduli -- and points to several classes of groups to be attacked next.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Responsibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ethics, individual responsibility is often defined through Frankfurt's principle of alternative possibilities. This definition is not adequate in a group decision-making setting because it often results in the lack of a responsible party or "responsibility gap''. One of the existing approaches to address this problem is to consider group responsibility. Another, recently proposed, approach is "higher-order'' responsibility. The paper considers the problem of deciding if higher-order responsibility up to degree $d$ is enough to close the responsibility gap. The main technical result is that this problem is $\Pi_{2d+1}$-complete.</description>

      <title>New aspects of quantum topological data analysis: Betti number estimation, and testing and tracking of homology and cohomology classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the application of quantum computation to topological data analysis (TDA) has received increasing attention. In particular, several quantum algorithms have been proposed for estimating (normalized) Betti numbers, a central challenge in TDA. However, it was recently proven that estimating Betti numbers is an NP-hard problem, revealing a complexity-theoretic limitation to achieving a generic quantum advantage for this task. Motivated by this limitation and inspired by previous progress, we explore broader quantum approaches to TDA. First, we consider scenarios in which a simplicial complex is specified in a more informative form, enabling alternative quantum algorithms to estimate Betti numbers and persistent Betti numbers. We then move beyond Betti numbers and study the problem of testing the homology class of a given cycle, as well as distinguishing between homology classes. We also introduce cohomological techniques for these problems, along with a quantum algorithm. We then discuss their potential use in the testing and tracking of homology classes, which can be useful for TDA applications. Our results show that, despite the hardness of general Betti number estimation, quantum algorithms can still offer speed-ups in structured settings.</description>

      <title>The Price of Being Partial: Complexity of Partial Generalized Dominating Set on Bounded-Treewidth Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $(\sigma, \rho)$-domination framework introduced by Telle [Nord. J. Comput.'94] captures many classical graph problems. For fixed sets $\sigma, \rho$ of non-negative integers, a $(\sigma,\rho)$-set of a graph $G$ is a set $S$ such that for every $v\in V(G)$, we have (1) if $v \in S$, then $|N(v) \cap S| \in \sigma$, and (2) if $v \not\in S$, then $|N(v) \cap S| \in \rho$. We initiate the study of a natural partial variant of the problem, in which the constraints given by $\sigma, \rho$ need not be fulfilled for all vertices, but we want to maximize the number of vertices that are happy in the sense that they satisfy (1) or (2) above. Given a graph $G$ and integers $k$ and $\ell$, the task of $(\sigma,\rho)$-MinParDomSet is to decide whether there is a set $S \subseteq V(G)$ of size at most $k$ such that at most $\ell$ vertices of the graph are not happy under $S$.
  We consider the problem on graphs of bounded treewidth for nonempty finite or simple cofinite sets $\sigma$ and $\rho$, and give matching upper and lower bounds for every such fixed $\sigma$ and $\rho$ (under the Primal Pathwidth Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis). Let $s_\sigma^\textsf{p} = \max \sigma + 1$ when $\sigma$ is finite, and $\min \sigma$ when $\sigma$ is simple cofinite; define $s_\rho^{\textsf{p}}$ similarly for $\rho$. We show that the problem $(\sigma,\rho)$-MinParDomSet (1) can be solved in time $(s_\sigma^\textsf{p} + s_\rho^{\textsf{p}} + 2)^{tw} \cdot |G|^{O(1)}$, when a tree decomposition of width $tw$ is provided together with the input, and (2) for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$, no algorithm can exist that solves the problem in time $(s_\sigma^\textsf{p} + s_\rho^{\textsf{p}} + 2 - \varepsilon)^{pw} \cdot |G|^{O(1)}$, even when a path decomposition of width $pw$ is provided together with the input.</description>

      <title>Black-Box Crypto is Useless for Pseudorandom Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A pseudorandom code is a keyed error-correction scheme with the property that any polynomial number of encodings appear random to any computationally bounded adversary. We show that the pseudorandomness of any code tolerating a constant rate of random errors cannot be based on black-box reductions to almost any generic cryptographic primitive: for instance, anything that can be built from random oracles, generic multilinear groups, and virtual black-box obfuscation. Our result is optimal, as Ghentiyala and Guruswami (2024) observed that pseudorandom codes tolerating any sub-constant rate of random errors exist using a black-box reduction from one-way functions.
  The key technical ingredient in our proof is the hypercontractivity theorem for Boolean functions, which we use to prove our impossibility in the random oracle model. It turns out that this easily extends to an impossibility in the presence of ``crypto oracles,'' a notion recently introduced -- and shown to be capable of implementing all the primitives mentioned above -- by Lin, Mook, and Wichs (EUROCRYPT 2025).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct sum theorems state that the cost of solving $k$ instances of a problem is at least $\Omega(k)$ times the cost of solving a single instance. We prove the first such results in the randomised parity decision tree model. We show that a direct sum theorem holds whenever (1) the lower bound for parity decision trees is proved using the discrepancy method; or (2) the lower bound is proved relative to a product distribution.</description>

      <title>Solving Multiagent Path Finding on Highly Centralized Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mutliagent Path Finding (MAPF) problem consists of identifying the trajectories that a set of agents should follow inside a given network in order to reach their desired destinations as soon as possible, but without colliding with each other. We aim to minimize the maximum time any agent takes to reach their goal, ensuring optimal path length. In this work, we complement a recent thread of results that aim to systematically study the algorithmic behavior of this problem, through the parameterized complexity point of view.
  First, we show that MAPF is NP-hard when the given network has a star-like topology (bounded vertex cover number) or is a tree with $11$ leaves. Both of these results fill important gaps in our understanding of the tractability of this problem that were left untreated in the recent work of [Fioravantes et al. Exact Algorithms and Lowerbounds for Multiagent Path Finding: Power of Treelike Topology. AAAI'24]. Nevertheless, our main contribution is an exact algorithm that scales well as the input grows (FPT) when the topology of the given network is highly centralized (bounded distance to clique). This parameter is significant as it mirrors real-world networks. In such environments, a bunch of central hubs (e.g., processing areas) are connected to only few peripheral nodes.</description>

      <title>Fast Compressed-Domain N-Point Discrete Fourier Transform: The "Twiddless" FFT Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present the \emph{twiddless fast Fourier transform (TFFT)}, a novel algorithm for computing the $N$-point discrete Fourier transform (DFT). The TFFT's divide strategy builds on recent results that decimate an $N$-point signal (by a factor of $p$) into an $N/p$-point compressed signal whose DFT readily yields $N/p$ coefficients of the original signal. However, existing compression-domain DFT analyses have been limited to computing only the even-indexed DFT coefficients. With TFFT, we overcome this limitation by efficiently computing both \emph{even- and odd-indexed} DFT coefficients in the compressed domain with $O(N \log N)$ complexity. TFFT introduces a new recursive decomposition of the DFT problem, wherein $N/2^i$ coefficients of the original input are computed at recursion level $i$, with no need for twiddle factor multiplications or butterfly structures. Additionally, TFFT generalizes the input length to $N = c \cdot 2^k$ (for $k \geq 0$ and non-power-of-two $c &gt; 0$), reducing the need for zero-padding and potentially improving efficiency and stability over classical FFTs. We believe TFFT represents a \emph{novel paradigm} for DFT computation, opening new directions for research in optimized implementations, hardware design, parallel computation, and sparse transforms.</description>

      <title>Robust Stackelberg Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14990v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a systematic study of the robust Stackelberg equilibrium (RSE), which naturally generalizes the widely adopted solution concept of the strong Stackelberg equilibrium (SSE). The RSE accounts for any possible up-to-$\delta$ suboptimal follower responses in Stackelberg games and is adopted to improve the robustness of the leader's strategy. While a few variants of robust Stackelberg equilibrium have been considered in previous literature, the RSE solution concept we consider is importantly different -- in some sense, it relaxes previously studied robust Stackelberg strategies and is applicable to much broader sources of uncertainties.
  We provide a thorough investigation of several fundamental properties of RSE, including its utility guarantees, algorithmics, and learnability. We first show that the RSE we defined always exists and thus is well-defined. Then we characterize how the leader's utility in RSE changes with the robustness level considered. On the algorithmic side, we show that, in sharp contrast to the tractability of computing an SSE, it is NP-hard to obtain a fully polynomial approximation scheme (FPTAS) for any constant robustness level. Nevertheless, we develop a quasi-polynomial approximation scheme (QPTAS) for RSE. Finally, we examine the learnability of the RSE in a natural learning scenario, where both players' utilities are not known in advance, and provide almost tight sample complexity results on learning the RSE. As a corollary of this result, we also obtain an algorithm for learning SSE, which strictly improves a key result of Bai et al. [2021] in terms of both utility guarantee and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Classifying Entanglement by Algebraic Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Entanglement is one of the key manifestations of quantum mechanics that separate the quantum realm from the classical one. Characterization of entanglement as a physical resource for quantum technology became of uppermost importance. While the entanglement of bipartite systems is already well understood, the ultimate goal to cope with the properties of entanglement of multipartite systems is still far from being realized. This dissertation covers characterization of multipartite entanglement using algebraic-geometric tools. Firstly, we establish an algorithm to classify multipartite entanglement by $k$-secant varieties of the Segre variety and $\ell$-multilinear ranks that are invariant under Stochastic Local Operations with Classical Communication (SLOCC). We present a fine-structure classification of multiqubit and tripartite entanglement based on this algorithm. Another fundamental problem in quantum information theory is entanglement transformation that is quite challenging regarding to multipartite systems. It is captivating that the proposed entanglement classification by algebraic geometry can be considered as a reference to study SLOCC and asymptotic SLOCC interconversions among different resources based on tensor rank and border rank, respectively. In this regard, we also introduce a new class of tensors that we call \emph{persistent tensors} and construct a lower bound for their tensor rank. We further cover SLOCC convertibility of multipartite systems considering several families of persistent tensors.</description>

      <title>Directed st-connectivity with few paths is in quantum logspace</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a $\mathsf{BQSPACE}(O(\log n))$-procedure to count $st$-paths on directed graphs for which we are promised that there are at most polynomially many paths starting in $s$ and polynomially many paths ending in $t$. For comparison, the best known classical upper bound in this case just to decide $st$-connectivity is $\mathsf{DSPACE}(O(\log^2 n/ \log \log n))$. The result establishes a new relationship between~$\mathsf{BQL}$ and unambiguity and fewness subclasses of $\mathsf{NL}$. Further, we also show how to \emph{recognize} directed graphs with at most polynomially many paths between any two nodes in $\mathsf{BQSPACE}(O(\log n))$. This yields the first natural candidate for a language separating $\mathsf{BQL}$ from $\mathsf{L}$ and~$\mathsf{BPL}$. Until now, all candidates potentially separating these classes were inherently promise problems.</description>

      <title>Algorithms and Hardness for Estimating Statistical Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10527v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the computational problem of determining statistical similarity between probability distributions. For distributions $P$ and $Q$ over a finite sample space, their statistical similarity is defined as $S_{\mathrm{stat}}(P, Q) := \sum_x \min(P(x), Q(x))$. Despite its fundamental nature as a measure of similarity between distributions, capturing essential concepts such as Bayes error in prediction and hypothesis testing, this computational problem has not been previously explored. Recent work on computing statistical distance has established that, somewhat surprisingly, even for the simple class of product distributions, exactly computing statistical similarity is $\#\mathsf{P}$-hard. This motivates the question of designing approximation algorithms for statistical similarity. Our first contribution is a Fully Polynomial-Time deterministic Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) for estimating statistical similarity between two product distributions. Furthermore, we also establish a complementary hardness result. In particular, we show that it is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard to estimate statistical similarity when $P$ and $Q$ are Bayes net distributions of in-degree $2$.</description>

      <title>Learning-Augmented Algorithms for Boolean Satisfiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning-augmented algorithms are a prominent recent development in beyond worst-case analysis. In this framework, a problem instance is provided with a prediction (``advice'') from a machine-learning oracle, which provides partial information about an optimal solution, and the goal is to design algorithms that leverage this advice to improve worst-case performance. We study the classic Boolean satisfiability (SAT) decision and optimization problems within this framework using two forms of advice. ``Subset advice" provides a random $\epsilon$ fraction of the variables from an optimal assignment, whereas ``label advice" provides noisy predictions for all variables in an optimal assignment.
  For the decision problem $k$-SAT, by using the subset advice we accelerate the exponential running time of the PPSZ family of algorithms due to Paturi, Pudlak, Saks and Zane, which currently represent the state of the art in the worst case. We accelerate the running time by a multiplicative factor of $2^{-c}$ in the base of the exponent, where $c$ is a function of $\epsilon$ and $k$. For the optimization problem, we show how to incorporate subset advice in a black-box fashion with any $\alpha$-approximation algorithm, improving the approximation ratio to $\alpha + (1 - \alpha)\epsilon$. Specifically, we achieve approximations of $0.94 + \Omega(\epsilon)$ for MAX-$2$-SAT, $7/8 + \Omega(\epsilon)$ for MAX-$3$-SAT, and $0.79 + \Omega(\epsilon)$ for MAX-SAT. Moreover, for label advice, we obtain near-optimal approximation for instances with large average degree, thereby generalizing recent results on MAX-CUT and MAX-$2$-LIN.</description>
