      <title>Understanding process-structure-property relation for elastoplastic behavior of polymer nanocomposites with agglomeration anomalies and gradient interphase percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For polymer nanocomposites disordered microstructural nature makes processing control and hence tailoring properties to desired values a challenge. Understanding process-structure-property relation can provide guidelines for process and constituents design. Our work explores nuances of PSP relation for polymer nanocomposites with attractive pairing between particles and polymer bulk. Past works have shown that particle functionalization can help tweak these interactions in attractive or repulsive directions and can produce slow or fast decay of stiffness properties in polymer nanocomposites. In absence of any nano or micro-scale local property measurement, we develop a material model that can represent decay for small strain elastoplastic properties in interfacial regions and simulate representative or statistical volume element behavior. The interfacial elastoplastic material model is devised by combining local stiffness and glass transition measurements that were obtained by previous researchers by atomic force microscopy and fluorescence microscopy. This is further combined with a microstructural design of experiments for agglomerated nanocomposite systems. Agglomerations are particle aggregations that are processing artefacts that result from lack of processing control. Twin screw extrusion process can reduce extent of aggregation in hot pressed samples via erosion or rupture depending on screw rpms and toque. We connect this process-structure relation to structure-property relation that emerges from our study. We discover that balancing between local stress concentration zone and interfacial property decay governs how fast yield stress can improve if we break down agglomeration via erosion. Rupture is relatively less effective in helping improve nanocomposite yield strength.</description>

      <title>How friction and adhesion affect the mechanics of deep penetration in soft solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanics of puncture and soft solid penetration is commonly explored with the assumption of frictionless contact between the needle (penetrator) and the specimen. This leads to the hypothesis of a constant penetration force. Experimental observations, however, report a linear increment of penetration force with needle tip depth. This force increment is due to friction and adhesion, and this paper provides its correlation with the properties of the cut material. Specifically, the force-depth slope depends on the rigidity and toughness of the soft material, the radius of the penetrator and the interfacial properties (friction and adhesion) between the two. We observe that adhesion prevails at relatively low toughness, while friction is dominant at high toughness. Finally, we compare our results with experiments and observe good agreement. Our model provides a valuable tool to predict the evolution of penetration force with depth and to measure the friction and adhesion characteristics at the needle-specimen interface from puncture experiments.</description>

      <title>Cutting Soft Matter: Scaling relations controlled by toughness, friction, and wear</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cutting mechanics of soft solids is gaining rapid attention thanks to its promising benefits in material characterization and other applications. However, a full understanding of the physical phenomena is still missing, and several questions remain outstanding. E.g.: How can we directly and reliably measure toughness from cutting experiments? What is the role of blade sharpness? In this paper, we explore the simple problem of wire cutting, where blade sharpness is only defined by the wire radius. Through finite element analysis, we obtain a simple scaling relation between the wire radius and the steady-state cutting force per unit sample thickness. The cutting force is independent of the wire radius if the latter is below a transition length, while larger radii produce a linear force-radius correlation. The minimum cutting force, for small radii, is given by cleavage toughness, i.e., the surface energy required to break covalent bonds in the crack plane. The force-radius slope is instead given by the wear shear strength in the material. Via cutting experiments on polyacrylamide gels, we find that the magnitude of shear strength is close to the work of fracture of the material, i.e., the critical strain energy density required to break a pristine sample in uniaxial tension. The work of fracture characterizes the toughening contribution from the fracture process zone (FPZ), which adds to cleavage toughness. Our study provides two important messages, that answer the above questions: Toughness can be estimated from wire-cutting experiments from the intercept of the force-radius linear correlation, as previously explored. However, as we discovered, this only estimates cleavage toughness. Additionally, the force-radius slope is correlated with the work of fracture, giving an estimation of the dissipative contributions from the FPZ.</description>

      <title>Migration of active particle in mixtures of rigid and flexible rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The migration of active particles in slowly moving, crowded, and heterogeneous media is fundamental to various biological processes and technological applications, such as cargo transport. In this study, we numerically investigate the dynamics of a single active particle in a medium composed of mixtures of rigid and flexible rings. We observe a non-monotonic dependence of diffusivity on the relative fraction of rigid to flexible rings, leading to the identification of an optimal composition for enhanced diffusion. This long-time non-monotonic diffusion, likely resulting from the different responses of the active particle to rigid and flexible rings, is coupled with transient short-time trapping. The probability distribution of trapping durations is well described by the extended entropic trap model. We further establish a universal relationship between particle activity and the optimal rigid-to-flexible ring ratio for diffusion, which aligns closely with our numerical results.</description>

      <title>Analysis of axisymmetric necking of a circular dielectric membrane based on a one-dimensional model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To facilitate the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the electric breakdown of dielectric elastomers, we derive a one-dimensional (1d) model for axisymmetric necking in a dielectric membrane subjected to equibiaxial stretching and an electric field, starting from the three-dimensional (3d) nonlinear electroelasticity theory. Our reduction is built on the variational asymptotic method, so that the resulting 1d model is asymptotically self-consistent. The 1d model offers an easier and more efficient way to analyze axisymmetric necking in a dielectric membrane in the linear, weakly nonlinear and fully nonlinear regimes. It delivers results identical to the 3d theory in the linear and weakly nonlinear regimes, and near-identical results in the fully nonlinear regime due to its asymptotic self-consistency. We demonstrate the straightforward implementation of this 1d model by solving it using the Rayleigh--Ritz method and validate it by comparison with finite-element simulations. The 1d model enables a precise calculation of the minimum thickness that a dielectric membrane can reach when necking instability occurs and quantitative assessment of the effects of imperfections so that the integrity of a dielectric elastomer actuator can be evaluated with respect to electric breakdown. The developed methodology is not problem-specific and can also be applied to analyze similar phenomena in other soft materials subjected to any fields (e.g., the axisymmetric necking of stretched plastic membranes).</description>

      <title>Deformation Measures for Granular Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper presents a micromechanical representation of deformation in 2D granular materials. The representation is a generalization of K. Bagi's work and is based upon the void-cell approach of M. Satake. The general representation applies to a material region partitioned into polygonal subregions. This representation possesses a certain consistency that allows for a unique assignment of the contribution that each contact displacement makes to the average deformation of an assembly. The paper addresses construction of the particle graph and appropriate data structures for use with the Discrete Element Method. The approach is applied in a numerical simulation of a two-dimensional assembly of disks. The author presents results of the distributions of deformation and particle-group rotation, with a resolution of about a single particle diameter. Deformation was very nonuniform, even at low strains. Micro-bands, thin linear zones of intense rotation, were also observed.</description>

      <title>Frictional Adhesive Contact of Multiferroic Coatings Based on the Hybrid Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the frictional adhesive contact of a rigid insulating sphere sliding past a multiferroic coating deposed onto a rigid substrate, based on the hybrid element method (HEM). The adhesion behavior is described based on the Maugis-Dugdale (MD) model. The adhesion-driven conjugate gradient method (AD-CGM) is employed to calculate the distribution of unknown pressures, while the discrete convolution-fast Fourier transform (DC-FFT) is utilized to compute the deformations, surface electric and magnetic potentials as well as the subsurface stresses, electric displacements, and magnetic inductions. We found that the coating thickness affect the contact stiffness and the interplay between friction and adhesion. More importantly, friction and gap-dependent MD adhesion affects elastic, electric, and magnetic behavior of the interface, breaking the symmetry between leading and trailing edges behaviors in all the investigated fields. Indeed, increasing the friction coefficient, the contact shape is no longer circular, the pressure distribution shifts towards the leading edge, the electric/magnetic surface potentials distributions sharpen at the leading edge, and the subsurface stress fields concentrates at the trailing edges.</description>

      <title>Dynamical renormalization group analysis of $O(n)$ model in steady shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the critical behavior of the $O(n)$ model under steady shear flow using a dynamical renormalization group (RG) method. Incorporating the strong anisotropy in scaling ansatz, which has been neglected in earlier RG analyses, we identify a new stable Gaussian fixed point. This fixed point reproduces the anisotropic scaling of static and dynamical critical exponents for both non-conserved (Model A) and conserved (Model B) order parameters. Notably, the upper critical dimensions are $d_{\text{up}} = 2$ for the non-conserved order parameter (Model A) and $d_{\text{up}} = 0$ for the conserved order parameter (Model B), implying that the mean-field critical exponents are observed even in both $d=2$ and $3$ dimensions. Furthermore, the scaling exponent of the order parameter is negative for all dimensions $d \geq 2$, indicating that shear flow stabilizes the long-range order associated with continuous symmetry breaking even in $d = 2$. In other words, the lower critical dimensions are $d_{\rm low} &lt; 2$ for both types of order parameters. This contrasts with equilibrium systems, where the Hohenberg -- Mermin -- Wagner theorem prohibits continuous symmetry breaking in $d = 2$.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Time irreversibility in systems observed at coarse resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A broken time-reversal symmetry, i.e. broken detailed balance, is central to non-equilibrium physics and is a prerequisite for life. However, it turns out to be quite challenging to unambiguously define and quantify time-reversal symmetry (and violations thereof) in practice, that is, from observations. Measurements on complex systems have a finite resolution and generally probe low-dimensional projections of the underlying dynamics, which are well known to introduce memory. In situations where many microscopic states become "lumped" onto the same observable "state" or when introducing "reaction coordinates" to reduce the dimensionality of data, signatures of a broken time-reversal symmetry in the microscopic dynamics become distorted or masked. In this perspective we highlight why in defining and discussing time-reversal symmetry, and quantifying its violations, the precise underlying assumptions on the microscopic dynamics, the coarse graining, and further reductions, are not a technical detail. These assumptions decide whether the conclusions that are drawn are physically sound or inconsistent. We summarize recent findings in the field and reflect upon key challenges.</description>

      <title>Frozen Cheerios effect: Particle-particle interaction induced by an advancing solidification front</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particles at liquid interfaces have the tendency to cluster due to capillary forces competing with gravitational buoyancy (i.e., normal to the distorted free surface). This is known as the Cheerios effect. Here we experimentally and theoretically study the interaction between two submerged particles near an advancing water-ice interface during the freezing process. Particles that are thermally more conductive than water are observed to attract each other and form clusters once frozen. We call this feature the frozen Cheerios effect, where interactions are driven by alterations to the direction of the experienced repelling force (i.e., normal to the distorted isotherm). On the other hand, particles less conductive than water separate, highlighting the importance of thermal conduction during freezing. Based on existing models for single particle trapping in ice, we develop an understanding of multiple particle interaction. We find that the overall efficacy of the particle-particle interaction critically depends on the solidification front velocity. Our theory explains why the thermal conductivity mismatch between the particles and water dictates the attractive/repulsive nature of the particle-particle interaction.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical materials with interconnected pores from capillary suspensions for bone tissue engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing demand for bone grafts due to the aging population has opened new opportunities for the manufacture of porous ceramics to assist in bone reconstruction. In our study, we investigate a new, promising method to manufacture hierarchically porous structures in a straightforward, and tuneable way. It consists of combining the novel technology of capillary suspensions, formed by mixing solid particles and two immiscible liquids, one less than 5 vol%, with freeze casting. We have successfully achieved alumina and $\beta$-TCP materials with both &lt;2 $\mu$m and 20-50 $\mu$m as the smallest and largest pore size, respectively. The microstructure exhibits fully open pores and high levels of porosity (&gt;60%). The capillary suspensions' rheological behaviour indicates that silica nano-suspensions as a secondary fluid creates a stronger internal particle network than sucrose for the alumina system. Conversely, the opposite was observed with the $\beta$-TCP system. These differences were attributed to the change in affinity between the secondary fluids and the solid loading. Our study, both systems has served to deepen the knowledge about the new area of capillary suspensions and proves their use in hierarchical porous scaffolds for bone tissue engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorial mechanical metamaterials are made of anisotropic, flexible blocks, such that multiple metamaterials may be constructed using a single block type, and the system's response strongly depends on the mutual orientations of the blocks within the lattice. We study a family of possible block types for the square, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Blocks that are centrally symmetric induce holographic order, such that mechanical compatibility (meaning that blocks do not impede each other's motion) implies bulk-boundary coupling. With them, one can design a compatible metamaterial that will deform in any desired texture only on part of its boundary. With blocks that break holographic order, we demonstrate how to design the deformation texture on the entire boundary. Correspondingly, the number of compatible holographic metamaterials scales exponentially with the boundary, while in non-holographic cases we show that it scales exponentially with the bulk.</description>

      <title>A unified-field theory of genome organization and gene regulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our aim is to predict how often genic and non-genic promoters fire within a cell. We first review a parsimonious pan-genomic model for genome organization and gene regulation, where transcription rate is determined by proximity in 3D space of promoters to clusters containing appropriate factors and RNA polymerases -- structures variously called transcription factories, hubs, and condensates. This model allows reconciliation of conflicting results indicating that regulatory mammalian networks are both simple (as over-expressing just 4 transcription factors switches cell state) and complex (as genome-wide association studies show phenotypes like cell type are determined by thousands of loci rarely encoding such factors). It also yields simple explanations of how mysterious motifs like quantitative trait loci, enhancers, and silencers work. We then present 3D polymer simulations, and a proximity formula based on our biological model that enables prediction of transcriptional activities of all promoters in three human cell types. This simple fitting-free formula contains just one variable (distance on the genetic map to the nearest active promoter), and we suggest it can be applied to any organism.</description>

      <title>Heat differentiated by projection from particles' trajectories onto the particle number-density field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many particles suspended in a solution have two analogous but distinct stochastic descriptions based on particle-tracking or on the number-density field. This article investigates the spatiotemporally discrete or continuous stochastic models, where we focus on differences in heat naturally defined between the particle-tracking and the number-density field. Both of the discrete and continuous descriptions are found to generally make the heat differences by the ideal-gas-like entropic term as a function of the number density though spatial projection from the particles' position onto the number-density field. The transformation from the Langevin to Dean--Kawasaki eqs. is considered as the projection in the continuous descriptions, which generally finds the heat differences formulated by the entropic term, but the emergent differences undergoes little temporal variations due to the sparse distributions of the point-particles. On the other hand, the analogous formalisms constructed in the discrete models may exhibit the explicit temporal evolutions of the entropic term. Notably, spatiotemporal resolutions are not altered in all the above projections. Furthermore, we develop arguments about the interpretation and applicability of the heat differences as well as the perspectives to many-polymer system.</description>

      <title>3D-Printed Hydraulic Fluidic Logic Circuitry for Soft Robots</title>

Abstract: The confluence of soft robotics and fluidic logic have sparked innovations in integrated robots with superior flexibility and potential machine intelligence. However, current fluidically driven soft robots suffer from either a large number of input controlling devices, or limited driving power. Here, we propose a hydraulic fluidic logic circuitry for liquid driven soft robots, leveraging 3D printing technologies. The fundamental building blocks of the system are hydraulic normally-on and normally-off logic gates, namely NOT and AND, along with a multi-connected channel structure functioning as OR. Using minimal-input design principles, the XOR gate can be simplified to only two valves, and used to construct a sensor-free error detector. The design principle can also be extended to full adders, as well as amplifiers, which can greatly improve the flow efficiency of the system. Additionally, taking advantage of the incompressible nature of liquid and optimized logic circuitry using the minimal-input design principle, we present a quadruped soft robot integrated with combinational fluidic logic, realizing bidirectional turtle-like locomotion, controlled by only two inputs. The robot is capable of walking under heavy load and performing controllable underwater locomotion. This hydraulic fluidic soft robotic system utilizes a small number of inputs to control multiple distinct outputs, and alters the internal state of the circuit solely based on external inputs, holding significant promises for the development of microfluidics, fluidic logic, and intricate internal systems of untethered soft robots with machine intelligence.</description>

      <title>Double Layer-Interlocked Crystals of Nitrogen-Rich Compounds under Zero-Pressure Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stabilizing nitrogen-rich compound crystals under conventional conditions is a key issue in the development and application of high-energy density materials (HEDMs). Herein, a two-dimensional double-layer interlocked Li4(N5)2 nitrogen-rich compound crystals, in which the two N5 rings are locked to by sharing four Li atoms, was found to maintain structural stability at zero pressure conditions. Dynamics studies reliably confirm crystal stability below 250 K. Furthermore, the stability of Li4(N5)2 crystal mainly arises from the ionic interaction between Li atoms and N5 rings, formed by the charge transfer from Li atoms to N5 rings. This study highlights the feasibility of stabilizing nitrogen-rich compound crystals under conventional conditions, paving the way for atomic level advancements in HEDMs.</description>
