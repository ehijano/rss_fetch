      <title>Two-Sided Fairness in Many-to-One Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a classic many-to-one matching setting, where participants need to be assigned to teams based on the preferences of both sides. Unlike most of the matching literature, we aim to provide fairness not only to participants, but also to teams using concepts from the literature of fair division. We present a polynomial-time algorithm that computes an allocation satisfying team-justified envy-freeness up to one participant, participant-justified envy-freeness, balancedness, Pareto optimality, and group-strategyproofness for participants, even in the possible presence of ties. Our algorithm generalizes both the Gale-Shapley algorithm from two-sided matching as well as the round-robin algorithm from fair division. We also discuss how our algorithm can be extended to accommodate quotas and incomplete preferences.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of equilibrium allocations in an economy with public goods and infinitely many commodities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the characterizations of equilibrium in economies with public projects. Public goods, as discussed by Mas-Colell (1980), are modeled as elements of an abstract set lacking a unified ordering structure. We introduce the concepts of cost share equilibrium for such economies, where the private commodity space is a (possibly nonseparable) Banach lattice. Within this framework, we present two distinct characterizations of cost share equilibria via the veto power of the grand coalition in economies featuring finitely many agents. The first characterization involves allocations that are Aubin non-dominated, while the second establishes that an allocation is a cost share equilibrium if and only if it cannot be dominated by the grand coalition, where domination is considered under specific perturbations of initial endowments.</description>

      <title>Tight Samurai Accountant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note applies tightness (Kattwinkel and Preusser (2025)) to the setting of Border and Sobel (1987, "Samurai Accountant: A Theory of Auditing and Plunder"). Border and Sobel characterize efficient mechanisms and argue that efficiency entails no loss of optimality. We characterize tight mechanisms and argue that tightness entails no loss of optimality. We show that tight mechanisms form a subset of efficient mechanisms. Therefore, tightness refines efficiency without loss of optimality. By characterizing tight mechanisms, one can replicate the insights from Border and Sobel (1987) and Chander and Wilde (1998). A novel insight is how and in which order the principal uses different instruments to provide incentives to different agent types. Further, we describe a procedure for constructing efficient mechanisms in a setting with a continuum of types.</description>

      <title>SIMPOL Model for Solving Continuous-Time Heterogeneous Agent Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents SIMPOL (Simplified Policy Iteration), a modular numerical framework for solving continuous-time heterogeneous agent models. The core economic problem, the optimization of consumption and savings under idiosyncratic uncertainty, is formulated as a coupled system of partial differential equations: a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the agent's optimal policy and a Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation for the stationary wealth distribution. SIMPOL addresses this system using Howard's policy iteration with an *upwind* finite difference scheme that guarantees stability. A distinctive contribution is a novel consumption policy post-processing module that imposes regularity through smoothing and a projection onto an economically plausible slope band, improving convergence and model behavior. The robustness and accuracy of SIMPOL are validated through a set of integrated diagnostics, including verification of contraction in the Wasserstein-2 metric and comparison with the analytical solution of the Merton model in the no-volatility case. The framework is shown to be not only computationally efficient but also to produce solutions consistent with economic and mathematical theory, offering a reliable tool for research in quantitative macroeconomics.</description>

      <title>Redistribution Through Market Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14174v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how to optimally segment monopolistic markets with a redistributive objective. We characterize optimal redistributive segmentations and show that they (i) induce the seller to price progressively, i.e., richer consumers pay higher prices than poorer ones, and (ii) may not maximize consumer surplus, instead granting extra profits to the monopolist. We further show that optimal redistributive segmentations are implementable via price-based regulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study solution concepts for normal-form games. We obtain a characterization of Nash equilibria and logit quantal response equilibria, as well as generalizations capturing non-expected utility. Our axioms reflect that players are responsive to payoffs induced by the play of others and, whenever several games are played simultaneously, players may consider each separately.</description>

      <title>Contrarian Motives in Social Learning: Information Cascades with Nonconformist Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21446v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study sequential social learning with endogenous information acquisition when agents have a taste for nonconformity. Each agent observes predecessors' actions, decides whether to acquire a private signal (and how precise it should be), and then chooses between two actions. Payoffs value correctness and include a bonus for taking the less popular action among predecessors; because this bonus depends only on observed popularity, the equilibrium analysis avoids fixed points in anticipated popularity and preserves standard Bayesian updating. In a Gaussian-quadratic setting, optimal actions follow posterior thresholds that tilt against the majority, and we solve the precision choice problem. Whenever the no-signal decision aligns with the observed majority, stronger contrarian motives weakly raise the value of information and expand the set of histories in which agents invest. We provide compact comparative statics for thresholds, action probabilities, and the precision argmax, a local welfare-and-information treatment, and applications to scientific priority races, cultural diffusion, and online platforms.</description>

      <title>Reputational Conservatism in Expert Advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04036v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a tractable career-concerns model of expert recommendations with a continuous private signal. In equilibrium, advice obeys a cutoff rule: the expert recommends the risky option if and only if the signal exceeds a threshold. Under a mild relative-diagnosticity condition, the threshold is (weakly) increasing in reputation, yielding reputational conservatism. Signal informativeness and success priors lower the cutoff, while stronger career concerns raise it. A success-contingent bonus implements any target experimentation rate via a one-to-one mapping, providing an implementable design lever.</description>

      <title>Optimal Savings with Preference for Wealth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The consumption function maps current wealth and the exogenous state to current consumption. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a consumption function when the agent has a preference for wealth. When the period utility functions are restricted to power functions, we prove that the consumption function is asymptotically linear as wealth tends to infinity and provide a complete characterization of the asymptotic slopes. When the risk aversion with respect to wealth is less than that for consumption, the asymptotic slope is zero regardless of other model parameters, implying wealthy households save a large fraction of their income, consistent with empirical evidence.</description>
