      <title>Inference of noise intensity and phase response from noisy synchronous oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous biological and microscale systems exhibit synchronization in noisy environments. The theory of such noisy oscillators and their synchronization has been developed and experimentally demonstrated, but inferring the noise intensity and phase response is not always straightforward. In this study, we propose a useful formula that enables us to infer the noise intensity and phase response of a noisy oscillator synchronized with periodic external forcing. Through asymptotic approximations for small noise, we show that noisy synchronous oscillators satisfy a simple relationship among the noise intensity and measurable quantities, i.e., the stationary distribution of the oscillation phase and stationary probability current obtained as the average phase velocity, which is verified through systematic numerical analysis. The proposed formula facilitates a unified analysis and design of synchronous oscillators in weakly noisy environments.</description>

      <title>Untapped Potential in Self-Optimization of Hopfield Networks: The Creativity of Unsupervised Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Self-Optimization (SO) model can be considered as the third operational mode of the classical Hopfield Network (HN), leveraging the power of associative memory to enhance optimization performance. Moreover, is has been argued to express characteristics of minimal agency which, together with its biological plausibility, renders it useful for the study of artificial life. In this article, we draw attention to another facet of the SO model: its capacity for creativity. Drawing on the creativity studies literature, we argue that the model satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions of a creative process. Moreover, we explore the dependency of different creative outcomes based on learning parameters, specifically the learning and reset rates. We conclude that the SO model allows for simulating and understanding the emergence of creative behaviors in artificial systems that learn.</description>
