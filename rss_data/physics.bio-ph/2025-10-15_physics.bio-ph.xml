      <title>Exosome-mediated chemotaxis optimizes leader-follower cell migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cells frequently employ extracellular vesicles, or exosomes, to signal across long distances and coordinate collective actions. Exosomes diffuse slowly, can be actively degraded, and contain stochastic amounts of molecular cargo. These features raise the question of the efficacy of exosomes as a directional signal, but this question has not be systematically investigated. We develop a theoretical and computational approach to quantify the limits of exosome-mediated chemotaxis at the individual cell level. In our model, a leader cell secretes exosomes, which diffuse in the extracellular space, and a follower cell guides its migration by integrating discrete exosome detections over a finite memory window. We combine analytical calculations and stochastic simulations and show that the chemotactic velocity exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on the exosome cargo size. Small exosomes produce frequent but weak signals, whereas large exosomes produce strong but infrequent encounters. In the presence of nonlinear signal transduction, this tradeoff leads to an optimal cargo size that maximizes information throughput, as quantified by the average speed of the follower cell. Using a reduced one-dimensional model, we derive closed-form expressions coupling the optimal cargo size to follower speed as a function of secretion rate, memory time, and detection sensitivity. These results identify molecular packaging and memory integration as key determinants of exosome-mediated information transmission and highlight general design principles for optimization of migration under guidance by discrete and diffusible signaling particles.</description>

      <title>Interaction Dynamics of Borrelia Surface Proteins with Fibronectin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyme disease, caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, is a significant public health concern in North America, with approximately 500,000 cases reported annually in the United States. The dissemination of B. burgdorferi from the initial tick bite site to various tissues is facilitated by surface adhesins that bind to extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as fibronectin (Fn). This study investigates the binding dynamics of B. burgdorferi surface proteins RevA, BBK32, BmpA, OspA, and OspC to Fn using atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (AFM-SMFS). Our results demonstrate that RevA and BBK32 form strong, stable bonds with Fn, highlighting their roles as key mediators of host-cell attachment. By quantifying the rupture forces and kinetic parameters of these interactions, we provide a deeper understanding of B. burgdorferi adhesion mechanics and offer insights into potential therapeutic strategies targeting early bacterial attachment.</description>

      <title>A minimal model for poration induced electro deformation of Giant Vesicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work attempts to understand the mechanism of simultaneous electrodeformation and electroporation in Giant Unilamellar Vesicles (GUVs) using a minimal analytical model. In the small deformation limit, the coupled electroporation, electrohydrodynamics and membrane mechanics are solved. The excess membrane area generated by electroporation manifests as amplitudes of the second, fourth, and sixth Legendre modes, P2(cos{\theta}), P4(cos{\theta}), and P6(cos{\theta}), respectively, which serves as the shape function. The proposed model reveals that accentuated deformation in GUVs under strong pulsed DC fields arises from the additional surface area introduced by membrane poration. Thus, the resulting GUV deformation, obtained as a result of a balance of electric stresses and the membrane and hydrodynamic stresses, is prolate or oblate cylindrical or square shaped instead of prolate or oblate ellipsoids, as otherwise seen under weak AC/DC fields. The origin of higher modes is essentially due to electropore-generated membrane conductance, which is approximated to angularly vary as 2/3(1/2+P2(cos{\theta})), to keep the calculations analytically tractable, whereby the electric potential varies as P3(cos{\theta}) in addition to P1(cos{\theta}) seen for unporated vesicles. The vesicle correspondingly admits P4(cos{\theta}) and P6(cos{\theta}) shape deformation modes, besides P2(cos{\theta}) observed for unporated vesicles, on account of the quadratic dependence of Maxwell stresses on the electric field. The model qualitatively and semiquantitatively, with a correction factor (fitting parameter), captures the square shape modes for \b{eta} = 1, prolate ellipsoids (cylinders) for \b{eta} &gt;1, and oblate cylinders for \b{eta} &lt; 1, where \b{eta} ={\sigma}i/{\sigma}e is the ratio of the electrical conductivity of the inner fluid ({\sigma}i) to the outer fluid ({\sigma}e).</description>

      <title>Modelling of magnetic vortex microdisc dynamics under varying magnetic field in biological viscoelastic environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetically driven microparticles provide a versatile platform for probing and manipulating biological systems, yet the physical framework governing their actuation in complex environments remains only partially explored. Within the field of cellular magneto-mechanical stimulation, vortex microdiscs have emerged as particularly promising candidates for developing novel therapeutic approaches. Here, we introduce a simplified two-dimensional model describing the magneto-mechanical response of such particles embedded in viscoelastic media under varying magnetic fields. Using a Maxwell description of the medium combined with simplified elasticity assumptions, we derive analytical expressions and support them with numerical simulations of particle motion under both oscillating and rotating magnetic fields. Our results show that rotating fields typically induce oscillatory dynamics and that the transition to asynchronous motion occurs at a critical frequency determined by viscosity and stiffness. The amplitude and phase of this motion is governed by the competition between magnetic and viscoelastic contributions, with particle motion being strongly impaired when the latter dominate. Energy-based considerations further demonstrate that, within the frequency range explored of few tens of Hertz, no heat is generated -- distinguishing this approach from magnetic hyperthermia -- while the elastic energy transferred to the surrounding medium is, in principle, sufficient to perturb major cellular processes. This work provides a simple framework to anticipate the first-order influence of rheological properties on magnetically driven microdisc dynamics, thereby enabling a better understanding of their impact in cells or extracellular materials and bridging the gap between experimental observations and theoretical modelling.</description>

      <title>ECMSim: A high-performance web simulation of cardiac ECM remodeling through integrated ODE-based signaling and diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling is central to a wide variety of healthy and diseased tissue processes. Unfortunately, predicting ECM remodeling under various chemical and mechanical conditions has proven to be excessively challenging, due in part to its complex regulation by intracellular and extracellular molecular reaction networks that are spatially and temporally dynamic. We introduce ECMSim, which is a highly interactive, real-time, and web application designed to simulate heterogeneous matrix remodeling. The current model simulates cardiac scar tissue with configurable input conditions using a large-scale model of the cardiac fibroblast signaling network. Cardiac fibrosis is a major component of many forms of heart failure. ECMSim simulates over 1.3 million equations simultaneously in real time that include more than 125 species and more than 200 edges in each cell in a 100*100 spatial array (10,000 cells), which accounts for inputs, receptors, intracellular signaling cascades, ECM production, and feedback loops, as well as molecular diffusion. The algorithm is represented by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that are coupled with ECM molecular diffusion. The equations are solved on demand using compiled C++ and the WebAssembly standard. The platform includes brush-style cell selection to target a subset of cells with adjustable input molecule concentrations, parameter sliders to adjust parameters on demand, and multiple coupled real-time visualizations of network dynamics at multiple scales. Implementing ECMSim in standard web technologies enables a fully functional application that combines real-time simulation, visual interaction, and model editing. The software enables the investigation of pathological or experimental conditions, hypothetical scenarios, matrix remodeling, or the testing of the effects of an experimental drug(s) with a target receptor.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Generative Framework for Modeling Single-Cell Transcriptomes with Gene-Gene and Cell-Cell Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data simulation is limited by classical methods that rely on linear correlations, failing to capture the intrinsic, nonlinear dependencies and the simultaneous gene-gene and cell-cell interactions. We introduce qSimCells, a novel hybrid quantum-classical simulator that leverages quantum entanglement to model single-cell transcriptomes. The core innovation is a quantum kernel that uses a parameterized quantum circuit with CNOT gates to encode complex, nonlinear gene regulatory network (GRN) and cell-cell communication topologies with explicit directionality (causality). The synthetic data exhibits non-classical dependencies that challenge standard analysis. We demonstrated that classical correlation methods (Pearson and Spearman) failed to reconstruct the complete programmed quantum causal paths, instead reporting spurious statistical artifacts driven by high base-gene expression probabilities. Applying CellChat2.0 to the simulated cell-cell communication validated the true mechanistic links by showing a robust, relative increase in communication probability (up to 75-fold) only when the quantum entanglement was active. This work confirms that the quantum kernel is essential for creating high-fidelity ground truth data, highlighting the need for advanced inference techniques to capture the complex, non-classical dependencies inherent in gene regulation.</description>

      <title>Impact of Oxygen on DNA Damage Distribution in 3D Genome and Its Correlation to Oxygen Enhancement Ratio under High LET Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The variation of the oxygen enhancement ratio (OER) across Linear Energy Transfer (LET) currently lacks a comprehensive mechanistic interpretation and a mechanistic model. Our earlier research revealed a significant correlation between the distribution of double-strand breaks (DSBs) within 3D genome and radiation-induced cell death, which offers valuable insights into the oxygen effect. We propose a model where the reaction of oxygen is represented as the probability of inducing DNA strand breaks. Then it is integrated into a track-structure Monte Carlo simulation to investigate the impact of oxygen on the distribution of DSBs within 3D genome. Using the parameters from our previous study, we calculate the OER values related to cell survival. Results show that the incidence ratios of clustered DSBs in a single topologically associating domain (TAD) (case 2) and DSBs in frequently-interacting TADs (case 3) under aerobic and hypoxic conditions align with the trend of the OER of cell survival across LET. Our OER curves exhibit good correspondence with experimental data. This study provides a potentially mechanistic explanation for changes in OER across LET. High-LET irradiation leads to dense ionization events, resulting in an overabundance of lesions that readily induce case 2 and case 3, which have substantially higher probabilities of cell killing than other damage patterns. This may contribute to the main mechanism governing the variation of OER for high LET. Our study further underscores the importance of the DSB distribution within 3D genome in the context of radiation-induced cell death.</description>
