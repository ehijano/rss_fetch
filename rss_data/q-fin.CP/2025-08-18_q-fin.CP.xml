      <title>Tokenize Everything, But Can You Sell It? RWA Liquidity Challenges and the Road Ahead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tokenization of real-world assets (RWAs) promises to transform financial markets by enabling fractional ownership, global accessibility, and programmable settlement of traditionally illiquid assets such as real estate, private credit, and government bonds. While technical progress has been rapid, with over \$25 billion in tokenized RWAs brought on-chain as of 2025, liquidity remains a critical bottleneck. This paper investigates the gap between tokenization and tradability, drawing on recent academic research and market data from platforms such as RWA.xyz. We document that most RWA tokens exhibit low trading volumes, long holding periods, and limited investor participation, despite their potential for 24/7 global markets. Through case studies of tokenized real estate, private credit, and tokenized treasury funds, we present empirical liquidity observations that reveal low transfer activity, limited active address counts, and minimal secondary trading for most tokenized asset classes. Next, we categorize the structural barriers to liquidity, including regulatory gating, custodial concentration, whitelisting, valuation opacity, and lack of decentralized trading venues. Finally, we propose actionable pathways to improve liquidity, ranging from hybrid market structures and collateral-based liquidity to transparency enhancements and compliance innovation. Our findings contribute to the growing discourse on digital asset market microstructure and highlight that realizing the liquidity potential of RWAs requires coordinated progress across legal, technical, and institutional domains.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Stochastic Collocation with Exponential Splines for an Arbitrage-Free Interpolation of Option Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the stochastic collocation method using the exponential of a quadratic spline. In particular, we look in details whether it is more appropriate to fix the ordinates and optimize the abscissae of an interpolating spline or to fix the abscissae and optimize the parameters of a B-spline representation.</description>

      <title>Bridging Econometrics and AI: VaR Estimation via Reinforcement Learning and GARCH Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an environment of increasingly volatile financial markets, the accurate estimation of risk remains a major challenge. Traditional econometric models, such as GARCH and its variants, are based on assumptions that are often too rigid to adapt to the complexity of the current market dynamics. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework for Value-at-Risk (VaR) estimation, combining GARCH volatility models with deep reinforcement learning. Our approach incorporates directional market forecasting using the Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) model, treating the task as an imbalanced classification problem. This architecture enables the dynamic adjustment of risk-level forecasts according to market conditions. Empirical validation on daily Eurostoxx 50 data covering periods of crisis and high volatility shows a significant improvement in the accuracy of VaR estimates, as well as a reduction in the number of breaches and also in capital requirements, while respecting regulatory risk thresholds. The ability of the model to adjust risk levels in real time reinforces its relevance to modern and proactive risk management.</description>

      <title>ContestTrade: A Multi-Agent Trading System Based on Internal Contest Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In financial trading, large language model (LLM)-based agents demonstrate significant potential. However, the high sensitivity to market noise undermines the performance of LLM-based trading systems. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multi-agent system featuring an internal competitive mechanism inspired by modern corporate management structures. The system consists of two specialized teams: (1) Data Team - responsible for processing and condensing massive market data into diversified text factors, ensuring they fit the model's constrained context. (2) Research Team - tasked with making parallelized multipath trading decisions based on deep research methods. The core innovation lies in implementing a real-time evaluation and ranking mechanism within each team, driven by authentic market feedback. Each agent's performance undergoes continuous scoring and ranking, with only outputs from top-performing agents being adopted. The design enables the system to adaptively adjust to dynamic environment, enhances robustness against market noise and ultimately delivers superior trading performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed system significantly outperforms prevailing multi-agent systems and traditional quantitative investment methods across diverse evaluation metrics.

      <title>Marketron Through the Looking Glass: From Equity Dynamics to Option Pricing in Incomplete Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Marketron model, introduced by [Halperin, Itkin, 2025], describes price formation in inelastic markets as the nonlinear diffusion of a quasiparticle (the marketron) in a multidimensional space comprising the log-price $x$, a memory variable $y$ encoding past money flows, and unobservable return predictors $z$. While the original work calibrated the model to S\&amp;P 500 time series data, this paper extends the framework to option markets - a fundamentally distinct challenge due to market incompleteness stemming from non-tradable state variables. We develop a utility-based pricing approach that constructs a risk-adjusted measure via the dual solution of an optimal investment problem. The resulting Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, though computationally formidable, is solved using a novel methodology enabling efficient calibration even on standard laptop hardware. Having done that, we look at the additional question to answer: whether the Marketron model, calibrated to market option prices, can simultaneously reproduce the statistical properties of the underlying asset's log-returns. We discuss our results in view of the long-standing challenge in quantitative finance of developing an unified framework capable of jointly capturing equity returns, option smile dynamics, and potentially volatility index behavior.</description>
