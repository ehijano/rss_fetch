      <title>Systematic search for islets of stability in the standard map for large parameter values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the seminal paper (Phys. Rep. 52, 263, 1979), Boris Chirikov showed that the standard map does not exhibit a boundary to chaos, but rather that there are small islands (islets) of stability for arbitrarily large values of the nonlinear perturbation. In this context, he established that the area of the islets in the phase space and the range of parameter values where they exist should decay following power laws with exponents -2 and -1, respectively. In this paper, we carry out a systematic numerical search for islets of stability and we show that the power laws predicted by Chirikov hold. Furthermore, we use high-resolution 3D islets to reveal that the islets volume decays following a similar power law with exponent -3.</description>

      <title>Van Hove singularities in the density of states of a chaotic dynamical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The statistics of a chaotic recursion relation can be predicted by constructing an associated sequence of periodic elliptic operators. For such operators, the density of states is well understood, can be computed straightforwardly and explicit formulas can often be derived. The example studied here is a non-linear recursion relation which can be related to a sequence of periodic operators generated by a Fibonacci tiling rule. This link is used to derive an explicit formula for the limiting distribution of orbits of the non-linear recursion relation. This distribution contains characteristic features of the associated operators' densities of states, such as Van Hove singularities near to critical values.</description>

      <title>Adjoint Sensitivities of Chaotic Flows without Adjoint Solvers: A Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In one calculation, adjoint sensitivity analysis provides the gradient of a quantity of interest with respect to all system's parameters. Conventionally, adjoint solvers need to be implemented by differentiating computational models, which can be a cumbersome task and is code-specific. To propose an adjoint solver that is not code-specific, we develop a data-driven strategy. We demonstrate its application on the computation of gradients of long-time averages of chaotic flows. First, we deploy a parameter-aware echo state network (ESN) to accurately forecast and simulate the dynamics of a dynamical system for a range of system's parameters. Second, we derive the adjoint of the parameter-aware ESN. Finally, we combine the parameter-aware ESN with its adjoint version to compute the sensitivities to the system parameters. We showcase the method on a prototypical chaotic system. Because adjoint sensitivities in chaotic regimes diverge for long integration times, we analyse the application of ensemble adjoint method to the ESN. We find that the adjoint sensitivities obtained from the ESN match closely with the original system. This work opens possibilities for sensitivity analysis without code-specific adjoint solvers.</description>

      <title>Master Stability Functions of Networks of Izhikevich Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.13921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.13921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization has attracted the interest of many areas where the systems under study can be described by complex networks. Among such areas is neuroscience, where is hypothesized that synchronization plays a role in many functions and dysfunctions of the brain. We study the linear stability of synchronized states in networks of Izhikevich neurons using Master Stability Functions, and to accomplish that, we exploit the formalism of saltation matrices. Such a tool allows us to calculate the Lyapunov exponents of the Master Stability Function (MSF) properly since the Izhikevich model displays a discontinuity within its spikes. We consider both electrical and chemical couplings, as well as total and partially synchronized states. The MSFs calculations are compared with a measure of the synchronization error for simulated networks. We give special attention to the case of electric and chemical coupling, where a riddled basin of attraction makes the synchronized solution more sensitive to perturbations.</description>

      <title>Full range spectral correlations and their spectral form factors in chaotic and integrable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Correlations between the eigenenergies of a system's spectrum can be a defining feature of quantum chaos. We characterize correlations between energies for all spectral distances by studying the distributions of $k$-th neighbor level spacings ($k$nLS) and compute their associated $k$-th neighbor spectral form factor ($k$nSFF). Specifically, we find analytical expressions for these signatures in paradigmatic models of quantum chaos, namely the three Gaussian ensembles of random matrix theory, and in integrable models, taken as systems with completely uncorrelated spectra (the Poissonian ensemble). The spectral distance decomposition of the SFF allows us to probe the contribution of each individual $k$nLS to the ramp. The latter is a characteristic feature of quantum chaos, and we show how each spectral distance participates in building it -- the linear ramp cannot be formed by short-range energy correlations only. We illustrate our findings in the XXZ spin chain with disorder, which interpolates between chaotic and integrable behavior.</description>
