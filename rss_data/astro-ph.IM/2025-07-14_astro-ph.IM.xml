      <title>A candidate field for deep imaging of the Epoch of Reionization observed with MWA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep imaging of structures from the Cosmic Dawn (CD) and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) in five targeted fields is one of the highest priority scientific objectives for the Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Selecting 'quiet' fields, which allow deep imaging, is critical for future SKA CD/EoR observations. Pre-observations using existing radio facilities will help estimate the computational capabilities required for optimal data quality and refine data reduction techniques. In this study, we utilize data from the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) Phase II extended array for a selected field to study the properties of foregrounds. We conduct deep imaging across two frequency bands: 72-103 MHz and 200-231 MHz. We identify up to 2,576 radio sources within a 5-degree radius of the image center (at RA (J2000) $8^h$ , Dec (J2000) 5{\deg}), achieving approximately 80% completeness at 7.7 mJy and 90% at 10.4 mJy for 216 MHz, with a total integration time of 4.43 hours and an average RMS of 1.80 mJy. Additionally, we apply a foreground removal algorithm using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and calculate the angular power spectra of the residual images. Our results indicate that nearly all resolved radio sources can be successfully removed using PCA, leading to a reduction in foreground power. However, the angular power spectra of the residual map remains over an order of magnitude higher than the theoretically predicted CD/EoR 21 cm signal. Further improvements in data reduction and foreground subtraction techniques will be necessary to enhance these results.</description>

      <title>newASTROGAM -- The New MeV to GeV Gamma-ray Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: newASTROGAM is a breakthrough mission concept for the study of the non-thermal Universe from space with gamma rays in the energy range from 15 keV to 3 GeV. It is based on advanced space-proven detector technologies, which will achieve unprecedented sensitivity, angular and energy resolution combined with polarimetric capability. Since the MeV gamma-ray energy range is the most under-explored electromagnetic window to the Universe, a mission in this energy range can for the first time sensitively address fundamental astrophysics questions connected to the physics of compact objects and merger events, jets and their environments, supernovae and the origin of the elements, potentially constrain the nature of dark matter and many more science objectives. The mission will detect and follow-up many of the key sources of multi-messenger astronomy in the 2040s.
  newASTROGAM provides an unprecedentedly broad energy coverage from keV to GeV energies. The payload concept consists of a Silicon tracker combined with a crystal calorimeter. Both detectors are surrounded by an anti-coincidence detector to reject charged cosmic rays. In addition, a thin X-ray coded mask provides very good imaging capabilities. Such a mission can uniquely detect gamma rays via the photoelectric effect, Compton scattering and electron-positron pair production. newASTROGAM is proposed to the ESA call for medium-class mission ideas (M8).</description>

      <title>Development of a laser stabilized on an ultra-stable silicon cryogenic Fabry-Perot cavity for dark matter detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical observations suggest the existence of an unknown kind of matter in the Universe, in the frame of the $\Lambda$CDM model. The research field of dark matter covers an energy scale going from massive objects to ultra-light scalar fields, which are the focus of the present work. It is supposed that ultra-light scalar fields affect the length of objects, whereas the speed of light stays unchanged. It follows that Fabry-Perot cavities are ideal tools for ultra-light dark matter detection since the fluctuations in the length of a cavity can be detected on the frequency of the laser stabilized to it. At FEMTO-ST, we have set up an ultra-stable silicon cavity suitable for a test of detection of ultra-light dark matter in an energy range close to 10$^{-10}$ eV. Our 14 cm cavity is composed of two mirrors optically bonded to an ultra-rigid spacer, with each element made in single-crystal of silicon, and cooled at 17 K in order to cancel the first order thermal expansion coefficient of the silicon spacer. The projected fractional frequency stability of the laser is $3 \times 10^{-17}$, mainly limited by the thermal noise of the amorphous dielectric reflective coatings. To reach this remarkable stability, several effects have to be reduced below the thermal noise limit. While the contribution of the residual amplitude modulation is now acceptable, we are currently implementing a laser power lock with residual fluctuations lower than 3~nW and a piezoelectric-based servo loop to actively reduce the vibration noise that has to be inferior to $-110 \textrm{~dB(m s}^{-2})^2/\textrm{Hz}$ at 1 Hz. Here, we present both the status of the development of our ultra-stable laser and the mechanical response of the cavity in the presence of ultra-light dark matter.</description>

      <title>On-axis afocal telescopes as framework for Cubesat based astronomical imagers and slit-less spectrographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cubesats present unique opportunities for observational astronomy in the modern era. They are useful in observing difficult-to-access wavelength regions and long-term monitoring of interesting astronomical sources. However, conventional telescope designs are not necessarily the best fit for restricted envelope of a Cubesat. Additionally, fine-pointing stability on these platforms is difficult due to the low mass of the spacecraft and special allocations within the optical design are needed to achieve stable pointing. We propose afocal telescope designs as the framework to realise imagers and low-resolution spectrographs on Cubesat platforms. These designs help reduce the number of components in the optical chain and aim to improve throughput and sensitivity compared to conventional designs. Additionally, they also provide a fine steering mechanism within a collimated beam section. Fine beam steering within the collimated beam section avoids issues of image degradation due to out-of-plane rotation of the image plane or offset in the rotation axis of the mirror. This permits the use of simple and mostly off-the-shelf tip-tilt mirrors for beam steering. The designs discussed here also allow for a standard telescope design to be used in many instrument types; thus reducing the complexity as well as the development time and cost. The optical design, performance and SNR estimations of these designs along with some interesting science cases are discussed. A number of practical aspects in implementation such as guiding, tolerancing, choice of detectors, vibration analysis and laboratory test setups are also presented.</description>

      <title>NuAncestor: an artificial satellite-borne star for accurate frequency calibration of ground-based EPRV spectrographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accuracy of state-of-the-art Extreme Precision Radial Velocity (EPRV) spectrographs depends on the access to extremely precise and stable wavelength calibration sources. There are several available calibration sources (e.g., emission lamps, laser frequency combs, reference cavities) that can be used to calibrate an astronomical spectrograph. However, the calibration as it is currently performed is always 'local'. In the proposed talk we will present the NuAncestor concept that proposes an accurate (absolute) and common wavelength calibration for astronomical high-resolution, high-precision spectrographs by embarking an optical frequency comb on-board a satellite equipped with an actively pointing telescope and precision orbitography. This calibration satellite shall be available and serve EPRV spectrographs in all major observatories around the world.</description>

      <title>The Optical Sensor for IceCube-Gen2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An innovative optical module (OM) with segmented light-sensitive area has been developed for IceCube-Gen2 that will take neutrino astronomy at the South Pole to the next level. It builds on the successful features of the mDOM and D-Egg modules of IceCube Upgrade while adapting to the smaller borehole diameter of IceCube-Gen2. The newly developed OM, which is being tested in IceCube Upgrade, serves as a prototype for the planned mass production of about 10,000 OMs for IceCube-Gen2. To simplify the assembly process, important changes were made to the design, in particular to integrate the new gel pad concept. This replaces the 3D-printed support structure of the mDOM while maintaining through total internal reflection the increased light collection efficiency of the reflector rings. In addition, the design features local generation of high voltage for each photomultiplier tube (PMT) via a Cockcroft-Walton circuit and the full digitization of the signal on each PMT base with a sampling rate of 60 MSpS. This significantly reduces the complexity of the mainboard so that it fits into the limited space available. This article describes the development status and presents the performance of the first prototypes.</description>

      <title>A co-deployed dust-logging instrument for the IceCube Upgrade and IceCube-Gen2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A precise understanding of the optical properties of the instrumented Antarctic ice sheet is crucial to the performance of optical Cherenkov telescopes such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory and its planned successor, IceCube-Gen2. One complication arising from the large envisioned footprint of IceCube-Gen2 is the larger impact of the so-called ice tilt. It describes the undulation of ice layers of constant optical properties within the detector. In this contribution, we will describe the project to build a co-deployed laser dust logger. This is a device to measure the stratigraphy of impurities in the ice to derive the ice tilt. It consists of a light source that will be co-deployed with the photosensor modules, meaning it is part of the deployment string and operated during the deployment of the detector. The newly developed device will be tested during the deployment of the IceCube Upgrade in the 2025/26 austral summer to pave the way for IceCube-Gen2.</description>

      <title>Determination of the energy scale of cosmic ray measurements using the Auger Engineering Radio Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate determination of the absolute energy scale in cosmic ray measurements is both a challenging and fundamentally important task. We present how measurements of radio pulses from extensive air showers with the Auger Engineering Radio Array, combined with per-event simulations of radio emission using the CoREAS extension of CORSIKA, allow us to determine the energy scale of cosmic rays between $3\cdot 10^{17}$\,eV and several $10^{18}$\,eV. Our analysis accounts for many factors, each of which is controlled on the 5\% level or better. The absolute calibration of the antennas and the entire analog signal chain builds on a Galactic calibration in combination with a detailed understanding of the antenna-gain patterns. Additional key elements include compensation for temperature-dependent signal amplification, continuous detector health monitoring, an active veto for thunderstorm conditions, an unbiased event reconstruction, and per-event atmospheric modeling in the simulations. The analysis benefits from a high-statistics dataset of over 800 measured cosmic ray showers. We describe our analysis method, perform multiple cross-checks, and evaluate systematic uncertainties. We find that absolute energies determined with AERA are 12\% higher than those established with the Auger Fluorescence Detector, a result well in agreement within systematic uncertainties and thus a strong independent confirmation of the absolute energy scale of the Pierre Auger Observatory.</description>

      <title>Expanding the Pierre Auger Observatory Open Data program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since 2021, the Open Data Portal has provided access to the Pierre Auger Observatory's data for both the scientific community and the general public. The data release process has been in place since the Observatory's foundation. It continues to be strengthened as outlined in the approved policy and the Observatory's Data Management Plan. More than 80 000 cosmic-ray events above $10^{17}$ eV, detected with the surface and fluorescence detectors, have been released at various levels, from calibrated traces to high-level reconstruction parameters. Additionally, atmospheric data and low-energy particle counting rates have been made available for space weather studies. The Collaboration is committed to releasing FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data, along with accompanying software and detailed documentation, enabling users to perform their own queries and analyses for both research and educational purposes. These datasets have already served as a basis for several scientific papers and have been widely used in various outreach activities. After 20 years of stable data acquisition, the Pierre Auger Collaboration will disclose 30% of the cosmic ray events above $2.5 \cdot 10^{18}$ eV collected with the main surface detector array between 2004 and 2022, corresponding to an exposure of about 24 000 km$^2$ sr yr, together with events detected with the fluorescence detector and used for energy calibration. This release will provide an unprecedented public dataset for ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, enabling in-depth studies of their properties. Together with the published catalog of the 100 most energetic events recorded, this initiative represents the Pierre Auger Collaboration's strong commitment to distributed and collective knowledge, sharing progress with the entire scientific community.</description>

      <title>Event reconstruction with the Radio detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory has recently been upgraded with the addition of radio antennas, forming the radio detector (RD). This contribution outlines the standard methods for reconstructing extensive air showers using the RD, along with recent developments. The reconstruction pipeline is based on a robust understanding of the detector itself. The entire instrument, including the antenna pattern and analog chain, has been meticulously characterized within the Offline software framework, based on measurements in the laboratory as well as in the field. To ensure data integrity, stations identified as unreliable through monitoring are excluded before event reconstruction. Absolute calibration is achieved at the 5 percent level by analyzing the diffuse galactic radio emission. Next, the electric field that induced voltages in the antenna is calculated by unfolding the antenna response pattern. Key observables, such as the energy fluence (the energy deposited in the ground per unit area) and the arrival time of the pulse, are then determined. With these quantities, shower parameters can be reconstructed with very good accuracy in two chi-square-minimization fits: one to determine the shower's arrival direction via a spherical wavefront fit (predicted within 0.2 degree), and the other to estimate the distance to the shower maximum and the electromagnetic cascade energy (predicted within 5 percent) using a lateral density function</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upgrade of Pierre Auger Observatory, AugerPrime, is a multi-hybrid system designed to improve the sensitivity and precision of ultra-high-energy cosmic ray measurements. It includes scintillator detectors positioned both atop the enhanced Water-Cherenkov detectors and buried nearby for direct muon measurements, along with radio and fluorescence detectors. In this contribution, we present an overview of the monitoring tools developed for all the components of AugerPrime, focusing on real-time performance assessment and long-term stability metrics. By continuously tracking key parameters, we can identify potential issues early, enabling timely interventions and improving overall data quality. These strategies are crucial for maintaining the long-term reliability of the measurements taken at the Auger Observatory and providing high-quality data for cosmic ray research in the coming decades.</description>

      <title>Performance and extensions of the central data acquisition system for Phase II of the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory is a hybrid detector designed to observe and study ultra-high-energy particles of extraterrestrial origin. With its 27 fluorescence telescopes and over 1600 autonomously operating water-Cherenkov detectors spread over an area of 3000 km$^2$, it is world-leading in terms of exposure to cosmic rays and offers an unparalleled window into the physical processes that happen at energy scales unattainable by particle accelerators on Earth. Measurement information of candidate air-shower events from all associated detectors and telescopes is collected at a central data-acquisition system located in the nearby town of Malarg\"ue, and processed for higher-level physics analysis. On top of this, data for monitoring the long-term stability and operation of the observatory is forwarded to the central server as well. In this work, we briefly review the central data-acquisition system of the Pierre Auger Observatory. We examine the rates, efficiencies, and purity of detected events for Phase II of the Pierre Auger Observatory and compare them to performance parameters during Phase I. We detail challenges in the event detection up until now and present recent changes in the central data acquisition system and local station software that aim to streamline the data acquisition chain.</description>

      <title>A model-agnostic gravitational-wave background characterization algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors improve in sensitivity, gravitational-wave background (GWB) signals will progressively become detectable. Currently, searches for the GWB model the signal as a power law, however deviations from this model will be relevant at increased sensitivity. Therefore, to prepare for the range of potentially detectable GWB signals, we propose an interpolation model implemented through a transdimensional reverse-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm. This interpolation model foregoes a specific physics-informed model (of which there are a great many) in favor of a flexible model that can accurately recover a broad range of potential signals. In this paper, we employ this framework for an array of GWB applications. We present three dimensionless fractional GW energy density injections and recoveries as examples of the capabilities of this spline interpolation model. We further demonstrate how our model can be implemented for hierarchical GW analysis on $\Omega_{\rm GW}$.</description>

      <title>Enhancing searches for astrophysical neutrino sources in IceCube with machine learning and improved spatial modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searches for astrophysical neutrino sources in IceCube rely on an unbinned likelihood that consists of an energy and spatial component. Accurate modeling of the detector, ice, and spatial distributions leads to improved directional and energy reconstructions, resulting in increased sensitivity. In this work, we utilize our best knowledge of the detector ice properties and detector calibrations to reconstruct in-ice particle showers. The spatial component of the likelihood is parameterized either by a 2D Gaussian or a von Mises Fisher (vMF) distribution at small and large angular uncertainties, respectively. Here, we use a gradient-boosted decision tree with a vMF spatial likelihood loss function, reparameterized through two coordinate transformations, to predict per-event point spread functions (PSF). Additionally, we discuss the search for PeV cosmic ray sources using the IceCube Multi-Flavor Astrophysical Neutrino (ICEMAN) sample. Our search contains both an analysis of individual neutrino sources coincident with greater than 100 TeV gamma-ray sources and also a stacking analysis. We outline the prospects for extended neutrino emission originating from the Cygnus Cocoon region.</description>

      <title>Maneuver Detection via a Confidence Dominance Maneuver Indicator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient maneuver detection is critical for ensuring the safety and predictability of spacecraft trajectories. This paper presents a novel maneuver detection approach based on comparing the confidence levels associated with the orbital state estimation and the observation likelihood. First, a confidence-dominance maneuver indicator (CDMI) is proposed by setting a confidence level for the state estimation and computing the maximum likelihood of the observation and its confidence level. The CDMI then flag a maneuver when the observation's confidence level exceeds that of the state estimation, indicating that the observation is unlikely under the no-maneuver hypothesis while maintaining consistency with the prior state estimation confidence. To efficiently compute the maximum likelihood of the observation and obtain the CDMI, a recursive polynomial optimization method is developed, taking advantage of convex optimization and polynomial approximation. In addition, an integrated CDMI approach is developed to eliminate the need to manually select the state confidence level. The integrated CDMI approach maintains high detection accuracy while simultaneously providing an indication of maneuver likelihood, thereby enhancing robustness and practical applicability. The performance of the proposed CDMI-based maneuver detection approaches is evaluated against an optimal control distance metric and two mixture-based approaches. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed integrated CDMI approach can achieve up to 99.33\% detection accuracy, at least 10% higher than the competing methods, while substantially reducing computational costs.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Limits of Rotation Period Recovery through Gyrochronology Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contamination from nearby sources often compromises stellar rotation periods derived from photometric light curves, particularly in data with large pixel scales such as TESS. This problem is compounded when both the target and contaminant are intrinsically variable, a scenario that challenges deblending algorithms, which often assume constant contaminants. We assess the reliability of rotation period detections using wide binary systems, whose components share a common age and rotational history. By applying gyrochronology constraints, we identify period combinations that yield consistent ages between components, helping to isolate true rotation signals. Simulating blends with degraded Kepler data, our method recovers correct rotation periods with an 88\% success rate for periods $&lt;12$ days, where TESS detections are most reliable. Applying this framework to nearly 300 wide binaries observed by TESS, we find that despite significant contamination, a subset of pairs shows consistent gyrochronological ages. We establish a practical detection threshold for TESS blended observations, finding that periods shorter than $\sim8$ days are reliably recovered, while those longer than $\sim10$ days become significantly more challenging and often remain unresolved. As expected, rotation periods are more often recovered when the highest-amplitude periodogram peak is linked to the brighter star and the second to the dimmer star, although many cases deviate from this pattern, indicating it cannot always be assumed. Our results highlight the limitations of standard deblending methods and demonstrate that astrophysical constraints, such as gyrochronology, provide a valuable tool for extracting reliable rotation periods from complex photometric blends.</description>

      <title>Improving gravitational wave search sensitivity with TIER: Trigger Inference using Extended strain Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a machine learning (ML) framework called $\texttt{TIER}$ for improving the sensitivity of gravitational wave search pipelines. Typically, search pipelines only use a small region of strain data in the vicinity of a candidate signal to construct the detection statistic. However, extended strain data ($\sim 10$ s) in the candidate's vicinity can also carry valuable complementary information. We show that this information can be efficiently captured by ML classifier models trained on sparse summary representation/features of the extended data. Our framework is easy to train and can be used with already existing candidates from any search pipeline, and without requiring expensive injection campaigns. Furthermore, the output of our model can be easily integrated into the detection statistic of a search pipeline. Using $\texttt{TIER}$ on triggers from the $\texttt{IAS-HM}$ pipeline, we find up to $\sim 20\%$ improvement in sensitive volume time in LIGO-Virgo-Kagra O3 data, with improvements concentrated in regions of high masses and unequal mass ratios. Applying our framework increases the significance of several near-threshold gravitational-wave candidates, especially in the pair-instability mass gap and intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) ranges.</description>

      <title>The Rosetta Stone Project. I. A suite of radiative magnetohydrodynamics simulations of high-mass star-forming clumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Star formation and, in particular, high-mass star formation are key astrophysical processes that are far from being fully understood. Unfortunately, progress in these fields is slow because observations are hard to interpret as they cannot be directly compared to numerical simulations. Synthetic observations are therefore necessary to better constrain the models. Aims. With the Rosetta Stone project, we aim to develop an end-to-end pipeline to compare star formation simulations with observations as accurately as possible in order to study the evolution from clumps scales to stars.
  Methods. Using the adaptive mesh-refinement code RAMSES, we computed a first grid of model of star-forming clumps to develop our pipeline and explore the impact of the clump initial conditions on their evolution. The main purpose of this set of simulations is to be converted into synthetic observations to enable a direct comparison with real star-forming clumps observed with Herschel and ALMA.
  Results. The Rosetta Stone simulations presented here provide a catalog available for full post-processing and subsequent comparison with observations (RS1). Among all the parameters explored here, the strength of the magnetic field has the strongest influence on the clump evolution (fragmentation, star formation, global collapse) at both large and small scales. Numerical parameters such as the resolution per Jeans length or the threshold for accretion onto sink particles affects the formation of low-mass sinks. Finally, the widely used L/M ratio is found to be a good indicator of the clump evolutionary state regardless of its initial condition, but this could change when more feedback processes (jets, HII regions) are included.
  Conclusions. We now have a new suite of simulations of star-forming clumps that is available for full post-processing and subsequent comparison with the observations,</description>

      <title>Recent Highlights from the Auger Engineering Radio Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Auger Engineering Radio Array (AERA) consists of 153 autonomous antenna stations deployed over 17 km^2 to measure the radio emission from extensive air showers initiated by cosmic rays with energies between 0.1 and 10 EeV in the 30 to 80 MHz frequency band. It operates in coincidence with the other detectors of the Pierre Auger Observatory particularly the Surface Detector (SD) and the Fluorescence Detector (FD). As the largest cosmic-ray radio detector worldwide before the recent Observatory upgrade AugerPrime, AERA has played a pioneering role in the development of radio technique for cosmic rays, providing complementary measurements and serving as a testbed for ideas that motivated the build-up of a new Radio Detector (RD) as part of AugerPrime. We report on measurements of the depth of the shower maximum using the radio footprint, demonstrating compatibility and competitive resolution with established FD results. An absolute calibration of AERA is achieved by monitoring the sidereal modulation of the diffuse Galactic radio emission for nearly a decade, confirming the long-term stability of a radio detector with no significant aging effects observed. This stability suggests that radio detectors could also be used to monitor potential aging effects in other detector systems. Additionally, we investigate the muon content of inclined air showers using hybrid SD-AERA events. Our results indicate that the muon content in measured data is consistent with expectations for iron nuclei as predicted by current-generation hadronic interaction models, confirming the well-known muon deficit for the first time with radio data. These findings reinforce the value of radio detection for cosmic-ray studies and provide a foundation for the next generation of analyses with the AugerPrime RD.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Shadows of the Moon and Sun Using the Pierre Auger Observatory at an Average Energy of $7\times10^{17}\,$eV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interaction of cosmic rays with celestial bodies such as the Moon or the Sun produces a shadow in the arrival direction distribution of the cosmic rays reaching the Earth. Such deficits from an isotropic flux have been observed by astroparticle observatories below energies of $10^{15}\,$eV. Above this energy, measurements were limited due to the low number of events as a result of the steeply falling cosmic-ray flux with energy. With more than 10.6 million events recorded during 20 years of operation of the Pierre Auger Observatory, we report the first observation of the shadow of the Moon at an average energy of $7\times10^{17}\,$eV with a maximum significance above 3$\sigma$. The shadow is an end-to-end check that the celestial directions are correctly reconstructed from the air shower data, and it is used here to derive the effective angular resolution for this dataset. Additionally, we present the results of a similar study on the shadow of the Sun.</description>

      <title>Chemical abundances and small-scale gas kinematics in the local star-forming galaxy NGC 2366</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed spectroscopic study of ionised gas in the nearby (~3.3Mpc) dwarf galaxy NGC 2366, a local analogue of Green Pea galaxies, based on observations with the SCORPIO-2 instrument at the Russian 6-m BTA telescope. Using scanning Fabry-Perot interferometry and long-slit spectroscopy, we examine the gas kinematics, excitation mechanisms, and chemical abundances across the disc of NGC 2366, including its prominent starburst region Mrk 71 and the companion region NGC 2363. We identified 20 regions with locally elevated Ha velocity dispersion, only four of which correspond to known high-energy sources. We argue that one of the remaining objects can be a previously unidentified Wolf-Rayet star and two - supernova remnants. For 15 HII regions, we measure electron temperatures, oxygen and nitrogen abundances via the `direct' Te method, with 12 + log(O/H) ranging from 7.6 to 8.0 in most of the regions. We show that Mrk 71 has higher oxygen abundance compared to the other \HII regions in the galaxy, contrary to the previous indirect estimates suggesting flat gradient throughout the galaxy. Together with the localized spatial variations of metallicity in the area, it is indicative of metal enrichment by the outflow from the super star cluster in the centre of Mrk 71.</description>

Abstract: The IceCube Observatory at the South Pole has been operating in its full configuration since May 2011 with a duty cycle of about 99%. Its main component consists of a cubic-kilometer array of optical sensors deployed deep in the Glacial ice designed for the detection of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos. A surface array for cosmic ray air shower detection, IceTop, and a denser inner subdetector, DeepCore, significantly enhance the capabilities of the observatory, making it a multipurpose facility. This list of contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference in Geneva, Switzerland (July 15-24, 2025) summarizes the latest results from IceCube covering a broad set of key questions in physics and astrophysics. The papers in this index are grouped topically to highlight IceCube contributions related to high-energy neutrino and multi-messenger astrophysics, atmospheric fluxes, cosmic-ray physics, low-energy neutrino transients, physics beyond the Standard Model, detector calibration and event reconstruction, and the status and performance of the IceCube Upgrade, a dense sensor infill complemented by calibration devices to be deployed by the end of 2025. Contributions related to IceCube-Gen2, the planned future extension of IceCube, are available in a separate collection.</description>

      <title>How stable are the impact factors of major astrophysics journals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the long-term trends in impact factor over the past decade (2015-2014) for seven flagship journals widely used in Astrophysics: ApJ, AJ, ApJL, ApJS,A &amp;A, JCAP, and MNRAS. We check the variation of both the traditional impact factor as well as the median-based impact factor, which we had studied in a previous work. We find that ApJS exhibits the largest drop in impact factor from 14.9 to 9.0, while ApJ and MNRAS show a steady decline from 6.7 to 5.2 and 5.6 to 5.0, respectively. However, the impact factors for AJ and ApJL have shown a steady increase from 4.55 to 5.35 and 6.4 to 9.7, respectively. The median-based impact factors are much more stable showing variations of at most $\pm 1$ within the last decade.</description>

      <title>OntoPortal-Astro, a Semantic Artefact Catalogue for Astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The astronomy communities are widely recognised as mature communities for their open science practices. However, while their data ecosystems are rather advanced and permit efficient data interoperability, there are still gaps between these ecosystems. Semantic artefacts (SAs) -- e.g., ontologies, thesauri, vocabularies or metadata schemas -- are a means to bridge that gap as they allow to semantically described the data and map the underlying concepts. The increasing use of SAs in astronomy presents challenges in description, selection, evaluation, trust, and mappings. The landscape remains fragmented, with SAs scattered across various registries in diverse formats and structures -- not yet fully developed or encoded with rich semantic web standards like OWL or SKOS -- and often with overlapping scopes. Enhancing data semantic interoperability requires common platforms to catalog, align, and facilitate the sharing of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable) SAs. In the frame of the FAIR-IMPACT project, we prototyped a SA catalogue for astronomy, heliophysics and planetary sciences. This exercise resulted in improved vocabulary and ontology management in the communities, and is now paving the way for better interdisciplinary data discovery and reuse. This article presents current practices in our discipline, reviews candidate SAs for such a catalogue, presents driving use cases and the perspective of a real production service for the astronomy community based on the OntoPortal technology, that will be called OntoPortal-Astro.</description>

      <title>Observation of the Crab Nebula with the Single-Mirror Small-Size Telescope stereoscopic system at low altitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Single-Mirror Small-Size Telescope (SST-1M) stereoscopic system is composed of two Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) designed for optimal performance for gamma-ray astronomy in the multi-TeV energy range. It features a 4-meter-diameter tessellated mirror dish and an innovative SiPM-based camera. Its optical system features a 4-m diameter spherical mirror dish based on the Davies-Cotton design, maintaining a good image quality over a large FoV while minimizing optical aberrations. In 2022, two SST-1M telescopes were installed at the Ond\v{r}ejov Observatory, Czech Republic, at an altitude of 510 meters above sea level, and have been collecting data for commissioning and astronomical observations since then. We present the first SST-1M observations of the Crab Nebula, conducted between September 2023 and March 2024 in both mono and stereoscopic modes. During this observation period, 46 hours for the SST-1M-1 and 52 hours for the SST-1M-2 were collected for which 33 hours are in stereoscopic mode. We use the Crab Nebula observation to validate the expected performance of the instrument, as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations carefully tuned to account for instrumental and atmospheric effects. We determined that the energy threshold at the analysis level for the zenith angles below $30^\circ$ is 1 TeV for mono mode and 1.3 TeV for stereo mode. The energy and angular resolutions are approximately 20% and $0.18^\circ$ for mono mode and 10% and $0.10^\circ$ for stereo mode, respectively. We present the off-axis performance of the instrument and a detailed study of systematic uncertainties. The results of a full simulation of the telescope and its camera is compared to the data for the first time, allowing a deep understanding of the SST-1M array performance.</description>

      <title>A forecasting framework for galactic cosmic ray flux in space weather applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intensity and energy spectrum of galactic cosmic rays in the heliosphere are significantly influenced by the 11-year solar cycle, a phenomenon known as solar modulation. Understanding this effect and its underlying physical mechanisms is essential for assessing radiation exposure and associated risks during space missions. Starting from a previously developed effective predictive model of solar modulation, validated using cosmic ray flux measurements from space-based detectors such as PAMELA and AMS-02, we build a generalizable forecasting strategy for the long-term evolution of cosmic ray fluxes. This strategy is based on identifying delayed cross-correlation relationships between solar proxies and the model's parameters. It integrates recent findings on time lags between cosmic ray fluxes and solar activity, and incorporates advanced time-series signal processing techniques. The framework not only performs well in reproducing observed data, but also shows strong potential for applications in space radiation monitoring and forecasting. By efficiently capturing the long-term variability of galactic cosmic rays, our approach contributes valuable insights for evaluating radiation risks, ultimately supporting safer and more effective space exploration.</description>

      <title>Costs of Bayesian Parameter Estimation in Third-Generation Gravitational Wave Detectors: a Review of Acceleration Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference with stochastic sampling has been widely used to obtain the properties of gravitational wave (GW) sources. Although computationally intensive, its cost remains manageable for current second-generation GW detectors because of the relatively low event rate and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The third-generation (3G) GW detectors are expected to detect hundreds of thousands of compact binary coalescence (CBC) events every year with substantially higher SNR and longer signal duration, presenting significant computational challenges. In this study, we systematically evaluate the computational costs of CBC source parameter estimation (PE) in the 3G era by modeling the PE time cost as a function of SNR and signal duration. We examine the standard PE method alongside acceleration methods including relative binning, multibanding, and reduced order quadrature. We predict that PE for a one-month-observation catalog with 3G detectors could require at least billions of CPU core hours with the standard PE method, whereas acceleration techniques can reduce this demand to less than millions of core hours, which is as high as the cost of analyzing GW events in the past 10 years. These findings highlight the necessity for more efficient PE methods to enable cost-effective and environmentally sustainable data analysis for 3G detectors. In addition, we assess the accuracy of accelerated PE methods, emphasizing the need for careful treatment in high-SNR scenarios.</description>

      <title>Tangent point position and atmosphere composition in limb scanning instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the forward model for limb-scanning instruments, ray tracing must be accounted for because variations in air refractivity cause the lines of sight to bend from straight paths into curves. The tangent point of a line of sight is defined as the minimum height point. The lines of sight can be adjusted by varying the nadir angles of the instrument, which must be calibrated to account for Earth's ellipticity and the actual atmospheric conditions sampled by these paths. In this study, we investigate the relationship between the nadir angles, atmospheric properties, and tangent point positions, using a configuration relevant to the CAIRT instrument. Atmospheric data from reanalysis databases are utilized, and the lines of sight are determined by numerically solving the Eikonal equation. Our findings are compared to those of a previous study conducted for the MIPAS instrument, highlighting key differences.</description>

      <title>Open Source Planning &amp; Control System with Language Agents for Autonomous Scientific Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-agent system for automation of scientific research tasks, cmbagent (https://github.com/CMBAgents/cmbagent). The system is formed by about 30 Large Language Model (LLM) agents and implements a Planning &amp; Control strategy to orchestrate the agentic workflow, with no human-in-the-loop at any point. Each agent specializes in a different task (performing retrieval on scientific papers and codebases, writing code, interpreting results, critiquing the output of other agents) and the system is able to execute code locally. We successfully apply cmbagent to carry out a PhD level cosmology task (the measurement of cosmological parameters using supernova data) and evaluate its performance on two benchmark sets, finding superior performance over state-of-the-art LLMs. The source code is available on GitHub, demonstration videos are also available, and the system is deployed on HuggingFace and will be available on the cloud.</description>

      <title>CLASS_SZ II: Notes and Examples of Fast and Accurate Calculations of Halo Model, Large Scale Structure and Cosmic Microwave Background Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These notes are very much work-in-progress and simply intended to showcase, in various degrees of details (and rigour), some of the cosmology calculations that class_sz can do. We describe the class_sz code in C, Python and Jax. Based on the Boltzmann code class, it can compute a wide range of observables relevant to current and forthcoming CMB and Large Scale Structure surveys. This includes galaxy shear and clustering, CMB lensing, thermal and kinetic Sunyaev and Zeldovich observables, Cosmic Infrared Background, cross-correlations and three-point statistics. Calculations can be done either within the halo model or the linear bias model. For standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and extensions, class_sz uses high-accuracy cosmopower emulators of the CMB and matter power spectrum to accelerate calculations. With this, along with efficient numerical integration routines, most class_sz output can be obtained in less than 500 ms (CMB $C_\ell$'s or matter $P(k)$ take $\mathcal{O}(1\mathrm{ms})$), allowing for fast or ultra-fast parameter inference analyses. Parts of the calculations are "jaxified", so the software can be integrated into differentiable pipelines.</description>
