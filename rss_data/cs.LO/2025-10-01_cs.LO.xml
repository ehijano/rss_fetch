      <title>Monoid Structures on Indexed Containers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Containers represent a wide class of type constructions relevant for functional programming and (co)inductive reasoning. Indexed containers generalize this notion to better fit the scope of dependently typed programming. When interpreting types to be sets, a container describes an endofunctor on the category of sets while an I-indexed container describes an endofunctor on the category Set^I of I-indexed families of sets.
  We consider the monoidal structure on the category of I-indexed containers whose tensor product of containers describes the composition of the respective induced endofunctors. We then give a combinatorial characterization of monoids in this monoidal category, and we show how these monoids correspond precisely to monads on the induced endofunctors on Set^I. Lastly, we conclude by presenting some examples of monads on Set^I that fall under our characterization, including the product of two monads, indexed variants of the state and the writer monads and an example of a free monad. The technical results of this work are accompanied by a formalization in the proof assistant Cubical Agda.</description>

      <title>A Function-Set Framework: General Properties and Applications to Modal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Representations are essential to mathematically model phenomena, but there are many options available. While each of those options provides useful properties with which to solve problems related to the phenomena in study, comparing results between these representations can be non-trivial, as different frameworks are used for different contexts. We present a general structure based on set-theoretic concepts that accommodates many situations related to logical and semantic frameworks. We show the versatility of this approach by presenting alternative constructions of modal logic; in particular, all modal logics can be represented within the framework.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Lattice Properties Within Modal Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the extension of lattice-based logics into modal languages. We observe that such extensions admit multiple approaches, as the interpretation of the necessity operator is not uniquely determined by the underlying lattice structure. The most natural interpretation defines necessity as the meet of the truth values of a formula across all accessible worlds -- an approach we refer to as the \textitnormal interpretation. We examine the logical properties that emerge under this and other interpretations, including the conditions under which the resulting modal logic satisfies the axiom K and other common modal validities. Furthermore, we consider cases in which necessity is attributed exclusively to formulas that hold in all accessible worlds.</description>

      <title>Nominal Sets in Rocq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nominal techniques have been praised for their ability to formalize grammars with binding structures closer to their informal developments. At its core, there lies the definition of nominal sets, which capture the notion of name (in)dependence through a simple, and uniform, metatheory based on name permutations. We present a formal constructive development of nominal sets in Rocq (formerly known as Coq), with its main design and project decisions. Furthermore, we formalize the concepts of freshness, nominal alpha-equivalence, name abstraction, and finitely supported functions. Our implementation relies on a type class hierarchy which, combined with Rocq generalized rewriting mechanism, achieves concise definitions and proofs, whilst easing the well-known "setoid hell" scenario. We conclude with a discussion on how to obtain the constructive alpha-structural recursion and induction combinators, towards a nominal framework.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Codensity Monads via Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Codensity monads provide a universal method to generate complex monads from simple functors. Recently, a wide range of important monads in logic, denotational semantics, and probabilistic computation, such as several incarnations of the ultrafilter monad, the Vietoris monad, and the Giry monad, have been presented as codensity monads, using complex arguments. We propose a unifying categorical approach to codensity presentations of monads, based on the idea of relating the presenting functor to a dense functor via a suitable duality between categories. We prove a general presentation result applying to every such situation and demonstrate that most codensity presentations known in the literature emerge from this strikingly simple duality-based setup, drastically alleviating the complexity of their proofs and in many cases completely reducing them to standard duality results. Additionally, we derive a number of novel codensity presentations using our framework, including the first non-trivial codensity presentations for the filter monads on sets and topological spaces, the lower Vietoris monad on topological spaces, and the expectation monad on sets.</description>

      <title>Logical Approaches to Non-deterministic Polynomial Time over Semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a logical characterization of non-deterministic polynomial time defined by BSS machines over semirings via existential second-order logic interpreted in the semiring semantics developed by Gr\"adel and Tannen. Furthermore, we show that, similarly to the classical setting, the satisfiability problem of propositional logic in the semiring semantics is the canonical complete problem for this version of NP. Eventually, we prove that the true existential first-order theory of the semiring is a complete problem for the so-called Boolean part of this version of NP.</description>

      <title>Transporting Theorems about Typeability in LF Across Schematically Defined Contexts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dependently-typed lambda calculus LF is often used as a vehicle for formalizing rule-based descriptions of object systems. Proving properties of object systems encoded in this fashion requires reasoning about formulas over LF typing judgements. An important characteristic of LF is that it supports a higher-order abstract syntax representation of binding structure. When such an encoding is used, the typing judgements include contexts that assign types to bound variables and formulas must therefore allow for quantification over contexts. The possible instantiations of such quantifiers are usually governed by schematic descriptions that must also be made explicit for effectiveness in reasoning. In practical reasoning tasks, it is often necessary to transport theorems involving universal quantification over contexts satisfying one schematic description to those satisfying another description. We provide here a logical justification for this ability. Towards this end, we utilize the logic $\mathcal{L}_{LF}$, which has previously been designed for formalizing properties of LF specifications. We develop a transportation proof rule and show it to be sound relative to the semantics of $\mathcal{L}_{LF}$. Key to this proof rule is a notion of context schema subsumption that uses the subordination relation between types as a means for determining the equivalence of contexts relative to individual LF typing judgements. We discuss the incorporation of this rule into the Adelfa proof assistant and its use in actual reasoning examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the issue of defining a semantics for deontic argumentation that supports weak permission. Some recent results show that grounded semantics do not support weak permission when there is a conflict between two obligations. We provide a definition of Deontic Argumentation Theory that accounts for weak permission, and we recall the result about grounded semantics. Then, we propose a new semantics that supports weak permission.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.02142v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a proof language for intuitionistic multiplicative additive linear logic, incorporating the sup connective that introduces additive pairs with a probabilistic elimination, and sum and scalar products within the proof-terms. We provide an abstract characterisation of the language, revealing that any symmetric monoidal closed category with biproducts and a monomorphism from the semiring of scalars to the semiring Hom(I,I) is suitable for the job. Leveraging the binary biproducts, we define a weighted codiagonal map at the heart of the sup connective.</description>

      <title>Type Isomorphisms for Multiplicative-Additive Linear Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11987v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize type isomorphisms in the multiplicative-additive fragment of linear logic (MALL), and thus in *-autonomous categories with finite products, extending a result for the multiplicative fragment by Balat and Di Cosmo. This yields a much richer equational theory involving distributivity and cancellation laws. The unit-free case is obtained by relying on the proof-net syntax introduced by Hughes and Van Glabbeek. We use the sequent calculus to extend our results to full MALL, including all units, thanks to a study of cut-elimination and rule commutations.</description>

      <title>Towards the Usage of Window Counting Constraints in the Synthesis of Reactive Systems to Reduce State Space Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The synthesis of reactive systems aims for the automated construction of strategies for systems that interact with their environment. Whereas the synthesis approach has the potential to change the development of reactive systems significantly due to the avoidance of manual implementation, it still suffers from a lack of efficient synthesis algorithms for many application scenarios. The translation of the system specification into an automaton that allows for strategy construction (if a winning strategy exists) is nonelementary in the length of the specification in S1S and doubly exponential for LTL, raising the need of highly specialized algorithms. In this article, we present an approach on how to reduce this state space explosion in the construction of this automaton by exploiting a monotonicity property of specifications. For this, we introduce window counting constraints that allow for step-wise refinement or abstraction of specifications. In an iterative synthesis procedure, those window counting constraints are used to construct automata representing over- or under-approximations (depending on the counting constraint) of constraint-compliant behavior. Analysis results on winning regions of previous iterations are used to reduce the size of the next automaton, leading to an overall reduction of the state space explosion extent. We present the implementation results of the iterated synthesis for a zero-sum game setting as proof of concept. Furthermore, we discuss the current limitations of the approach in a zero-sum setting and sketch future work in non-zero-sum settings.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Semantics for Jumping Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11849v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jumping automata are finite automata that read their input in a non-sequential manner, by allowing a reading head to ``jump'' between positions on the input, consuming a permutation of the input word. We argue that allowing the head to jump should incur some cost. To this end, we propose four quantitative semantics for jumping automata, whereby the jumps of the head in an accepting run define the cost of the run. The four semantics correspond to different interpretations of jumps: the \emph{absolute distance} semantics counts the distance the head jumps, the \emph{reversal} semantics counts the number of times the head changes direction, the \emph{Hamming distance} measures the number of letter-swaps the run makes, and the \emph{maximum jump} semantics counts the maximal distance the head jumps in a single step,
  We study these measures, with the main focus being the \emph{boundedness problem}: given a jumping automaton, decide whether its (quantitative) language is bounded by some given number $k$. We establish the decidability and complexity for this problem under several variants.</description>
