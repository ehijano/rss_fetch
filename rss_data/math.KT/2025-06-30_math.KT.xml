      <title>Some criteria concerning the rational vanishing of Whitehead groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give several examples of finite groups $G$ for which the rank of the tensor product $\mathbb{Z} \otimes_{\mathbb{Z}\mathrm{Aut}(G)}$ Wh$(G)$ is or is not zero. This is motivated by an earlier theorem of the first author, which implies as a special case that when this group has nonzero rank, the Whitehead group of any other group (finite or infinite) that contains $G$ as a normal subgroup is rationally nontrivial.</description>

      <title>Totally acyclic complexes and homological invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study equivalent characterizations of the condition that every acyclic complex of projective (resp., injective and flat) modules is totally acyclic over a general ring R. This line of inquiry was initiated by Iyengar and Krause in 2006 for commutative Noetherian rings with dualizing complexes. We demonstrate that certain equivalent conditions are closely related to the invariants silp(R) and spli(R) defined by Gedrich and Gruenberg, as well as to the invariant sfli(R) defined by Ding and Chen. We also examine some sufficient conditions for the equality spli(R) = silp(R), that leads to a generalization of a result by Ballas and Chatzistavridis that was originally proved in the case that R is a left (and right) coherent ring which is isomorphic with its opposite ring. Finally, we provide examples to illustrate relations among these conditions.</description>

      <title>On outer automorphisms of certain graph $C^{*}$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a countable abelian group $A$, we construct a row finite directed graph $\Gamma(A)$ such that the $K_{0}$-group of the graph $\textrm{C}^{\ast}$-algebra $\textrm{C}^{\ast}(\Gamma(A))$ is canonically isomorphic to $A$. Moreover, each element of $\textrm {Aut}(A)$ is a lift of an automorphism of the graph $\textrm{C}^{\ast}$-algebra $\textrm{C}^{\ast}(\Gamma(A))$.</description>

      <title>BV structure on the Hochschild cohomology of twisted tensor products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two Frobenius algebras, we describe the BV operator on the Hochschild cohomology of their tensor product twisted by a bicharacter in terms of twisted BV operators on summands of the Hochschild cohomology described by Briggs and Witherspoon. This specialises to the case of non-twisted tensor products, and in doing so generalises a result of Le and Zhou. This allows us to simplify calculations in the literature significantly.</description>

      <title>Large-scale quantization of trace I: Finite propagation operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by parallel developments in coarse geometry in mathematics and exact macroscopic quantization in physics, we present a family of general trace formulae which are universally quantized and depend only on large-scale geometric features of the input data. They generalize, to arbitrary dimensions, formulae found by Roe in his partitioned manifold index theorem, as well as the Kubo and Kitaev formulae for 2D Hall conductance used in physics.</description>

      <title>Anderson duality of topological modular forms and its differential-geometric manifestations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct and study a morphism of spectra implementing the Anderson duality of topological modular forms ($\mathrm{TMF}$). Its differential version will then be introduced, allowing us to pair elements of $\pi_d\mathrm{TMF}$ with spin manifolds whose boundaries are equipped with string structure. A few negative-degree elements of $\pi_d\mathrm{TMF}$ will then be constructed using the theory of $\mathrm{RO}(G)$-graded $\mathrm{TMF}$, and will be identified using the differential pairing. We also discuss a conjecture relating vertex operator algebras and negative-degree elements of $\pi_d\mathrm{TMF}$, underlying much of the discussions of this paper. The paper ends with a separate appendix for physicists, in which the contents of the paper are summarized and translated into their language.</description>

      <title>A generalization of Rao's theorem to graded $R$-subalgebras of $R[t]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a Noetherian local ring of Krull dimension $d$ such that $(d!)R = R$, and let $A$ be a graded $R$-subalgebra of the polynomial algebra $R[t]$. We prove that every unimodular row of length $d + 1$ over $A$ can be completed to an invertible matrix. This is a generalization of a classical result by Rao, who proved that in the same setting, every unimodular row of length $d + 1$ over $R[t]$ admits a completion to an invertible matrix.</description>
