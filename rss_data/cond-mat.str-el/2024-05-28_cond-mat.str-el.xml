      <title>Emergent Gauge Fields in Band Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By explicit microscopic construction involving a mapping to a quantum vertex model subject to the `ice rule,' we show that an electronically `trivial' band insulator with suitable vibrational (phonon) degrees of freedom can host a ``resonating valence-bond'' state - a quantum phase with emergent gauge fields. This novel type of band insulator is identifiable by the existence of emergent gapless `photon' modes and deconfined excitations, the latter of which carry non-quantized mobile charges. We suggest that such phases may exist in the quantum regimes of various nearly ferroelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Engineering flux-controlled flat bands and topological states in a Stagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Stagome lattice, a variant of the Kagome lattice, where one can make any of the bands completely flat by tuning an externally controllable magnetic flux. This systematically allows the energy of the flat band (FB) to coincide with the Fermi level. We have analytically calculated the compact localized states (CLS) associated to each of these flat bands appearing at different values of the magnetic flux. We also show that, this model features nontrivial topological properties with distinct integer values of the Chern numbers as a function of the magnetic flux. We argue that this mechanism for making any of the bands exactly flat could be of interest to address the FB superconductivity in such a system. Furthermore, we believe that the phenomenon of photonic flat band localization could be studied in the Stagome lattice structure, designed for instance using femtosecond laser induced single-mode waveguide arrays.</description>

      <title>Correlation effects in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene: An auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) presents a fascinating platform for investigating the effects of electron interactions in topological flat bands. The Bistritzer-MacDonald (BM) model provides a simplified quantitative description of the flat bands. Introducing long-range Coulomb interactions leads to an interacting BM (IBM) Hamiltonian, a momentum-space continuum description which offers a very natural starting point for many-body studies of MATBG. Accurate and reliable many-body computations in the IBM model are challenging, however, and have been limited mostly to special fillings, or smaller lattice sizes. We employ state-of-the-art auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method to study the IBM model, which constrains the sign problem to enable accurate treatment of large system sizes. We determine ground-state properties and quantify errors compared to mean-field theory calculations. Our calculations identify correlated metal states and their competition with the insulating Kramers inter-valley coherent state at both half-filling and charge neutrality. Additionally, we investigate one- and three-quarter fillings, and examine the effect of many-body corrections beyond single Slater determinant solutions. We discuss the effect that details of the IBM Hamiltonian have on the results, including different forms of double-counting corrections, and the need to establish and precisely specify many-body Hamiltonians to allow more direct and quantitative comparisons with experiments in MATBG.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic ferroelectricity due to the Kugel-Khomskii mechanism of the orbital ordering assisted by atomic Hund's second rule effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exchange interactions in insulators depend on the orbital state of magnetic ions, obeying certain phenomenological principles, known as Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson rules. Particularly, the ferro order of alike orbitals tends to stabilize antiferromagnetic interactions, while the antiferro order of unlike orbitals favors ferromagnetic interactions. The Kugel-Khomskii theory provides a universal view on such coupling between spin and orbital degrees of freedom, based on the superexchange processes: namely, for a given magnetic order, the occupied orbitals tend to arrange in a way to further minimize the exchange energy. Then, if two magnetic sites are connected by the spatial inversion, the antiferro orbital order should lead to the ferromagnetic coupling and break the inversion symmetry. This constitutes the basic idea of our work, which opens a new route for designing ferromagnetic ferroelectrics - the rare but fundamentally and practically important multiferroic materials. After illustrating the basic idea on toy-model examples, we propose that such behavior can be indeed realized in the van der Waals ferromagnet VI$_3$, employing for this analysis the realistic model derived from first-principles calculations for magnetic $3d$ bands. We argue that the intraatomic Coulomb interactions responsible for Hund's second rule, acting against the crystal field, tend to restore the orbital degeneracy of the ionic $d^{2}$ state in VI$_3$ and, thus, provide a necessary flexibility for activating the Kugel-Khomskii mechanism of the orbital ordering. In the honeycomb lattice, this orbital ordering breaks the inversion symmetry, stabilizing the ferromagnetic-ferroelectric ground state. The symmetry breaking leads to the canting of magnetization, which can be further controlled by the magnetic field, producing a huge change of electric polarization.</description>

      <title>Continuous Transition between Bosonic Fractional Chern Insulator and Superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) phase and the phase transitions between FCI and Mott insulators (MI) in bosonic systems are well studied. The continuous transitions between FCI and superfluid (SF), however, despite the inspiring field theoretical predictions, have not been directly verified. The existing numerical results of FCI-SF transition are either indirect or clearly first-order. Here, by simply tuning the bandwidth of Haldane honeycomb lattice model, we find direct transitions from a bosonic FCI at $\nu$ = 1/2 filling of a flat Chern band to two SF states with bosons condensed at momenta $M$ and $\Gamma$, respectively. While the FCI-SF($M$) transition is first-order, the FCI-SF($\Gamma$) transition is found continuous. Through finite size criticality analysis, the obtained critical exponents $\beta\approx$0.35(5) and $\nu\approx$0.62(12) are both compatible with those of the 3D XY universality class and more exotic beyond-Landau ones. Our work thence presents a direct numerical evidence of a continuous FCI-SF transition between topological ordered phase and spontaneous continuous symmetry-breaking phase, and further indicates the zero-field bosonic FCI might be realized from a SF state by gradually flattening the dispersion of Chern band, through the (quasi)adiabatic preparation in ultracold atom systems.</description>

      <title>Metamagnetic multiband Hall effect in Ising antiferromagnet ErGa$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frustrated rare-earth-based intermetallics provide a promising platform for emergent magnetotransport properties through exchange coupling between conduction electrons and localized rare-earth magnetic moments. Metamagnetism, the abrupt change of magnetization under an external magnetic field, is a signature of first-order magnetic phase transitions; recently, metamagnetic transitions in frustrated rare earths intermetallics have attracted interest for their accompanying nontrivial spin structures (e.g. skyrmions) and associated non-linear and topological Hall effects. Here, we present metamagnetism-induced Hall anomalies in single-crystalline ErGa$_2$, which recalls features arising from the topological Hall effect but wherein the strong Ising type anisotropy of Er moments prohibit noncoplanar spin structures. We show that the observed anomalies are neither due to anomalous Hall effect nor topological Hall effect, instead, can be accounted for via 4f-5d interactions which produce a band-dependent mobility modulation. This leads to a pronounced multiband Hall response across the magnetization process -- a metamagnetic multiband Hall effect that resembles a topological-Hall-like response but without nontrivial origins. The present findings may be of general relevance in itinerant metamagnetic systems regardless of coplanar/non-coplanar nature of spins and are important for the accurate identification of Hall signals due to emergent magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Approximately-symmetric neural networks for quantum spin liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a family of approximately-symmetric neural networks for quantum spin liquid problems. These tailored architectures are parameter-efficient, scalable, and significantly out-perform existing symmetry-unaware neural network architectures. Utilizing the mixed-field toric code model, we demonstrate that our approach is competitive with the state-of-the-art tensor network and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, at the largest system sizes (N=480), our method allows us to explore Hamiltonians with sign problems beyond the reach of both quantum Monte Carlo and finite-size matrix-product states. The network comprises an exactly symmetric block following a non-symmetric block, which we argue learns a transformation of the ground state analogous to quasiadiabatic continuation. Our work paves the way toward investigating quantum spin liquid problems within interpretable neural network architectures</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional hydrodynamic viscous electron flow in annular Corbino rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of fluidic viscosity is ubiquitous in our everyday life and for it to arise the fluidic medium must necessarily form a continuum where macroscopic properties can emerge. While a powerful concept for tangible liquids, hydrodynamic manifestation of collective flow in electronic systems such as two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) has only been shown recently to occur in graphene and GaAs/AlGaAs. Here, we present nonlocal electronic transport measurements in concentric annular rings formed in high-mobility GaAs/AlGaAs 2DEGs and the resulting data strongly suggest that viscous hydrodynamic flow can occur far away from the source-drain current region. Our conclusion of viscous electronic transport is further corroborated by simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations that are found to be in agreement with our measurements below 1K temperature. Most importantly, our work emphasizes the key role played by viscosity via electron-electron (e-e) interaction when hydrodynamic transport is restricted radially, and for which a priori should not have played a major role.</description>

      <title>Exchange Splitting Mechanism of Negative Magnetoresistance in Layered Antiferromagnetic Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered topologically non-trivial and trivial semimetals with AFM-type ordering of magnetic sublattice are known to exhibit a negative magnetoresistance that is well correlated with AFM magnetization changes in a magnetic field. This effect is reported in several experimental studies with EuFe$_2$As$_2$, EuSn$_2$As$_2$, EuSn$_2$P$_2$, etc., where the resistance decreases quadratically with field by about $\delta\rho/\rho \sim 4-6\%$ up to the spin-polarization field. Despite the fact that this effect is well documented experimentally, its theoretical explanation is missing up to date. In this paper we propose a novel theoretical mechanism describing the observed magnetoresistance that does not imply either topological origin of the materials, surface roughness, their potential defect structure, or electron-magnon scattering. We believe, the proposed intrinsic mechanism of magnetoresistance is applicable to a wide class of the layered AFM- ordered semimetals. The theoretically calculated magnetoresistance is qualitatively consistent with experimental data for crystals of various composition.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Lifshitz Fermion Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the static entanglement structure in (1+1)-dimensional free Dirac-fermion theory with Lifshitz symmetry and arbitrary integer dynamical critical exponent. This model is different from the one introduced in [Hartmann et al., SciPost Phys. 11, no.2, 031 (2021)] due to a proper treatment of the square Laplace operator. Dirac fermion Lifshitz theory is local as opposed to its scalar counterpart which strongly affects its entanglement structure. We show that there is quantum entanglement across arbitrary subregions in various pure (including the vacuum) and mixed states of this theory for arbitrary integer values of the dynamical critical exponent. Our numerical investigations show that quantum entanglement in this theory is tightly bounded from above. Such a bound and other physical properties of quantum entanglement are carefully explained from the correlation structure in these theories. A generalization to (2+1)-dimensions where the entanglement structure is seriously different is addressed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct Narain conformal field theories (CFTs) from quantum subsystem codes, a more comprehensive class of quantum error-correcting codes than quantum stabilizer codes, for qudit systems of prime dimensions. The resulting code CFTs exhibit a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, enabling us to perform the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-gauging to derive their orbifolded and fermionized theories when the symmetry is non-anomalous. We classify a subset of these subsystem code CFTs using weighted oriented graphs and enumerate those with small central charges. Consequently, we identify several bosonic code CFTs self-dual under the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold, new supersymmetric code CFTs, and a few fermionic code CFTs with spontaneously broken supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Momentum-resolved electronic structures and strong electronic correlations in graphene-like nitride superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although transition-metal nitrides have been widely applied for several decades, experimental investigations of their high-resolution electronic band structures are rare due to the lack of high-quality single-crystalline samples. Here, we report on the first momentum-resolved electronic band structures of titanium nitride (TiN) films, a remarkable nitride superconductor. The measurements of crystal structures and electrical transport properties confirmed the high quality of these films. More importantly, with a combination of high-resolution angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy and the first-principles calculations, the extracted Coulomb interaction strength of TiN films can be as large as 8.5 eV, whereas resonant photoemission spectroscopy yields a value of 6.26 eV. These large values of Coulomb interaction strength indicate that superconducting TiN is a strongly correlated system. Our results uncover the unexpected electronic correlations in transition-metal nitrides, potentially providing a perspective not only to understand their emergent quantum states but also to develop their applications in quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: We develop a technique that dramatically reduces the contact resistances and depletes a shunting channel between the contacts in the ungated area outside the Hall bar in ultra-high mobility SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures. It involves the creation of three overlapping independent gates deposited on top of the structure and allows transport measurements to be performed at millikelvin temperatures in the strongly interacting limit at low electron densities, where the energy of the electron-electron interactions dominates all other energy scales. This design allows one to observe the two-threshold voltage-current characteristics that are a signature for the collective depinning and sliding of the electron solid.</description>

      <title>Computational Characterization of Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is a challenging problem to correctly characterize the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in open quantum systems. As the measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) utilizes non-trivial edge states of the SPT phases as the logical qubit, its computational power is closely tied to the non-trivial topological nature of the phases. In this paper, we propose to use the gate fidelity which is a measure of the computational power of the MBQC to identify the SPT phases in mixed-state settings. Specifically, we investigate the robustness of the Haldane phase by considering the MBQC on the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki state subject to different types of noises. To illustrate how our criterion works, we analytically and numerically calculated the gate fidelity to find that its behavior depends crucially on whether the noises satisfy a certain symmetry condition with respect to the on-site $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry. In particular, the fidelity for the identity gate, which is given by the sum of the non-local string order parameters, plays an important role. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a stronger symmetry conditions are required to be able to perform other (e.g., the $Z$-rotation gate) gates with high fidelity. By examining which unitary gates can be implemented with the MBQC on the decohered states, we can gain a useful insight into the richer structure of noisy SPT states that cannot be captured solely by the string order parameters.</description>

Abstract: Strongly correlated electron systems are challenging to calculate, and entanglement in such systems is not widely analyzed.
  We present an approach that can be used as a post-processing step for calculating the two-site reduced density matrix and from it entanglement measures such as the mutual information and entanglement negativity. Input is only the one- and two-particle Green's function which is the output of numerous many-body methods.
  As an illustration, we present results for a toy model, the Hubbard model on a $2\times2$ cluster and a $6$ site ring.</description>

      <title>Metamagnetism and anomalous magnetotransport properties in rare-earth-based polar semimetals $R$AuGe ($R =$ Dy, Ho, and Gd)</title>

Abstract: We report the magnetic, magnetoelastic, and magnetotransport properties of single crystals of polar magnets $R$AuGe ($R=$ Dy, Ho, and Gd), grown by Au-Ge self-flux. Magnetization and magnetostriction measurements reveal multi-step metamagnetic transitions for the $c$-axis magnetic field ($H\parallel c$) for DyAuGe and HoAuGe, suggesting magnetic frustration in the triangular lattice of $R$ ions. The magnetic phase diagrams have clarified a close connection between the magnetoelastic property and the emergence of the intermediate metamagentic phase. The magnetic-field dependence of the resistivity and Hall resistivity reveal the semimetallic transport dominated by hole-type carriers, consistent with the behavior in a nonmagnetic analogue YAuGe. We also identify a signature of an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) proportional to the field-induced magnetization in $R=$ Dy, Ho, and Gd. GdAuGe shows magnetic and transport behavior as reported in a previous study using Bi-flux grown single crystals, while the self-flux grown crystal shows larger magnetoresistance ($\sim$ 345\%, at 1.8 K and 9 T) due to higher hole-type carrier mobility ($\sim$ 6400 cm$^2$/Vs). Using the two-band model analysis considering the mobility change during the magnetization process, we extract the anomalous Hall conductivity: $\sim 1200$ S/cm and $\sim 530$ S/cm for $R=$ Dy and Ho, respectively, at 1.8 K with 9 T for $H\parallel c$. The magnitude of conductivity suggests a contribution of intrinsic origin, possibly related to the Berry curvature in the electron bands induced by the time-reversal symmetry breaking and the polar lattice.</description>

      <title>Robust non-Abelian even-denominator fractional Chern insulator in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08386v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent experiment observes a series of quantum spin Hall effects in transition metal dichalcogenide moir\'e MoTe$_2$ [K. Kang, \textit{et. al}, Nature 628, 522-526 (2024)]. Among them, the filling $\nu=3$ state points to a time-reversal pair of edge states resembling those of the even-denominator fractional Chern insulators (FCIs). Inspired by this discovery, we investigate whether a robust incompressible quantum Hall liquid can be stabilized in the half-filled Chern band of twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers. We use the continuum model with parameters relevant to twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers and obtain three consecutive nearly flat Chern bands with the same Chern number. Crucially, when the second moir\'e miniband is half-filled, signatures of non-Abelian states are found via exact diagonalization calculations, including the stable six-fold ground state degeneracy which grows more robust for larger lattice sizes and is consistent with an even-denominator FCI state. We further perform flux insertion simulations to reveal a 1/2 quantized many-body Chern number as direct evidence of topological order. Furthermore, the ground state density structure factors show no sharp peak, indicating no charge density wave order. These evidences signal the potential of realizing the non-Abelian state at zero magnetic field in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ at the fractional hole filling 3/2.</description>

      <title>Out-of-plane magnetic phase diagram of Kitaev quantum spin liquid candidate Na2Co2TeO6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13935v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have investigated the magnetic properties and mapped out the phase diagram of the honeycomb magnet Na2Co2TeO6 with Co 3d7 in out-of-plane magnetic fields. This material has previously been proposed to show nearest-neighbor Kitaev interactions between Co spins and maybe even Kitaev quantum spin liquid behavior in high fields. At low magnetic fields, we observe a thermal phase transition at TN = 27 K, transitioning from a paramagnetic state to a canonical ferrimagnetic state. Under the application of magnetic fields, a spin flop-like phase transition occurred before saturation of J = 1/2 between 10 K and TN. Below 10 K, a peak-dip-peak structure emerges between 10 and 17 T in the magnetic susceptibility (dM/dH) before the magnetic saturation, reminiscent of magnetic plateau behavior. The measurement of the magnetocaloric effect also shows dip-peak-dip behavior in this field range. Our data can be explained by an XXZ model with a single ion anisotropy and possibly small Kitaev and {\Gamma} exchange interactions. We also unambiguously determined the magnetization saturation field that helps constrain the energy scale of the exchange interactions</description>

      <title>Electronic thermal resistivity and quasi-particle collision cross-section in semi-metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-electron collisions lead to a T-square component in the electrical resistivity of Fermi liquids. The case of liquid $^3$He illustrates that the \textit{thermal} resitivity of a Fermi liquid has a T-square term, expressed in m$\cdot$W$^{-1}$. Its natural units are $\hbar/k_FE_F^2$. Here, we present a high-resolution study of the thermal conductivity in bismuth, employing magnetic field to extract the tiny electronic component of the total thermal conductivity and resolving signals as small as $\approx 60 \mu$K. We find that the electronic thermal resistivity follows a T-square temperature dependence with a prefactor twice larger than the electric T-square prefactor. Adding this information to what has been known for other semi-metals, we find that the prefactor of the T-square thermal resistivity scales with the square of the inverse of the Fermi temperature, implying that the dimensionless fermion-fermion collision cross-section is roughly proportional to the Fermi wavelength, indicating that it is not simply set by the strength of the Coulomb interaction.</description>

      <title>Pair-Kondo effect: a mechanism for time-reversal broken superconductivity in UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important open puzzle in the superconductivity of UTe$_2$ is the emergence of time-reversal broken superconductivity from a non-magnetic normal state. Breaking time-reversal symmetry in a single second-order superconducting transition requires the existence of two degenerate superconducting order parameters, which is not natural for orthorhombic UTe$_2$. Moreover, experiments under pressure (Braithwaite et. al., Comm. Phys. \bf{2}, 147 (2019), arXiv:1909.06074 [cond-mat.str-el]) suggest that superconductivity sets in at a single transition temperature in a finite parameter window, in contrast to the splitting between the symmetry breaking temperatures expected for accidental degenerate orders. Motivated by these observations, we propose a mechanism for the emergence of time-reversal breaking superconductivity without accidental or symmetry-enforced order parameter degeneracies in systems close to a magnetic phase transition. We demonstrate using Landau theory that a cubic coupling between incipient magnetic order and magnetic moments of Cooper pairs (pair-Kondo coupling) can drive time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductivity that onsets in a single, weakly first order transition over an extended region of the phase diagram. We discuss the experimental signatures of such transition in thermodynamic and resonant ultrasound measurements. A microscopic origin of pair-Kondo coupling is identified as screening of magnetic moments by chiral Cooper pairs, built out of two non-degenerate order parameters - an extension of Kondo screening to unconventional pairs.</description>

      <title>Wehrl Entropy and Entanglement Complexity of Quantum Spin Systems</title>

Abstract: The Wehrl entropy of a quantum state is the entropy of the coherent-state distribution function (Husimi function), and is non-zero even for pure states. We investigate the Wehrl entropy for $N$ spin-1/2 particles with respect to SU(2)$^{\otimes N}$ coherent states (i.e., the direct products of spin coherent states of each particle). We focus on: (1) The statistical interpretation of this Wehrl entropy. (2) The relationship between the Wehrl entropy and quantum entanglement. For (1), despite the coherent states not forming a group of orthonormal bases, we prove that the Wehrl entropy can still be interpreted as the entropy of a probability distribution with clear physical meaning. For (2), we numerically calculate the Wehrl entropy of various entangled pure states with particle number $2\leq N\leq 20$. Our results show that for the large-$N$ ($N\gtrsim 10$) systems the Wehrl entropy of the highly chaotic entangled states are much larger than that of the regular ones (e.g., the GHZ state). These results, together with the fact that the Wehrl entropy is invariant under local unitary transformations, indicate that the Wehrl entropy can reflect the complexity of the quantum entanglement (entanglement complexity) of many-body pure states, as A. Sugita proposed directly from the definitions of the Husimi function and Wehrl entropy (Jour. Phys. A 36, 9081 (2003)). Furthermore, the Wehrl entropy per particle can serve as a quantitative description of this complexity. We further show that the many-body pure entangled states can be classified into three types, according to the behaviors of the Wehrl entropy per particle in the limit $N\rightarrow\infty$, with the states of each type having very different entanglement complexity.</description>

      <title>Non-Invertible Duality Interfaces in Field Theories with Exotic Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the concept of global symmetry has generalized considerably. Two dramatic examples of this generalization are the exotic symmetries that govern theories with fractons and non-invertible symmetries, which do not fuse according to a group law. Only recently has the interplay between these two been examined. In this paper, we provide further examples of the interplay in the XY plaquette model, XY cube model, 1+1 d theory with global dipole symmetry, and the 2+1 d Lifshitz theory. They are analogs of the duality symmetries in 2d CTFs and are constructed by first gauging a finite subgroup of the momentum symmetry on half of spacetime and then performing a duality transformation. We analyze the fusion rules of the symmetries and find that they are condensation defects from an analog of higher gauging exotic symmetries. We also address their dependence on the UV cutoff when relevant.</description>

      <title>Low-Weight High-Distance Error Correcting Fermionic Encodings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform an extended numerical search for practical fermion-to-qubit encodings with error correcting properties. Ideally, encodings should strike a balance between a number of the seemingly incompatible attributes, such as having a high minimum distance, low-weight fermionic logical operators, a small qubit to fermionic mode ratio and a simple qubit connectivity graph including ancilla qubits for the measurement of stabilizers. Our strategy consists of a three-step procedure in which we: first generate encodings with code distances up to $d\leq4$ by a brute-force enumeration technique; subsequently, we use these encodings as starting points and apply Clifford deformations to them which allows us to identify higher-distance codes with $d\leq7$; finally, we optimize the hardware connectivity graphs of resulting encodings in terms of the graph thickness and the number of connections per qubit. We report multiple promising high-distance encodings which significantly improve the weights of stabilizers and logical operators compared to previously reported alternatives.</description>
