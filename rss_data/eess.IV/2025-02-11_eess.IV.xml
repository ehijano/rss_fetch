      <title>CoRPA: Adversarial Image Generation for Chest X-rays Using Concept Vector Perturbations and Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image classification tasks are becoming widely implemented in AI-assisted diagnostic tools, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce clinician workloads, and improve patient outcomes. However, their vulnerability to adversarial attacks poses significant risks to patient safety. Current attack methodologies use general techniques such as model querying or pixel value perturbations to generate adversarial examples designed to fool a model. These approaches may not adequately address the unique characteristics of clinical errors stemming from missed or incorrectly identified clinical features. We propose the Concept-based Report Perturbation Attack (CoRPA), a clinically-focused black-box adversarial attack framework tailored to the medical imaging domain. CoRPA leverages clinical concepts to generate adversarial radiological reports and images that closely mirror realistic clinical misdiagnosis scenarios. We demonstrate the utility of CoRPA using the MIMIC-CXR-JPG dataset of chest X-rays and radiological reports. Our evaluation reveals that deep learning models exhibiting strong resilience to conventional adversarial attacks are significantly less robust when subjected to CoRPA's clinically-focused perturbations. This underscores the importance of addressing domain-specific vulnerabilities in medical AI systems. By introducing a specialized adversarial attack framework, this study provides a foundation for developing robust, real-world-ready AI models in healthcare, ensuring their safe and reliable deployment in high-stakes clinical environments.</description>

      <title>Multi-Class Segmentation of Aortic Branches and Zones in Computed Tomography Angiography: The AortaSeg24 Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-class segmentation of the aorta in computed tomography angiography (CTA) scans is essential for diagnosing and planning complex endovascular treatments for patients with aortic dissections. However, existing methods reduce aortic segmentation to a binary problem, limiting their ability to measure diameters across different branches and zones. Furthermore, no open-source dataset is currently available to support the development of multi-class aortic segmentation methods. To address this gap, we organized the AortaSeg24 MICCAI Challenge, introducing the first dataset of 100 CTA volumes annotated for 23 clinically relevant aortic branches and zones. This dataset was designed to facilitate both model development and validation. The challenge attracted 121 teams worldwide, with participants leveraging state-of-the-art frameworks such as nnU-Net and exploring novel techniques, including cascaded models, data augmentation strategies, and custom loss functions. We evaluated the submitted algorithms using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and Normalized Surface Distance (NSD), highlighting the approaches adopted by the top five performing teams. This paper presents the challenge design, dataset details, evaluation metrics, and an in-depth analysis of the top-performing algorithms. The annotated dataset, evaluation code, and implementations of the leading methods are publicly available to support further research.

      <title>A Novel Convolutional-Free Method for 3D Medical Imaging Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Segmentation of 3D medical images is a critical task for accurate diagnosis and treatment planning. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have dominated the field, achieving significant success in 3D medical image segmentation. However, CNNs struggle with capturing long-range dependencies and global context, limiting their performance, particularly for fine and complex structures. Recent transformer-based models, such as TransUNet and nnFormer, have demonstrated promise in addressing these limitations, though they still rely on hybrid CNN-transformer architectures. This paper introduces a novel, fully convolutional-free model based on transformer architecture and self-attention mechanisms for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach focuses on improving multi-semantic segmentation accuracy and addressing domain adaptation challenges between thick and thin slice CT images. We propose a joint loss function that facilitates effective segmentation of thin slices based on thick slice annotations, overcoming limitations in dataset availability. Furthermore, we present a benchmark dataset for multi-semantic segmentation on thin slices, addressing a gap in current medical imaging research. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over traditional and hybrid architectures, offering new insights into the future of convolution-free medical image segmentation.</description>

      <title>Diverse Image Generation with Diffusion Models and Cross Class Label Learning for Polyp Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pathologic diagnosis is a critical phase in deciding the optimal treatment procedure for dealing with colorectal cancer (CRC). Colonic polyps, precursors to CRC, can pathologically be classified into two major types: adenomatous and hyperplastic. For precise classification and early diagnosis of such polyps, the medical procedure of colonoscopy has been widely adopted paired with various imaging techniques, including narrow band imaging and white light imaging. However, the existing classification techniques mainly rely on a single imaging modality and show limited performance due to data scarcity. Recently, generative artificial intelligence has been gaining prominence in overcoming such issues. Additionally, various generation-controlling mechanisms using text prompts and images have been introduced to obtain visually appealing and desired outcomes. However, such mechanisms require class labels to make the model respond efficiently to the provided control input. In the colonoscopy domain, such controlling mechanisms are rarely explored; specifically, the text prompt is a completely uninvestigated area. Moreover, the unavailability of expensive class-wise labels for diverse sets of images limits such explorations. Therefore, we develop a novel model, PathoPolyp-Diff, that generates text-controlled synthetic images with diverse characteristics in terms of pathology, imaging modalities, and quality. We introduce cross-class label learning to make the model learn features from other classes, reducing the burdensome task of data annotation. The experimental results report an improvement of up to 7.91% in balanced accuracy using a publicly available dataset. Moreover, cross-class label learning achieves a statistically significant improvement of up to 18.33% in balanced accuracy during video-level analysis. The code is available at https://github.com/Vanshali/PathoPolyp-Diff.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Self-Prior Embedding Neural Representation for Iterative Sparse-View CT Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging unsupervised implicit neural representation (INR) methods, such as NeRP, NeAT, and SCOPE, have shown great potential to address sparse-view computed tomography (SVCT) inverse problems. Although these INR-based methods perform well in relatively dense SVCT reconstructions, they struggle to achieve comparable performance to supervised methods in sparser SVCT scenarios. They are prone to being affected by noise, limiting their applicability in real clinical settings. Additionally, current methods have not fully explored the use of image domain priors for solving SVCsT inverse problems. In this work, we demonstrate that imperfect reconstruction results can provide effective image domain priors for INRs to enhance performance. To leverage this, we introduce Self-prior embedding neural representation (Spener), a novel unsupervised method for SVCT reconstruction that integrates iterative reconstruction algorithms. During each iteration, Spener extracts local image prior features from the previous iteration and embeds them to constrain the solution space. Experimental results on multiple CT datasets show that our unsupervised Spener method achieves performance comparable to supervised state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on in-domain data while outperforming them on out-of-domain datasets. Moreover, Spener significantly improves the performance of INR-based methods in handling SVCT with noisy sinograms. Our code is available at https://github.com/MeijiTian/Spener.</description>

      <title>4D VQ-GAN: Synthesising Medical Scans at Any Time Point for Personalised Disease Progression Modelling of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the progression trajectories of diseases is crucial for early diagnosis and effective treatment planning. This is especially vital for life-threatening conditions such as Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), a chronic, progressive lung disease with a prognosis comparable to many cancers. Computed tomography (CT) imaging has been established as a reliable diagnostic tool for IPF. Accurately predicting future CT scans of early-stage IPF patients can aid in developing better treatment strategies, thereby improving survival outcomes. In this paper, we propose 4D Vector Quantised Generative Adversarial Networks (4D-VQ-GAN), a model capable of generating realistic CT volumes of IPF patients at any time point. The model is trained using a two-stage approach. In the first stage, a 3D-VQ-GAN is trained to reconstruct CT volumes. In the second stage, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) based temporal model is trained to capture the temporal dynamics of the quantised embeddings generated by the encoder in the first stage. We evaluate different configurations of our model for generating longitudinal CT scans and compare the results against ground truth data, both quantitatively and qualitatively. For validation, we conduct survival analysis using imaging biomarkers derived from generated CT scans and achieve a C-index comparable to that of biomarkers derived from the real CT scans. The survival analysis results demonstrate the potential clinical utility inherent to generated longitudinal CT scans, showing that they can reliably predict survival outcomes.</description>

      <title>Image-Based Alzheimer's Disease Detection Using Pretrained Convolutional Neural Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease is an untreatable, progressive brain disorder that slowly robs people of their memory, thinking abilities, and ultimately their capacity to complete even the most basic tasks. Among older adults, it is the most frequent cause of dementia. Although there is presently no treatment for Alzheimer's disease, scientific trials are ongoing to discover drugs to combat the condition. Treatments to slow the signs of dementia are also available. Many researchers throughout the world became interested in developing computer-aided diagnosis systems to aid in the early identification of this deadly disease and assure an accurate diagnosis. In particular, image based approaches have been coupled with machine learning techniques to address the challenges of Alzheimer's disease detection. This study proposes a computer aided diagnosis system to detect Alzheimer's disease from biomarkers captured using neuroimaging techniques. The proposed approach relies on deep learning techniques to extract the relevant visual features from the image collection to accurately predict the Alzheimer's class value. In the experiments, standard datasets and pre-trained deep learning models were investigated. Moreover, standard performance measures were used to assess the models' performances. The obtained results proved that VGG16-based models outperform the state of the art performance.</description>

      <title>Inverse Problem Sampling in Latent Space Using Sequential Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In image processing, solving inverse problems is the task of finding plausible reconstructions of an image that was corrupted by some (usually known) degradation model. Commonly, this process is done using a generative image model that can guide the reconstruction towards solutions that appear natural. The success of diffusion models over the last few years has made them a leading candidate for this task. However, the sequential nature of diffusion models makes this conditional sampling process challenging. Furthermore, since diffusion models are often defined in the latent space of an autoencoder, the encoder-decoder transformations introduce additional difficulties. Here, we suggest a novel sampling method based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) in the latent space of diffusion models. We use the forward process of the diffusion model to add additional auxiliary observations and then perform an SMC sampling as part of the backward process. Empirical evaluations on ImageNet and FFHQ show the benefits of our approach over competing methods on various inverse problem tasks.</description>

      <title>A Generative Framework for Bidirectional Image-Report Understanding in Chest Radiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have unlocked their potential for multimodal tasks, where text and visual data are processed jointly. However, applying LLMs to medical imaging, particularly for chest X-rays (CXR), poses significant challenges due to the need for precise visual-textual alignment and the preservation of critical diagnostic details. In this paper, we propose Multi-Stage Adaptive Vision-Language Tuning (MAViLT), a novel framework designed to enhance multimodal reasoning and generation for CXR understanding. MAViLT incorporates a clinical gradient-weighted tokenization process and a hierarchical fine-tuning strategy, enabling it to generate accurate radiology reports, synthesize realistic CXRs from text, and answer vision-based clinical questions. We evaluate MAViLT on two benchmark datasets, MIMIC-CXR and Indiana University CXR, achieving state-of-the-art results across all tasks. Human evaluations further validate the clinical relevance and utility of MAViLT, making it a robust tool for real-world medical applications. This work demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging LLMs for multimodal medical imaging while addressing key challenges in vision-language integration.</description>

      <title>Multi-modal Data Fusion and Deep Ensemble Learning for Accurate Crop Yield Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces RicEns-Net, a novel Deep Ensemble model designed to predict crop yields by integrating diverse data sources through multimodal data fusion techniques. The research focuses specifically on the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), optical remote sensing data from Sentinel 1, 2, and 3 satellites, and meteorological measurements such as surface temperature and rainfall. The initial field data for the study were acquired through Ernst &amp; Young's (EY) Open Science Challenge 2023. The primary objective is to enhance the precision of crop yield prediction by developing a machine-learning framework capable of handling complex environmental data. A comprehensive data engineering process was employed to select the most informative features from over 100 potential predictors, reducing the set to 15 features from 5 distinct modalities. This step mitigates the ``curse of dimensionality" and enhances model performance. The RicEns-Net architecture combines multiple machine learning algorithms in a deep ensemble framework, integrating the strengths of each technique to improve predictive accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that RicEns-Net achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 341 kg/Ha (roughly corresponds to 5-6\% of the lowest average yield in the region), significantly exceeding the performance of previous state-of-the-art models, including those developed during the EY challenge.</description>

      <title>A Data-Efficient Pan-Tumor Foundation Model for Oncology CT Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence-assisted imaging analysis has made substantial strides in tumor diagnosis and management. Here we present PASTA, a pan-tumor CT foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on 45 of 46 representative oncology tasks -- including lesion segmentation, tumor detection in plain CT, tumor staging, survival prediction, structured report generation, and cross-modality transfer learning, significantly outperforming the second-best models on 35 tasks. This remarkable advancement is driven by our development of PASTA-Gen, an innovative synthetic tumor generation framework that produces a comprehensive dataset of 30,000 CT scans with pixel-level annotated lesions and paired structured reports, encompassing malignancies across ten organs and five benign lesion types. By leveraging this rich, high-quality synthetic data, we overcome a longstanding bottleneck in the development of CT foundation models -- specifically, the scarcity of publicly available, high-quality annotated datasets due to privacy constraints and the substantial labor required for scaling precise data annotation. Encouragingly, PASTA demonstrates exceptional data efficiency with promising practical value, markedly improving performance on various tasks with only a small amount of real-world data. The open release of both the synthetic dataset and PASTA foundation model effectively addresses the challenge of data scarcity, thereby advancing oncological research and clinical translation.</description>

      <title>Is an Ultra Large Natural Image-Based Foundation Model Superior to a Retina-Specific Model for Detecting Ocular and Systemic Diseases?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of foundation models (FMs) is transforming medical domain. In ophthalmology, RETFound, a retina-specific FM pre-trained sequentially on 1.4 million natural images and 1.6 million retinal images, has demonstrated high adaptability across clinical applications. Conversely, DINOv2, a general-purpose vision FM pre-trained on 142 million natural images, has shown promise in non-medical domains. However, its applicability to clinical tasks remains underexplored. To address this, we conducted head-to-head evaluations by fine-tuning RETFound and three DINOv2 models (large, base, small) for ocular disease detection and systemic disease prediction tasks, across eight standardized open-source ocular datasets, as well as the Moorfields AlzEye and the UK Biobank datasets. DINOv2-large model outperformed RETFound in detecting diabetic retinopathy (AUROC=0.850-0.952 vs 0.823-0.944, across three datasets, all P&lt;=0.007) and multi-class eye diseases (AUROC=0.892 vs. 0.846, P&lt;0.001). In glaucoma, DINOv2-base model outperformed RETFound (AUROC=0.958 vs 0.940, P&lt;0.001). Conversely, RETFound achieved superior performance over all DINOv2 models in predicting heart failure, myocardial infarction, and ischaemic stroke (AUROC=0.732-0.796 vs 0.663-0.771, all P&lt;0.001). These trends persisted even with 10% of the fine-tuning data. These findings showcase the distinct scenarios where general-purpose and domain-specific FMs excel, highlighting the importance of aligning FM selection with task-specific requirements to optimise clinical performance.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional MRI Reconstruction with Gaussian Representations: Tackling the Undersampling Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-Dimensional Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has shown substantial promise in the field of computer vision, but remains unexplored in the field of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This study explores its potential for the reconstruction of isotropic resolution 3D MRI from undersampled k-space data. We introduce a novel framework termed 3D Gaussian MRI (3DGSMR), which employs 3D Gaussian distributions as an explicit representation for MR volumes. Experimental evaluations indicate that this method can effectively reconstruct voxelized MR images, achieving a quality on par with that of well-established 3D MRI reconstruction techniques found in the literature. Notably, the 3DGSMR scheme operates under a self-supervised framework, obviating the need for extensive training datasets or prior model training. This approach introduces significant innovations to the domain, notably the adaptation of 3DGS to MRI reconstruction and the novel application of the existing 3DGS methodology to decompose MR signals, which are presented in a complex-valued format.</description>

      <title>Semantic-Aware Adaptive Video Streaming Using Latent Diffusion Models for Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel framework for real-time adaptive-bitrate video streaming by integrating latent diffusion models (LDMs) within the FFmpeg techniques. This solution addresses the challenges of high bandwidth usage, storage inefficiencies, and quality of experience (QoE) degradation associated with traditional constant bitrate streaming (CBS) and adaptive bitrate streaming (ABS). The proposed approach leverages LDMs to compress I-frames into a latent space, offering significant storage and semantic transmission savings without sacrificing high visual quality. While it keeps B-frames and P-frames as adjustment metadata to ensure efficient video reconstruction at the user side, the proposed framework is complemented with the most state-of-the-art denoising and video frame interpolation (VFI) techniques. These techniques mitigate semantic ambiguity and restore temporal coherence between frames, even in noisy wireless communication environments. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves high-quality video streaming with optimized bandwidth usage, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in terms of QoE and resource efficiency. This work opens new possibilities for scalable real-time video streaming in 5G and future post-5G networks.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Feature Fusion with Image-Driven Spatial Integration for Left Atrium Segmentation from Cardiac MRI Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the left atrium (LA) from late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging plays a vital role in visualizing diseased atrial structures, enabling the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular diseases. It is particularly essential for planning treatment with ablation therapy, a key intervention for atrial fibrillation (AF). However, manual segmentation is time-intensive and prone to inter-observer variability, underscoring the need for automated solutions. Class-agnostic foundation models like DINOv2 have demonstrated remarkable feature extraction capabilities in vision tasks. However, their lack of domain specificity and task-specific adaptation can reduce spatial resolution during feature extraction, impacting the capture of fine anatomical detail in medical imaging. To address this limitation, we propose a segmentation framework that integrates DINOv2 as an encoder with a UNet-style decoder, incorporating multi-scale feature fusion and input image integration to enhance segmentation accuracy. The learnable weighting mechanism dynamically prioritizes hierarchical features from different encoder blocks of the foundation model, optimizing feature selection for task relevance. Additionally, the input image is reintroduced during the decoding stage to preserve high-resolution spatial details, addressing limitations of downsampling in the encoder. We validate our approach on the LAScarQS 2022 dataset and demonstrate improved performance with a 92.3% Dice and 84.1% IoU score for giant architecture compared to the nnUNet baseline model. These findings emphasize the efficacy of our approach in advancing the field of automated left atrium segmentation from cardiac MRI.</description>

      <title>Label-free segmentation from cardiac ultrasound using self-supervised learning</title>

Abstract: Segmentation and measurement of cardiac chambers is critical in cardiac ultrasound but is laborious and poorly reproducible. Neural networks can assist, but supervised approaches require the same laborious manual annotations. We built a pipeline for self-supervised (no manual labels) segmentation combining computer vision, clinical domain knowledge, and deep learning. We trained on 450 echocardiograms (93,000 images) and tested on 8,393 echocardiograms (4,476,266 images; mean 61 years, 51% female), using the resulting segmentations to calculate biometrics. We also tested against external images from an additional 10,030 patients with available manual tracings of the left ventricle. r2 between clinically measured and pipeline-predicted measurements were similar to reported inter-clinician variation and comparable to supervised learning across several different measurements (r2 0.56-0.84). Average accuracy for detecting abnormal chamber size and function was 0.85 (range 0.71-0.97) compared to clinical measurements. A subset of test echocardiograms (n=553) had corresponding cardiac MRIs, where MRI is the gold standard. Correlation between pipeline and MRI measurements was similar to that between clinical echocardiogram and MRI. Finally, the pipeline accurately segments the left ventricle with an average Dice score of 0.89 (95% CI [0.89]) in the external, manually labeled dataset. Our results demonstrate a manual-label free, clinically valid, and highly scalable method for segmentation from ultrasound, a noisy but globally important imaging modality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing frequency and severity of wildfires requires advanced methods for effective surveillance and management. Traditional ground-based observation techniques often struggle to adapt to rapidly changing fire behavior and environmental conditions. This paper examines the application of multispectral aerial and satellite imagery in wildfire management, emphasizing the identification and analysis of key factors influencing wildfire behavior, such as combustible vegetation and water features. Through a comprehensive review of current literature and the presentation of two practical case studies, we assess various multispectral indices and evaluate their effectiveness in extracting critical environmental attributes essential for wildfire prevention and management. Our case studies highlight several indices as particularly effective for segmentation and extraction: NVDI for vegetation, MNDWI for water features, and MSR for artificial structures. These indices significantly enhance wildfire data processing, thereby supporting improved monitoring and response strategies.</description>

      <title>Mixed Graph Signal Analysis of Joint Image Denoising / Interpolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A noise-corrupted image often requires interpolation. Given a linear denoiser and a linear interpolator, when should the operations be independently executed in separate steps, and when should they be combined and jointly optimized? We study joint denoising / interpolation of images from a mixed graph filtering perspective: we model denoising using an undirected graph, and interpolation using a directed graph. We first prove that, under mild conditions, a linear denoiser is a solution graph filter to a maximum a posteriori (MAP) problem regularized using an undirected graph smoothness prior, while a linear interpolator is a solution to a MAP problem regularized using a directed graph smoothness prior. Next, we study two variants of the joint interpolation / denoising problem: a graph-based denoiser followed by an interpolator has an optimal separable solution, while an interpolator followed by a denoiser has an optimal non-separable solution. Experiments show that our joint denoising / interpolation method outperformed separate approaches noticeably.</description>

      <title>4D-ONIX: A deep learning approach for reconstructing 3D movies from sparse X-ray projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09508v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The X-ray flux provided by X-ray free-electron lasers and storage rings offers new spatiotemporal possibilities to study in-situ and operando dynamics, even using single pulses of such facilities. X-ray Multi-Projection Imaging (XMPI) is a novel technique that enables volumetric information using single pulses of such facilities and avoids centrifugal forces induced by state-of-the-art time-resolved 3D methods such as time-resolved tomography. As a result, XMPI offers the potential to acquire 3D movies (4D) at least three orders of magnitude faster than current methods. However, it is exceptionally challenging to reconstruct 4D from highly sparse projections as acquired by XMPI with current algorithms. Here, we present 4D-ONIX, a Deep Learning (DL)-based approach that learns to reconstruct 3D movies (4D) from an extremely limited number of projections. It combines the computational physical model of X-ray interaction with matter and state-of-the-art DL methods. We demonstrate the potential of 4D-ONIX to generate high-quality 4D by generalizing over multiple experiments with only two to three projections per timestamp for binary droplet collisions and additive manufacturing. We envision that 4D-ONIX will become an enabling tool for 4D analysis, offering new spatiotemporal resolutions to study processes not possible before.</description>

      <title>CAMSIC: Content-aware Masked Image Modeling Transformer for Stereo Image Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08505v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing learning-based stereo image codec adopt sophisticated transformation with simple entropy models derived from single image codecs to encode latent representations. However, those entropy models struggle to effectively capture the spatial-disparity characteristics inherent in stereo images, which leads to suboptimal rate-distortion results. In this paper, we propose a stereo image compression framework, named CAMSIC. CAMSIC independently transforms each image to latent representation and employs a powerful decoder-free Transformer entropy model to capture both spatial and disparity dependencies, by introducing a novel content-aware masked image modeling (MIM) technique. Our content-aware MIM facilitates efficient bidirectional interaction between prior information and estimated tokens, which naturally obviates the need for an extra Transformer decoder. Experiments show that our stereo image codec achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on two stereo image datasets Cityscapes and InStereo2K with fast encoding and decoding speed.

      <title>Endmember Extraction from Hyperspectral Images Using Self-Dictionary Approach with Linear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging technology has a wide range of applications, including forest management, mineral resource exploration, and Earth surface monitoring. A key step in utilizing this technology is endmember extraction, which aims to identify the spectral signatures of materials in observed scenes. Theoretical studies suggest that self-dictionary methods using linear programming (LP), known as Hottopixx methods, are effective in extracting endmembers. However, their practical application is hindered by high computational costs, as they require solving LP problems whose size grows quadratically with the number of pixels in the image. As a result, their actual effectiveness remains unclear. To address this issue, we propose an enhanced implementation of Hottopixx designed to reduce computational time and improve endmember extraction performance. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments. The results suggest that our implementation enables the application of Hottopixx for endmember extraction from real hyperspectral images and allows us to achieve reasonably high accuracy in estimating endmember signatures.</description>

      <title>Weakly-Supervised PET Anomaly Detection using Implicitly-Guided Attention-Conditional Counterfactual Diffusion Modeling: a Multi-Center, Multi-Cancer, and Multi-Tracer Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimizing the need for pixel-level annotated data to train PET lesion detection and segmentation networks is highly desired and can be transformative, given time and cost constraints associated with expert annotations. Current un-/weakly-supervised anomaly detection methods rely on autoencoder or generative adversarial networks trained only on healthy data; however GAN-based networks are more challenging to train due to issues with simultaneous optimization of two competing networks, mode collapse, etc. In this paper, we present the weakly-supervised Implicitly guided COuNterfactual diffusion model for Detecting Anomalies in PET images (IgCONDA-PET). The solution is developed and validated using PET scans from six retrospective cohorts consisting of a total of 2652 cases containing both local and public datasets. The training is conditioned on image class labels (healthy vs. unhealthy) via attention modules, and we employ implicit diffusion guidance. We perform counterfactual generation which facilitates "unhealthy-to-healthy" domain translation by generating a synthetic, healthy version of an unhealthy input image, enabling the detection of anomalies through the calculated differences. The performance of our method was compared against several other deep learning based weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods as well as traditional methods like 41% SUVmax thresholding. We also highlight the importance of incorporating attention modules in our network for the detection of small anomalies. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ahxmeds/IgCONDA-PET.git.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Resonance Image Processing Transformer for General Accelerated Image Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled the development of generalizable models that achieve state-of-the-art performance across various imaging tasks. Vision Transformer (ViT)-based architectures, in particular, have demonstrated strong feature extraction capabilities when pre-trained on large-scale datasets. In this work, we introduce the Magnetic Resonance Image Processing Transformer (MR-IPT), a ViT-based framework designed to enhance the generalizability and robustness of accelerated MRI reconstruction. Unlike conventional deep learning models that require separate training for different acceleration factors, MR-IPT is pre-trained on a large-scale dataset encompassing multiple undersampling patterns and acceleration settings, enabling a unified reconstruction framework. By leveraging a shared transformer backbone, MR-IPT effectively learns universal feature representations, allowing it to generalize across diverse reconstruction tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR-IPT outperforms both CNN-based and existing transformer-based methods, achieving superior reconstruction quality across varying acceleration factors and sampling masks. Moreover, MR-IPT exhibits strong robustness, maintaining high performance even under unseen acquisition setups, highlighting its potential as a scalable and efficient solution for accelerated MRI. Our findings suggest that transformer-based general models can significantly advance MRI reconstruction, offering improved adaptability and stability compared to traditional deep learning approaches.</description>

      <title>CISCA and CytoDArk0: a Cell Instance Segmentation and Classification method for histo(patho)logical image Analyses and a new, open, Nissl-stained dataset for brain cytoarchitecture studies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Delineating and classifying individual cells in microscopy tissue images is inherently challenging yet remains essential for advancements in medical and neuroscientific research. In this work, we propose a new deep learning framework, CISCA, for automatic cell instance segmentation and classification in histological slices. At the core of CISCA is a network architecture featuring a lightweight U-Net with three heads in the decoder. The first head classifies pixels into boundaries between neighboring cells, cell bodies, and background, while the second head regresses four distance maps along four directions. The outputs from the first and second heads are integrated through a tailored post-processing step, which ultimately produces the segmentation of individual cells. The third head enables the simultaneous classification of cells into relevant classes, if required. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using four datasets, including CoNIC, PanNuke, and MoNuSeg, which are publicly available H&amp;Estained datasets that cover diverse tissue types and magnifications. In addition, we introduce CytoDArk0, the first annotated dataset of Nissl-stained histological images of the mammalian brain, containing nearly 40k annotated neurons and glia cells, aimed at facilitating advancements in digital neuropathology and brain cytoarchitecture studies. We evaluate CISCA against other state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its versatility, robustness, and accuracy in segmenting and classifying cells across diverse tissue types, magnifications, and staining techniques. This makes CISCA well-suited for detailed analyses of cell morphology and efficient cell counting in both digital pathology workflows and brain cytoarchitecture research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The attention mechanism is the key to the success of transformers in different machine learning tasks. However, the quadratic complexity with respect to the sequence length of the vanilla softmax-based attention mechanism becomes the major bottleneck for the application of long sequence tasks, such as vision tasks. Although various efficient linear attention mechanisms have been proposed, they need to sacrifice performance to achieve high efficiency. What's more, memory-efficient methods, such as FlashAttention-1-3, still have quadratic computation complexity which can be further improved. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient linear fast attention (ELFATT) mechanism to achieve low memory input/output operations, linear computational complexity, and high performance at the same time. ELFATT offers 4-7x speedups over the vanilla softmax-based attention mechanism in high-resolution vision tasks without losing performance. ELFATT is FlashAttention friendly. Using FlashAttention-2 acceleration, ELFATT still offers 2-3x speedups over the vanilla softmax-based attention mechanism on high-resolution vision tasks without losing performance. Even on edge GPUs, ELFATT still offers 1.6x to 2.0x speedups compared to state-of-the-art attention mechanisms in various power modes from 5W to 60W. Furthermore, ELFATT can be used to enhance and accelerate diffusion tasks directly without training.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel generative approach based on Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs), which produces high-quality image samples along with their losslessly compressed bit-stream representations. This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</description>

      <title>MOS: Model Synergy for Test-Time Adaptation on LiDAR-Based 3D Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14878v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LiDAR-based 3D object detection is crucial for various applications but often experiences performance degradation in real-world deployments due to domain shifts. While most studies focus on cross-dataset shifts, such as changes in environments and object geometries, practical corruptions from sensor variations and weather conditions remain underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel online test-time adaptation framework for 3D detectors that effectively tackles these shifts, including a challenging cross-corruption scenario where cross-dataset shifts and corruptions co-occur. By leveraging long-term knowledge from previous test batches, our approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting and adapts effectively to diverse shifts. Specifically, we propose a Model Synergy (MOS) strategy that dynamically selects historical checkpoints with diverse knowledge and assembles them to best accommodate the current test batch. This assembly is directed by our proposed Synergy Weights (SW), which perform a weighted averaging of the selected checkpoints, minimizing redundancy in the composite model. The SWs are computed by evaluating the similarity of predicted bounding boxes on the test data and the independence of features between checkpoint pairs in the model bank. To maintain an efficient and informative model bank, we discard checkpoints with the lowest average SW scores, replacing them with newly updated models. Our method was rigorously tested against existing test-time adaptation strategies across three datasets and eight types of corruptions, demonstrating superior adaptability to dynamic scenes and conditions. Notably, it achieved a 67.3% improvement in a challenging cross-corruption scenario, offering a more comprehensive benchmark for adaptation.

      <title>Towards Defining an Efficient and Expandable File Format for AI-Generated Contents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, AI-generated content (AIGC) has gained significant traction due to its powerful creation capability. However, the storage and transmission of large amounts of high-quality AIGC images inevitably pose new challenges for recent file formats. To overcome this, we define a new file format for AIGC images, named AIGIF, enabling ultra-low bitrate coding of AIGC images. Unlike compressing AIGC images intuitively with pixel-wise space as existing file formats, AIGIF instead compresses the generation syntax. This raises a crucial question: Which generation syntax elements, e.g., text prompt, device configuration, etc, are necessary for compression/transmission? To answer this question, we systematically investigate the effects of three essential factors: platform, generative model, and data configuration. We experimentally find that a well-designed composable bitstream structure incorporating the above three factors can achieve an impressive compression ratio of even up to 1/10,000 while still ensuring high fidelity. We also introduce an expandable syntax in AIGIF to support the extension of the most advanced generation models to be developed in the future.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Learned Image Compression via Cross Window-based Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21144v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, learned image compression methods have demonstrated superior rate-distortion performance compared to traditional image compression methods. Recent methods utilize convolutional neural networks (CNN), variational autoencoders (VAE), invertible neural networks (INN), and transformers. Despite their significant contributions, a main drawback of these models is their poor performance in capturing local redundancy. Therefore, to leverage global features along with local redundancy, we propose a CNN-based solution integrated with a feature encoding module. The feature encoding module encodes important features before feeding them to the CNN and then utilizes cross-scale window-based attention, which further captures local redundancy. Cross-scale window-based attention is inspired by the attention mechanism in transformers and effectively enlarges the receptive field. Both the feature encoding module and the cross-scale window-based attention module in our architecture are flexible and can be incorporated into any other network architecture. We evaluate our method on the Kodak and CLIC datasets and demonstrate that our approach is effective and on par with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Commissioning An All-Sky Infrared Camera Array for Detection Of Airborne Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To date there is little publicly available scientific data on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) whose properties and kinematics purportedly reside outside the performance envelope of known phenomena. To address this deficiency, the Galileo Project is designing, building, and commissioning a multi-modal ground-based observatory to continuously monitor the sky and conduct a rigorous long-term aerial census of all aerial phenomena, including natural and human-made. One of the key instruments is an all-sky infrared camera array using eight uncooled long-wave infrared FLIR Boson 640 cameras. Their calibration includes a novel extrinsic calibration method using airplane positions from Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data. We establish a first baseline for the system performance over five months of field operation, using a real-world dataset derived from ADS-B data, synthetic 3-D trajectories, and a hand-labelled real-world dataset. We report acceptance rates (e.g. viewable airplanes that are recorded) and detection efficiencies (e.g. recorded airplanes which are successfully detected) for a variety of weather conditions, range and aircraft size. We reconstruct $\sim$500,000 trajectories of aerial objects from this commissioning period. A toy outlier search focused on large sinuosity of the 2-D reconstructed trajectories flags about 16% of trajectories as outliers. After manual review, 144 trajectories remain ambiguous: they are likely mundane objects but cannot be elucidated at this stage of development without distance and kinematics estimation or other sensor modalities. Our observed count of ambiguous outliers combined with systematic uncertainties yields an upper limit of 18,271 outliers count for the five-month interval at a 95% confidence level. This likelihood-based method to evaluate significance is applicable to all of our future outlier searches.</description>

      <title>TACO: Training-free Sound Prompted Segmentation via Semantically Constrained Audio-visual CO-factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale pre-trained audio and image models demonstrate an unprecedented degree of generalization, making them suitable for a wide range of applications. Here, we tackle the specific task of sound-prompted segmentation, aiming to segment image regions corresponding to objects heard in an audio signal. Most existing approaches tackle this problem by fine-tuning pre-trained models or by training additional modules specifically for the task. We adopt a different strategy: we introduce a training-free approach that leverages Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to co-factorize audio and visual features from pre-trained models so as to reveal shared interpretable concepts. These concepts are passed on to an open-vocabulary segmentation model for precise segmentation maps. By using frozen pre-trained models, our method achieves high generalization and establishes state-of-the-art performance in unsupervised sound-prompted segmentation, significantly surpassing previous unsupervised methods.</description>
