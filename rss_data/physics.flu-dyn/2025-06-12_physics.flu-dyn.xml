      <title>Interfacial deformation and energy exchange in strong free-surface turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of strong free-surface turbulence (SFST) using direct numerical simulations (DNS). We focus on the energy exchange between the deformed free-surface and underlying turbulence, examining the influence of Reynolds ($Re$), Froude ($Fr$), and Weber ($We$) numbers. The two-fluid DNS of SFST at high $Fr$ and $We$ is able to incorporate air entrainment effects in a statistical steady-state. Results reveal that high $We$ primarily affects entrained bubble shapes (sphericity), while $Fr$ significantly alters free-surface deformation, two-dimensional compressibility, and turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) modulation. Vorticity flux across the interface occurs from viscous diffusion of surface-parallel structures. At lower $Fr$, kinetic energy is redistributed between horizontal and vertical components, aligning with rapid distortion theory (RDT), whereas higher $Fr$ preserves isotropy near the surface. Evidence of a reverse or dual energy cascade is verified through third-order structure functions, with a strong net reverse cascade near the integral length scale, and enhanced vertical kinetic energy in upwelling eddies. Discrete wavelet transforms (DWT) of TKE show weaker decay at smallest scales near the interface, suggesting contributions from gravitational energy conversion and reduced dissipation. The wavelet energy spectra also exhibits different scaling laws across the wavenumber range, with a $-3$ slope within the inertial subrange. These findings highlight scale- and proximity-dependent effects on two-phase TKE transport, with implications for sub-grid modeling. This work underscores the need for advanced analytical tools that allow for localization in both physical and spectral domains to further elucidate the complex energy cascade mechanisms in SFST.</description>

      <title>Effects of the sheared flow velocity profile shape on impedance eduction in a 2D duct</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess the impact of the flow profile shape on acoustic propagation in a two-dimensional duct within the typical operating range of impedance eduction facilities. Firstly, a numerical experiment is proposed in which the Pridmore--Brown equation is assumed to represent the true physical behaviour, and is used with both simplified flow profiles commonly used in the literature and a realistic representation of a turbulent boundary layer using a van Driest universal law of the wall model. The data from these numerical experiments are then used with a traditional impedance eduction process, and the resulting variation in obtained impedances are investigated. Secondly, we apply a less-traditional impedance eduction method that incorporates the sheared velocity profile to data obtained from real-world experiments. The results suggest that the Ingard--Myers boundary condition remains a good approximation to a realistic boundary layer profile, such as the universal law of the wall, at least in the two-dimensional case. However, it is also shown that the simplified flow profiles often used in the literature can lead to significant deviations from the results obtained using a realistic velocity distribution.</description>

      <title>Onsager Coefficients for Liquid Metal Flow in a Conduit under a Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the flow of room and near room-temperature liquid metals in shallow, long rectangular conduits with two insulating and two perfectly conducting walls under a uniform magnetic field perpendicular to the flow direction and the insulating surfaces, focusing on moderate Hartmann numbers. A pressure gradient and Lorentz body forces may drive or oppose the flow. We derive explicit expressions for the Onsager coefficients that relate the flow rate and electric current on the one hand to the potential difference across electrodes and the pressure gradient on the other hand. We further demonstrate that these coefficients satisfy Onsager-Casimir reciprocity. These simplified expressions provide a convenient framework for analyzing, optimizing, and controlling magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) machines operating with liquid metals in applications such as power conversion, energy harvesting, pumping, actuation, valving, breaking, and sensing without moving components.</description>

      <title>Attention on flow control: transformer-based reinforcement learning for lift regulation in highly disturbed flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear flow control strategy designed for weak disturbances may not remain effective in sequences of strong disturbances due to nonlinear interactions, but it is sensible to leverage it for developing a better strategy. In the present study, we propose a transformer-based reinforcement learning (RL) framework to learn an effective control strategy for regulating aerodynamic lift in gust sequences via pitch control. The transformer addresses the challenge of partial observability from limited surface pressure sensors. We demonstrate that the training can be accelerated with two techniques -- pretraining with an expert policy (here, linear control) and task-level transfer learning (here, extending a policy trained on isolated gusts to multiple gusts). We show that the learned strategy outperforms the best proportional control, with the performance gap widening as the number of gusts increases. The control strategy learned in an environment with a small number of successive gusts is shown to effectively generalize to an environment with an arbitrarily long sequence of gusts. We investigate the pivot configuration and show that quarter-chord pitching control can achieve superior lift regulation with substantially less control effort compared to mid-chord pitching control. Through a decomposition of the lift, we attribute this advantage to the dominant added-mass contribution accessible via quarter-chord pitching. The success on multiple configurations shows the generalizability of the proposed transformer-based RL framework, which offers a promising approach to solve more computationally demanding flow control problems when combined with the proposed acceleration techniques.</description>

      <title>Aerodynamics and Aeroacoustics of da Vinci's Aerial Screw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leonardo da Vinci's aerial screw, conceived in the 15th century, represents one of the earliest conceptualizations of lift-generating rotary flight. Despite its historical significance, the aerodynamic and aeroacoustic performance of this rotor has received limited scientific attention. In this study, we employ direct numerical simulations to analyze the aerodynamic forces and acoustic emissions of a modernized da Vinci aerial screw design across a range of Reynolds numbers (2000, 4000, and 8000). These results are compared against those from a canonical two-bladed rotor producing similar lift. The aerial screw demonstrates significantly lower mechanical power consumption and acoustic intensity per unit lift, primarily due to its larger wetted area and correspondingly lower rotational speed. Although the aerial screw exhibits a lower lift coefficient and much of its surface contributes minimally to lift generation, the net performance under iso-lift conditions highlights its efficiency and reduced noise signature. The continuous spiral geometry of the aerial screw also helps suppress blade-vortex interaction noise common in multi-bladed systems. These findings support previous scaling analyses and point toward unconventional rotor designs as viable options for low-noise aerial platforms.</description>

      <title>Modelling of Counter-Current Gas-Liquid Annular Flow in a Vertical Annulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Annular two-phase flow involving upward-moving gas and downward-flowing liquid within a vertical annular geometry is a common configuration in various engineering systems. In such systems, accurately predicting the pressure gradient is essential for understanding flow stability, equipment performance, and system design under counter-current conditions. This paper presents a general mechanistic model to predict the pressure gradient in counter-current annular flow within a vertical annular space. The model accounts for liquid film behaviour, droplet entrainment, and interfacial shear. Model predictions show that the pressure gradient increases with rising gas flow rate. The increase in pressure gradient is attributed to a higher entrainment of liquid droplets into the gas core and enhanced interfacial forces between the phases.</description>

Abstract: Starting from the Navier-Stokes equation in the $f$-plane approximation, we provide an exact and explicit solution of the governing equations at leading order for fluid flows in the upper layer of the ocean, driven by a wind stress. Such a solution highlights the presence of a mean Ekman current superimposed to trochoidal oscillations and a background geostrophic current.</description>

      <title>Predicting air flow in calendered paper sheets from $\mu$-CT data: combining physics with morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the macroscopic properties of thin fiber-based porous materials from their microscopic morphology remains challenging because of the structural heterogeneity of these materials. In this study, computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed to compute volume air flow based on tomographic image data of uncompressed and compressed paper sheets. To reduce computational demands, a pore network model was employed, allowing volume air flow to be approximated with less computational effort. To improve prediction accuracy, geometric descriptors of the pore space, such as porosity, surface area, median pore radius, and geodesic tortuosity, were combined with predictions of the pore network model. This integrated approach significantly improves the predictive power of the pore network model and indicates which aspects of the pore space morphology are not accurately represented within the pore network model. In particular, we illustrate that a high correlation among descriptors does not necessarily imply redundancy in a combined prediction.</description>

      <title>Vortex-magnetic competition and regime transitions in antiparallel flux tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex-magnetic interactions shape magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, influencing energy transfer in astrophysical, geophysical, and industrial systems. On the Sun, granular-scale vortex flows couple strongly with magnetic fields, channelling energy into the corona. At high Reynolds numbers, vorticity and magnetic fields are nearly frozen into the charged fluid, and MHD flows emerge from the interplay between vortex dynamics and Lorentz forces. To probe this competition in a controlled setting, we revisit the canonical problem of two antiparallel flux tubes. By varying the magnetic flux threading each tube--and thus sweeping the interaction parameter $N_i$, which gauges Lorentz-to-inertial force balance--we uncover three distinct regimes: vortex-dominated joint reconnection, instability-triggered cascade, and Lorentz-induced vortex disruption. At low $N_i$, classical vortex dynamics dominate, driving joint vortex-magnetic reconnection and amplifying magnetic energy via a dynamo effect. At moderate $N_i$, the system oscillates between vorticity-driven attraction and magnetic damping, triggering instabilities and nonlinear interactions that spawn secondary filaments and drive an energy cascade. At high $N_i$, Lorentz forces suppress vortex interactions, aligning the tubes axially while disrupting vortex cores and rapidly converting magnetic to kinetic energy. These findings reveal how the inertial-Lorentz balance governs energy transfer and coherent structure formation in MHD turbulence, offering insight into vortex-magnetic coevolution in astrophysical plasmas.</description>

      <title>OmniFluids: Unified Physics Pre-trained Modeling of Fluid Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity and efficient simulation of fluid dynamics drive progress in various scientific and engineering applications. Traditional computational fluid dynamics methods offer strong interpretability and guaranteed convergence, but rely on fine spatial and temporal meshes, incurring prohibitive computational costs. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and neural operators aim to accelerate PDE solvers using deep learning techniques. However, PINNs require extensive retraining and careful tuning, and purely data-driven operators demand large labeled datasets. Hybrid physics-aware methods embed numerical discretizations into network architectures or loss functions, but achieve marginal speed gains and become unstable when balancing coarse priors against high-fidelity measurements. To this end, we introduce OmniFluids, a unified physics pre-trained operator learning framework that integrates physics-only pre-training, coarse-grid operator distillation, and few-shot fine-tuning, which enables fast inference and accurate prediction under limited or zero data supervision. For architectural design, the key components of OmniFluids include a mixture of operators, a multi-frame decoder, and factorized Fourier layers, which enable efficient and scalable modeling of diverse physical tasks while maintaining seamless integration with physics-based supervision. Across a broad range of two- and three-dimensional benchmarks, OmniFluids significantly outperforms state-of-the-art AI-driven methods in flow field reconstruction and turbulence statistics accuracy, delivering 10-100x speedups compared to classical solvers, and accurately recovers unknown physical parameters from sparse, noisy data. This work establishes a new paradigm for efficient and generalizable surrogate modeling in complex fluid systems under limited data availability.</description>

      <title>Understanding the mismatch between in-vivo and in-silico rhinomanometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulations and clinical measurements of nasal resistance are in quantitative disagreement. Bias introduced by the design of medical devices has not been considered until now as a possible explanation. The aim of present paper is to study the effect of the location of the probe on the rhinomanometer that is meant to measure the ambient pressure. Rhinomanometry is carried out on a 3D silicone model of a patient-specific anatomy; a clinical device and dedicated sensors are employed side-by-side for mutual validation. The same anatomy is also employed for numerical simulations, with approaches spanning a wide range of fidelity levels. We find that the intrinsic uncertainty of the numerical simulations is of minor importance. To the contrary, the position of the pressure tap intended to acquire the external pressure in the clinical device is crucial, and can cause a mismatch comparable to that generally observed between in-silico and in-vivo rhinomanometry data. A source of systematic bias may therefore exist in rhinomanometers, designed under the assumption that measurements of the nasal resistance are unaffected by the flow development within the instruments.</description>

      <title>Experimental investigation of the flow rate--pressure drop relation of a viscoelastic Boger fluid in a deformable channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the steady flow-induced deformation between an incompressible non-Newtonian fluid and a three-dimensional (3D) deformable channel. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive experimental--theoretical framework for such flows of constant-viscosity viscoelastic (i.e., Boger) fluids, which allows us to quantify the influence of the fluid's viscoelasticity on the flow rate--pressure drop ($q-\Delta p$) relation. For a flow-rate-controlled regime and weakly viscoelastic flow, we find excellent agreement between the theoretical prediction and experimental results, specifically providing an experimental demonstration of how both wall compliance and fluid viscoelasticity decrease the pressure drop. To definitively demonstrate the coupled effect of wall compliance and fluid viscoelasticity (change of cross-sectional area and curving of streamlines), we perform experiments in an equivalent rigid channel, showing that both the Boger fluid and a viscosity-matched Newtonian fluid have the same pressure drop. Thus, the experimentally verified theory for the $q-\Delta p$ relation of weakly viscoelastic flows of Boger fluids in compliant channels can now be used for microfluidic system design involving complex fluids.</description>

      <title>Modelling intermediate internal waves with currents and variable bottom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A model for internal interfacial waves between two layers of fluid in the presence of current and variable bottom is studied in the flat-surface approximation. Fluids are assumed to be incompressible and inviscid. Another assumption is that the upper layer is considerably deeper with a lower density than the lower layer. The fluid dynamics is presented in Hamiltonian form with appropriate Dirichlet-Neumann operators for the two fluid domains, and the depth-dependent current is taken into account. The well known integrable Intermediate Long Wave Equation (ILWE) is derived as an asymptotic internal waves model in the case of flat bottom. For a non-flat bottom the ILWE is with variable coefficients. Two limits of the ILWE lead to the integrable Benjamin-Ono and Korteweg-de Vries equations. Higher-order ILWE is obtained as well.</description>

Abstract: We consider the non-linear dynamics governing the break-up of a two-dimensional strip of active chiral fluid. We observe that the strip thickness goes to zero at the pinch off points as a power law in finite time. Using slender body theory combined with a scaling analysis, we identify a new class of scaling exponents and scaling functions characterizing the speed and shape of break-up in these systems. The scaling analysis is in excellent agreement with direct numerical simulations of the hydrodynamic equations</description>

      <title>Pushing the Limits of Extreme Weather: Constructing Extreme Heatwave Storylines with Differentiable Climate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the plausible upper bounds of extreme weather events is essential for risk assessment in a warming climate. Existing methods, based on large ensembles of physics-based models, are often computationally expensive or lack the fidelity needed to simulate rare, high-impact extremes. Here, we present a novel framework that leverages a differentiable hybrid climate model, NeuralGCM, to optimize initial conditions and generate physically consistent worst-case heatwave trajectories. Applied to the 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave, our method produces temperature anomalies up to 3.7 $^\circ$C above the most extreme member of a 75-member ensemble. These trajectories feature intensified atmospheric blocking and amplified Rossby wave patterns--hallmarks of severe heat events. Our results demonstrate that differentiable climate models can efficiently explore the upper tails of event likelihoods, providing a powerful new approach for constructing targeted storylines of extreme weather under climate change.</description>

      <title>A novel visual data-based diagnostic approach for estimation of regime transition in pool boiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel metric, the Index of Visual Similarity (IVS), to qualitatively characterize boiling heat transfer regimes using only visual data. The IVS is constructed by combining morphological similarity, through SIFT-based feature matching, with physical similarity, via vapor area estimation using Mask R-CNN. High-speed images of pool boiling on two distinct surfaces, polished copper and porous copper foam, are employed to demonstrate the generalizability of the approach. IVS captures critical changes in bubble shape, size, and distribution that correspond to transitions in heat transfer mechanisms. The metric is validated against an equivalent metric, $\Phi$, derived from measured heat transfer coefficients (HTC), showing strong correlation and reliability in detecting boiling regime transitions, including the onset of nucleate boiling and proximity to critical heat flux (CHF). Given experimental limitations in precisely measuring changes in HTC, the sensitivity of IVS to surface superheat is also examined to reinforce the credibility of IVS. IVS thus emerges as a powerful, rapid, and non-intrusive tool for real-time, image-based boiling diagnostics, with promising applications in phase change heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Dual Theory of Turbulent Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10205v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical solution for incompressible turbulent mixing governed by the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations, with a passive scalar (such as concentration or temperature) advected by the turbulent velocity field. Building on our recent formulation of decaying turbulence via the Euler ensemble, we express the correlation functions of the passive scalar as statistical averages over this ensemble.
  Employing a novel and significantly simplified method for computing the statistical limit of the Euler ensemble, we derive the scalar energy spectrum and its scaling functions. The leading term of the spectrum exhibits universal decay as $t^{-5/4}$, independent of the Schmidt number - mirroring the decay of turbulent kinetic energy. However, the subleading contributions differ markedly and reveal a rich structure: we obtain a universal closed-form expression involving sums and integrals, with power-law exponents restricted to negative half-integer values.
  Although the scaling exponents are universal, the corresponding pre-exponential factors show strong dependence on the Schmidt number. This sensitivity may give the appearance of non-universality in direct numerical simulations (DNS), unless properly accounted for.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification and stability of neural operators for prediction of three-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence poses challenges for numerical simulation due to its chaotic, multiscale nature and high computational cost. Traditional turbulence modeling often struggles with accuracy and long-term stability. Recent scientific machine learning (SciML) models, such as Fourier Neural Operators (FNO), show promise in solving PDEs, but are typically limited to one-step-ahead predictions and often fail over long time horizons, especially in 3D turbulence. This study proposes a framework to assess the reliability of neural operator models in turbulent flows. Using three-dimensional forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) as a benchmark, we evaluate models in terms of uncertainty quantification (UQ), error propagation, and sensitivity to initial perturbations. Statistical tools such as error distribution analysis and autocorrelation functions (ACF) are used to assess predictive robustness and temporal coherence. Our proposed model, the factorized-implicit FNO (F-IFNO), improves long-term stability and accuracy by incorporating implicit factorization into the prediction process. It outperforms conventional LES and other FNO-based models in balancing accuracy, stability, and efficiency. The results highlight the importance of prediction constraints, time interval selection, and UQ in developing robust neural operator frameworks for turbulent systems.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian analysis of turbulent blood flow in the human left heart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a Lagrangian analysis of turbulent blood flow in the human left heart using high-fidelity simulations based on a patient-specific anatomical model. Leveraging a fully coupled fluid-structure-electrophysiology interaction (FSEI) framework, we track the motion of Lagrangian (passive) tracers to investigate the multiscale statistical properties of velocity fluctuations over more than four decades. Our analysis reveals strong Lagrangian intermittency throughout the left heart, reflecting the complex and unsteady nature of cardiovascular flow. The present work underscores the sensitivity of Lagrangian statistics to physiological parameters and highlights their potential for improving the understanding of pathological flow conditions in cardiovascular systems. Such Lagrangian tool provides a statistical foundation for modeling shear-induced damage in red blood cells (hemolysis), with implications for the evaluation of prosthetic valves and blood-contacting medical devices.</description>

      <title>Droplet on a sugar fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motion of a water droplet on a single vertical sugar fiber is analyzed. The fiber is positioned vertically, with the droplet placed at its pending end. If the capillary force exceeds the weight of the droplet, the droplet remains suspended at the fiber's extremity. As water dissolves, the fiber eventually breaks. Subsequently, the droplet may fall down carrying a portion of the undissolved fiber or, more interestingly, the droplet may be propelled upwards, remaining attached to the fiber. The process can then restart. A phase diagram is constructed based on the droplet's volume and the fiber's diameter. A model has been built to assess the critical droplet volume for a given fiber diameter, above which the droplet falls. Below this volume, the droplet can move upwards along the fiber.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium-distribution-function based mesoscopic finite-difference methods for partial differential equations: Modeling and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, based on the idea of direct discrete modeling (DDM) with equilibrium distribution functions (EDFs), we develop a general framework of the mesoscopic numerical method (MesoNM) for macroscopic partial differential equations (PDEs), including but not limited to the nonlinear convection-diffusion equation (NCDE) and the Navier-Stokes equations (NSEs). Unlike the mesoscopic lattice Boltzmann method, this kind of MesoNM is an EDF-based mesoscopic finite-difference (MesoFD) method, and by taking the moments of the MesoFD scheme, its macroscopic version, called MMFD method, can be derived directly. Both MesoFD scheme and MMFD schemes are multi-level FD methods, MesoFD scheme being mesoscopic, and MMFD scheme being its macroscopic form which has the form of the central FD scheme. They are unified FD schemes for PDEs and can be in implicit or explicit forms as needed. The macroscopic moment equations (MEs) can be derived from the MesoFD or MMFD scheme through the Taylor expansion method, and the common PDEs can be recovered from the MEs by using the direct Taylor expansion method. Moreover, the stability of the MMFD scheme is analyzed for linear CDE and liner wave equation with anisotropic diffusion, and the stability conditions of a two-level explicit MMFD scheme, a two-level $\theta$-MMFD scheme (hybrid explicit and implicit MMFD scheme), and a three-level MMFD scheme are obtained, respectively. Finally, we note that some existing lattice Boltzmann (LB) based macroscopic FD models for the NSEs and NCDE are the special cases of present MMFD, which can be considered as a unified framework of FD schemes for PDEs, from this point of view.</description>
