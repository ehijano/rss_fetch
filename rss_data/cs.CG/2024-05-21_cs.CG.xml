      <title>Nearly Orthogonal Sets over Finite Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a field $\mathbb{F}$ and integers $d$ and $k$, a set of vectors of $\mathbb{F}^d$ is called $k$-nearly orthogonal if its members are non-self-orthogonal and every $k+1$ of them include an orthogonal pair. We prove that for every prime $p$ there exists a positive constant $\delta = \delta (p)$, such that for every field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p$ and for all integers $k \geq 2$ and $d \geq k^{1/(p-1)}$, there exists a $k$-nearly orthogonal set of at least $d^{\delta \cdot k^{1/(p-1)}/ \log k}$ vectors of $\mathbb{F}^d$. In particular, for the binary field we obtain a set of $d^{\Omega( k /\log k)}$ vectors, and this is tight up to the $\log k$ term in the exponent. For comparison, the best known lower bound over the reals is $d^{\Omega( \log k / \log \log k)}$ (Alon and Szegedy, Graphs and Combin., 1999). The proof combines probabilistic and spectral arguments.</description>

      <title>New examples and partial classification of 15-vertex triangulations of the quaternionic projective plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Brehm and K\"uhnel (1992) constructed three 15-vertex combinatorial 8-manifolds `like the quaternionic projective plane' with symmetry groups $\mathrm{A}_5$, $\mathrm{A}_4$, and $\mathrm{S}_3$, respectively. Gorodkov (2016) proved that these three manifolds are in fact PL homeomorphic to $\mathbb{HP}^2$. Note that 15 is the minimal number of vertices of a combinatorial 8-manifold that is not PL homeomorphic to $S^8$. In the present paper we construct a lot of new 15-vertex triangulations of $\mathbb{HP}^2$. A surprising fact is that such examples are found for very different symmetry groups, including those not in any way related to the group $\mathrm{A}_5$. Namely, we find 19 triangulations with symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_7$, one triangulation with symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_6\times\mathrm{C}_2$, 14 triangulations with symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_6$, 26 triangulations with symmetry group $\mathrm{C}_5$, one new triangulation with symmetry group $\mathrm{A}_4$, and 11 new triangulations with symmetry group $\mathrm{S}_3$. Further, we obtain the following classification result. We prove that, up to isomorphism, there are exactly 75 triangulations of $\mathbb{HP}^2$ with 15 vertices and symmetry group of order at least 4: the three Brehm-K\"uhnel triangulations and the 72 new triangulations listed above. On the other hand, we show that there are plenty of triangulations with symmetry groups $\mathrm{C}_3$ and $\mathrm{C}_2$, as well as the trivial symmetry group.</description>

      <title>Polycube Layouts via Iterative Dual Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polycube layouts for 3D models effectively support a wide variety of applications such as hexahedral mesh construction, seamless texture mapping, spline fitting, and multi-block grid generation. However, the automated construction of valid polycube layouts suffers from robustness issues: the state-of-the-art deformation-based methods are not guaranteed to find a valid solution. In this paper we present a novel approach which is guaranteed to return a valid polycube layout for 3D models of genus 0. Our algorithm is based on a dual representation of polycubes; we construct polycube layouts by iteratively adding or removing dual loops. The iterative nature of our algorithm facilitates a seamless trade-off between quality and complexity of the solution. Our method is efficient and can be implemented using comparatively simple algorithmic building blocks. We experimentally compare the results of our algorithm against state-of-the-art methods. Our fully automated method always produces provably valid polycube layouts whose quality - assessed via the quality of derived hexahedral meshes - is on par with state-of-the-art deformation methods.</description>
