      <title>Higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function: Obstructions to symmetry-preserving gapped edge of (2+1)D topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A (2+1)D topological ordered phase with U(1) symmetry may or may not have a symmetric gapped edge state, even if both thermal and electric Hall conductivity are vanishing. It is recently discovered that there are "higher" versions of Hall conductivity valid for fermionic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, which obstructs symmetry-preserving gapped edge state beyond thermal and electric Hall conductivity. In this paper, we show that one can extract higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function of an FQH state, by evaluating the expectation value of the "partial rotation" unitary which is a combination of partial spatial rotation and a U(1) phase rotation. This result is verified numerically with the fermionic Laughlin state with $\nu=1/3$, $1/5$, as well as the non-Abelian Moore-Read state. Together with topological entanglement entropy, we prove that the expectation values of the partial rotation completely determines if a bosonic/fermionic Abelian topological order with U(1) symmetry has a symmetry-preserving gappable edge state or not. Even in non-Abelian FQH states, partial rotation provides the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem constraining the low-energy spectrum of the bulk-boundary system. The generalization of higher Hall conductivity to the case with Lie group symmetry is also presented.</description>

      <title>Nature of excitons and their ligand-mediated delocalization in nickel dihalide charge-transfer insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fundamental optical excitations of correlated transition-metal compounds are typically identified with multielectronic transitions localized at the transition-metal site, such as $dd$ transitions. In this vein, intense interest has surrounded the appearance of sharp, below band-gap optical transitions, i.e. excitons, within the magnetic phase of correlated Ni$^{2+}$ van der Waals magnets. The interplay of magnetic and charge-transfer insulating ground states in Ni$^{2+}$ systems raises intriguing questions on the roles of long-range magnetic order and of metal-ligand charge transfer in the exciton nature, which inspired microscopic descriptions beyond typical $dd$ excitations. Here we study the impact of charge-transfer and magnetic order on the excitation spectrum of the nickel dihalides (NiX$_2$, X $=$ Cl, Br, and I) using Ni-$L_3$ resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). In all compounds, we detect sharp excitations, analogous to the recently reported excitons, and assign them to spin-singlet multiplets of octahedrally-coordinated Ni$^{2+}$ stabilized by intra-atomic Hund's exchange. Additionally, we demonstrate that these excitons are dispersive using momentum resolved RIXS. Our data evidence a ligand-mediated multiplet dispersion, which is tuned by the charge-transfer gap and independent of the presence of long-range magnetic order. This reveals the mechanisms governing non-local interactions of on-site $dd$ excitations with the surrounding crystal/magnetic structure, in analogy to ground state superexchange. These measurements thus establish the roles of magnetic order, self-doped ligand holes, and intersite coupling mechanisms for the properties of $dd$ excitations in charge-transfer insulators.</description>

      <title>Magnetically propagating Hund's exciton in van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have opened new frontiers for realizing novel many-body phenomena. Recently NiPS3 has received intense interest since it hosts an excitonic quasiparticle whose properties appear to be intimately linked to the magnetic state of the lattice. Despite extensive studies, the electronic character, mobility, and magnetic interactions of the exciton remain unresolved. Here we address these issues by measuring NiPS3 with ultra-high energy resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). We find that Hund's exchange interactions are primarily responsible for the energy of formation of the exciton. Measuring the dispersion of the Hund's exciton reveals that it propagates in a way that is analogous to a double-magnon. We trace this unique behavior to fundamental similarities between the NiPS3 exciton hopping and spin exchange processes, underlining the unique magnetic characteristics of this novel quasiparticle.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised machine learning for the detection of exotic phases in skyrmion phase diagrams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Undoubtedly, machine learning techniques are being increasingly applied to a wide range of situations in the field of condensed matter. Amongst these techniques, unsupervised techniques are especially attractive, since they imply the possibility of extracting information from the data without previous labeling. In this work, we resort to the technique known as anomaly detection to explore potential exotic phases in skyrmion phase diagrams, using two different algorithms: Principal Component Analysis and Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE). First, we train these algorithms with an artificial dataset of skyrmion lattices constructed from an analytical parametrization, for different magnetizations, skyrmion lattice orientations, and skyrmion radii. We apply the trained algorithms to a set of snapshots obtained from Monte Carlo simulations for three ferromagnetic skyrmion models: two with in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DMI) in the triangular and kagome lattices, and one with an additional out of plane DMI in the kagome lattice. Then, we compare the root mean square error (RMSE) and the binary cross entropy between the input and output snapshots as a function of the external magnetic field and temperature. We find that the RMSE and its variance in the CAE case may be useful to not only detect exotic low temperature phases, but also to differentiate between the characteristic low temperature orderings of a skyrmion phase diagram (helical, skyrmions and ferromagnetic). Moreover, we apply the skyrmion trained CAE to two antiferromagnetic models in the triangular lattice, one that gives rise to antiferromagnetic skyrmions, and the pure exchange antiferromagnetic case. Despite the predictably larger RMSE, we find that, even in these cases, RMSE is also an indicator of different orderings and the emergence of particular features, such as the well-known pseudo-plateau in the pure exchange case.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Schultz-Mattis constraints for the insulating phases of the one-dimensional SU($N$) Kondo lattice model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the insulating phases of the SU($N$)-generalization of the one-dimensional Kondo lattice model is investigated by means of non-perturbative approaches. By extending the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) argument to multi-component fermion systems with translation and global SU($N$) symmetries, we derive two indices which depend on the filling and the ``SU($N$)-spin'' (representation) of the local moments. These indices strongly constrain possible insulating phases; for instance, when the local moments transform in the $N$-dimensional (defining) representation of SU($N$), a featureless Kondo insulator is possible only at filling $f= 1-1/N$. To obtain further insight into the insulating phases suggested by the LSM argument, we derive low-energy effective theories by adding an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange interaction among the local moments [the SU($N$) Kondo-Heisenberg model]. A conjectured global phase diagram of the SU($N$) Kondo lattice model as a function of the filling and the Kondo coupling is then obtained by a combination of different analytical approaches.</description>

      <title>Multiple charge-density-wave gaps in LaSbTe and CeSbTe as revealed by ultrafast spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing ultrafast time-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy measurements, we investigate the photoinduced quasiparticle dynamics of the topological materials LaSbTe and CeSbTe. In LaSbTe, the relaxation of quasiparticles is dominated by two different mechanisms: electron-phonon coupling, and phonon-assisted electron-hole recombination. Significantly, the amplitude of photoinduced reflectivity related to the former one shows two pronounced peaks at 156 K and 263 K, indicating the occurrence of two charge density wave (CDW) phase transitions. The ultrafast responses of CeSbTe share a lot of similarities with LaSbTe, and an additional CDW phase transition at 154 K is revealed in CeSbTe. However, the slower relaxation of CeSbTe exhibits an exotic behavior that deviates from the typical phonon-assisted electron-hole recombination process, probably due to the imbalance between the electron- and hole-type carriers. Unlike LaSbTe, the relaxation times of CeSbTe vary slightly with the pump power, inferring the possible participation of 4$f$ electron in the decay process. In addition, two oscillation modes around 1 THz and 3 THz are identified in both LaSbTe and CeSbTe, which are mostly likely to be coherent phonon modes. These findings unravel the existence of multiple CDW orders in LaSbTe and CeSbTe, offering insights into the underlying physics of these systems.</description>

      <title>Negatively enhanced thermopower near a Van Hove singularity in electron-doped Sr$_2$RuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The layered perovskite Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ serves as a model material of the two-dimensional (2D) Fermi liquid but also exhibits various emergent phenomena including the non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) behavior under external perturbations such as uniaxial pressure and chemical substitutions. Here we present the thermoelectric transport of electron-doped system Sr$_{2-y}$La$_{y}$RuO$_4$, in which a filling-induced Lifshitz transition occurs at the Van Hove singularity (VHS) point of $y\approx 0.2$. We find that the sign of the low-temperature thermopower becomes negative only near the VHS point, where the NFL behavior has been observed in the earlier work. This observation is incompatible with either a numerical calculation within a constant relaxation-time approximation or a toy-model calculation for the 2D Lifshitz transition adopting an elastic carrier scattering. As a promising origin of the observed negatively enhanced thermopower, we propose a skewed NFL state, in which an inelastic scattering with a considerable odd-frequency term plays a crucial role to negatively enhance the thermopower.</description>

      <title>Spin and charge dynamics of doped one-dimensional Mott insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) for a newly discovered doped one-dimensional (1D) Mott insulator Ba$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_{3+\delta}$ proposed the presence of attractive charge interactions between neighboring sites if an 1D Hubbard model is employed to describe the material. On the other hand, long-range repulsive charge interactions were proposed to be crucial for understanding optical excitations of undoped 1D Mott insulators. Motivated by these contrasting proposals, we perform density-matrix renormalization group calculations of the single-particle spectral function as well as dynamical spin and charge structure factors for two kinds of extended 1D Hubbard models. The spectral function for the long-range repulsive model less agrees with the ARPES data as compared with that for the attractive one. The dynamical spin and charge structure factors also exhibit contrasting behaviors between the two models: the attractive model shows less momentum dependence of the integrated weight in the dynamical spin structure factor and more accumulation of the weight on the upper edge of particle-hole-type excitation in the dynamical charge structure factor. These features give a good criterion of an appropriate model for doped 1D Mott insulators, which can be judged by resonant-inelastic x-ray scattering experiments.</description>

      <title>Localized dopant motion across the 2D Ising phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I investigate the motion of a single hole in 2D spin lattices with square and triangular geometries. While the spins have nearest neighbor Ising spin couplings $J$, the hole is allowed to move only in 1D along a single line in the 2D lattice with nearest neighbor hopping amplitude $t$. The non-equilibrium hole dynamics is initialized by suddenly removing a single spin from the thermal Ising spin lattice. I find that for any nonzero spin coupling and temperature, the hole is localized. This is an extension of the thermally induced localization phenomenon [arXiv:2310.11193] to the case, where there is a phase transition to a long-range ordered ferromagnetic phase. The dynamics depends only on the ratio of the temperature to the spin coupling, $k_BT / |J|$, and on the ratio of the spin coupling to the hopping $J/t$. I characterize these dependencies in great detail. In particular, I find universal behavior at high temperatures, common features for the square and triangular lattices across the Curie temperatures for ferromagnetic interactions, and highly distinct behaviors for the two geometries in the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions due geometric frustration in the triangular lattice.</description>

      <title>Sublinear transport in Kagome metals: Interplay of Dirac cones and Van Hove singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome metals are known to host Dirac fermions and saddle point Van Hove singularities near Fermi level. With the minimal two-pocket model (Dirac cone + Van Hove singularity), we propose a semiclassical theory to explain the experimentally observed sublinear resistivity in Ni$_3$In and other Kagome metals. We derive the full semiclassical description of kinetic phenomena using Boltzmann equation, and demonstrate that internode electron-electron interaction leads to sublinear in $T$ scaling for both electrical and thermal transport at low temperatures. At higher temperatures above the Dirac node chemical potential, thermal and electric current dissipate through distinct scattering channels, making a ground for Wiedemann-Franz law violation.</description>

      <title>Existence of Hebel-Slichter peak in unconventional kagome superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a theoretical investigation of the spin susceptibility of unconventional superconductivity on the kagome lattice. Despite the existence of a sign-changing gap structure, which sums to zero over the Fermi surface, we show that such unconventional pairing states may exhibit a Hebel-Slichter peak in the temperature-dependent spin-lattice relaxation rate. It originates from destructive sublattice interference effects. For the same reason, unconventional pairing states on the kagome lattice tend not to exhibit a neutron resonance peak. These results supplement previous theoretical studies of the surprising robustness of sign-changing gap structures to disorder on the kagome lattice. Taken together these findings imply that unconventional superconductivity on the kagome lattice is deceptive in the sense that its properties may appear similar to conventional non-sign-changing superconductivity. These results may be of relevance to the superconducting state of the kagome superconductors $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$: K, Rb, Cs) and CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The large spin-orbit coupling in iridium oxides plays a significant role in driving novel physical behaviors, including emergent phenomena in the films and heterostructures of perovskite and Ruddlesden-Popper iridates. In this work, we study the role of epitaxial strain on the electronic behavior of thin SrIrO$_3$ films. We find that compressive epitaxial strain leads to metallic transport behavior, but a slight tensile strain shows gapped behavior. Temperature-dependent resistivity measurements are used to examine different behaviors in films as a function of strain. We find Kondo contributions to the resistivity, with stronger effects in films that are thinner and under less compressive epitaxial strain. These results show the potential to tune SrIrO$_3$ into Kondo insulating states and open possibilities for a quantum critical point that can be controlled with strain in epitaxial films.</description>

      <title>Discovering Factorization Surface of Quantum Spin Chains with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entanglement in quantum many-body systems is required for a variety of quantum information tasks, making it crucial to identify the parameter space in which the ground state is fully separable, known as the factorization surface (FS). Nonetheless, the tuning parameters indicating FS for several quantum spin models remain unknown. We employ symbolic regression (SR), a supervised learning technique, to determine a closed-form expression in the parameter regime corresponding to FS of quantum many-body Hamiltonians. We verify the effectiveness of this method by examining the analytically tractable models, namely a nearest-neighbor (NN) quantum transverse XY model with additional Kaplan-Shekhtman-Entin-Aharony interactions, for which the FS is well-known. We construct an accurate expression for the FS of the XYZ model by providing the parameter set through the SR algorithm in which the ground state is derived by matrix product state formalism. With a satisfactory level of accuracy, we estimate the FS for the long-range XY model, and the NN XY model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type asymmetric interaction for which the factorization surface is not known.</description>

      <title>Exact Demonstration of pair-density-wave superconductivity in the $\sigma_z$-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Describing and achieving `unconventional' superconductivity remains a forefront challenge in quantum many-body physics. Here we use a unitary mapping, combined with the well-established properties of the attractive Hubbard model to demonstrate rigorously a Hamiltonian with a low temperature pair-density-wave (PDW) phase. We also show that the same mapping, when applied to the widely accepted properties of the repulsive Hubbard model, leads to a Hamiltonian exhibiting triplet $d$-wave PDW superconductivity and an unusual combination of ferro- and antiferro-magnetic spin correlations. We then demonstrate the persistence of the $d$-wave PDW in a Hamiltonian derived from the mapping of the extended $t$-$J$ model in the large-$U$ limit. Furthermore, through strategic manipulation of the nearest-neighbor hopping signs of spin-down electrons, we illustrate the attainability of PDW superconductivity at other momenta. The intertwining of different magnetic and exotic pairing correlations noted here may have connections to experimental observations in spin-triplet candidates like UTe$_2$.</description>

Abstract: Here we report a comprehensive study of the crystal structure, resistivity, and ac magnetic susceptibility in single crystals of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, with a hydrostatic pressure up to 104 GPa. X-ray diffraction measurements reveal a bilayer orthorhombic structure (space group $Amam$) at ambient pressure and a transformation into a tetragonal phase (space group $I4/mmm$) at a critical pressure of $\sim$14 GPa. The transport measurements reveal a dome-shaped superconducting region with a maximum $T_c$ of 83 K at 18.0 GPa. The superconductivity is gradually suppressed when applying a higher pressure, but it can persist up to 90 GPa. Importantly, from our high-pressure $ac$ magnetic susceptibility measurements, the estimated maximum superconducting volume fraction is 48$\%$ at 19.4 GPa. Thus, we demonstrate the bulk nature of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure. The intimate connection among the superconductivity, the oxygen content, and the tetragonal structure are discussed.</description>

      <title>Revealing the spatial nature of sublattice symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sublattice symmetry on a bipartite lattice is commonly regarded as the chiral symmetry in the AIII class of the tenfold Altland--Zirnbauer classification. Here, we reveal the spatial nature of sublattice symmetry, and show that this assertion holds only if the periodicity of primitive unit cells agrees with that of the sublattice labeling. In cases where the periodicity does not agree, sublattice symmetry is represented as a glide reflection in energy--momentum space, which inverts energy and simultaneously translates some $k$ by $\pi$, leading to substantially different physics. Particularly, it introduces novel constraints on zero modes in semimetals and completely alters the classification table of topological insulators compared to class AIII. Notably, the dimensions corresponding to trivial and nontrivial classifications are switched, and the nontrivial classification becomes $\mathbb{Z}_2$ instead of $\mathbb{Z}$. We have applied these results to several models, including the Hofstadter model both with and without dimerization.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Nonsaturating Magnetoresistance Observed in HoMn$_6$Ge$_6$: A Kagome Dirac Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the magnetic and magnetotransport properties and electronic band structure of the kagome Dirac semimetal HoMn$_6$Ge$_6$. Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity demonstrates various magnetic-transition-driven anomalies. Notably, a crossover from negative to positive magnetoresistance (MR) is observed at around 150 K. While the linear nonsaturating positive MR in the low-temperature region is mainly driven by the linear Dirac-like band dispersions as predicted by the first-principles calculations, the negative MR observed in the high-temperature region is due to the spin-flop type magnetic transition. Consistent with anisotropic Fermi surface topology, we observe anisotropic magnetoresistance at low temperatures. A significant anomalous Hall effect has been noticed at high temperatures in addition to a switching of the dominant charge carrier from electron to hole at around 215 K.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum phase transition on the kagome lattice: Distinct velocities of spinon and string excitations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum phase transition (DQPT) provides an extraordinary possibility of the quantum phase transition beyond the Ginzburg-Landau paradigm, which is interwoven with numerous exotic phenomena of the strongly correlated quantum many-body system, e.g. fractional excitation, emergent symmetries, and gauge field. However, various candidates of DQPT have been demonstrated to be weakly first-order, and the conformal field theory (CFT) has to be altered into a non-unitary one. Here we numerically found two linear dispersions with different velocities in one of the few survivors of DQPT -- the extended hard-core Bose-Hubbard model on the Kagome lattice. Such counterintuitive results directly lead to the negation of possible emergent Lorentz symmetry, and the breakdown of conventional theory of DQPT. Furthermore, the snapshots of boson configuration hint that these two velocities may correspond to the dynamics of the fractional excitations and quantum strings, respectively. Our work will inspire the revisit of the theory of DQPT and benefit the field of quantum materials and quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>SmoQyDQMC.jl: A flexible implementation of determinant quantum Monte Carlo for Hubbard and electron-phonon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the SmoQyDQMC.jl package, a Julia implementation of the determinant quantum Monte Carlo algorithm. SmoQyDQMC.jl supports generalized tight-binding Hamiltonians with on-site Hubbard and generalized electron-phonon interactions, including non-linear $e$-ph coupling and anharmonic lattice potentials. Our implementations use hybrid Monte Carlo methods with exact forces for sampling the phonon fields, enabling efficient simulation of low-energy phonon branches, including acoustic phonons. The SmoQyDQMC.jl package also uses a flexible scripting interface, allowing users to adapt it to different workflows and interface with other software packages in the Julia ecosystem. The code for this package can be downloaded from our GitHub repository at https://github.com/SmoQySuite/SmoQyDQMC.jl or installed using the Julia package manager. The online documentation, including examples, can be obtained from our document page at https://smoqysuite.github.io/SmoQyDQMC.jl/stable/.</description>

      <title>Structural complexity of snapshots of 2D Fermi-Hubbard systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of quantum gas microscopy for two-dimensional optical lattices has provided an unparalleled tool to study the Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) with ultracold atoms. Spin-resolved projective measurements, or snapshots, have played a significant role in quantifying correlation functions which uncover underlying physical phenomena such as antiferromagnetism at commensurate filling on bipartite lattices, and other charge and spin correlations, as well as dynamical properties at various densities. However, in order to interpret these results and to establish temperature scales, comparison against theory is generally needed. Here, we employ a recent concept, the {\em multi-scale structural complexity}, and show that when computed for the snapshots (of either single spin species, local moments, or total density) it can provide a theory-free property, immediately accessible to experiments. Specifically, after benchmarking results for Ising and XY models, we study the structural complexity of snapshots of the repulsive FHM in the two-dimensional square lattice as a function of doping and temperature. We generate projective measurements using determinant quantum Monte Carlo and compare their complexities against those from the experiment. We demonstrate that these complexities are linked to relevant physical observables such as the entropy and double occupancy. Their behaviors capture the development of correlations and relevant length scales in the system. We provide an open-source code in Python which can be implemented into data analysis routines in experimental settings for the square lattice.</description>

      <title>Nonthermal electron-photon steady states in open cavity quantum materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupling a system to two different baths can lead to novel phenomena escaping the constraints of thermal equilibrium. In quantum materials inside optical cavities, this feature can be exploited as electrons and cavity-photons are easily pulled away from their mutual equilibrium, even in the steady state. This offers new routes for a non-invasive control of material properties and functionalities. We show that the absence of thermal equilibrium between electrons and photons leads to reduced symmetries of the steady-state electronic distribution function. Moreover, by defining an effective temperature from the on-shell distribution function, we find a non-monotonic behaviour as a function of cavity frequency, consistent with recent experimental findings. Finally, we show that, the non-thermal behaviour leads to qualitative modifications of the material's properties, as the standard Sommerfeld expansion for observables is modified by a leading-order correction linearly proportional to the temperature difference between the two baths and to the frequency-derivative of the electron damping.</description>

      <title>Few-magnon excitations in a frustrated spin-$S$ ferromagnetic chain with single-ion anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14101v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study few-magnon excitations in a finite-size spin-$S$ chain with ferromagnetic nearest-neighbor (NN) interaction $J&gt;0$ and antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) interaction $J'&lt;0$, in the presence of the single-ion (SI) anisotropy $D$. We first reveal the condition for the emergence of zero-excitation-energy states. In the isotropic case with $\Delta=\Delta'=1$ ($\Delta$ and $\Delta'$ are the corresponding anisotropy parameters), a threshold of $J/|J'|$ above which the ground state is ferromagnetic is determined by exact diagonalization for short chains up to $12$ sites. Using a set of exact two-magnon Bloch states, we then map the two-magnon problem to a single-particle one on an effective open chain with both NN and NNN hoppings. The whole two-magnon excitation spectrum is calculated for large systems and the commensurate-incommensurate transition in the lowest-lying mode is found to exhibit different behaviors between $S=1/2$ and higher spins due to the interplay of the SI anisotropy and the NNN interaction. For the commensurate momentum $k=-\pi$, the effective lattice is decoupled into two NN open chains that can be exactly solved via a plane-wave ansatz. Based on this, we analytically identify in the $\Delta'-D/|J'|$ plane the regions supporting the SI or NNN exchange two-magnon bound states near the edge of the band. In particular, we prove that there always exists a lower-lying NN exchange two-magnon bound state near the band edge for arbitrary $S\geq 1/2$. Finally, we numerically calculate the $n$-magnon spectra for $S=1/2$ with $n\leq5$ by using a spin-operator matrix element method. The corresponding $n$-magnon commensurate instability regions are determined for finite chains and consistent results with prior literature are observed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction model has gained a lot of attention in recent years, due to the fact it is exactly solvable in momentum space in any dimension while capturing some key features of the Mott phase. Here a one-dimensional lattice model with this interaction is approached from the real-space perspective, to explore how breaking the translation invariance of a lattice affects the intuition built by studying the exact solution in $k$-space. The ground state properties of chains with periodic and open boundary conditions are calculated and compared with both the exact solution in momentum space, as well as with analogous solutions of the Hubbard model. The results show that introducing hard edges enhances the ferromagnetic correlations and the system undergoes a magnetic transition before reaching the strong coupling limit. Understanding the impact of hard edges is a crucial step toward answering the looming question of the existence of edge states and other topological phenomena in systems with this type of interaction.</description>

      <title>Dynamic magnetic phase transition induced by parametric magnon pumping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncovering pathways to optically drive magnetic order-disorder transitions on ultrashort timescales can lead to the realization of novel out-of-equilibrium quantum phenomena. A long-sought pathway is to directly excite a highly non-thermal energy-momentum distribution of magnons, bypassing both charge and lattice degrees of freedom. However, this remains elusive owing to the weak coupling and large momentum mismatch between photons and magnons. Here we demonstrate strong parametric excitation of magnons across the entire Brillouin zone of the antiferromagnetic insulator Sr$_2$Cu$_3$O$_4$Cl$_2$ by periodically modulating the superexchange interaction with the electric field of light. The excitation efficiency is greatly enhanced by tuning to the van Hove singularity in the magnon spectrum, sufficient to transiently collapse the antiferromagnetic state using a pulsed laser field of 10$^9$ V/m. The order parameter recovery timescale increases by over 1000 times as a function of excitation density, reflecting a crossover from high- to low-energy magnon dominated decay dynamics. This electric-field induced parametric magnon pumping mechanism is applicable to a broad range of magnetic insulators and opens up the possibility of dynamically engineering magnon distributions by design.</description>

      <title>Incompatibility between topological Weyl state of large Berry curvature and 4$f$-driven correlated state emerging on the Fermi surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the impact of the strong correlation effect of rare-earth 4$f$ orbitals on the non-trivial topological Weyl state, and discovered the incompatible dynamics between those states. The screening suppression by the large Berry curvature at the quadratic band touching point is suggested to prevent the emergence of a correlated 4$f$ state on the Fermi surface. By employing ab initio many-body perturbation theory combined with dynamical mean field theory, we show that this effect prompts two types of topological semimetals. The type-I semimetal PrPtBi exhibits a topological quasiparticle away from the Fermi level due to the formation of a 4$f$ quasiparticle. The type-II semimetals HoPtBi and PrAlGe feature a robust topological quasiparticle at the Fermi level, which pushes the 4$f$ quasiparticle away. Our work provides an avenue to harness semimetals' anomalous quantum effects from topological quasiparticle to heavy-fermion behavior by the incorporation of 4$f$ quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Transcorrelated Method enabling accurate Quantum Chemistry on near-term Quantum Hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02007v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is emerging as a new computational paradigm with the potential to transform several research fields, including quantum chemistry. However, current hardware limitations (including limited coherence times, gate infidelities, and limited connectivity) hamper the straightforward implementation of most quantum algorithms and call for more noise-resilient solutions. In quantum chemistry, the limited number of available qubits and gate operations is particularly restrictive since, for each molecular orbital, one needs, in general, two qubits. In this study, we propose an explicitly correlated Ansatz based on the transcorrelated (TC) approach, which transfers -- without any approximation -- correlation from the wavefunction directly into the Hamiltonian, thus reducing the number of resources needed to achieve accurate results with noisy, near-term quantum devices. In particular, we show that the exact transcorrelated approach not only allows for more shallow circuits but also improves the convergence towards the so-called basis set limit, providing energies within chemical accuracy to experiment with smaller basis sets and, therefore, fewer qubits. We demonstrate our method by computing bond lengths, dissociation energies, and vibrational frequencies close to experimental results for the hydrogen dimer and lithium hydride using just 4 and 6 qubits, respectively. Conventional methods require at least ten times more qubits for the same accuracy.</description>

      <title>ANTN: Bridging Autoregressive Neural Networks and Tensor Networks for Quantum Many-Body Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01996v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body physics simulation has important impacts on understanding fundamental science and has applications to quantum materials design and quantum technology. However, due to the exponentially growing size of the Hilbert space with respect to the particle number, a direct simulation is intractable. While representing quantum states with tensor networks and neural networks are the two state-of-the-art methods for approximate simulations, each has its own limitations in terms of expressivity and inductive bias. To address these challenges, we develop a novel architecture, Autoregressive Neural TensorNet (ANTN), which bridges tensor networks and autoregressive neural networks. We show that Autoregressive Neural TensorNet parameterizes normalized wavefunctions, allows for exact sampling, generalizes the expressivity of tensor networks and autoregressive neural networks, and inherits a variety of symmetries from autoregressive neural networks. We demonstrate our approach on quantum state learning as well as finding the ground state of the challenging 2D $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model with different systems sizes and coupling parameters, outperforming both tensor networks and autoregressive neural networks. Our work opens up new opportunities for quantum many-body physics simulation, quantum technology design, and generative modeling in artificial intelligence.</description>

Abstract: In the hydrodynamic regime, field theories typically have their boost symmetry spontaneously broken due to the presence of a thermal rest frame although the associated Goldstone field does not acquire independent dynamics. We show that this is not the case for Carrollian field theories where the boost Goldstone field plays a central role. This allows us to give a first-principles derivation of the equilibrium currents and dissipative effects of Carrollian fluids. We also demonstrate that the limit of vanishing speed of light of relativistic fluids is a special case of this class of Carrollian fluids. Our results shine light on the thermodynamic properties and thermal partition functions of Carrollian field theories.</description>

Abstract: Controlling zero bias anomalies in magnetic atoms provides a promising strategy to engineer tunable quantum many-body excitations. Here we show how two different quantum impurities featuring spinaron and Kondo excitations can be controlled via quantum confinement engineering by using circular quantum corrals on a Ag(111) surface. In corrals built from both Ag and Co adatoms, the width of the zero bias anomaly in the central Co adatom oscillates as a function of corral radius with a period of half of the Ag(111) surface state wavelength. Parameters extracted for Co/Ag(111) show only small differences in extracted spinaron zero-bias anomaly between corral walls built from Ag or Co adatoms. In quantum corrals occupied with metal-free phthalocyanine, a $S=1/2$ Kondo system, we observe notable changes in the zero bias anomaly lineshape as a function of corral radius. Our results offer insight into many-body Kondo and spinaron resonances where the electronic density is controlled by confinement engineering.</description>

Abstract: The near-term utility of quantum computers is hindered by hardware constraints in the form of noise. One path to achieving noise resilience in hybrid quantum algorithms is to decrease the required circuit depth -- the number of applied gates -- to solve a given problem. This work demonstrates how to reduce circuit depth by combining the transcorrelated (TC) approach with adaptive quantum ans\"atze and their implementations in the context of variational quantum imaginary time evolution (AVQITE). The combined TC-AVQITE method is used to calculate ground state energies across the potential energy surfaces of H$_4$, LiH, and H$_2$O. In particular, H$_4$ is a notoriously difficult case where unitary coupled cluster theory, including singles and doubles excitations, fails to provide accurate results. Adding TC yields energies close to the complete basis set (CBS) limit while reducing the number of necessary operators -- and thus circuit depth -- in the adaptive ans\"atze. The reduced circuit depth furthermore makes our algorithm more noise-resilient and accelerates convergence. Our study demonstrates that combining the TC method with adaptive ans\"atze yields compact, noise-resilient, and easy-to-optimize quantum circuits that yield accurate quantum chemistry results close to the CBS limit.</description>

      <title>Anyon braiding and telegraph noise in a graphene interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18983</link>

Abstract: The search for anyons, quasiparticles with fractional charge and exotic exchange statistics, has inspired decades of condensed matter research. Quantum Hall interferometers enable direct observation of the anyon braiding phase via discrete interference phase jumps when the quasiparticle number changes. Here, we observe the universal anyonic braiding phase in both the $\nu = 1/3$ and $4/3$ fractional quantum Hall states by probing three-state random telegraph noise (RTN) in real-time. We find that the observed RTN stems from anyon quasiparticle number $n$ fluctuations and reconstruct three Aharonov-Bohm oscillation signals phase shifted by $2\pi/3$, corresponding to the three possible interference branches from braiding around $n$ (mod 3) anyons. Hence, we fully characterize the anyon exchange statistics using new methods that can readily extend to non-abelian states.</description>
