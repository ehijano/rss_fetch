      <title>Fan-Wang type regular black holes in Quasi-Topological Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a class of regular black hole solutions of the Fan-Wang type within quasi-topological gravity (QTG) in arbitrary spacetime dimensions greater than four. In contrast to the original Fan-Wang solution, which was obtained in four-dimensional general relativity coupled to nonlinear electrodynamics, our higher-dimensional generalization does not require any matter fields. Instead, regularity is achieved purely through an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections. We demonstrate that the Fan-Wang-type metric is a solution to the QTG field equations by explicitly determining the corresponding coupling constants for each curvature order. Within an appropriate parameter regime, the solution describes an asymptotically flat black hole spacetime with a regular center. Remarkably, even in the case of negative mass, the geometry can remain completely regular, in sharp contrast to Einstein gravity.</description>

      <title>Observational constraints on viscous free-$\gamma$ fluid in $f(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the late-time cosmological dynamics of a spatially flat FLRW universe in the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity, where $Q$ denotes the nonmetricity scalar. The matter sector is modeled as a bulk viscous fluid with a free equation-of-state parameter $\gamma$, allowing for a generalized description of cosmic matter beyond the standard dust approximation. We derive the background evolution equations and analyze the resulting expansion history. The model parameters are constrained using a combination of observational datasets, including cosmic chronometers (CC), baryon acoustic oscillations from DESI DR2, and Type~Ia supernovae (GRBs and Union3). Using the best-fit parameters, we further employ the statefinder and $\mathrm{Om}(z)$ diagnostics to distinguish the viscous $f(Q)$ scenario from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In addition, we examine the evolution of the deceleration parameter, which exhibits a transition from an early decelerated phase to the current accelerated expansion, and analyze the effective equation of state behavior. Our results show that bulk viscosity within $f(Q)$ gravity provides a viable and observationally consistent description of late-time cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>Regular black holes from pure gravity in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive static spherically symmetric regular black holes as vacuum solutions to purely gravitational theories in four dimensions. To that end, we construct four-dimensional non-polynomial gravities starting from subclasses of two-dimensional Horndeski actions. By construction, these theories possess second-order equations of motion on spherically symmetric backgrounds. We show that a subset of these non-polynomial gravities, referred to as non-polynomial quasi-topological gravities, admit single-function static spherically symmetric solutions whereby the metric function is determined by an algebraic equation. Solutions to these theories include the Hayward regular black-hole spacetime, for which a corresponding gravitational action is stated explicitly.</description>

      <title>Particle Motion in Regular Black Hole Spacetimes Supported by a Galactic Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate particle motion in regular and asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes supported by Dehnen-type dark-matter halos. Two analytic models are analyzed, allowing a systematic study of circular geodesics, photon-sphere properties, shadow radius, Lyapunov exponent, ISCO frequency, binding energy, and Hawking temperature. The corrected numerical results show that the halo scale parameter can significantly modify strong-field observables. In both models, for moderate density slopes, increasing the halo parameter reduces characteristic radii while enhancing orbital instability and accretion efficiency. For steeper density falloff, however, deviations from the Schwarzschild case remain small. These results demonstrate that halo-induced modifications of optical and dynamical black hole signatures are strongly controlled by the density profile parameters.</description>

      <title>Kerr-Schild solutions in Multigravity and the Classical Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the multimetric theory of gravitation, also known as multigravity. We derive additional new exact solutions for the theory in proportional Kerr-Schild and double Kerr-Schild forms. We extend several solutions from the theory of General Relativity, characterized by a constant Ricci scalar in single and double Kerr-Schild forms, to derive solutions in the multi-gravity context. We also examine and extend the classical double copy relations that can be constructed out from these solutions in multigravity exploring the dynamics of the single copy and zero copy fields.</description>

      <title>The empirical laws for Majorana fields in a curved spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is a sequel to our previous paper (arXiv:2511.12311), where we considered the conceptual problem on the empirical laws for the Klein\textendash Gordon quantum field theory in curved spacetime (QFTCS), and we will consider the similar problems for the Majorana field on curved spacetime here. A ``law'' in theoretical physics is said to be observable or empirical only if it can be verified/falsified by some experimental procedure. The notion of empiricality/observability becomes far more unclear in QFTCS, than in QFT in Minkowski (flat) spacetime (QFTM), mainly because QFTCS lacks the notion of vacuum. This could potentially undermine the status of QFTCS as a physical (not only mathematical) theory. We consider this problem for the Majorana field in curved spacetime, and examine some examples of the empirical laws.</description>

      <title>Black-Hole mimickers in GR and $f(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole mimickers (BHMs) are horizonless globally regular ultracompact relativistic self-gravitating objects (UCOs) of mass $M$ and radius $R$ with compactness $C = M/R$ higher than that of a neutron star and that produce an effective potential for null geodesics (photons) that possesses a local maximum, which is usually accompanied by an inner local minimum. The presence of a local maximum allows for unstable circular orbits to exist similar to light rings present in actual BH solutions, while it has been conjectured that the presence of a local minimum is symptomatic of potential instabilities. One such candidate for a BHM is a solitonic boson star (SBS) which is a boson star endowed with a sextic potential. In this paper we investigate further solutions of static and spherically symmetric SBSs in general relativity with a larger set of parameter values, and argue that such solutions are very similar to UCOs composed of an incompressible perfect fluid (IPF) with a sufficiently large pressure (the mimicker of a BHM). These IPFUCOs reach the Buchdahl limit $C= 4/9$ for arbitrarily large pressures. We investigate the extent to which the IPFUCOs constructed within a quadratic model in $f(R)$ gravity can overcome this limit or not, and thus pave the way for possibly building SBSs (or other kind of UCO) within this (or other alternative theory of gravity). We further elaborate about the stability properties of SBSs which have been the subject of some controversy recently.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Decay Rate and Greybody Factors for Regular Black Holes with Scalar Hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation of massive scalar fields in the background of asymptotically flat regular black holes supported by a phantom scalar field with a scalar charge $A$. This parameter regularizes the geometry by removing the central singularity. Focusing on wave dynamics, we analyze scalar perturbations, quasinormal modes, and greybody factors, emphasizing the role of the regularization parameter on the effective potential and the decay properties of the modes. Using WKB methods beyond the eikonal limit, we show that the presence of scalar hair modifies both the oscillation frequencies and damping rates of quasinormal modes. In particular, we demonstrate the occurrence of an anomalous decay rate for massive scalar perturbations: above a critical field mass, the longest-lived modes correspond to lower angular momentum, in contrast with the massless case. We derive analytical expressions for the critical mass and study its dependence on the scalar charge and overtone number. Furthermore, we apply the Horowitz-Hubeny method to compute the quasinormal frequencies and show that the results obtained from the WKB and Horowitz-Hubeny approaches exhibit excellent agreement in the regime where both methods are valid. In addition, we compute reflection and transmission coefficients and analyze the corresponding greybody factors, clarifying how regularity effects imprint themselves on black-hole scattering properties. Our results show that regular black holes with scalar hair exhibit distinctive dynamical signatures that can be probed through quasinormal ringing and wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Extreme-mass ratio inspirals in Schwarzschild - de Sitter spacetime I: Weak-field orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inspiral of a compact object into a black hole is a key source of low-frequency gravitational waves for future space-based detectors like LISA. While models of this process have advanced, they typically focus on asymptotically flat spacetimes. In this paper, we explore how the absence of asymptotic flatness affects the slow, adiabatic orbital evolution due to radiation reaction. This lack of asymptotic flatness can arise from external environments or an expanding universe. Using the Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) spacetime, where the deviation from flatness is governed by the cosmological constant, we study bound orbits characterized by their semi-latus rectum $p$ and eccentricity $e$. We calculate how the cosmological constant shifts the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits and alters the relationship between the binary's binding energy, angular momentum, and orbital parameters. Assuming the orbital timescale is much shorter than the inspiral timescale, we apply a modified quadrupole formula to examine the impact of a small positive cosmological constant on the orbital evolution in the weak-field limit. We find that the cosmological constant accelerates the decrease in eccentricity, reducing inspiral plunge times, which could influence event rate estimates for space-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Uncovering subdominant multipole asymmetries in binary black-hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dynamically formed binaries, the spins of the black holes tend to be misaligned with the system's orbital angular momentum. This causes the spins to precess and leads to an asymmetric emission of gravitational waves. The resulting gravitational-wave multipole asymmetries directly source the recoil of the remnant black hole and are the critical element in fully describing precession. Recoil and precession are of significant astrophysical importance, but multipole asymmetries contribute only minimally to the overall signal strength. Consequently, most current gravitational-wave models either do not incorporate asymmetries at all, or only consider the dominant ones. Here we highlight the importance of subdominant multipole asymmetries for an accurate recoil velocity calculation and discuss their detectability with third generation detectors. Neglecting subdominant asymmetries leads to velocity differences of up to 210 km/s and can, in particular, introduce systematic biases in the inference of masses and the spin geometry. We further discuss universal characteristics of subdominant multipole asymmetries in order to prepare the ground for potential future asymmetry models. In the inspiral regime, the average antisymmetric frequencies can be described by a multiple of the orbital frequency. During ringdown, however, they become equal to their corresponding symmetric frequencies.</description>

      <title>Constraining $\beta$-Exponential Inflation with the latest ACT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT), especially when combined with DESI baryon acoustic oscillation data, indicate a scalar spectral index $n_s$ higher than the value reported by \textit{Planck} 2018, placing tension on universal inflationary attractor models. Motivated by this discrepancy, we investigate the inflationary predictions of the $\beta$-exponential potential, $V(\phi)=V_0\left(1-\lambda\beta\phi/M_p\right)^{1/\beta}$ considering both minimally and non-minimally coupled realizations. This potential generalizes standard exponential inflation and naturally arises in braneworld scenarios. We derive analytical expressions for the slow-roll parameters and inflationary observables using a perturbative expansion in the non-minimal coupling $\xi$, and validate these results through numerical calculations. In the minimally coupled case, the model predicts $n_s \simeq 0.976$ and $r \simeq 0.035$ for $N=50$ and moderate values of \beta, remaining compatible with ACT+DESI constraints at the 1\sigma level while yielding a spectral tilt larger than the universal attractor prediction. Introducing a small non-minimal coupling significantly improves agreement with observations by suppressing the tensor-to-scalar ratio while preserving the enhanced scalar tilt. For $N=60, \lambda \sim 0.3-0.5$, and $\beta \sim O(1-5)$, the non-minimally coupled model yields $n_s \simeq 0.974-0.976$ and $r \lesssim 0.03$, comfortably consistent with ACT, DESI, and BICEP/Keck bounds. Our results show that the $\beta$-exponential potential, especially when implemented with a non-minimal coupling, exhibits good agreement with the latest CMB observations. Our inflationary predictions of the non-minimal model of $n_s$ and $r$ confirming the leading-order contributions in $\xi$ are sufficient to capture the essential features of both $r$ and $n_s$ in observationally relevant regimes.</description>

      <title>Possible existence of super Chandrasekhar mass limit in the matter-curvature coupled gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate white dwarfs in the framework of f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity to explore the Chandrasekhar Limit. We have considered two functional forms of f(R,L_m) and one functional form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Considering the matter Lagrangian L_m=p, we calculate modified TOV equations for each of the forms. By employing the fully degenerate electron gas equation of state in the modified TOV equations, we derive the mass-radius relation for each functional form of both f(R,L_m) and f(R,L_m,T) gravity. Our models imply modifications in the Chandrasekhar mass limit that deviate significantly from the GR and the Newtonian cases. In the f(R,L_m, T)$ gravity, the new mass limit of the white dwarf can reach upto 1.537\,\mathrm{M}_\odot while in f(R,L_m) with the quadratic extension can goes upto 1.52\,\mathrm{M}_\odot and with exponential extension upto 2.08\,\mathrm{M}_\odot. Further, we analyze the static stability criterion, the gravitational redshift, and the adiabatic indices. For the power-law form of f(R,L_m) and the non-linear form of f(R,L_m,T) gravity, significant variations are observed at higher densities (\rho_c &gt; 10^{10}\, \mathrm{g/cm^3}), while substantial changes are noted at much lower central densities in the case of exponential form of f(R,L_m) gravity. We also calculate compactness and gravitational redshift, which are much lower than those of neutron stars and black holes. Stability is also confirmed by adiabatic indices, which show that all models yield \Gamma &gt; 4/3 throughout the interiors of WDs. Overall, our models provide a viable framework for the existence of super-Chandrasekhar mass limit, extending beyond the classical predictions in the Newtonian and/or GR cases.</description>

      <title>Inspiral tests of general relativity and waveform geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase evolution of gravitational waves encodes critical information about the orbital dynamics of binary systems. In this work, we test the robustness of parameterized tests against unmodeled deviations from general relativity. We demonstrate that these parameterized tests are flexible and sensitive in detecting generic deviations in the waveform using the Cutler-Vallisneri bias formalism. This universality arises from examining the inherent geometry of the waveform signal and understanding how biases manifest. We show how Bayes factors are governed by the intrinsic geometry of the waveform signal manifold when parameterized tests are used to approximate generic violations of GR. We use the singular value decomposition to propose templates that are orthogonal to parameterized tests, identifying degeneracies and enhancing the detection of potential deviations. More broadly, the geometric framework developed here clarifies -- at a fundamental level -- how subtle waveform effects (including orbital eccentricity, spin precession, waveform systematics, and instrumental glitches) can mimic one another in data, and when they are intrinsically distinguishable.</description>

      <title>Novel (Non-)Accelerating Vacuum Spacetimes from Bertotti--Robinson Black Holes via Harrison and Inversion Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct new vacuum solutions of the Einstein equations generated from electrovacuum configurations embedded in external electromagnetic backgrounds. Starting from accelerating Bertotti--Robinson black holes, we employ two independent mechanisms: a Melvin--Bonnor-type magnetization and an Inversion symmetry of the Einstein--Maxwell system. In both cases the external electromagnetic field can be removed, while a non-trivial gravitational backreaction remains in the metric, yielding new accelerating vacuum spacetimes of Petrov type I. In the static, non-accelerating limit, the magnetized Schwarzschild case reproduces previously known results, whereas the Inversion symmetry leads to a genuinely new vacuum configuration. These findings provide a method for generating algebraically general vacuum geometries and illustrate how electromagnetic embeddings can produce non-trivial vacuum metrics in General Relativity. The main geometrical properties of these spacetimes are discussed. Two additional results are presented in the appendices: a stationary generalization of these vacuum geometries, and two further static vacuum configurations obtained through the same symmetries but using the Alekseev--Garc\'ia black hole as the seed.</description>

Abstract: The principle of relativity is extended to accommodate observers with quantum properties. This results in a new theory that introduces relative quantization rules and novel uncertainty relations, while also elucidating some interpretational problems present in the current formulation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Operational measurement of relativistic equilibrium from stochastic fields alone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relativistic equilibrium is described by the inverse-temperature four-vector $\beta^\mu = u^\mu/(k_B T_0)$ rather than by a frame-dependent scalar temperature. We show that $\beta^\mu$ can be reconstructed directly from electromagnetic fluctuations emitted by a drifting medium, without external probes, spectral lines, or absolute intensity calibration. A Lorentz boost converts isotropic rest-frame noise into correlated electric and magnetic fields, producing a gain-independent fluctuation observable that yields the drift velocity purely from stochastic data. Combined with angle-resolved noise spectra governed by the covariant fluctuation--dissipation theorem, this enables full reconstruction of $\beta^\mu$ using electromagnetic measurements alone. Monte Carlo analysis demonstrates percent-level accuracy at realistic signal-to-noise ratios, and feasibility estimates indicate sub-microsecond integration times for laboratory plasmas. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first method that reconstructs the covariant thermal state $\beta^\mu$ of a relativistic medium from passive stochastic fields alone, without absolute calibration, spectral lines, or external probes. These results establish vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations as a direct operational probe of relativistic equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Spectral Spacetime Entropy for Quasifree Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the necessity to UV-regularise entanglement entropy, we present a spectral method for calculating the entropy of quasifree states, for both bosonic and fermionic field theories. This construction is defined in spacetime rather than on a hypersurface, enabling the covariant regularisation of entropies, and its calculation in generic spacetime regions. We derive these formulae, which have previously appeared in the literature, in a new manner and highlight certain aspects of them, such as their connection to the density matrix and its eigenvalues. The spacetime nature of the formulation makes it particularly apt in the context of semiclassical and quantum gravity and in connection to black hole entropy. Another useful property of the formulation is its application to settings where no notion of a Cauchy surface exists, such as in the causal set theory approach to quantum gravity. We show example applications of the formulae which demonstrate their ability to reproduce known results. We also show a calculation in a causal set in $1+1$ dimensions which makes use of several of the unique and useful features of the formalism. In this last example, we obtain a novel result of a slightly modified entanglement entropy scaling coefficient, giving a possible signature of spacetime discreteness.</description>

      <title>Fast pre-merger detection of massive black-hole binaries in LISA based on time-frequency excess power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna is expected to observe gravitational waves from massive black hole binaries across cosmic time. Many are anticipated to be detectable hours to weeks before coalescence. We present a fast algorithm for the pre-merger detection and preliminary characterization of such binaries. The method performs a search for excess power with a chirping time-frequency morphology in short-time Fourier transform spectrograms. By tiling the time-frequency plane with slices defined by the quadrupole frequency evolution, we define a signal significance relative to a fitted background distribution of instrumental noise and Galactic foreground. Individual search triggers are followed by a coherence tracker, which groups over time triggers consistent with the same physical signal . Doing so, our analysis provides progressively refined estimates of the chirp mass and coalescence time. We validate our algorithm on the Sangria LISA Data Challenge dataset, successfully detecting all 15 injected MBHBs: 14 of them hours-to-weeks before merger, while one is only detected after the binary coalescence. The algorithm yields chirp mass relative errors below $3\%$ for high-SNR sources and coalescence time uncertainties of up to a few hours. With a computational cost of less than a second to process a 10-day data segment on single core, our approach is suitable for generating real-time alerts, trigger protected observational periods, and provide informative priors for Bayesian parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Analytical Estimates of Gravitational Wave Background Anisotropies from Shot Noise and Large-Scale Structure in Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important next step for pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) is to measure anisotropies in the gravitational wave background (GWB) at $\sim$ nano-Hz frequencies. We calculate the expected GWB anisotropies using empirically calibrated models for the merger rates of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The anisotropies reflect both shot-noise in the discrete SMBHB populations while also tracing, in part, the large-scale structure (LSS) of the universe. The shot-noise term is sensitive to the high-mass end of the merging SMBH mass function, depends somewhat on the low-redshift tail of the merger distribution, and is a strong function of observing frequency. The precise frequency dependence provides a test of SMBHB residence times. In our models, the mean shot-noise anisotropy typically lies close to or above the broad frequency-band NANOGrav upper limits. Consequently, near-future PTA data, and potentially re-analyses of existing measurements using frequency-dependent shot-noise anisotropy templates, should be capable of detecting this signal or placing meaningful constraints on SMBHB merger models. A full interpretation, however, will require modeling the probability distribution of shot-noise amplitudes rather than relying solely on ensemble-averaged predictions. The LSS-induced anisotropies are at least two to three orders of magnitude smaller. Although the LSS contribution contains valuable information regarding the redshift distribution and clustering bias of the merging SMBHBs, detecting this component will be challenging.</description>

      <title>Solution to the Cosmological Constant Problem from Pre-geometric Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel solution to the cosmological constant (CC) problem that requires no fine-tunings nor anthropic reasoning. In pre-geometric gravity (PGG), spacetime emerges from the spontaneous breaking of a fundamental gauge symmetry. This mechanism dynamically generates general relativity while also revealing a deep connection: the topological Gauss-Bonnet coupling of the theory scales precisely as the de Sitter entropy, an enormous number which reflects the information content of our universe. This coupling acts as a gravitational $\theta$-angle parameter, forcing the CC to become quantized into discrete topological sectors. The symmetry-breaking dynamics naturally selects the sector corresponding to the observed vacuum energy. The selected vacuum state is stabilized by the extremely large potential barrier of the pre-geometric Higgs field, which effectively seals it off from quantum tunneling transitions to other topological sectors. The PGG framework thus provides a dynamical explanation for the smallness of the CC, linking gravity, topology and quantum information in a unified picture.</description>

      <title>Theory of striped dynamic spectra of the Crab pulsar high-frequency interpulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A theory of the spectral "zebra" pattern of the Crab pulsar's high-frequency interpulse (HFIP) radio emission is developed. The observed emission bands are interference maxima caused by multiple ray propagation through the pulsar magnetosphere. The high-contrast interference pattern is the combined effect of gravitational lensing and plasma de-lensing of light rays. The model enables space-resolved tomography of the pulsar magnetosphere, yielding a radial plasma density profile of $n_{e}\propto r^{-3}$, which agrees with theoretical insights. We predict the zebra pattern trend to change at a higher frequency when the ray separation becomes smaller than the pulsar size. This frequency is predicted to be in the range between 42 GHz and 650 GHz, which is within the reach of existing facilities like ALMA and SMA. These observations hold significant importance and would contribute to our understanding of the magnetosphere. Furthermore, they offer the potential to investigate gravity in the strong field regime near the star's surface.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov stochasticity parameter (KSP) as a sensitive descriptor of degree of randomness of signals is used to analyze the properties of the NANOGrav pulsar timing data associated to a stochastic gravitational wave background. The time of arrival (TOA) data of white noise for 68 pulsars are analyzed regarding their KSP properties. The analysis enables to obtain the degree of randomness of the white noise for various pulsars and to reveal its inhomogeneity, i.e. pulsars with low and high randomness of the white noise. The time-dependence of the randomness in the white noise is also studied, indicating the existence of non-stationary physical processes influencing the pulsar timing. The KSP thus is acting as an indicator for the degree of the agreement between the observations and the timing models and as a test in revealing the contribution of various physical processes in the stochastic background signal.</description>

      <title>Illuminating the Mass Gap Through Deep Optical Constraint on a Neutron Star Merger Candidate S250206dm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational wave (GW) event S250206dm, as the first well-localized neutron star merger candidate potentially located in the mass gap, presented a unique opportunity to probe the electromagnetic signatures from such a system. Here we report a deep, multiband search with the new 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST), covering about 64% of the localization region up to a 5-sigma limiting magnitude of 23 mag. In total, 12 potential candidates have been identified while none of them are likely related to S250206dm. This non-detection provides the most stringent constraint to date on any associated kilonova. Crucially, an AT 2017gfo-like event at 269 Mpc can be excluded by WFST observations alone. Based on ejecta mass limits, a neutron star-black hole with a large mass ratio (Q &gt;= 3.2) is disfavored. This optical-derived constraint on the mass ratio reaches, for the first time, a precision comparable to that inferred from the GW signal. This work presents the best observation of this type of events until now, and demonstrates the power of rapid, deep follow-up observations to constrain the properties of compact binary progenitors, offering key insights into the constituents of the mass gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observational data in cosmology indicate a small, positive, and nonvanishing cosmological constant that dominates the energy budget of the present universe. The origin of the cosmological constant from a quantum perspective remains unresolved, with a discrepancy of approximately 120 orders of magnitude between its observed value and theoretical estimates. Motivated by earlier work of Gibbons, we analyze the cosmological constant problem within a quantum-gravitational framework based on Schwarzian theory and its ensemble averaging. We then derive the phenomenological value of the dark energy density and obtain the corresponding equation of state. In this model, the cosmological constant arises from the ensemble average of time-reparametrization modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pure 3d gravity in AdS is believed to admit a holographic description in terms of 2d CFT. We introduce a theory of fermionic 3d gravity where we sum over geometries equipped with spin structure, and propose it is holographically described by fermionic 2d CFT data. We evaluate the leading contributions to the gravity path integral with one and two torus boundaries, extracting both the spectrum and its spectral statistics from the torus wormhole. Strikingly, the theory has fermionic black hole microstates, even in the absence of bulk fermionic matter. We then incorporate subtle bulk topological field theories, classified by appropriate cobordism groups, and evaluate the one and two-boundary torus partition functions. The spectral statistics we derive from gravity are shown, in all cases, to be consistent with the pattern of anomalies expected from classifications of fermionic 2d CFT. We also define a version of RMT$_2$, a random-matrix framework compatible with the symmetries of 2d CFTs, which naturally accommodates fermionic spectra and reproduces our gravitational results across all cases we analyze.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a hydrodynamical description of spherical void evolution in modified gravity (MG), extending the standard General Relativity (GR) and dynamical dark energy treatment by encoding gravity modifications into effective couplings that enter the Euler and Poisson equations. This yields a compact non-linear evolution equation for the Eulerian density contrast, controlled by a time- and density-dependent effective gravitational strength, and provides a direct map between model functions and void observables. We apply the framework to the luminal Galileon class of models, where derivative self-interactions generate Vainshtein screening and might lead to a breakdown of the physical branch in sufficiently underdense regions. Exploiting this feature, we apply the void-informed viability requirement that translates into bounds on the theory parameter space and, equivalently, on the minimum attainable void depth as a function of redshift. For viable parameters of a concrete model, we quantify the impact of MG on isolated void evolution, the Lagrangian to Eulerian mapping, and the shell-crossing threshold. Relative to GR, we find a clear hierarchy of MG effects, with ${\cal O}(10\%)$ modifications in the gravitational couplings, percent-level shifts in the void density evolution, and sub-percent deviations in both the mapping and the shell-crossing thresholds. Moreover, within the adopted parametrization, we show analytically that voids always lie in an unscreened regime on the physical branch. Overall, the formalism provides a self-consistent route to predict void dynamics and consistency constraints in a broad class of MG models.</description>

      <title>Testing Local Lorentz Invariance with Laser Tracking of the LAGEOS and LAGEOS II Satellites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Violations of Lorentz Invariance, a cornerstone of modern physics, are predicted by theories of quantum gravity and by extensions of General Relativity involving new vector or tensor fields. In the weak-field limit, such a violation would primarily manifest as a non-zero value for the post-Newtonian parameter $\alpha_1$, which is identically zero in General Relativity. We present a new test of Local Lorentz Invariance by searching for this signature in the orbits of the LAGEOS and LAGEOS II satellites. By applying a Phase Sensitive Detection technique to the mean argument of latitude, derived from about 30 years of Satellite Laser Ranging data, we isolate the periodic signal potentially induced by a preferred reference frame aligned with the Cosmic Microwave Background. {Our analysis yields a new constraint $|\alpha_1| \sim 2 \times 10^{-5}$. This result improves upon the previous best limit from Lunar Laser Ranging and provides the most stringent constraint to date on preferred-frame effects in Earth's gravity.}</description>

      <title>New analytical model of static black hole with a dark matter halo and parametric constraints through quasiperiodic oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20031v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel analytical Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) solution is derived. It exhibits a static BH with a dark matter (DM) halo characterized by a Dehnen-type density profile. This solution could represent an alternative perspective on the interaction of black hole-dark matter systems, providing new insights into the fundamental properties of DM halos. We study the properties of the newly derived BH solution by examining its spacetime curvature characteristics and energy conditions, providing insights into how the DM halo influences these fundamental characteristics. Additionally, we analyze the timelike geodesics of test particles in the obtained BH-DM spacetime, highlighting how the presence of the novel Dehnen-type DM halo alters the gravitational dynamics and modifies particle trajectories. Increase of the DM halo's density $\rho_s$ and characteristic scale $r_s$ leads to an outward shift of both stable and unstable circular orbits. Finally, we test our model by fitting it to real data from the microquasars GRO J1655-40, GRS 1915+105, and XTE J1550-564 using a statistical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. This allows us to find the best estimates for the properties of the DM halo surrounding these systems.</description>

      <title>Wigner's friend's black hole adventure: an argument for complementarity?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the heart of both black hole physics and Wigner's friend scenarios lies the question of unitarity. In Wigner's friend setups, sealed-lab measurements are modeled unitarily, probing the measurement problem.In black hole physics, the unitarity problem concerns information preservation in evaporation. We extend a recent analogy between these two puzzles exposed by Hausmann and Renner [arXiv:2504.03835v1] by constructing new paradoxes that merge black hole physics with extensions of the Wigner's friend scenario into a unified argument. This unified construction allows us to sharpen the cloning and firewall paradoxes, which leave room for a post-quantum theory to consistently describe the physics of black holes. We close this loophole, showing that no such theory exists if no observer can experimentally falsify quantum theory's predictions. We conclude by briefly highlighting subtleties in assumptions commonly used in black hole puzzles.</description>

      <title>Effective Dynamics of Loop Quantum Kaluza-Klein Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07962v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The five-dimensional loop quantum Kaluza-Klein cosmology is constructed based on the symmetric reduction of the connection formulation of the full theory. Through semiclassical analysis, the effective scalar constraint for the cosmological model coupled with a dust field is derived, incorporating the quantum fluctuations of geometry as a subleading order correction. It demonstrates that the quantum model has the correct classical limit. The explicit solutions to the equations of motion show that the big bang and past big rip singularities in the classical model are avoided by a quantum bounce and a quantum collapse respectively in the effective model. In a particular scenario, the dynamical compactification of the extra dimension is realized, while the observable four-dimensional universe transitions through three distinct epochs: (i) a super-inflationary phase generating 55 e-folds, (ii) a decelerated expansion era, and (iii) a late-time accelerated expansion phase driven by quantum fluctuations. These results suggest that both cosmic inflation and dark energy may originate from the interplay between the compact extra dimension and quantum geometric effects.</description>

      <title>GWTC-4.0: Methods for Identifying and Characterizing Gravitational-wave Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC) is a collection of candidate gravitational-wave transient signals identified and characterized by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. Producing the contents of the GWTC from detector data requires complex analysis methods. These comprise techniques to model the signal; identify the transients in the data; evaluate the quality of the data and mitigate possible instrumental issues; infer the parameters of each transient; compare the data with the waveform models for compact binary coalescences; and handle the large amount of results associated with all these different analyses. In this paper, we describe the methods employed to produce the catalog's fourth release, GWTC-4.0, focusing on the analysis of the first part of the fourth observing run of Advanced LIGO, Advanced Virgo and KAGRA.</description>

      <title>Self-regularized entropy: What does black hole entropy predict for tests of Kerr no-hair theorem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the canonical (brick-wall) entropy of Hawking radiation in a in a quantum black hole model whose strong-field exterior is modeled phenomenologically, to first order in a small quadrupole parameter, by the static q-metric, which is an exact vacuum solution of the Einstein equations. WKB counting of trapped near-horizon cavity modes shows that, within the perturbative small-deformation regime studied here, a modest quadrupolar deformation self-regularizes the ultraviolet divergence: the entropy becomes finite without an ad hoc cutoff. Adopting the Hawking temperature and the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of a Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass as external thermodynamic inputs, matching this canonical entropy to that benchmark yields an entropy-motivated deformation scale which, when interpreted phenomenologically in a stationary extension, corresponds to percent-to-tens-of-percent violations of the Kerr multipole relations, and provides concrete observational targets for the Next Generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT), the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), and planned third-generation (3G) ground-based gravitational wave observatories.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Ruffini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134 (2025) 8, 081403] pointed out that the repetitive Penrose process cannot drain the entire extractable energy of a Kerr black hole. In this Letter, we alternatively point out the charge of a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole cannot drop down to exactly zero via the repetitive electric Penrose process that is terminated after a finite number of iterative steps, indicating a new thermodynamical third-law analog for the repetitive electric Penrose process.</description>

      <title>Threshold Resolvent Singularities and the Infrared Structure of Linearized Gravit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a sharp geometric threshold governing the infrared spectral behavior of the spatial Lichnerowicz operator on asymptotically flat three--dimensional manifolds. Let $(M,g)$ be asymptotically flat and let $L=\Delta_L$ denote the spatial Lichnerowicz operator acting on symmetric $2$--tensors. Assume \[ |{\rm Riem}(x)| \lesssim r(x)^{-p} \quad \text{as } r(x)\to\infty . \]
  If $p&gt;3$, curvature is spectrally short--range: $L$ exhibits regular low--energy scattering and zero energy is not singular. At the critical decay \[ |{\rm Riem}(x)| \sim r^{-3}, \] dispersion and curvature balance. Zero enters the essential spectrum and the weighted resolvent develops a threshold singularity. For $s\in(1/2,1)$, \[ \|\langle r\rangle^{-s}(L-i\varepsilon)^{-1}\langle r\rangle^{-s}\| \gtrsim \varepsilon^{-(1-s)} \quad \text{as } \varepsilon \downarrow 0 . \] Thus the limiting absorption principle fails at zero energy.
  This singularity provides a spatial spectral mechanism for the infrared sector of linearized gravity. The same inverse--cube scaling governs long--range correlations, irregular low--frequency scattering, and soft gravitational modes. Numerical simulations of a radial model and the full tensor operator confirm that $p=3$ marks a sharp transition between negligible and marginal curvature.
  The associated branch point at zero energy determines late--time relaxation, yielding the universal tail exponent \[ t^{-(2\ell+3)}, \] a spectral consequence of nonzero ADM mass. More generally, in $d$ spatial dimensions the critical decay \[ |{\rm Riem}(x)| \sim r^{-d} \] forms a universal boundary for curvature--coupled Laplace--type operators, encoding the infrared structure of gravity in the spectral geometry of a Cauchy slice.</description>

      <title>From minimal-length quantum theory to modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider generalized uncertainty principles (GUPs) that incorporate a minimal length through generic momentum-dependent deformation functions. We thus develop a systematic approach connecting such a framework to effective gravitational actions extending general relativity. By examining quantum gravity-motivated corrections to black hole entropy induced by the GUP and employing Wald's formalism, we reconstruct modifications to Einstein's gravity within the contexts of $f(R)$ and $f(R, R_{\mu\nu} R^{\mu\nu})$ theories. In this way, we establish a direct mapping between the GUP parameters and the higher-order curvature coefficients in the gravitational Lagrangian. As an illustrative application, we compute corrections to the general relativistic prediction for light deflection, which in turn allows us to infer a stringent upper bound on the minimal measurable length. Our results show that GUP-induced effects can be consistently embedded into extended gravity theories, offering a promising framework for testing quantum gravity phenomenology through astrophysical and cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Continued fraction method for high overtone quasinormal modes in effective potentials with discontinuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we extend Leaver's continued fraction method to evaluate black hole quasinormal modes (QNMs) in systems where the effective potential exhibits a discontinuity. Besides the low-lying modes, we particularly focus on high overtones, which are physically pertinent due to the substantial deformation of the QNM spectrum triggered by spectral instability. In our algorithm, we expand the wavefunction at the point of discontinuity, instead of the black hole horizon, and incorporate the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions. %As the wavefunction convergence condition becomes irrelevant, our proposed algorithm generalizes the original method by expanding the wavefunctions at the point of discontinuity, and the associated difficulty is mitigated by rectifying the recurrence relations between the expansion coefficients to incorporate the Israel-Lanczos-Sen junction conditions. We apply this algorithm to compute the QNMs of the modified Regge-Wheeler potential up to $2000$ modes with high precision. For the low-lying modes, the numerical results show excellent agreement with those obtained using the matrix and Prony methods. The high overtones are significantly deformed, owing to the presence of echoes due to the discontinuity. This deformation in the asymptotic QNM spectrum reveals universal features that are largely independent of the specific form of the discontinuity in the potential, seemingly coinciding with those observed in the modified P\"oschl-Teller effective potential. We speculate on whether the collective effect of the high overtones has an observational impact on gravitational wave signals.</description>

      <title>The measurable impact of the 2pN spin-dependent accelerations on the jet precession of M87$^\ast$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent accurate measurements of disk/jet coprecessions around some galactic supermassive black holes, the accelerations experienced by an uncharged, spinless object in the Kerr metric, written in harmonic coordinates, are analytically calculated up to the formal second post-Newtonian order. To such a level, some new accelerations make their appearance. They are proportional to even and odd powers of the hole's angular momentum. Their counterparts are not known where the primary is a material body. After expressing them in a coordinate-independent, vector form valid for any orientations of the hole's spin axis in space, their orbital effects are perturbatively worked out in terms of the particle's Keplerian orbital elements. The resulting expressions, averaged over one orbital revolution, are valid for generic shapes and inclinations of the orbit. The orbital plane's precession proportional to the first power of the hole's angular momentum and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light amounts to about twenty per cent of the corresponding Lense-Thirring effect. The latter is believed to be the cause of the accurately measured disk/jet precessional phenomenology, currently measured to a few per cent accuracy. Although at a lesser extent, also the precession proportional to the second power of the hole's spin and to the reciprocal of the fourth power of the speed of light is measurable. Allowed domains in the parameter space of the jet precession around M87$^\ast$ are displayed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, astronomers discovered unusual Einstein cross images of the galaxy HerS-3, which feature a bright central spot. Motivated by studies of images produced by regular stars, it has been proposed that optical appearances caused by compact stars acting as gravitational lenses may account for this central bright spot. We further suggest that images produced by regular stars exhibit additional characteristics distinct from those of ordinary black holes, such as the possible partial or complete absence of secondary images. These phenomena may serve as favorable observational criteria for identifying regular stars in future searches.</description>

Abstract: The composition of the core of neutron stars (NS) is still under debate. One possibility is that because of the high densities reached in their cores, matter could be deconfined into quark matter. We investigate the existence of hybrid stars, using microscopic models to describe different phases of matter. Within the adopted microscopic models we calculate properties of NS and properties of matter. We want to probe the pQCD calculations influence and analyze properties that identify a transition to deconfined matter. Bayesian approach is applied to generate 8 sets of equations of state (EOS). A Maxwell construction is adopted to describe the deconfinement transition. For the hadron phase, we consider a stiff and a soft EOS obtained from the Relativistic Mean Field model with nonlinear meson terms. For the quark phase, we use 2 different models: the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model with multiquark interactions and the Mean Field Theory of QCD, a model similar to the vector MIT bag model. Bayesian inference was applied to determine the model parameters that satisfy the X-ray observations from NICER and have phase transition at densities between 0.15 - 0.40 fm$^{-3}$. We also applied restrictions from the pQCD calculations to half of the sets. Hybrid stars are compatible with current observational data. The pQCD restrictions reduce the value of the $M_{max}$. However, even applying this restriction, the models were able to reach values of $2.1 - 2.3 M_\odot$. The conformal limit was still not attained at the center of the most massive stars. The vector interactions are essential to describe hybrid stars with a mass above $2 M_\odot$. The multiquark interactions introduced may affect the limits of some quantities considered as indicators of the presence of a deconfined phase. It is possible to find a set of EOS, that predict that inside NS the renormalized matter trace anomaly is always positive.</description>

      <title>Precision Inflationary Predictions: Impact of Accurate End-of-Inflation Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01713v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precision era of cosmology demands accurate theoretical predictions from inflationary models. In quantitative reheating analyses, inflationary observables depend sensitively on the number of e-folds between horizon exit and the end of inflation, $N_k$, whose determination relies on slow-roll approximations near the end of inflation. Since inflation ends when the first slow-roll parameter reaches unity, even modest inaccuracies in this approximation can shift the end of inflation and thereby alter $N_k$, leading to modifications in predicted observables -- including those evaluated at leading order. While such effects are implicit in standard treatments, their quantitative impact on observable constraints has not been systematically assessed. In this work, we first re-evaluate leading-order slow-roll predictions using an improved determination of $N_k$ within a simple quantitative reheating framework, and then incorporate higher-order slow-roll corrections consistently with the revised background evolution. Applying this framework to the Starobinsky model, we find that improved end-of-inflation dynamics alone can induce shifts of order $\Delta n_s \sim 10^{-3}$, while higher-order slow-roll corrections provide additional refinements at the $\sim 4 \times 10^{-4}$ level. The cumulative effect results in a maximum shift of $\Delta n_s \sim 1.2 \times 10^{-3}$ within the allowed reheating range. These results demonstrate that an accurate determination of the end of inflation is essential for precision tests of inflationary models.</description>

      <title>Rod Structures and Patching Matrices: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I review the twistor theory construction of stationary and axisymmetric, Lorentzian signature solutions of the Einstein vacuum equations and the related toric Ricci-flat metrics of Riemannian signature, \cite{W,MW,F,FW}. The construction arises from the Ward construction \cite{W2} of anti-self-dual Yang-Mills fields as holomorphic vector bundles on twistor space, with the observation of Witten \cite{LW} that the Einstein equations for these metrics include the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations. The principal datum for a solution is the holomorphic patching matrix $P$ for a holomorphic vector bundle on a reduced twistor space, and $P$ is typically simpler than the corresponding metric to write down.
  I give a catalogue of examples, building on earlier collections \cite{F,AG}, and consider the inverse problem: how far does the rod structure of such a metric, together with its asymptotics, determine $P$?</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and observational implications of black holes in toroidal geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01132v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic and observational implications for the charged torus-like black holes, a class of solutions distinct from the classical Schwarzschild black holes. We explicitly derive the fundamental thermodynamic properties, such as heat capacity, P-V diagram, isothermal compressibility, Helmholtz free energy, and Gibbs free energy, under different entropy models. We find that only the exponential corrected entropy demonstrates multiple phase transitions, which we validate with the Ricci Scalar divergence obtained from the Ruppeiner formalism. This indicates that exponential corrected entropy is more sensitive to BH's microstructure as compared to the Hawking-Bekenstein and R\`{e}nyi entropy models. In addition, we study the sparsity and emission rates of Hawking radiation, demonstrating that exponential correction entropy yields more consistent and stable behavior. In our observational analysis, we graphically demonstrate the behavior of redshift, blueshift, and gravitational shift, and identify specific conditions where the photon sphere radius exceeds the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which depends on the values of parameters such as electric charge and cosmological constant. The novel insight of this work is that despite this violation, our computed redshift, blueshift, and gravitational shifts fall within the range of the observational data of NGC 4258 and UGC 3789.</description>

      <title>Gauging the Standard Model 1-form symmetry via gravitational instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fate of the Standard Model (SM) $\mathbb Z_6^{(1)}$ electric $1$-form global symmetry in the background of gravitational instantons, focusing on Eguchi-Hanson (EH) geometries. We show that EH instantons support quantized $\mathbb Z_6^{(1)}$ fluxes localized on their $S^2$ bolt, inducing fractional topological charge without backreacting on the geometry. The requirement that quark and lepton wavefunctions be globally well-defined under parallel transport imposes boundary conditions, removing ill-defined fermion zero modes; the surviving spectrum is confirmed by an explicit solution of the Dirac equation and by the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem. The Euclidean path integral in the EH background can be interpreted as a transition amplitude from an entangled state between two identical halves of space to the vacuum. Summing over all $\mathbb{Z}_6^{(1)}$ flux sectors in the path integral gauges the SM $1$-form symmetry; thus, it cannot persist as an exact global symmetry in the semiclassical limit of gravity. We further show that these fluxes induce baryon- and lepton-number violating processes, which are exponentially suppressed due to the smallness of the hypercharge coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Inconsistencies of Tsallis Cosmology within Horizon Thermodynamics and Holographic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological implications of Tsallis entropy in two widely discussed frameworks: the Cai-Kim thermodynamic derivation of the Friedman equations and the Tsallis holographic dark energy (HDE) scenario, considering both the Hubble scale and the Granda-Oliveros (GO) cutoff as infrared regulators. In both cases, the dynamics introduce a nonextensivity parameter $\delta$, with the standard Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area relation recovered for $\delta = 1$. While previous studies have suggested that only small deviations from extensivity are observationally allowed, typically requiring $|1 - \delta| \lesssim 10^{-3}$, here we go further and perform a systematic consistency analysis across the entire expansion history.
  We show that even mild departures from $\delta = 1$ lead to pathological behavior in the effective dark energy sector: its density can become negative or complex, its equation of state may diverge, or it can contribute an unacceptably large early-time fraction that spoils radiation domination and violates BBN and CMB constraints. Our results sharpen and unify earlier hints of tension, providing a clear physical interpretation in terms of corrections that grow uncontrollably with the expansion rate toward the past.
  We conclude that within both the Cai-Kim and HDE formulations, a viable cosmology emerges only in the extensive limit, effectively reducing the models to $\Lambda$CDM. More broadly, our findings emphasize the importance of dynamical consistency and cosmological viability tests, when assessing nonextensive entropy formalisms as potential frameworks for describing the Universe's dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Inference of Hybrid Stars with Large Quark Cores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are interesting objects capable of reaching densities unattainable on Earth. The properties of matter under these conditions remain a mystery. Exotic matter, including quark matter, may be present in the NS core. In this work, we explore the possible compositions of NS cores, in particular, the possible existence of large quark cores. We use the Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) model with nonlinear terms for the hadron phase and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model and Mean Field Theory of Quantum Chromodynamics (MFTQCD) for the quark phase. Through Bayesian inference, we obtain different sets of equations: four sets with hybrid equations and one set with only the hadron phase. We impose constraints regarding the properties of nuclear matter, X-ray observational data from NICER, gravitational wave data from the binary neutron star merger GW170817, perturbative QCD (pQCD) calculations, and causality. The MFTQCD allows for a phase transition to quark matter at low densities, just above saturation density, while for the NJL sets, the phase transition occurs above twice the saturation density. As a result, the MFTQCD model predicts the presence of quark matter in the inner core of 1.4 M$_\odot$ NSs, while NJL models suggest a low probability of quark matter in the interior of a 1.4 M$_\odot$ NS. Both models predict the existence of quark matter in 2 M$_\odot$ NSs. The slope of the mass-radius curve has been shown to carry information about the presence of quark matter. In particular, a positive slope at 1.8 M$_\odot$ indicates the presence of non-nucleonic matter. A hybrid star with a stiff quark equation of state could explain a larger radius in more massive stars, such as two solar mass stars, compared to canonical NSs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ultra-relativistic (Carrollian) regime of gravity has recently emerged as a fertile framework for exploring holography, non-Lorentzian symmetries, and geometric limit of General Relativity. In this letter, we establish the presence of a non-vanishing torsion within three-dimensional Carrollian gravity by constructing the Carrollian Mielke-Baekler (C-MB) gravity theory in its Chern-Simons formulation, obtained as the ultra-relativistic limit of the relativistic Mielke-Baekler model. The resulting C-MB theory features non-zero temporal torsion and curvature, together with spatial curvature, providing the most general three-dimensional Carrollian gravity model with these properties. Temporal torsion affects non-affinity of null generators and boundary dynamics. Several known ultra-relativistic gravity theories arise as particular limits of this framework, highlighting its unifying character.</description>

      <title>$\mathbf{\Omega_1\Omega_2}$-$\mathbf{\Lambda}$CDM: A promising phenomenological extension of the standard model of cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19000v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a phenomenological extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM framework, the $\Omega_1\Omega_2$-$\Lambda$CDM model, in which the total energy density of the universe is expanded in powers of $1+z$. This parameterization recovers $\Lambda$CDM and introduces two additional terms, $\Omega_1(1+z)$ and $\Omega_2(1+z)^2$, in the dark energy sector alongside the cosmological constant, leading to a physically interpretable and observationally testable effective dark energy dynamics. Using Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) data, we find that the model allows additional freedom in the late-time expansion history while preserving standard early-universe physics. When DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data are included, the inferred Hubble constant is $H_0 = 69.74 \pm 0.77~\mathrm{km\;s^{-1}\;Mpc^{-1}}$ (68% CL), consistent with Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB) measurements from the Carnegie--Chicago Hubble Program (CCHP). The reconstructed dark energy equation of state exhibits a smooth transition across the phantom divide followed by asymptotic de Sitter behavior, modifying late-time dynamics while maintaining standard early-time cosmology. Overall, controlled late-time deviations from $\Lambda$CDM improve cosmological concordance.</description>

Abstract: We construct a large number of exact solutions of three-dimensional gravity with heavy matter particles that generalize the construction of Antonini, Sasieta, and Swingle (AS${}^2$), argued to define CFT states dual to a spacetime with a closed baby universe cosmology. Our construction starts with an arbitrary heavy-particle closed universe cosmology of the type constructed in arXiv:2503.12227, and via a gluing procedure adds an arbitrary number of AdS tubes connecting the past and future conformal boundaries of the associated Euclidean wormhole solution. With our construction, it is straightforward to produce examples where the cosmology is approximately homogeneous and isotropic. We describe a necessary condition for the cosmological wormhole saddle to dominate the Euclidean path integral with the specified boundary conditions. We argue that the original AS${}^2$ construction usually does not meet this condition, and describe alternative saddles that are likely to dominate. We discuss various possibilities for how the cosmological saddle might be made to dominate in our generalized construction.</description>
