      <title>Min-CSPs on Complete Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a fixed arity $k \geq 2$, Min-$k$-CSP on complete instances involves a set of $n$ variables $V$ and one nontrivial constraint for every $k$-subset of variables (so there are $\binom{n}{k}$ constraints). The goal is to find an assignment that minimizes unsatisfied constraints. Unlike Max-$k$-CSP that admits a PTAS on dense or expanding instances, the approximability of Min-$k$-CSP is less understood. For some CSPs like Min-$k$-SAT, there's an approximation-preserving reduction from general to dense instances, making complete instances unique for potential new techniques.
  This paper initiates a study of Min-$k$-CSPs on complete instances. We present an $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for Min-2-SAT on complete instances, the minimization version of Max-2-SAT. Since $O(1)$-approximation on dense or expanding instances refutes the Unique Games Conjecture, it shows a strict separation between complete and dense/expanding instances.
  Then we study the decision versions of CSPs, aiming to satisfy all constraints; which is necessary for any nontrivial approximation. Our second main result is a quasi-polynomial time algorithm for every Boolean $k$-CSP on complete instances, including $k$-SAT. We provide additional algorithmic and hardness results for CSPs with larger alphabets, characterizing (arity, alphabet size) pairs that admit a quasi-polynomial time algorithm on complete instances.</description>

      <title>Tera-Scale Multilevel Graph Partitioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present TeraPart, a memory-efficient multilevel graph partitioning method that is designed to scale to extremely large graphs.
  In balanced graph partitioning, the goal is to divide the vertices into $k$ blocks with balanced size while cutting as few edges as possible.
  Due to its NP-hard nature, heuristics are prevalent in this field, with the multilevel framework as the state-of-the-art method.
  Recent work has seen tremendous progress in speeding up partitioning algorithms through parallelism. The current obstacle in scaling to larger graphs is the high memory usage due to auxiliary data structures and storing the graph itself in memory.
  In this paper, we present and study several optimizations to significantly reduce their memory footprint.
  We devise parallel label propagation clustering and graph contraction algorithms that use $O(n)$ auxiliary space instead of $O(np)$, where $p$ is the number of processors.
  Moreover, we employ an existing compressed graph representation that enables iterating over a neighborhood by on-the-fly decoding at speeds close to the uncompressed graph.
  Combining these optimizations yields up to a 16-fold reduction in peak memory, while retaining the same solution quality and similar speed.
  This configuration can partition a graph with one trillion edges in under 8 minutes \emph{on a single machine} using around 900\,GiB of RAM.
  This is the first work to employ the multilevel framework at this scale, which is vital to achieving low edge cuts.
  Moreover, our distributed memory implementation handles graphs of up to 16 trillion edges on 128 machines with 256\,GiB each in just under 10 minutes.
  Finally, we present a version of shared-memory parallel FM local search that uses $O(m)$ space instead of $O(nk)$, reducing peak memory by factor 5.8 on medium-sized graphs without affecting running time.</description>

      <title>Overcoming Non-Submodularity: Constant Approximation for Network Immunization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a network with an ongoing epidemic, the network immunization problem seeks to identify a fixed number of nodes to immunize in order to maximize the number of infections prevented. One of the fundamental computational challenges in network immunization is that the objective function is generally neither submodular nor supermodular. As a result, no efficient algorithm is known to consistently find a solution with a constant approximation guarantee. Traditionally, this problem is addressed using proxy objectives, which offer better approximation properties. However, converting to these indirect optimizations often introduces losses in effectiveness. In this paper, we overcome these fundamental barriers by utilizing the underlying stochastic structures of the diffusion process. Similar to the traditional influence objective, the immunization objective is an expectation that can be expressed as the sum of objectives over deterministic instances. However, unlike the former, some of these terms are not submodular. The key step is proving that this sum has a bounded deviation from submodularity, thereby enabling the greedy algorithm to achieve constant factor approximation. We show that this approximation still stands considering a variety of immunization settings and spread models.</description>

      <title>Paths and Intersections: Characterization of Quasi-metrics in Directed Okamura-Seymour Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the following distance realization problem. Given a quasi-metric $D$ on a set $T$ of terminals, does there exist a directed Okamura-Seymour graph that realizes $D$ as the (directed) shortest-path distance metric on $T$? We show that, if we are further given the circular ordering of terminals lying on the boundary, then Monge property is a sufficient and necessary condition. This generalizes previous results for undirected Okamura-Seymour instances.
  With the circular ordering, we give a greedy algorithm for constructing a directed Okamura-Seymour instance that realizes the input quasi-metric. The algorithm takes the dual perspective concerning flows and routings, and is based on a new way of analyzing graph structures, by viewing graphs as \emph{paths and their intersections}. We believe this new understanding is of independent interest and will prove useful in other problems in graph theory and graph algorithms.
  We also design an efficient algorithm for finding such a circular ordering that makes $D$ satisfy Monge property, if one exists. Combined with our result above, this gives an efficient algorithm for the distance realization problem.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Deterministic Network Decomposition and Ruling Set, and Improved MIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper improves and in two cases nearly settles, up to logarithmically lower-order factors, the deterministic complexity of some of the most central problems in distributed graph algorithms, which have been studied for over three decades:
  Near-Optimal Network Decomposition: We present a deterministic distributed algorithm that computes a network decomposition in approximately O(log^2 n) rounds, with O(log n) diameter and O(log n) colors. This round complexity is near-optimal in the following sense: even given an ideal network decomposition, using it (in the standard way) requires round complexity equal to the product of diameter and number of colors, which is known to be approximately Omega(log^2 n). This near-optimality is remarkable, considering the rarity of optimal deterministic distributed algorithms and that for network decomposition, the first polylogarithmic-round algorithm was achieved only recently, by Rozhon and Ghaffari [STOC 2020], after three decades.
  Near-Optimal Ruling Set: We present a deterministic distributed algorithm that computes an O(log log n) ruling set in approximately O(log n) rounds. This is an exponential improvement over the O(log n) ruling set of Awerbuch, Goldberg, Luby, and Plotkin [FOCS 1989], while almost matching their O(log n) round complexity. Our result's round complexity nearly matches the approximately Omega(log n) lower bound established by Balliu, Brandt, Kuhn, and Olivetti [STOC 2022], which applies to any poly(log log n) ruling set.
  Improved Maximal Independent Set (MIS): We present a deterministic distributed algorithm for computing an MIS in approximately O(log^(5/3) n) rounds. This improves upon the approximately O(log^2 n) complexity achieved by Ghaffari and Grunau [STOC 2023] and breaks the log-squared barrier necessary for any method based on network decomposition.</description>

      <title>Dynamic O(arboricity) coloring in polylogarithmic worst-case time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent work by Christiansen, Nowicki, and Rotenberg provides dynamic algorithms for coloring sparse graphs, concretely as a function of the arboricity alpha of the input graph. They give two randomized algorithms: O({alpha} log {alpha}) implicit coloring in poly(log n) worst-case update and query times, and O(min{{alpha} log {alpha}, {alpha} log log log n}) implicit coloring in poly(log n) amortized update and query times (against an oblivious adversary). We improve these results in terms of the number of colors and the time guarantee: First, we present an extremely simple algorithm that computes an O({alpha})-implicit coloring with poly(log n) amortized update and query times. Second, and as the main technical contribution of our work, we show that the time complexity guarantee can be strengthened from amortized to worst-case. That is, we give a dynamic algorithm for implicit O({alpha})-coloring with poly(log n) worst-case update and query times (against an oblivious adversary).</description>

      <title>Improved Hardness-of-Approximation for Token Swapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the token swapping problem, in which we are given a graph with an initial assignment of one distinct token to each vertex, and a final desired assignment (again with one token per vertex). The goal is to find the minimum length sequence of swaps of adjacent tokens required to get from the initial to final assignment.
  The token swapping problem is known to be NP-complete. It is also known to have a polynomial-time 4-approximation algorithm. From the hardness-of-approximation side, it is known to be NP-hard to approximate with ratio better than 1001/1000.
  Our main result is an improvement of the approximation ratio of the lower bound: We show that it is NP-hard to approximate with ratio better than 14/13.
  We then turn our attention to the 0/1-weighted version, in which every token has a weight of either 0 or 1, and the cost of a swap is the sum of the weights of the two participating tokens. Unlike standard token swapping, no constant-factor approximation is known for this version, and we provide an explanation. We prove that 0/1-weighted token swapping is NP-hard to approximate with ratio better than $(1-\varepsilon) \ln(n)$ for any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$.
  Lastly, we prove two barrier results for the standard (unweighted) token swapping problem. We show that one cannot beat the current best known approximation ratio of 4 using a large class of algorithms which includes all known algorithms, nor can one beat it using a common analysis framework.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Computation trade-offs in Private Repetition and Metaselection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Private Repetition algorithm takes as input a differentially private algorithm with constant success probability and boosts it to one that succeeds with high probability. These algorithms are closely related to private metaselection algorithms that compete with the best of many private algorithms, and private hyperparameter tuning algorithms that compete with the best hyperparameter settings for a private learning algorithm. Existing algorithms for these tasks pay either a large overhead in privacy cost, or a large overhead in computational cost. In this work, we show strong lower bounds for problems of this kind, showing in particular that for any algorithm that preserves the privacy cost up to a constant factor, the failure probability can only fall polynomially in the computational overhead. This is in stark contrast with the non-private setting, where the failure probability falls exponentially in the computational overhead. By carefully combining existing algorithms for metaselection, we prove computation-privacy tradeoffs that nearly match our lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Fairness and Efficiency in Online Class Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The online bipartite matching problem, extensively studied in the literature, deals with the allocation of online arriving vertices (items) to a predetermined set of offline vertices (agents). However, little attention has been given to the concept of class fairness, where agents are categorized into different classes, and the matching algorithm must ensure equitable distribution across these classes.
  We here focus on randomized algorithms for the fair matching of indivisible items, subject to various definitions of fairness. Our main contribution is the first (randomized) non-wasteful algorithm that simultaneously achieves a $1/2$ approximation to class envy-freeness (CEF) while simultaneously ensuring an equivalent approximation to the class proportionality (CPROP) and utilitarian social welfare (USW) objectives. We supplement this result by demonstrating that no non-wasteful algorithm can achieve an $\alpha$-CEF guarantee for $\alpha &gt; 0.761$. In a similar vein, we provide a novel input instance for deterministic divisible matching that demonstrates a nearly tight CEF approximation.
  Lastly, we define the ``price of fairness,'' which represents the trade-off between optimal and fair matching. We demonstrate that increasing the level of fairness in the approximation of the solution leads to a decrease in the objective of maximizing USW, following an inverse proportionality relationship.</description>

      <title>Online Matching in Geometric Random Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate online maximum cardinality matching, a central problem in ad allocation. In this problem, users are revealed sequentially, and each new user can be paired with any previously unmatched campaign that it is compatible with. Despite the limited theoretical guarantees, the greedy algorithm, which matches incoming users with any available campaign, exhibits outstanding performance in practice. Some theoretical support for this practical success was established in specific classes of graphs, where the connections between different vertices lack strong correlations - an assumption not always valid. To bridge this gap, we focus on the following model: both users and campaigns are represented as points uniformly distributed in the interval $[0,1]$, and a user is eligible to be paired with a campaign if they are similar enough, i.e. the distance between their respective points is less than $c/N$, with $c&gt;0$ a model parameter. As a benchmark, we determine the size of the optimal offline matching in these bipartite random geometric graphs. In the online setting and investigate the number of matches made by the online algorithm closest, which greedily pairs incoming points with their nearest available neighbors. We demonstrate that the algorithm's performance can be compared to its fluid limit, which is characterized as the solution to a specific partial differential equation (PDE). From this PDE solution, we can compute the competitive ratio of closest, and our computations reveal that it remains significantly better than its worst-case guarantee. This model turns out to be related to the online minimum cost matching problem, and we can extend the results to refine certain findings in that area of research. Specifically, we determine the exact asymptotic cost of closest in the $\epsilon$-excess regime, providing a more accurate estimate than the previously known loose upper bound.</description>

      <title>Navigable Graphs for High-Dimensional Nearest Neighbor Search: Constructions and Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18680v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been significant recent interest in graph-based nearest neighbor search methods, many of which are centered on the construction of navigable graphs over high-dimensional point sets. A graph is navigable if we can successfully move from any starting node to any target node using a greedy routing strategy where we always move to the neighbor that is closest to the destination according to a given distance function. The complete graph is navigable for any point set, but the important question for applications is if sparser graphs can be constructed. While this question is fairly well understood in low-dimensions, we establish some of the first upper and lower bounds for high-dimensional point sets. First, we give a simple and efficient way to construct a navigable graph with average degree $O(\sqrt{n \log n })$ for any set of $n$ points, in any dimension, for any distance function. We compliment this result with a nearly matching lower bound: even under the Euclidean metric in $O(\log n)$ dimensions, a random point set has no navigable graph with average degree $O(n^{\alpha})$ for any $\alpha &lt; 1/2$. Our lower bound relies on sharp anti-concentration bounds for binomial random variables, which we use to show that the near-neighborhoods of a set of random points do not overlap significantly, forcing any navigable graph to have many edges.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Online Bipartite Edge Coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study online bipartite edge coloring, with nodes on one side of the graph revealed sequentially. The trivial greedy algorithm is $(2-o(1))$-competitive, which is optimal for graphs of low maximum degree, $\Delta=O(\log n)$ [BNMN IPL'92]. Numerous online edge-coloring algorithms outperforming the greedy algorithm in various settings were designed over the years (e.g., AGKM FOCS'03, BMM SODA'10, CPW FOCS'19, BGW SODA'21, KLSST STOC'22, BSVW STOC'24), all crucially relying on randomization. A commonly-held belief, first stated by [BNMN IPL'92], is that randomization is necessary to outperform greedy.
  Surprisingly, we refute this belief, by presenting a deterministic algorithm that beats greedy for sufficiently large $\Delta=\Omega(\log n)$, and in particular has competitive ratio $\frac{e}{e-1}+o(1)$ for all $\Delta=\omega(\log n)$. We obtain our result via a new and surprisingly simple randomized algorithm that works against adaptive adversaries (as opposed to oblivious adversaries assumed by prior work), which implies the existence of a similarly-competitive deterministic algorithm [BDBKTW STOC'90].</description>

Abstract: Cycle packing is a fundamental problem in optimization, graph theory, and algorithms. Motivated by recent advancements in finding vertex-disjoint paths between a specified set of vertices that either minimize the total length of the paths [Bj\"orklund, Husfeldt, ICALP 2014; Mari, Mukherjee, Pilipczuk, and Sankowski, SODA 2024] or request the paths to be shortest [Lochet, SODA 2021], we consider the following cycle packing problems: Min-Sum Cycle Packing and Shortest Cycle Packing.
  In Min-Sum Cycle Packing, we try to find, in a weighted undirected graph, $k$ vertex-disjoint cycles of minimum total weight. Our first main result is an algorithm that, for any fixed $k$, solves the problem in polynomial time. We complement this result by establishing the W[1]-hardness of Min-Sum Cycle Packing parameterized by $k$. The same results hold for the version of the problem where the task is to find $k$ edge-disjoint cycles.
  Our second main result concerns Shortest Cycle Packing, which is a special case of Min-Sum Cycle Packing that asks to find a packing of $k$ shortest cycles in a graph. We prove this problem to be fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) when parameterized by $k$ on weighted planar graphs. We also obtain a polynomial kernel for the edge-disjoint variant of the problem on planar graphs. Deciding whether Min-Sum Cycle Packing is FPT on planar graphs and whether Shortest Cycle Packing is FPT on general graphs remain challenging open questions.</description>

      <title>Bayan Algorithm: Detecting Communities in Networks Through Exact and Approximate Optimization of Modularity</title>

Abstract: Community detection is a classic network problem with extensive applications in various fields. Its most common method is using modularity maximization heuristics which rarely return an optimal partition or anything similar. Partitions with globally optimal modularity are difficult to compute, and therefore have been underexplored. Using structurally diverse networks, we compare 30 community detection methods including our proposed algorithm that offers optimality and approximation guarantees: the Bayan algorithm. Unlike existing methods, Bayan globally maximizes modularity or approximates it within a factor. Our results show the distinctive accuracy and stability of maximum-modularity partitions in retrieving planted partitions at rates higher than most alternatives for a wide range of parameter settings in two standard benchmarks. Compared to the partitions from 29 other algorithms, maximum-modularity partitions have the best medians for description length, coverage, performance, average conductance, and well clusteredness. These advantages come at the cost of additional computations which Bayan makes possible for small networks (networks that have up to 3000 edges in their largest connected component). Bayan is several times faster than using open-source and commercial solvers for modularity maximization, making it capable of finding optimal partitions for instances that cannot be optimized by any other existing method. Our results point to a few well performing algorithms, among which Bayan stands out as the most reliable method for small networks. A Python implementation of the Bayan algorithm (bayanpy) is publicly available through the package installer for Python.</description>

      <title>The Power of Two Matrices in Spectral Algorithms for Community Recovery</title>

Abstract: Spectral algorithms are some of the main tools in optimization and inference problems on graphs. Typically, the graph is encoded as a matrix and eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix are then used to solve the given graph problem. Spectral algorithms have been successfully used for graph partitioning, hidden clique recovery and graph coloring. In this paper, we study the power of spectral algorithms using two matrices in a graph partitioning problem. We use two different matrices resulting from two different encodings of the same graph and then combine the spectral information coming from these two matrices.
  We analyze a two-matrix spectral algorithm for the problem of identifying latent community structure in large random graphs. In particular, we consider the problem of recovering community assignments exactly in the censored stochastic block model, where each edge status is revealed independently with some probability. We show that spectral algorithms based on two matrices are optimal and succeed in recovering communities up to the information theoretic threshold. Further, we show that for most choices of the parameters, any spectral algorithm based on one matrix is suboptimal. The latter observation is in contrast to our prior works (2022a, 2022b) which showed that for the symmetric Stochastic Block Model and the Planted Dense Subgraph problem, a spectral algorithm based on one matrix achieves the information theoretic threshold. We additionally provide more general geometric conditions for the (sub)-optimality of spectral algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantum Graph-State Synthesis with SAT</title>

Abstract: In quantum computing and quantum information processing, graph states are a specific type of quantum states which are commonly used in quantum networking and quantum error correction. A recurring problem is finding a transformation from a given source graph state to a desired target graph state using only local operations. Recently it has been shown that deciding transformability is already NP-hard. In this paper, we present a CNF encoding for both local and non-local graph state operations, corresponding to one- and two-qubit Clifford gates and single-qubit Pauli measurements. We use this encoding in a bounded-model-checking set-up to synthesize the desired transformation. Additionally, for a completeness threshold on local transformations, we provide an upper bound on the length of the transformation if it exists. We evaluate the approach in two settings: the first is the synthesis of the ubiquitous GHZ state from a random graph state where we can vary the number of qubits, while the second is based on a proposed 14 node quantum network. We find that the approach is able to synthesize transformations for graphs up to 17 qubits in under 30 minutes.</description>

Abstract: Many problems in linear algebra -- such as those arising from non-Hermitian physics and differential equations -- can be solved on a quantum computer by processing eigenvalues of the non-normal input matrices. However, the existing Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT) framework is ill-suited to this task, as eigenvalues and singular values are different in general. We present a Quantum EigenValue Transformation (QEVT) framework for applying arbitrary polynomial transformations on eigenvalues of block-encoded non-normal operators, and a related Quantum EigenValue Estimation (QEVE) algorithm for operators with real spectra. QEVT has query complexity to the block encoding nearly recovering that of the QSVT for a Hermitian input, and QEVE achieves the Heisenberg-limited scaling for diagonalizable input matrices. As applications, we develop a linear differential equation solver with strictly linear time query complexity for average-case diagonalizable operators, as well as a ground state preparation algorithm that upgrades previous nearly optimal results for Hermitian Hamiltonians to diagonalizable matrices with real spectra. Underpinning our algorithms is an efficient method to prepare a quantum superposition of Faber polynomials, which generalize the nearly-best uniform approximation properties of Chebyshev polynomials to the complex plane. Of independent interest, we also develop techniques to generate $n$ Fourier coefficients with $\mathbf{O}(\mathrm{polylog}(n))$ gates compared to prior approaches with linear cost.</description>

      <title>Locally seeded embeddings, and Ramsey numbers of bipartite graphs with sublinear bandwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18223v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A seminal result of Lee asserts that the Ramsey number of any bipartite $d$-degenerate graph $H$ satisfies $\log r(H) = \log n + O(d)$. In particular, this bound applies to every bipartite graph of maximal degree $\Delta$. It remains a compelling challenge to identify conditions that guarantee that an $n$-vertex graph $H$ has Ramsey number linear in $n$, independently of $\Delta$. Our contribution is a characterization of bipartite graphs with linear-size Ramsey numbers in terms of graph bandwidth, a notion of local connectivity. We prove that for any $n$-vertex bipartite graph $H$ with maximal degree at most $\Delta$ and bandwidth $b(H)$ at most $\exp(-C\Delta\log\Delta)\,n$, we have $\log r(H) = \log n + O(1)$. This characterization is nearly optimal: for every $\Delta$ there exists an $n$-vertex bipartite graph $H$ of degree at most $\Delta$ and $b(H) \leq \exp(-c\Delta)\,n$, such that $\log r(H) = \log n + \Omega(\Delta)$. We also provide bounds interpolating between these two bandwidth regimes.</description>
