      <title>The magnon mediated plasmon friction: a functional integral approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss quantum friction in a system formed by two metallic surfaces separated by a ferromagnetic intermedium of a certain thickness. The internal degrees of freedom in the two metallic surfaces are assumed to be plasmons, while the excitations in the intermediate material are magnons, modeling plasmons coupled to magnons. During relative sliding, one surface moves uniformly parallel to the other, causing friction in the system. By calculating the effective action of the magnons, we can determine the particle production probability, which shows a positive correlation between the probability and the sliding speed. Finally, we derive the frictional force of the system, with both theoretical and numerical results indicating that the friction, like the particle production probability, also has a positive correlation with the speed.</description>

      <title>On the Hamiltonian structure of the intrinsic evolution of a closed vortex sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of previous authors on vortex sheets and their applications, the inviscid evolution equations of a closed vortex sheet in a plane, separating two piecewise constant density fluids, and their Hamiltonian form are investigated. The model has potential applications to bubble dynamics. A Poisson bracket is obtained containing the curve-tangential derivative. A Lagrangian invariant of the sheet motion by its self-induced velocity--the Cauchy principal value of the Biot-Savart integral--is derived.</description>

      <title>From irregular to regular eutectic growth in the Al-Al3Ni system: in situ observations during directional solidification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the irregular eutectic growth dynamics of the Al-Al3Ni alloy, in which one of the solid phases (Al3Ni) grows faceted from the liquid. Leveraging in situ optical microscopy and synchrotron transmission x-ray microscopy, we address the question of the degree of coupling between Al and Al3Ni at the growth front and that of the shape of the microstructures left behind in the bulk solid during directional solidification. Real-time optical observations bring evidence for a morphological transition from a eutectic-grain dependent, irregular eutectic growth at low solidification velocity V (typically 1 ${\mu}ms^{-1}$), to a weakly anisotropic, regular growth at higher V (reaching 10 ${\mu}ms^{-1}$). Unprecedented x-ray nano-imaging of the solid-liquid interface, and 3D characterization of the growth patterns, were made possible by a new Directional Solidification (DS) setup at Brookhaven National Laboratory's NSLS-II. At low V, the leading tips of partly faceted Al3Ni crystals are observed to grow not far ahead of the Al growth front. Correlating in situ images and postmortem 3D tomographic reconstructions reveals that the presence of faceted and non-faceted regions of Al3Ni crystals in the solid is a direct consequence of coupling and decoupling during DS, respectively. Upon increasing V , the lead distance of Al3Ni vanishes, and the shape of Al3Ni ceases to be governed by faceted growth. These observations shed light on the basic mechanisms (faceted growth, diffusive coupling, and the dynamics of trijunctions) governing the transition from faceted to rod-like growth upon increasing V in the Al3Ni system, with broad implications for a large class of irregular eutectics.</description>
