      <title>Extreme vortex gust encounters by a square wing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extreme gust encounters by finite wings with disturbance velocity exceeding their cruise speed remain largely unexplored, while particularly relevant to miniature-scale aircraft. This study considers extreme aerodynamic flows around a square wing and the large, unsteady forces that result from gust encounters. We analyse the evolution of three-dimensional, large-scale vortical structures and their complex interactions with the wing by performing direct numerical simulations at a chord-based Reynolds number of 600. We find that a strong incoming positive gust vortex induces a prominent leading-edge vortex (LEV) on the upper surface of the wing, accompanied by tip vortices (TiVs) strengthened through the interaction. Conversely, a strong negative gust vortex induces an LEV on the lower surface of the wing and causes a reversal in TiV orientation. In both extreme vortex gust encounters, the wing experiences significant lift fluctuations. Furthermore, we identify two opposing effects of the TiVs on the large lift fluctuations. First, the enhanced or reversed TiVs contribute to significant lift surges or drops by generating large low-pressure cores near the wing. Second, the TiVs play a part in attenuating lift fluctuations through enhanced downwash or upwash, formation of an arch vortex, and distortion of vortical structure around the wing corners. The second effect outweighs the first, resulting in smaller transient lift changes on the finite wing compared to the 2D wing. We also show that flying above a positive gust vortex or flying below a negative one can mitigate lift fluctuations during encounters. The current findings provide potential guidance on how TiV dynamics and wing positions could be leveraged to alleviate large transient lift fluctuations experienced by finite wings in severe gust conditions.</description>

      <title>Assessment of Gradient-based Reconstruction and Artificial Diffusivity Methods in Simulating High-Speed Compressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two promising methods for capturing high-speed flows are local artificial diffusivity (LAD) and centralised gradient-based reconstruction (C-GBR), the former being computationally economical and the latter being more robust and stable but expensive. While the LAD approach captures discontinuities by adding artificial fluid transport coefficients, C-GBR employs a wave appropriate discontinuity sensor to obtain cleaner results and utilises the HLLC approximate Riemann solver for computing inviscid fluxes. The efficacy of these schemes is initially demonstrated in single-species 1D and 2D test cases. Moreover, the shock-capturing capability is assessed for 3D supersonic and hypersonic turbulent boundary layers. The accuracy of LAD predictions is comparable to that of C-GBR for the test case of a supersonic turbulent boundary layer. From the stability front, all simulations are found to be stable with the C-GBR scheme, whereas the LAD-based simulations are observed to abruptly diverge for supersonic and hypersonic flows over compression corners with stronger shocks and larger flow separations. From the computational front, the LAD-based schemes are $1.17 - 2.32 \times$ faster than the monotonicity-preserving explicit/implicit C-GBR schemes. A hybrid approach leveraging the strengths of LAD and GBR schemes is proposed as a promising solution for high-speed turbulent flows with strong shock-boundary layer interactions. The efficacy of the hybrid LAD-GBR solver is demonstrated for the compressible triple-point and supersonic compression ramp test cases. For the M2.9, $24^{\circ}$ case, the hybrid solver was stable and achieved a notable $1.67 \times$ speed-up over the C-GBR scheme.</description>

      <title>Subspace Acceleration for Efficient Nonlinear Water Wave Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient simulation of nonlinear and dispersive free-surface flows governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations remains a central challenge in ocean and coastal engineering. The computational bottleneck arises from solving a time-dependent discretized Poisson problem at every time step to enforce divergence free flow. This is crucial to ensure conservation of mass and requires solving long sequences of time-dependent linear systems typically using iterative methods, such as the preconditioned Krylov subspace methods. In this work, we investigate new subspace acceleration techniques for improving initial guesses to reduce the number of iterations required by iterative solvers, with a focus on nonlinear wave propagation problems. We extend the original subspace acceleration method by incorporating the complete history of previous solutions through an exponentially weighted formulation. This approach eliminates the need for repeated sketching and orthonormalization, resulting in a more efficient and scalable strategy to generate better initial guesses. Our method is implemented within a high-order finite-difference framework using a method-of-lines formulation and a low-storage Runge-Kutta time integration scheme. We demonstrate that subspace acceleration significantly reduces the number of GMRES iterations when solving the Poisson equation in nonlinear water wave simulations. Performance is evaluated on two benchmark problems: nonlinear stream function wave propagation and harmonic wave generation over a submerged bar. In both cases, the new approach achieves substantial improvements in computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. Although demonstrated using high-order finite difference methods, the technique is discretization independent and broadly applicable to incompressible free-surface flow solvers.</description>

      <title>Electroosmotic lubrication flow in constricted microchannels with a compliant wall and DLVO interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a nonlinear model for electroosmotic transport in a constricted microchannel with a compliant lower wall, with applications to soft microfluidics, bio-inspired sensing, and energy harvesting. The formulation couples electroosmotic slip-driven flow under a globally constrained electric field with pressure-driven lubrication and elastic wall deformation, modeled as a clamped Kirchhoff-Love plate. Short-range intermolecular stresses are incorporated through an extended Derjaguin-Landau-Verwey-Overbeek framework combining electrostatic double-layer repulsion and van der Waals attraction, enabling us to probe the nonlinear coupling between intermolecular forces, wall deformation, and electroosmotic flow in compliant microchannels. The flow is governed by six nondimensional parameters: wall compliance, geometric curvature, electrostatic and van der Waals strengths, scaled Debye length, and Dukhin number. Asymptotic analysis clarifies the role of these parameters in limiting regimes. In the stiff-wall limit, electroosmotic slip acts as a uniform offset to the pressure-driven flow. Fully coupled spectral collocation simulations confirm the asymptotic predictions and capture nonlinear feedback between pressure, deformation, and intermolecular stresses. Three regimes emerge: a stiff-wall regime with negligible deformation, a deformation-limited regime in which elastic narrowing strongly suppresses flux, and a repulsion-limited regime where DLVO forces cap wall deflection and prevent collapse. These results show how elasticity, geometry, and molecular forces jointly regulate electroosmotic lubrication and provide scaling rules for the design of compliant electrokinetic channels operating under nanometric confinement.</description>

      <title>Measuring fluxes between wave and geostrophic features in rotating non-hydrostatic flows with variable stratification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A challenge in physical oceanography is quantifying the energy content of waves and balanced flows and the fluxes that connect these reservoirs with their sources and sinks. Methodological limitations have prevented decompositions for realistic flows with non-hydrostatic motions and variable stratification.
  We present a framework that separates the flow into wave and geostrophic components using the principle that waves have no Eulerian available potential vorticity signature. Starting from new expressions for available energy and potential vorticity conservation, we construct a basis of wave and geostrophic modes, complete and orthogonal with respect to quadratic approximations of the conserved quantities. Using the resulting non-hydrostatic projection operators, the nonlinear equations of motion are expressed as coupled wave and geostrophic equations, quantifying cascade and transfer fluxes of wave and geostrophic energy.
  We apply the method to non-hydrostatic mid-ocean simulations with geostrophic mean-flow, near-inertial, and tidal forcing. From these experiments, we construct source-sink-reservoir diagrams for exact and quadratic fluxes, quantifying the fluxes between geostrophic and wave components. Because the cascade fluxes obey total energy conservation, we construct energy flow diagrams within the wave and geostrophic reservoirs and diagnose nonlocal transfers. The simulations show a geostrophic inverse cascade, a forward wave cascade, and a direct transfer of geostrophic to wave energy, with no indication of a forward geostrophic cascade. The mean-flow-only simulation shows weak spontaneous wave emission during spin-up, which diminishes to zero. Finally, we evaluate the decomposition by comparing linearized and fully conserved available potential vorticity, finding that errors become significant at scales below 15\,km.</description>

      <title>A Modified Suspension-Balance Model for Deformable Particle Suspensions: Application to Blood Flows with Cell-Free Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modified suspension balance model (SBM) for the flow of red blood cells (RBCs) and other deformable particle suspensions in confined geometries. Specifically, the method includes the hydrodynamic lift force generated by deformable particles interacting with walls leading to a cell-free layer. The lift force is added to the SBM to drive RBCs migrating away from the wall. Using the modified SBM (MSBM), we simulate blood flows through microvascular channels and tubes. The method is able to capture the transient development of the cell-free layer (CFL) and the corresponding hematocrit and velocity profiles with the development of the CFL. The CFL thickness and hemorheological hallmarks in microcirculation, such as the Fahraeus Effect and the Fahraeus-Linqvist Effect, are captured and are in good agreement with existing experimental and direct numerical results of blood flows. This work establishes a novel continuum computational framework that can efficiently capture the microstructural heterogeneity and non-Newtonian flow behavior of concentrated deformable particle suspensions under confinement.</description>

      <title>Hybrid RANS-LES simulation of transverse fuel injection in a Mach-10 scramjet engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hypersonic flight poses unique propulsion challenges, requiring engines that maintain thrust, efficiency, and stability across a wide range of operating conditions. These engines must transition smoothly between flight regimes and altitudes. Scramjets (supersonic combustion ramjets) play a key role in addressing these challenges. Recent advancements in high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools allow researchers to explore novel designs and improve the feasibility of hypersonic travel. In this work, we analyze a radical-farming type scramjet engine mounted at the University of Queensland's T4 Wind Tunnel at Mach 10. We use the Improved Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (IDDES) model, which combines Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and Large Eddy Simulation (LES) in different flow regions. A novel integrated modeling strategy is introduced, coupling the inlet, fuel injectors, combustor, and nozzle for full-scale engine analysis. Hydrogen combustion is modeled using a Finite Rate Chemistry (FRC) approach with a 12-species, 27-reaction mechanism to capture shock-induced chemical kinetics across equivalence ratios of $\phi = 0.5$ to $0.9$. The Takeno flame index analysis reveals multiple combustion regimes, with ignition occurring in the partially premixed regime. This is supported by Chemical Explosive Mode Analysis (CEMA), which identifies regions of high chemical sensitivity, correlating with observed hot pockets and providing insights into autoignition and flame stabilization mechanisms. The combination of IDDES and FRC improves the transport of hydrogen to hot pockets, producing combustion patterns that match experimental results. This work establishes a framework to address critical challenges in future air-breathing propulsion systems.</description>

      <title>Field Inversion Machine Learning for Time-Resolved Unsteady Flows in Airfoil Dynamic Stall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While many existing machine learning studies have focused on augmenting Reynolds averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) turbulence models for steady or time averaged unsteady flows, this paper takes a first step toward extending such augmentation to time resolved unsteady flows. An unsteady field inversion and machine learning (FIML) method is developed, in which a temporally evolving correction field (beta) is incorporated into the production term of a RANS turbulence model. The inverse problem is solved by optimizing the spatial temporal distribution of beta to minimize the regularized prediction errors. The resulting optimized beta field is then used to train a multi layer neural network that learns the time dependent relationship between local flow features and beta. The approach is demonstrated using the unsteady flow over a NACA0012 airfoil undergoing dynamic stall. Results show that the unsteady FIML model, trained using only the time series of drag data at a given pitch rate, can accurately reproduce the spatial temporal evolution of reference drag, lift, pitching moment, surface pressure, and velocity fields at both identical and different pitch rates. The unsteady FIML is integrated into the open source DAFoam framework, enabling a pathway toward developing accurate and generalizable RANS turbulence models for time resolved unsteady flows.</description>

      <title>Escape from end-pinching in Herschel-Bulkley ligaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capillary retraction of Herschel-Bulkley ligaments displays a rich set of behaviours that depart significantly from the classical Newtonian picture. We focus here on the low-viscosity regime, where droplet detachment is controlled by the end-pinching mechanism. Using fully resolved axisymmetric simulations, we show that viscoplasticity and shear-dependent rheology reorganize the fundamental routes by which a retracting ligament may pinch off or escape breakup. Four dynamical outcomes are identified: inertial pinch-off, viscous escape driven by an attached vorticity layer, inertial escape caused by vortex-ring detachment, and complete arrest when yielding suppresses motion. These regimes appear in an orderly structure across the rheological parameter space, but their transitions are governed by a single unifying feature of the neck dynamics: whether inertia, viscous diffusion, or yield stress dominates the local collapse. When inertia dominates, the vorticity sheet detaches and rolls into a vortex ring, producing an inertial rebound of the neck. When viscous effects dominate, the vorticity layer remains attached and drives a back-flow that reopens the neck. When yield stress is sufficiently large, both mechanisms are suppressed and the ligament becomes motionless. This framework extends the Newtonian end-pinching and escape mechanisms to viscoplastic fluids and clarifies how non-Newtonian rheology reshapes capillary-driven retraction.</description>

      <title>Deformation and stability of a gas bubble in a biaxial straining flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taking advantage of the recently developed L-ALE framework [Sierra-Ausin \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Fluids {\bf{7}}, 113603 (2022)], we characterize the linear dynamics of an incompressible gas bubble immersed in a biaxial straining flow. We show that the system undergoes a saddle-node bifurcation with strongly different equilibrium shapes when varying the Ohnesorge number, $\Oh$, which compares viscous and capillary effects. Equilibrium shapes are found to be oblate for sufficiently large $\Oh$ while, counter-intuitively, they are prolate for low-enough $\Oh$. The bifurcation diagram is found to contain also two sets of disconnected branches that cannot be obtained by continuation starting from a spherical shape. One set corresponds to bubble shapes expected to be unstable, while the second set comprises a wide region exhibiting stable shapes that might be observed in practice. We then characterize the linear stability of the various branches. In addition to the unstable axisymmetric mode arising at the saddle-node bifurcation, two non-oscillating drift modes are also identified, together with a new unstable non-oscillating mode with azimuthal wave number $m=2$. This mode might be responsible for some type of bubble breakup observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum machine learning for efficient reduced order modelling of turbulent flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately predicting turbulent flows remains a central challenge in fluid dynamics due to their high dimensionality and intrinsic nonlinearity. Recent developments in quantum algorithms and machine learning offer new opportunities for overcoming the computational barriers inherent in turbulence modeling. Here we present a new hybrid quantum-classical framework that enables faster-than-real-time turbulence prediction by integrating machine learning, quantum computation, and fluid dynamics modeling, in particular, the reduced-order modeling. The novel framework combines quantum proper orthogonal decomposition (QPOD) with a quantum-enhanced deep kernel learning (QDKL) approach. QPOD employs quantum circuits to perform efficient eigenvalue decomposition for low-rank flow reconstruction, while QDKL exploits quantum entanglement and nonlinear mappings to enhance kernel expressivity and dynamic prediction accuracy. The new method is demonstrated on three benchmark turbulent flows, our architecture achieves significantly improved predictive accuracy at reduced model ranks, with training speeds up to 10 times faster and parameter counts reduced by a factor of 1/N compared to classical counterparts, where N is the input dimensionality. Although constrained by current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, our results demonstrate the potential of quantum machine learning to transform turbulence simulation and lay a solid foundation for scalable, real-time quantum fluid modeling in future quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Effect of subgrid-scale anisotropy on wall-modeled large-eddy simulation of separated flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the role of anisotropic SGS stress in WMLES of flow over a spanwise-uniform Gaussian-shaped bump, with particular emphasis on predicting flow separation. The simulations show that eddy-viscosity-based SGS models often yield non-monotonic predictions of the mean separation bubble size on the leeward side under grid refinement, whereas models incorporating anisotropic SGS stress produce more consistent results across mesh resolutions. To identify where SGS anisotropy is most critical, we selectively introduce anisotropic SGS terms in different regions of the computational domain. The results reveal that the windward side near the bump peak, where a strong FPG occurs, plays a crucial role in determining downstream flow separation. Analysis of the Reynolds stress transport equation shows that fluctuations of anisotropic SGS stress directly modify SGS dissipation and diffusion in this region, thereby altering the Reynolds stress distributions and the onset of downstream separation. Examination of the mean streamwise momentum equation indicates that at coarse resolutions, the mean SGS shear stress dominates, and the differences between the eddy-viscosity-based and anisotropic models remain minor. As the grid is refined, however, resolved Reynolds stresses increasingly govern the near-wall momentum transport, and the influence of SGS stress fluctuations becomes more pronounced, as they determine the SGS dissipation and diffusion of Reynolds stresses. Component-wise analysis of the SGS stress tensor further shows that the improvement arises mainly from including significant normal stress contributions. Finally, an a priori study using filtered DNS of turbulent Couette-Poiseuille flow confirms that wall-bounded turbulence under FPG is highly anisotropic and that anisotropic SGS models provide a more realistic representation of SGS stress anisotropy than eddy-viscosity-based models.</description>

      <title>Toward end-to-end quantum simulation of rapidly distorted turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an end-to-end quantum algorithm to simulate rapidly distorted turbulence via linear combination of Hamiltonian (LCHS). The algorithm comprises three primary stages: the efficient preparation of an initial turbulent state with a prescribed energy spectrum, its subsequent time evolution via LCHS, and the direct measurement of key turbulence statistics. Our analysis indicates that the algorithm can offer a practical quantum speedup over the classical simulation methods for a sufficiently large computational grid. We evaluate the quantum resource requirements for simulating a minimal instance of non-trivial turbulence with classical validation. The numerical results show excellent agreement with ground-truth solutions, capturing both the qualitative evolution of turbulent fields and the quantitative behavior of statistics, including the Reynolds stresses and the fluctuating velocity spectrum. Despite its linearity, rapidly distorted turbulence captures essential turbulence mechanisms and may inform the development of quantum algorithms for the Navier-Stokes equations. Our work establishes a foundation for addressing more complex turbulent phenomena on future fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Solution of Incompressible Flow Equations with Physics and Equality Constrained Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a meshless method for the solution of incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in advection-dominated regimes using physics- and equality-constrained artificial neural networks combined with a conditionally adaptive augmented Lagrangian formulation. A single neural network parameterizes both the velocity and pressure fields, and is trained by minimizing the residual of a Poisson's equation for pressure, constrained by the momentum and continuity equations, together with boundary conditions on the velocity field. No boundary conditions are imposed on the pressure field aside from anchoring the pressure at a point to prevent its unbounded development. The training is performed from scratch without labeled data, relying solely on the governing equations and constraints. To enhance accuracy in advection-dominated flows, we employ a single Fourier feature mapping of the input coordinates. The proposed method is demonstrated for the canonical lid-driven cavity flow up to a Reynolds number of 7,500 and for laminar flow over a circular cylinder with inflow-outflow boundary conditions, achieving excellent agreement with benchmark solutions. We further compare the present formulation against alternative objective-function constructions based on different arrangements of the flow equations, thereby highlighting the algorithmic advantages of the proposed formulation centered around the Poisson's equation for pressure.</description>

      <title>Latent-Space Non-Linear Model Predictive Control for Partially-Observable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a scalable control framework based on nonlinear Model Predictive Control for high-dimensional dynamical systems. The proposed approach addresses the key challenges of model scalability and partial observability by integrating data-driven reduced order modelling, control in a latent space, and state estimation within a unified formulation. A predictive model is constructed via Operator Inference on a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition basis, yielding a compact latent representation that captures the dominant system dynamics. State estimation is achieved through an Unscented Kalman Filter, which reconstructs the latent space from sparse and noisy measurements, enabling closed-loop control. The input signals are computed directly in the reduced-order latent space, improving computational efficiency with negligible impact on predictive capability. The methodology is validated on the one- and two-dimensional Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equations, serving as benchmarks for chaotic and spatially-extended systems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves accurate stabilisation. Overall, the framework provides a practical approach for nonlinear control of complex, high-dimensional systems where full-state measurements are often inaccessible or infeasible.</description>

      <title>Sheared flow profile effects on acoustic impedance eduction in small 3D ducts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of sheared grazing flow on acoustic propagation in three-dimensional rectangular ducts. We particularly focus on small ducts typical of most experimental impedance eduction facilities, for which the flow profile in the duct cross-section varies significantly. We assess the effect of simplifying this inherent two-dimensional flow profile to either a one-dimensional (2D duct) or uniform flow profile. Three flow profiles are considered, namely (i) the tensorised hyperbolic tangent, (ii) the law-of-the-wall, and (iii) one obtained from a RANS simulation. These flow profiles are used in numerical simulations, based on the solution of the Pridmore--Brown equation, to perform in silico impedance eduction experiments. Results show that realistic flow profiles can be approximated well in ducts by uniform or 2D-duct models provided the bulk Mach number is correctly accounted for, which contrasts with previous findings for more simplistic flow profiles. The key conclusion of this work is that if viscous effects are negligible and acoustic impedance is a good representation of a lined wall with grazing flow, then the simplification to a uniform flow is a reasonable approximation and traditional eduction methods are satisfactorily accurate.</description>

      <title>H3PC: Hypersonic, High-Order, High-Performance Code with Adaptive Mesh Refinement and Real Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed a hypersonic high-order, high-performance code (H$^3$PC) utilizing the ``Trixi.jl" framework in order to simulate both non-reactive and chemically reactive compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations for complex three-dimensional geometries. H$^3$PC is parallel on CPU platforms and can perform exascale parallel computations of hypersonic turbulent flows. The numerical approach is based on the discontinuous Galerkin spectral element method, satisfying the entropy and energy stability conditions for the Euler equations. H$^3$PC can perform simulations of high-speed flows from subsonic to hypersonic speeds based on frozen, equilibrium, and non-equilibrium chemistry modeling of the gas mixture, using the \texttt{Mutation.jl} , which is a Julia package developed to wrap the C++-based Mutation++ library. H$^3$PC can also perform parallel adaptive mesh refinement for two- and three-dimensional Euler and Navier-Stokes discretizations with non-conforming elements. In this study, we first demonstrate the successful integration of Mutation++ into the H$^3$PC solver, and then verify its accuracy through simulations of Taylor-Green vortex flow, supersonic flow past a square and circular cylinder, and hypersonic P8-inlet.</description>

      <title>Periodicity-Enforced Neural Network for Designing Deterministic Lateral Displacement Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deterministic Lateral Displacement (DLD) devices enable liquid biopsy for cancer detection by separating circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from blood samples based on size, but designing these microfluidic devices requires computationally expensive Navier-Stokes simulations and particle-tracing analyses. While recent surrogate modeling approaches using deep learning have accelerated this process, they often inadequately handle the critical periodic boundary conditions of DLD unit cells, leading to cumulative errors in multi-unit device predictions. This paper introduces a periodicity-enforced surrogate modeling approach that incorporates periodic layers, neural network components that guarantee exact periodicity without penalty terms or output modifications, into deep learning architectures for DLD device design. The proposed method employs three sub-networks to predict steady-state, non-dimensional velocity and pressure fields (u, v, p) rather than directly predicting critical diameters or particle trajectories, enabling complete flow field characterization and enhanced design flexibility. Periodic layers ensure exact matching of flow variables across unit cell boundaries through architectural enforcement rather than soft penalty-based approaches. Validation on 120 CFD-generated geometries demonstrates that the periodic layer implementation achieves 0.478% critical diameter error while maintaining perfect periodicity consistency, representing an 85.4% improvement over baseline methods. The approach enables efficient and accurate DLD device design with guaranteed boundary condition satisfaction for multi-unit device applications.</description>

      <title>Dissipation anomaly in gradient-driven nonequilibrium steady states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipation anomaly-the persistence of finite energy dissipation in the inviscid limit-is a hallmark of turbulence, sometimes regarded as the "zeroth law" of turbulent flows. Here, we demonstrate that this phenomenon is not exclusive to turbulence. Using fluctuating hydrodynamics, we show that a simple gradient-driven nonequilibrium steady state, in which a fluid is subjected to a constant scalar gradient but remains macroscopically quiescent, also exhibits dissipation anomaly. Direct numerical simulations and self-consistent mode-coupling theory reveal that the anomaly originates from giant, long-range nonequilibrium fluctuations amplified by the imposed gradient. While linear theory predicts a divergent dissipation in the inviscid limit, nonlinear mode coupling regularizes the divergence, yielding a finite anomalous dissipation. Our findings identify a new, non-turbulent arena for dissipation anomaly and establish the interplay between thermal noise and nonequilibrium driving as a fundamental route to singular behavior in hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Deformation and organization of droplet-encapsulated soft beads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many biological, culinary, and engineering processes lead to the co-encapsulation of several soft particles within a liquid interface. In these situations the particles are bound together by the capillary forces that deform them and influence their biological or rheological properties. Here we introduce an experimental approach to encapsulate a controlled number of soft beads within aqueous droplets in oil. These droplet-encapsulated gels are manipulated in a deformable microfluidic device to merge them and modify the liquid fraction. In the dry limit the contact surface between the hydrogels is found to be determined by the elastocapillary number $E_c$, with the contact radius scaling as $E_c^{1/3}$, indicating that the deformation increases for soft or small particles. When multiple beads are co-encapsulated within a single droplet they can be arranged into linear or three-dimensional aggregates that remain at a local energy minimum.</description>

      <title>Sharp uniform-in-diffusivity mixing rates for passive scalars in parallel shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the advection-diffusion equation describing the evolution of a passive scalar in a background shear flow. We prove the optimal uniform-in-diffusivity mixing rate $\| f \|_{H^{-1}} \lesssim \langle t \rangle^{-1/(N+1)}$, $t \geq 0$, where $N$ is the maximal order of vanishing of the derivative $b'(y)$ of the shear profile, e.g., $N=1$ for plane Pouseille flow. Our proof is based on the description of the solution in terms of resolvents and involves pointwise estimates on the resolvent kernel. In the non-degenerate case, we further give a rigorous asymptotic description of generic solutions in terms of shear layers localized around the critical points. This verifies formal asymptotics in [McLaughlin-Camassa-Viotti, \textit{Physics of Fluids}, 22(11), 2010].</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Radially Symmetric Solutions of the Relativistic Euler Equations with Synge Energy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider self-similar, radially symmetric solutions of the relativistic Euler equations with constitutive relations from relativistic kinetic theory, based on Synge energies for monatomic and its extension to diatomic gases. For the corresponding initial--boundary value problem, including the spherical piston problem, we prove existence and uniqueness of solutions valid for all values of the relativistic parameter $\gamma = mc^{2}/(k_{B}T)$, thus covering both the classical limit $(\gamma \to \infty)$ and the ultra-relativistic regime $(\gamma \to 0)$. We further establish key structural properties of Synge energies, showing the strict negativity of the second derivative with respect to pressure at constant entropy and the monotone dependence of the characteristic velocity on $\gamma$. These results extend the classical theory of self-similar flows to the relativistic framework with kinetic-theory-based constitutive equations.</description>

      <title>Fast-Converging and Asymptotic-Preserving DSMC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19061v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving the efficiency of the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method has become increasingly urgent with the rapid development of space exploration. To address this issue, the direct intermittent general synthetic iteration (DIG) scheme has recently been proposed to enable DSMC's rapid and accurate convergence to steady-state solutions, even when the cell size is much larger than the mean free path in near-continuum flow regimes. The first part of the paper is devoted to the mathematical analysis of DIG's fast-converging and asymptotic-preserving properties. Because the Boltzmann equation is analytically intractable, the analysis is conducted using the linearized BGK model. It is found that, in the near continuum flow regime, the DIG method asymptotically recovers the Navier Stokes equations when the cell size is O(1), rather than being constrained by the mean free path. Moreover, after a single cycle of DIG evolution, the deviation from the final steady state solution is reduced by more than a factor of five. In the second part of the paper, the Poiseuille flow and hypersonic flow passing over cylinder are investigated using the DIG scheme, with different time step and cell sizes, thereby demonstrating its efficiency and accuracy in multiscale flow simulation. Specifically, when the Knudsen number is 0.01, the DIG method is found to be faster than the traditional DSMC method by two orders of magnitude. The performance gain becomes even greater at smaller Knudsen numbers. The proposed method holds great potential for engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Parasitic hydrogen bubble evolution in vanadium redox flow batteries: A lattice Boltzmann study</title>

Abstract: Vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) are a promising technology to capture and store energy from renewable sources, reducing the reliance on fossil fuels for energy generation. However, during the charging process, the parasitic hydrogen evolution reaction at the negative electrode affects the performance and durability of VFRBs. The evolution of hydrogen bubbles causes the loss of effective reaction area and blocks the transport of reactants. We employ the lattice Boltzmann method to investigate the two-phase flow transport in the negative electrode of VRFBs. Systematic parametric analyses reveal that increased gas production leads to uneven gas removal from the electrode, while an optimal flow rate can effectively remove bubbles and reduce external pumping energy. Additionally, increasing the compression ratio hinders gas removal but enhances electrode electrical conductivity. Overall, the present study provides valuable mechanistic insights into bubble generation at the negative electrode of VRFBs and offers a theoretical reference for designing and optimizing VRFBs.</description>

      <title>On energy consistency of intermediate states in HLL-type MHD Riemann solvers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate Riemann solvers are widely used for solving hyperbolic conservation laws, including those of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). However, due to the nonlinearity and complexity of MHD, obtaining accurate and robust numerical solutions to MHD equations is non-trivial, and it may be challenging for an approximate MHD Riemann solver to preserve the positivity of scalar variables, particularly when the plasma \b{eta} is low. As we have identified that the inconsistency between the numerically calculated magnetic field and magnetic energy may be at least partly responsible for the loss of positivity of scalar variables, we propose a consistency condition for calculating the intermediate energies within the Riemann fan and implement it in HLL-type MHD Riemann solvers, thereby alleviating erroneous magnetic field solutions that break scalar positivity. In addition, (I) for the HLLC-type scheme, we have designed a revised two-state approximation, specifically reducing numerical error in magnetic field solutions, although sacrificing the contact-resolving capability, and (II) for the HLLD-type scheme, we replace the constant total pressure assumption by a three-state assumption for the intermediate thermal energy, which is more consistent with our other assumptions. The proposed schemes perform better in numerical examples with low plasma \b{eta}. Moreover, we explained the energy error introduced during time integration.</description>

      <title>Reduced-order modeling of large-scale turbulence using Koopman $\beta$-variational autoencoders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reduced-order models (ROMs) are very popular for surrogate modeling of full-order computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, allowing for real-time approximation of complex flow phenomena. However, their application to CFD models including large eddy simulation (LES) and direct numerical simulaton (DNS) is limited due to the highly chaotic and multi-scale nature of resolved turbulent flow. Due to the large amounts of noise present in small-scale turbulent structures, error accumulation becomes a major issue, making long-term prediction of unsteady flow infeasible. While linear subspace methods like dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) can be used to pre-process turbulent flow data to remove small-scale structures, this often requires a very large number of modes and a non-trivial mode selection process. In this work, a ROM framework using Koopman $\beta$-variational autoencoders ($\beta$-VAEs) is introduced for reduced-order modeling of large-scale turbulence. The Koopman operator captures the variation of a non-linear dynamical system through a linear representation of state observables. By constraining the latent space of a $\beta$-VAE to grow linearly using a Koopman-inspired loss function, small-scale turbulent structures are filtered out in reconstructions of input data and latent variables are denoised in an unsupervised manner so that they can be sufficiently modeled over time. Combined with a long short-term memory (LSTM) ensemble for time series prediction of latent variables, the model is tested on LES flow past a Windsor body at multiple yaw angles, showing that the Koopman $\beta$-VAE can effectively denoise latent variables and remove small-scale structures from reconstructions while acting globally over multiple cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instability of a stratified two-phase MHD parallel flow between two infinite plates is addressed. We examine the effect of the transverse magnetic field on the base flow and long wave instability of a two-layer system consisting of conductive liquid and non-conductive gas. Both perfectly insulating and perfectly conducting boundaries are considered. To capture the behavior at small but finite wavenumbers, the conventional first-order long-wave stability analysis is extended to higher order terms. Using mercury-air system as a representative test case, the results demonstrate distinct and non-similar base flow and disturbance profiles, as well as different stability maps for insulating versus conducting boundaries. The stability diagrams reveal a non-monotonic influence of the magnetic field on flow stability, showing that, in addition to its expected stabilizing effect, the field can also induce destabilization under certain conditions. Inspection of the disturbance profiles indicates that despite the strong damping of mercury flow by the magnetic field, interaction of the two fluids at the interface and the shear-induced instabilities in the gas layer dominate and can lead to flow destabilization as the magnetic field strength increases.</description>

Abstract: The accurate mathematical modeling of droplet impact dynamics on micro-structured surfaces is fundamental to understanding and predicting complex fluid behaviors relevant to a wide range of engineering and scientific applications. In particular, the pancake bouncing phenomenon--systematically studied by Liu et al. (Nature Physics, 2014)--on superhydrophobic micro-structured substrates presents significant theoretical challenges. Central to these challenges is the need to construct effective mathematical models that capture the intricate influence of substrate micro/nanostructures on droplet dynamics. This requires the development of robust formulations for surface tension, contact line dynamics, and the interaction forces between fluid and solid structures. In this work, we formulate a nonlocal mathematical framework for the simulation of 3D pancake bouncing on superhydrophobic micro-cone arrays. The model incorporates intermolecular attractive forces to represent droplet surface tension, and we provide a strict theoretical derivation linking these forces quantitatively to the macroscopic surface tension coefficient, thereby circumventing the reliance on empirical parameter tuning. The complex geometry of micro-cone arrays introduces fundamental difficulties in defining local normal directions for contact algorithms. To overcome this, we develop a nonlocal contact repulsion force model that governs fluid-solid interactions and ensures numerical stability under high Weber number conditions. Based on this mathematical foundation, we implement the model using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH), enabling high-precision 3D simulations. Computational experiments, validated against empirical data, confirm the model's accuracy and robustness, while underscoring the key role of numerical simulation in elucidating droplet-microstructure interactions.</description>

      <title>Scale-by-scale kinetic energy budgets in multiphase turbulence</title>

Abstract: The present work aims at exploring the scale-by-scale kinetic energy exchanges in multiphase turbulence. For this purpose, we derive the K\'arm\'an-Howarth-Monin equation which accounts for the variations of density and viscosity across the two phases together with the effect of surface tension. We consider both conventional and phase conditional averaging operators. This framework is applied to numerical data from detailed simulations of forced homogeneous and isotropic turbulence covering different values for the liquid volume fraction, the liquid/gas density ratio, the Reynolds, and Weber numbers. We confirm the existence of an additional transfer term due to surface tension. Part of the kinetic energy injected at large scales is transferred into kinetic energy at smaller scales by classical non-linear transport while another part is transferred to surface energy before being released back into kinetic energy, but at smaller scales. The overall kinetic energy transfer rate is larger than in single phase flows. Kinetic energy budgets conditioned in a given phase show that the scale-by-scale transport of turbulent kinetic energy due to pressure is a gain (loss) of kinetic energy for the lighter (heavier) phase. Its contribution can be dominant when the gas volume fraction becomes small or when the density ratio increases. Building on previous work, we hypothesize the existence of a pivotal scale above which kinetic energy is stored into surface deformation and below which the kinetic energy is released by interface restoration. Some phenomenological predictions for this scale are discussed.</description>

      <title>Exploratory Study of Chaotic Behavior in Walking Droplets</title>

Abstract: The interaction of 'walking droplets' and capillary waves in a weakly subcritical Faraday wave experiment has been studied as a hydrodynamic analog to Bohmian quantum mechanics (see "Hydrodynamic Quantum Analogs", J. Bush and A. Oza, Rep. Prog. Physics (2021)). We report here experimental results of walking droplets interacting with supercritical Faraday waves with dimensionless acceleration of approximately 7.7, where the onset of Faraday instability occurs at dimensionless acceleration 6.3, in flat bath topography. Our working fluid is silicone oil with a kinematic viscosity of 20 cst that is placed as a 4.2 mm horizontal liquid layer in an intermediate-aspect-ratio circular bath with a radius to Faraday wavelength ratio of 5.8. We also use different 3D-printed subsurfaces that act as slit structures with local oil depth of 0.7 mm. We confirm expected behavior for walking droplets in the supercritical Faraday regime, such as erratic trajectories, droplets clustering together due to capillary effects, and spontaneous drop creation. We note a special case of walking-droplet behavior when the bath only partially displays Faraday waves. We discuss the influence of the lateral boundaries and slits on droplet trajectory in this chaotic regime and compare the measured trajectories found here to those single and double slit experiments previously studied in the subcritical Faraday regime.</description>

      <title>Looking Inside the Widom Region: Non-Equilibrium Stratification in Supercritical CO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The supercritical state of matter is usually described as a continuous phase without sharp boundaries between liquid and gas regions. However, under non-equilibrium conditions, this view breaks down. Here we report an experimental investigation of non-equilibrium fluctuations in supercritical carbon dioxide (CO2) subjected to a stabilising temperature gradient. Using shadowgraphy, we reveal spontaneous stratification of the fluid into different layers, separated by transition regions, where thermodynamic properties vary dramatically. These signatures are particularly evident when the system crosses the Widom lines, loci of the extrema of the response function in the supercritical domain. The analysis of the intermediate scattering function of temperature fluctuations highlights the presence of Brunt-Vaisala oscillations within the fluid at multiple frequencies. These oscillations arise from the coupling of thermal and viscous modes under gravity and are a clear signature of the layered structure of the fluid. Our approach enables systematic exploration of a wide range of thermodynamic conditions in a single experiment. These findings suggest that the Widom region cannot be described as a homogeneous phase, but rather as a dynamic assembly of phase-like behaviours, challenging the applicability of classical thermodynamics in non-equilibrium supercritical regimes.</description>
