      <title>Emergent active turbulence and intermittency in dense algal suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active-fluid turbulence has been found in bacterial suspensions, but not so far in their algal counterparts. We present the first experimental evidence for turbulence in dense algal suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We carry out a detailed analysis of the statistical properties of the flow present in these cell suspensions and show that they are quantitatively distinct from their counterparts in two-dimensional fluid and bacterial turbulence. Both kinetic-energy and density spectra of the fluid flow in algal turbulence show power-law regimes with unique scaling exponents. The fluid velocity probability distribution function (PDF) is strongly non-Gaussian and the length dependence of the PDF of fluid-velocity increments indicates small-scale intermittency. We compare and contrast our results with recent theoretical predictions for active-scalar turbulence and active glasses. Overall, our results highlight that active turbulence can arise, even in absence of orientational instabilities, so it is not limited to bacterial suspensions but it can also be found in many biological systems with free-swimming micro-organisms.</description>

      <title>Stress-stress correlations in two-dimensional amorphous and crystalline solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stress-stress correlations in crystalline solids with long-range order can be straightforwardly derived using elasticity theory. In contrast, the `emergent elasticity' of amorphous solids, rigid materials characterized by an underlying disordered structure, defies direct explanation within traditional theoretical frameworks. To address this challenge, tensor gauge theories have been recently proposed as a promising approach to describe the emergent elasticity of disordered solids and predict their stress-stress correlations. In this work, we revisit this problem in two-dimensional amorphous and crystalline solids by employing a canonical elasticity theory approach, supported by experimental and simulation data. We demonstrate that, with respect to static stress-stress correlations, the response of a 2D disordered solid is indistinguishable from that of a 2D isotropic crystalline solid and it is well predicted by vanilla elasticity theory. Moreover, we show that the presence of pinch-point singularities in the stress response is not an exclusive feature of amorphous solids. Our results confirm previous observations about the universal character of static stress-stress correlations in crystalline and amorphous packings.</description>

      <title>Nematic order from phase synchronization of shape oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a suspension of non-interacting deformable particles subjected to an oscillatory shear flow leads to development of nematic order that arises from the phenomenon of phase synchronization. The synchronized state corresponds to a unique, stable limit cycle confined in the toroidal state space. The limit cycle exists since, unlike rigid particles, deformable particles can modulate aspect ratio, adjust their tumbling rate and thus, achieve phase synchronization. These synchronized regions emerge as Arnold tongues in the parameter-space of the driving amplitude and frequency. Considering the rheological implications of ordering dynamics in soft and active matter, our results motivate oscillatory shear flow experiments with deformable particles.</description>

      <title>Euler buckling on curved surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euler buckling epitomises mechanical instabilities: An inextensible straight elastic line buckles under compression when the compressive force reaches a critical value $F_\ast&gt;0$. Here, we extend this classical, planar instability to the buckling under compression of an inextensible relaxed elastic line on a curved surface. By weakly nonlinear analysis of an asymptotically short elastic line, we reveal that the buckling bifurcation changes fundamentally: The critical force for the lowest buckling mode is $F_\ast=0$ and higher buckling modes disconnect from the undeformed branch to connect in pairs. Solving the buckling problem numerically, we additionally find a new post-buckling instability: A long elastic line on a curved surface snaps through under sufficient compression. Our results thus set the foundations for understanding the buckling instabilities on curved surfaces that pervade the emergence of shape in biology.</description>

      <title>Capillary jet in a slab of foam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A capillary jet plunging into a quasi-2D slab of monodisperse foam of the same solution is studied experimentally. We show that the jet can have a drastic impact on the foam. At small speeds it inflates the channels separating the bubbles. At intermediate speeds, impact with channels creates very small bubbles. At higher speeds, the jet thins the foam films, which can result in bubble rupture. We study the mechanisms behind these processes using an elementary foam formed by three soap films in contact through a Plateau border. We obtain scaling laws, which transfer quantitatively from the elementary foam to the 2D foam.</description>

      <title>A microstructural model of transversely isotropic, fibre-reinforced hydrogels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fibre-reinforced hydrogels are promising materials for biomedical applications due to their strength, toughness, and tunability. However, it remains unclear how to design fibre-reinforced hydrogels for use in specific applications due to the lack of a flexible modelling framework that can predict and hence optimise their behaviour. In this paper, we present a microstructural model for transversely isotropic fibre-reinforced hydrogels that captures the specific geometry of the fibre network. The model also accounts for slack in the initial fibre network that is gradually removed upon deformation. The mechanical model for the fibre network is coupled to a nonlinear poroelastic model for the hydrogel matrix that accounts for osmotic stress. By comparing the model predictions to data from load-controlled, unconfined compression experiments, we show that the model can capture J-shaped stress-strain curves and time-dependent creep responses. We showcase how the model can be used to guide the design of materials for artificial cartilage by exploring how to maximise interstitial fluid pressure. We find that fluid pressurisation can be increased by using stiffer fibres, removing slack from the fibre network, and reducing the Young's modulus of the hydrogel matrix. Finally, an open-source Python package has been developed for simulating unconfined compression experiments using the model.</description>

      <title>Predicting Heteropolymer Phase Separation Using Two-Chain Contact Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase separation in polymer solutions often correlates with single-chain and two-chain properties, such as the single-chain radius of gyration, Rg, and the pairwise second virial coefficient, B22. However, recent studies have shown that these metrics can fail to distinguish phase-separating from non-phase-separating heteropolymers, including intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). Here we introduce an approach to predict heteropolymer phase separation from two-chain simulations by analyzing contact maps, which capture how often specific monomers from the two chains are in physical proximity. Whereas B22 summarizes the overall attraction between two chains, contact maps preserve spatial information about their interactions. To compare these metrics, we train phase-separation classifiers for both a minimal heteropolymer model and a chemically specific, residue-level IDP model. Remarkably, simple statistical properties of two-chain contact maps predict phase separation with high accuracy, vastly outperforming classifiers based on Rg and B22 alone. Our results thus establish a transferable and computationally efficient method to uncover key driving forces of IDP phase behavior based on their physical interactions in dilute solution.</description>

      <title>Capacitive response of biological membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a minimal model to analyze the capacitive response of a biological membrane subjected to a step voltage via blocking electrodes. Through a perturbative analysis of the underlying electrolyte transport equations, we show that the leading-order relaxation of the transmembrane potential is governed by a capacitive timescale, ${\tau_{\rm C} =\dfrac{\lambda_{\rm D}L}{D}\left(\dfrac{2+\Gamma\delta^{\rm M}/L}{4+\Gamma\delta^{\rm M}/\lambda_{\rm D}}\right)}$, where $\lambda_{\rm D}$ is the Debye screening length, $L$ is the electrolyte width, $\Gamma$ is the ratio of the dielectric permittivity of the electrolyte to the membrane, $\delta^{\rm M}$ is the membrane thickness, and $D$ is the ionic diffusivity. This timescale is considerably shorter than the traditional RC timescale ${\lambda_{\rm D} L / D}$ for a bare electrolyte due to the membrane's low dielectric permittivity and finite thickness. Beyond the linear regime, however, salt diffusion in the bulk electrolyte drives a secondary, nonlinear relaxation process of the transmembrane potential over a longer timescale ${\tau_{\rm L} =L^2/4\pi^2 D}$. A simple equivalent-circuit model accurately captures the linear behavior, and the perturbation expansion remains applicable across the entire range of observed physiological transmembrane potentials. Together, these findings underscore the importance of the faster capacitive timescale and nonlinear effects on the bulk diffusion timescale in determining transmembrane potential dynamics for a range of biological systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover activity-driven crossover from phase separation to a new turbulent state in a two-dimensional system of counter-rotating spinners. We study the statistical properties of this active-rotor turbulence using the active-rotor Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes model, and show that the vorticity $\omega \propto \phi$, the scalar field that distinguishes regions with different rotating states. We explain this intriguing proportionality theoretically, and we characterize power-law energy and concentration spectra, intermittency, and flow-topology statistics. We suggest biological implications of such turbulence.</description>

      <title>The mechanics of the squash nick shot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Squash is a widely popular racket sport, practiced by millions of people worldwide, played inside a walled court. When played well, players can last for several minutes before the ball bounces twice on the floor. There is, however, an unanswerable shot. When the ball hits the nick between a vertical wall and the floor, under certain conditions, it rolls without any vertical bounce. We study this process experimentally. We determined that the ball must hit the vertical wall first at a narrow range of heights above the floor, but most importantly, it must touch the floor before finishing its rolling time on the vertical wall. When the rolling time is shorter than the contact time, the vertical momentum is canceled due to a mechanical frustration condition. This behavior is explained considering a contact model, which agrees with the experimental observations. We argue that this concept could be relevant to the design of rolling shock dampers with many possible practical applications.</description>

      <title>Reversal of tracer advection and Hall drift in an interacting chiral fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral fluids are defined by broken mirror or time-reversal symmetry, giving rise to tensorial transport coefficients with antisymmetric components. A key example is the odd mobility tensor, which governs the response of a chiral tracer to an applied force and induces a characteristic transverse drift. While this response is well understood in the infinite dilution limit, the impact of interparticle interactions on the tracer dynamics remains largely unexplored. Here, we conduct an analytical and computational study of a chiral fluid with interparticle interactions and show that, under an external driving force, a chiral tracer can undergo a complete reversal of both its transverse Hall drift and its advection along the force. This reversal emerges from the interplay between odd mobility and interaction-mediated forces, resulting in a phenomenon reminiscent of absolute negative mobility.</description>

      <title>Annihilation-limited Long-range Exciton Transport in High-mobility Conjugated Copolymer Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A combination of ultrafast, long-range and low-loss excitation energy transfer from the photo-receptor location to a functionally active site is essential for cost-effective polymeric semiconductors. Delocalized electronic wavefunctions along {\pi}-conjugated polymer backbone can enable efficient intrachain transport, while interchain transport is generally thought slow and lossy due to weak chain-chain interactions. In contrast to the conventional strategy of mitigating structural disorder, amorphous layers of rigid conjugated polymers, exemplified by highly planar poly(indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole) (IDT-BT) donor-accepter copolymer, exhibit trap-free transistor performance and charge-carrier mobilities similar to amorphous silicon. Here we report long-range exciton transport in HJ-aggregated IDTBT thin-film, in which the competing exciton transport and exciton-exciton annihilation (EEA) dynamics are spectroscopically separated using a phase-cycling-based scheme and shown to depart from the classical iffusion-limited and strong-coupling regime. In the thin film, we find an annihilation-limited mechanism with a per-encounter annihilation probability of much less than 100%, facilitating the minimization of EEA-induced excitation losses. In contrast, excitons on isolated IDTBT chains diffuse over 350 nm with 0.56 cm2 s-1 diffusivity, before eventually annihilating with unit probability on first contact. We complement the pump-probe studies with temperature dependent photocurrent and EEA measurements from 295 K to 77 K and find a remarkable correspondence of annihilation rate and photocurrent activation energies in the 140 K to 295 K temperature range.</description>

      <title>Persistent motion of a Brownian particle subject to repulsive feedback with time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03182v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on analytical and numerical calculations we study the dynamics of an overdamped colloidal particle moving in two dimensions under time-delayed, non-linear feedback control. Specifically, the particle is subject to a force derived from a repulsive Gaussian potential depending on the difference between its instantaneous position, $\mathbf{r}(t)$, and its earlier position $\mathbf{r}(t-\tau)$, where $\tau$ is the delay time. Considering first the deterministic case, we provide analytical results for both, the case of small displacements and the dynamics at long times. In particular, at appropriate values of the feedback parameters, the particle approaches a steady state with a constant, non-zero velocity whose direction is constant as well. In the presence of noise, the direction of motion becomes randomized at long times, but the (numerically obtained) velocity autocorrelation still reveals some persistence of motion. Moreover, the mean-squared displacement (MSD) reveals a mixed regime at intermediate times with contributions of both, ballistic motion and diffusive translational motion, allowing us to extract an estimate for the effective propulsion velocity in presence of noise. We then analyze the data in terms of exact, known results for the MSD of active Brownian particles. The comparison indeed indicates a strong similarity between the dynamics of the particle under repulsive delayed feedback and active motion. This relation carries over to the behavior of the long-time diffusion coefficient $D_\mathrm{eff}$ which, similarly to active motion, is strongly enhanced compared to the free case. Finally we show that, for small delays, $D_\mathrm{eff}$ can be estimated analytically.</description>

      <title>Heat production in a stochastic system with nonlinear time-delayed feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03316v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the framework of stochastic thermodynamics we study heat production related to the stochastic motion of a particle driven by repulsive, nonlinear, time-delayed feedback. Recently it has been shown that this type of feedback can lead to persistent motion above a threshold in parameter space [Physical Review E 107, 024611 (2023)]. Here we investigate, numerically and by analytical methods, the rate of heat production in the different regimes around the threshold to persistent motion. We find a nonzero average heat production rate, $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$, already below the threshold, indicating the nonequilibrium character of the system even at small feedback. In this regime, we compare to analytical results for a corresponding linearized delayed system and a small-delay approximation which provides a reasonable description of $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$ at small repulsion (or delay time). Beyond the threshold, the rate of heat production is much larger and shows a maximum as function of the delay time. In this regime, $\langle \dot{q}\rangle$ can be approximated by that of a system subject to a constant force stemming from the long-time velocity in the deterministic limit. The distribution of dissipated heat, however, is non-Gaussian, contrary to the constant-force case.</description>

Abstract: We give an introductory account of the recently identified gauge invariance of the equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical many-body systems [J. M\"uller et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 217101 (2024)]. The gauge transformation is a non-commutative shifting operation on phase space that keeps the differential phase space volume element and hence the Gibbs integration measure conserved. When thermally averaged any observable is an invariant, including thermodynamic and structural quantities. Shifting transformations are canonical in the sense of classical mechanics. They also form an infinite-dimensional group with generators of infinitesimal transformations that build a non-commutative Lie algebra. We lay out the connections with the underlying geometry of coordinate displacement and with Noether's theorem. Spatial localization of the shifting yields differential operators that satisfy commutator relationships, which we describe both in purely configurational and in full phase space setups. Standard operator calculus yields corresponding equilibrium hyperforce correlation sum rules for general observables and order parameters. Using Monte Carlos simulations we demonstrate explicitly the gauge invariance for finite shifting. We argue in favour of using the gauge invariance as a statistical mechanical construction principle for obtaining exact results and for formulating smart sampling algorithms.</description>
