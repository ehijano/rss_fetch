      <title>A joint effort to discover and characterize two resonant mini Neptunes around TOI-1803 with TESS, HARPS-N and CHEOPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of two mini Neptunes near a 2:1 orbital resonance configuration orbiting the K0 star TOI-1803. We describe their orbital architecture in detail and suggest some possible formation and evolution scenarios. Using CHEOPS, TESS, and HARPS-N datasets we can estimate the radius and the mass of both planets. We used a multidimensional Gaussian Process with a quasi-periodic kernel to disentangle the planetary components from the stellar activity in the HARPS-N dataset. We performed dynamical modeling to explain the orbital configuration and performed planetary formation and evolution simulations. For the least dense planet, we define possible atmospheric characterization scenarios with simulated JWST observations. TOI-1803 b and TOI-1803 c have orbital periods of $\sim$6.3 and $\sim$12.9 days, respectively, residing in close proximity to a 2:1 orbital resonance. Ground-based photometric follow-up observations revealed significant transit timing variations (TTV) with an amplitude of $\sim$10 min and $\sim$40 min, respectively, for planet -b and -c. With the masses computed from the radial velocities data set, we obtained a density of (0.39$\pm$0.10) $\rho_{earth}$ and (0.076$\pm$0.038) $\rho_{earth}$ for planet -b and -c, respectively. TOI-1803 c is among the least dense mini Neptunes currently known, and due to its inflated atmosphere, it is a suitable target for transmission spectroscopy with JWST. We report the discovery of two mini Neptunes close to a 2:1 orbital resonance. The detection of significant TTVs from ground-based photometry opens scenarios for a more precise mass determination. TOI-1803 c is one of the least dense mini Neptune known so far, and it is of great interest among the scientific community since it could constrain our formation scenarios.</description>

      <title>The First JWST View of a 30-Myr-old Protoplanetary Disk Reveals a Late-stage Carbon-rich Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a JWST MIRI/MRS spectrum of the inner disk of WISE J044634.16$-$262756.1B (hereafter J0446B), an old ($\sim$34 Myr) M4.5 star but with hints of ongoing accretion. The spectrum is molecule-rich and dominated by hydrocarbons. We detect 14 molecular species (H$_2$, CH$_3$, CH$_4$, C$_2$H$_2$, $^{13}$CCH$_2$, C$_2$H$_4$, C$_2$H$_6$, C$_3$H$_4$, C$_4$H$_2$, C$_6$H$_6$, HCN, HC$_3$N, CO$_2$ and $^{13}$CO$_2$) and 2 atomic lines ([Ne II] and [Ar II]), all observed for the first time in a disk at this age. The detection of spatially unresolved H$_2$ and Ne gas strongly supports that J0446B hosts a long-lived primordial disk, rather than a debris disk. The marginal H$_2$O detection and the high C$_2$H$_2$/CO$_2$ column density ratio indicate that the inner disk of J0446B has a very carbon-rich chemistry, with a gas-phase C/O ratio $\gtrsim$2, consistent with what have been found in most primordial disks around similarly low-mass stars. In the absence of significant outer disk dust substructures, inner disks are expected to first become water-rich due to the rapid inward drift of icy pebbles, and evolve into carbon-rich as outer disk gas flows inward on longer timescales. The faint millimeter emission in such low-mass star disks implies that they may have depleted their outer icy pebble reservoir early and already passed the water-rich phase. Models with pebble drift and volatile transport suggest that maintaining a carbon-rich chemistry for tens of Myr likely requires a slowly evolving disk with $\alpha-$viscosity $\lesssim10^{-4}$. This study represents the first detailed characterization of disk gas at $\sim$30 Myr, strongly motivating further studies into the final stages of disk evolution.</description>

      <title>TOI-4504: Exceptionally large Transit Timing Variations induced by two resonant warm gas giants in a three planet system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a joint analysis of TTVs and Doppler data for the transiting exoplanet system TOI-4504. TOI-4504 c is a warm Jupiter-mass planet that exhibits the largest known transit timing variations (TTVs), with a peak-to-node amplitude of $\sim$ 2 days, the largest value ever observed, and a super-period of $\sim$ 930 d. TOI-4504 b and c were identified in public TESS data, while the TTVs observed in TOI-4504 c, together with radial velocity (RV) data collected with FEROS, allowed us to uncover a third, non-transiting planet in this system, TOI-4504 d. We were able to detect transits of TOI-4504 b in the TESS data with a period of 2.4261$\pm 0.0001$ days and derive a radius of 2.69$\pm 0.19$ R$_{\oplus}$. The RV scatter of TOI-4504 was too large to constrain the mass of TOI-4504 b, but the RV signals of TOI-4504 c \&amp; d were sufficiently large to measure their masses. The TTV+RV dynamical model we apply confirms TOI-4504 c as a warm Jupiter planet with an osculating period of 82.54$\pm 0.02$ d, mass of 3.77$\pm 0.18$ M$_{\rm J}$ and a radius of 0.99$\pm 0.05$ R$_{\rm J}$, while the non-transiting planet TOI-4504 d, has an orbital period of 40.56$\pm 0.04$ days and mass of 1.42$_{-0.06}^{+0.07}$ M$_{\rm J}$. We present the discovery of a system with three exoplanets: a hot sub-Neptune and two warm Jupiter planets. The gas giant pair is stable and likely locked in a first-order 2:1 mean-motion resonance (MMR). The TOI-4504 system is an important addition to MMR pairs, whose increasing occurrence supports a smooth migration into a resonant configuration during the protoplanetary disk phase.</description>

      <title>A potential exomoon from the predicted planet obliquity of $\beta$ Pictoris b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planet obliquity is the alignment or misalignment of a planet spin axis relative to its orbit normal. In a multiplanet system, this obliquity is a valuable signature of planet formation and evolutionary history. The young $\beta$ Pictoris system hosts two coplanar super-Jupiters and upcoming JWST observations of this system will constrain the obliquity of the outer planet, $\beta$ Pictoris b. This will be the first planet obliquity measurement in an extrasolar, multiplanet system. First, we show that this new planet obliquity is likely misaligned by using a wide range of simulated observations in combination with published measurements of the system. Motivated by current explanations for the tilted planet obliquities in the Solar System, we consider collisions and secular spin-orbit resonances. While collisions are unlikely to occur, secular spin-orbit resonance modified by the presence of an exomoon around the outer planet can excite a large obliquity. The largest induced obliquities ($\sim 60^\circ$) occur for moons with at least a Neptune-mass and a semimajor axis of $0.03-0.05~\mathrm{au}$ ($40-70$ planet radii). For certain orbital alignments, such a moon may observably transit the planet (transit depth of $3-7\%$, orbital period of $3-7$ weeks). Thus, a nonzero obliquity detection of $\beta$ Pictoris b implies that it may host a large exomoon. Although we focus on the $\beta$ Pictoris system, the idea that the presence of exomoons can excite high obliquities is very general and applicable to other exoplanetary systems.</description>

      <title>Interior and Gravity Field Models for Uranus Suggest Mixed-composition Interior: Implications for the Uranus Orbiter and Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interior composition and structure of Uranus are ambiguous. It is unclear whether Uranus is composed of fully differentiated layers dominated by an icy mantle or has smooth compositional gradients. The Uranus Orbiter and Probe (UOP), the next NASA Flagship mission prioritized by the Planetary Science and Astrobiology Survey 2023-2032, will constrain the planet's interior by measuring its gravity and magnetic fields. To characterize the Uranian interior, here we present CORGI, a newly developed planetary interior and gravity model. We confirm that high degrees of mixing are required for Uranus interior models to be consistent with the $J_2$ and $J_4$ gravity harmonics measured by Voyager 2. Empirical models, which have smooth density profiles that require extensive mixing, can reproduce the Voyager 2 measurements. Distinct-layer models with mantles composed of H$_2$O-H/He or H$_2$O-CH$_4$-NH$_3$ mixtures are consistent with the Voyager 2 measurements if the heavy element mass fraction, $Z$, in the mantle $\lesssim85\%$, or if atmospheric $Z$ $\gtrsim25\%$. Our gravity harmonics model shows that UOP $J_2$ and $J_4$ measurements can distinguish between high ($Z\geq25\%$) and low ($Z=12.5\%$) atmospheric metallicity scenarios. The UOP can robustly constrain $J_6$ and potentially $J_8$ given polar orbits within rings. An ice-rich composition can naturally explain the source of Uranus' magnetic field. However, because the physical properties of rock-ice mixtures are poorly known, magnetic field generation by a rock-rich composition cannot be ruled out. Future experiments and simulations on realistic planetary building materials will be essential for refining Uranus interior models.</description>

      <title>No dilute core produced in simulations of giant impacts onto Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A giant impact has been proposed as a possible formation mechanism for Jupiter's dilute core - the planet's inferred internal structure in which the transition between its core of heavy elements and its predominantly hydrogen-helium envelope is gradual rather than a discrete interface. A past simulation suggested that a head-on impact of a 10 $M_\oplus$ planet into an almost fully formed, differentiated Jupiter could lead to a post-impact planet with a smooth compositional gradient and a central heavy-element fraction as low as $Z\approx0.5$. Here, we present simulations of giant impacts onto Jupiter using improved numerical methods to reassess the feasibility of this scenario. We use the REMIX smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation, which has been newly developed to improve the treatment of mixing in SPH simulations, in particular between dissimilar materials. We perform a suite of giant impact simulations to probe the effects of impact speed, impact angle, pre-impact planet structure, and material equations of state on the evolution of heavy elements during a giant impact onto Jupiter. In all of our simulations, heavy elements re-settle over short timescales to form a differentiated core, even in cases where the core is initially disrupted into a transiently mixed state. A dilute core is not produced in any of our simulations. Our results, combined with recent observations that indicate that Saturn also has a dilute core, suggest that such structures are produced as part of the extended formation and evolution of giant planets, rather than through extreme, low-likelihood giant impacts.</description>

      <title>Metallicity Dependence of Giant Planets around M Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stellar metallicity ([Fe/H] and [M/H]) dependence of giant planets around M dwarfs by comparing the metallicity distribution of 746 field M dwarfs without known giant planets with a sample of 22 M dwarfs hosting confirmed giant planets. All metallicity measurements are homogeneously obtained through the same methodology based on the near-infrared spectra collected with a single instrument SpeX mounted on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. We find that 1) giant planets favor metal-rich M dwarfs at a 4-5$\sigma$ confidence level, depending on the band of spectra used to derive metallicity; 2) hot ($a/R_\ast\leq 20$) and warm ($a/R_\ast&gt; 20$) Jupiters do not show a significant difference in the metallicity distribution. Our results suggest that giant planets around M and FGK stars, which are already known to prefer metal-rich hosts, probably have a similar formation channel. In particular, hot and warm Jupiters around M dwarfs may have the same origin as they have indistinguishable metallicity distributions. With the refined stellar and planetary parameters, we examine the stellar metallicities and the masses of giant planets where we find no significant correlation. M dwarfs with multi-giant planets as well as mid-to-late type M stars hosting gas giants do not show an apparent preference to higher metallicities.</description>

      <title>A multi-technique detection of an eccentric giant planet around accelerating star HD 57625</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synergy between different detection methods is a key asset in exoplanetology, allowing for both precise characterization of detected exoplanets and robust constraints even in the case of non-detection. Recently, the interplay between imaging, radial velocities and astrometry has produced significant advancements in exoplanetary science. We report a first result of an ongoing survey performed with SHARK-NIR, the new high-contrast near-infrared imaging camera at the Large Binocular Telescope, in parallel with LBTI/LMIRCam in order to detect planetary companions around stars with significant proper motion anomaly. In this work we focus on HD 57625, a F8 star for which we determine a $4.8^{+3.7}_{-2.9}$Ga age, exhibiting significant astrometric acceleration and for which archival radial velocities hint at the presence of a previously undetected massive long-period companion. We analyse the imaging data we collected with SHARK-NIR and LMIRCam in synergy with the available public SOPHIE radial velocity time series and Hipparcos-Gaia proper motion anomaly. With this joint multi-technique analysis, we aim at characterizing the companion responsible for the astrometric and radial velocity signals. The imaging observations result in a non-detection, indicating the companion to be in the substellar regime. This is confirmed by the synergic analysis of archival radial velocity and astrometric measurements resulting in the detection of HD 57625 b, a ${8.43}_{-0.91}^{+1.10}$M$_{\rm Jup}$ planetary companion with an orbital separation of ${5.70}_{-0.13}^{+0.14}$au and ${0.52}_{-0.03}^{+0.04}$ eccentricity. HD 57625 b joins the small but growing population of giant planets in outer orbits with true mass determination provided by the synergic usage of multiple detection methods, proving once again the importance of multi-technique analysis in providing robust characterization of planetary companions.</description>

      <title>Radiative transfer modeling of Haumea's dust ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Among the growing number of small body rings in the solar system, the ring of Haumea has a special status as it is likely suitable for direct imaging in the visible and submillimeter wavelengths. In this paper, we highlight its sole detectability among Centaur/TNO rings using both the ALMA and the James Webb Space Telescope to provide direct constraints on the ring composition for the first time. To overcome the limitations of the currently used simple ring models, we introduce radiative transfer modeling for small body ring systems. Here we perform a thorough analysis of the Haumea ring considering different materials and grain sizes, assuming that the ring consists of small particles with sizes below 1 mm. We present spectral energy distributions of each model for future comparison with multiwavelength measurements, providing a diagnostic tool to determine the dominant grain size and characteristic material of the ring, which are essential inputs for ring formation and evolution theories. Our results also show that for some sub-micron carbon-like or silicate grains, their mid-infrared excess can be detected even if the ring is not resolved, providing a tracer for small grains around the object.</description>

      <title>Population-level Hypothesis Testing with Rocky Planet Emission Data: A Tentative Trend in the Brightness Temperatures of M-Earths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining which rocky exoplanets have atmospheres, and why, is a key goal for JWST. So far, emission observations of individual rocky exoplanets orbiting M stars (M-Earths) have not provided definitive evidence for atmospheres. Here, we synthesize emission data for M-Earths and find a trend in measured brightness temperature (ratioed to its theoretical maximum value) as a function of instellation. However, the statistical evidence of this trend is dependent on the choice of stellar model and we consider its identification tentative. We show that this trend can be explained by either the onset of thin/tenuous atmospheres on colder worlds, or a population of bare rocks with stronger space weathering and/or coarser regolith on closer-in worlds. Such grain coarsening may be caused by sintering near the melting point of rock or frequent volcanic resurfacing. We also find that fresh, fine-grained surfaces can serve as a false positive to the detection of moderate atmospheric heat redistribution. However, we argue that such surfaces are unlikely given the ubiquity of space weathering in the Solar System and the low albedo of Solar System airless bodies. Furthermore, we highlight considerations when testing rocky planet hypotheses at the population level, including the choice of instrument, stellar modeling, and how brightness temperatures are derived. Emission data from a larger sample of M-Earths will be able to confirm or reject this tentative trend and diagnose its cause.</description>

      <title>On the formation of super-Jupiters: Core Accretion or Gravitational Instability?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Core Accretion model is widely accepted as the primary mechanism for forming planets up to a few Jupiter masses. However, the formation of super-massive planets remains a subject of debate, as their formation via the Core Accretion model requires super-solar metallicities. Assuming stellar atmospheric abundances reflect the composition of protoplanetary disks, and that disk mass scales linearly with stellar mass, we calculated the total amount of metals in planet-building materials that could contribute to the formation of massive planets. In this work, we studied a sample of 172 Jupiter-mass planets and 93 planets with masses exceeding 4 Mjup. Our results consistently demonstrate that planets with masses above 4 Mjup form in disks with at least as much metal content as those hosting planets with masses between 1 and 4 Mjup, often with slightly higher metallicity, typically exceeding that of the proto-solar disk. We interpret this as strong evidence that the formation of very massive Jupiters is feasible through Core Accretion and encourage planet formation modelers to test our observational conclusions.</description>

      <title>Resolved convection in hydrogen-rich atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In hydrogen-rich atmospheres with low mean molecular weight (MMW), an air parcel containing a higher-molecular-weight condensible can be negatively buoyant even if its temperature is higher than the surrounding environment. This should fundamentally alter the dynamics of moist convection, but the low-MMW regime has previously been explored primarily via one-dimensional theories that cannot capture the complexity of moist turbulence. Here, we use a three-dimensional cloud-resolving model to simulate moist convection in atmospheres with a wide range of background MMW, and confirm that a humidity threshold for buoyancy reversal first derived by Guillot (1995) coincides with an abrupt change in tropospheric structure. Crossing the "Guillot threshold" in near-surface humidity causes the dry (subcloud) boundary layer to collapse and be replaced by a very cloudy layer with a temperature lapse rate that exceeds the dry adiabatic rate. Simulations with reduced surface moisture availability in the lower atmosphere feature a deeper dry subcloud layer, which allows the superadiabatic cloud layer to remain aloft. Our simulations support a potentially observable systematic trend toward increased cloudiness for atmospheres with near-surface moisture concentrations above the Guillot threshold. This should apply to \ce{H2O} and potentially to other condensible species on hotter worlds. We also find evidence for episodic convective activity and associated variability in cloud cover in some of our low-MMW simulations, which should be investigated further with global-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Rotational Velocities and Radii Estimates of Low-Mass Pre-Main Sequence Stars in NGC 2264</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigating the angular momentum evolution of pre-main sequence (PMS) stars provides important insight into the interactions between Sun-like stars and their protoplanetary disks, and the timescales that govern disk dissipation and planet formation. We present projected rotational velocities (v sin i values) of 254 T Tauri stars (TTSs) in the ~3 Myr-old open cluster NGC 2264, measured using high-dispersion spectra from the WIYN 3.5m telescope's Hydra instrument. We combine these with literature values of temperature, rotation period, luminosity, disk classification, and binarity. We find some evidence that Weak-lined TTSs may rotate faster than their Classical TTS counterparts and that stars in binary systems may rotate faster than single stars. We also combine our v sin i measurements with rotation period to estimate the projected stellar radii of our sample stars, and then use a maximum likelihood modeling technique to compare our radii estimates to predicted values from stellar evolution models. We find that starspot-free models tend to underestimate the radii of the PMS stars at the age of the cluster, while models that incorporate starspots are more successful. We also observe a mass dependence in the degree of radius inflation, which may be a result of differences in the birthline location on the HR diagram. Our study of NGC 2264 serves as a pilot study for analysis methods to be applied to four other clusters ranging in age from 1 to 14 Myr, which is the timescale over which protoplanetary disks dissipate and planetary systems begin to form.</description>

      <title>Externally irradiated young stars in NGC 3603. A JWST NIRSpec catalogue of pre-main-sequence stars in a massive star formation region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05650v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NGC 3603 is the optically brightest massive star forming region (SFR) in the Milky Way, representing a small scale starburst region. Studying young stars in regions like this allows us to assess how star and planet formation proceeds in a dense clustered environment with high levels of UV radiation. JWST provides the sensitivity, unbroken wavelength coverage, and spatial resolution required to study individual pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in distant massive SFRs in detail for the first time. Using the Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) onboard the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec), multi-object spectroscopy was performed, yielding 100 stellar spectra. We fit the PMS spectra to derive their photospheric properties, extinction, and NIR veiling. From this, we determined the masses and ages of our sources by placing them on the Hertzsprung-Russel diagram (HRD). Their accretion rates were determined by converting the luminosity of hydrogen emission lines to an accretion luminosity. We have classified 42 as actively accreting. Our sources span a range of masses from 0.5 to 7 $M_{\odot}$. Twelve of these accreting sources have ages consistent with $\ge$ 10 Myrs, with four having ages of $\ge$ 15 Myrs. Their mass accretion rates span 5 orders of magnitude and are systematically higher for a given stellar mass than for a comparative sample taken from low-mass SFRs. We report an environmental relationship between $\dot{M}_{acc}$ and the density of ambient molecular gas as traced by nebular $H_2$ emission.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Electron Acceleration and the 'Ankle' Spectral Feature in Earth's Magnetotail Reconnection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrons are accelerated to high, non-thermal energies during explosive energy-release events in space, such as magnetic reconnection. However, the properties and acceleration mechanisms of relativistic electrons directly associated with reconnection X-line are not well understood. This study utilizes Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) measurements to analyze the flux and spectral features of sub-relativistic to relativistic (~ 80 to 560 keV) electrons during a magnetic reconnection event in Earth's magnetotail. This event provided a unique opportunity to measure the electrons directly energized by X-line as MMS stayed in the separatrix layer, where the magnetic field directly connects to the X-line, for approximately half of the observation period. Our analysis revealed that the fluxes of relativistic electrons were clearly enhanced within the separatrix layer, and the highest flux was directed away from the X-line, which suggested that these electrons originated directly from the X-line. Spectral analysis showed that these relativistic electrons deviated from the main plasma sheet population and exhibited an "ankle" feature similar to that observed in galactic cosmic rays. The contribution of "ankle" electrons to the total electron energy density increased from 0.1% to 1% in the separatrix layer, though the spectral slopes did not exhibit clear variations. Further analysis indicated that while these relativistic electrons originated from the X-line, they experienced a non-negligible degree of scattering during transport. These findings provide clear evidence that magnetic reconnection in Earth's magnetotail can efficiently energize relativistic electrons directly at the X-line, providing new insights into the complex processes governing electron dynamics during magnetic reconnection.</description>

      <title>Photoevaporation from Inner Protoplanetary Disks Confronted with Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decades-long explorations on the dispersal of protoplanetary disks involve many debates about photoevaporation versus magnetized wind launching mechanisms. This letter argues that the observed winds originating from the inner disk ($R\lesssim 0.3$ AU) cannot be explained by the photoevaporative mechanism. Energy conservation requires the presumed photoevaporative winds to be heated to $\gtrsim 10^5$ K when launched from inner disks. However, due to efficient thermal accommodation with dust grains and cooling processes at high densities, X-ray irradiation at energies above 1 keV cannot efficiently launch winds in the first place because of its high penetration. Some studies claiming X-ray wind launching have oversimplified the thermochemical couplings. Furthermore, heating the gas to escape velocity will over-ionize it, suppressing the species responsible for observed forbidden lines (e.g., [OI] 6300 $\r{A}$ ). Confirmed by semi-analytic integrations of thermochemical fluid structures, such high ionizations contradict the observed emission of neutral and singly-ionized atoms from the winds originating from the inner disks.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of Planets in the Milky Way's Thick Disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exoplanet demographic surveys have revealed that close-in (${\lesssim}$1 au) small planets orbiting stars in the Milky Way's thick disk are ${\sim}50\%$ less abundant than those orbiting stars in the Galactic thin disk. One key difference between the two stellar populations is the time at which they emerged: thick disk stars are the likely product of cosmic noon (redshift $z {\sim}2$), an era characterized by high star formation rate, massive and dense molecular clouds, and strong supersonic turbulence. Solving for the background radiation field in these early star-forming regions, we demonstrate that protoplanetary disks at cosmic noon experienced radiation fields up to ${\sim}7$ orders of magnitude more intense than in solar neighborhood conditions. Coupling the radiation field to a one-dimensional protoplanetary disk evolution model, we find that external UV photoevaporation destroys protoplanetary disks in just ${\sim}$0.2--0.5 Myr, limiting the timescale over which planets can assemble. Disk temperatures exceed the sublimation temperatures of common volatile species for ${\gtrsim}$Myr timescales, predicting more spatial homogeneity in gas chemical composition. Our calculations imply that the deficit in planet occurrence around thick disk stars should be even more pronounced for giant planets, particularly those at wide orbital separations, predicting a higher rocky-to-giant planet ratio in the Galactic thick disk vs.~thin disk.</description>

      <title>Volatile-rich Sub-Neptunes as Hydrothermal Worlds: The Case of K2-18 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temperate exoplanets between the sizes of Earth and Neptune, known as "sub-Neptunes", have emerged as intriguing targets for astrobiology. It is unknown whether these planets resemble Earth-like terrestrial worlds with a habitable surface, Neptune-like giant planets with deep atmospheres and no habitable surface, or something exotic in between. Recent JWST transmission spectroscopy observations of the canonical sub-Neptune, K2-18 b, revealed ~1% CH4, ~1% CO2, and a non-detection of CO in the atmosphere. While previous studies proposed that the observed atmospheric composition could help constrain the lower atmosphere's conditions and determine the interior structure of sub-Neptunes like K2-18 b, the possible interactions between the atmosphere and a hot, supercritical water ocean at its base remain unexplored. In this work, we investigate whether a global supercritical water ocean, resembling a planetary-scale hydrothermal system, can explain these observations on K2-18 b-like sub-Neptunes through equilibrium aqueous geochemical calculations. We find that the observed atmospheric CH4/CO2 ratio implies a minimum ocean temperature of ~710 K, whereas the corresponding CO/CO2 ratio allows ocean temperatures up to ~1070 K. These results indicate that a global supercritical water ocean on K2-18 b is plausible. While life cannot survive in such an ocean, this work represents the first step towards understanding how a global supercritical water ocean may influence observable atmospheric characteristics on volatile-rich sub-Neptunes. Future observations with better constrained CO and NH$_3$ mixing ratios could further help distinguish between possible interior compositions of K2-18 b.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Jupiter's interior using machine learning reveals four key structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The internal structure of Jupiter is constrained by the precise gravity field measurements by NASA's Juno mission, atmospheric data from the Galileo entry probe, and Voyager radio occultations. Not only are these observations few compared to the possible interior setups and their multiple controlling parameters, but they remain challenging to reconcile. As a complex, multidimensional problem, characterizing typical structures can help simplify the modeling process. We used NeuralCMS, a deep learning model based on the accurate concentric Maclaurin spheroid (CMS) method, coupled with a fully consistent wind model to efficiently explore a wide range of interior models without prior assumptions. We then identified those consistent with the measurements and clustered the plausible combinations of parameters controlling the interior. We determine the plausible ranges of internal structures and the dynamical contributions to Jupiter's gravity field. Four typical interior structures are identified, characterized by their envelope and core properties. This reduces the dimensionality of Jupiter's interior to only two effective parameters. Within the reduced 2D phase space, we show that the most observationally constrained structures fall within one of the key structures, but they require a higher 1 bar temperature than the observed value. We provide a robust framework for characterizing giant planet interiors with consistent wind treatment, demonstrating that for Jupiter, wind constraints strongly impact the gravity harmonics while the interior parameter distribution remains largely unchanged. Importantly, we find that Jupiter's interior can be described by two effective parameters that clearly distinguish the four characteristic structures and conclude that atmospheric measurements may not fully represent the entire envelope.</description>

      <title>On the non-dissipative orbital evolution of a binary system comprising non-compact components with misaligned spin and orbital angular momenta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09112v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Paper we determine the non-dissipative tidal evolution of a close binary system with an arbitrary eccentricity in which the spin angular momenta of both components are misaligned with the orbital angular momentum. We focus on the situation where the orbital angular momentum dominates the spin angular momenta and so remains at small inclination to the conserved total angular momentum. Torques arising from rotational distortion and tidal distortion taking account of Coriolis forces are included. This extends the previous work of Ivanov &amp; Papaloizou relaxing the limitation resulting from the assumption that one of the components is compact and has zero spin angular momentum. Unlike the above study, the evolution of spin-orbit inclination angles is driven by both types of torque. We develop a simple analytic theory describing the evolution of orbital angles and compare it with direct numerical simulations. We find that the tidal torque prevails near 'critical curves' in parameter space where the time-averaged apsidal precession rate is close to zero. In the limit of small spin, these curves exist only for systems that have at least one component with retrograde rotation. As in our previous work, we find solutions close to these curves for which the apsidal angle librates. As noted there, this could result in oscillation between prograde and retrograde states. We consider the application of our approach to systems with parameters similar to those of the misaligned binary DI Her.</description>
