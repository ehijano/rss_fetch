      <title>High-quality electron beam generation from laser wakefield accelerators for driving compact free electron lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the successful demonstration of compact free electron lasers (FELs) driven by laser wakefield accelerators (LWFAs), the pursuit of further enhancements in high-gain compact FELs presents a challenge due to the limitations in electron beam quality. In this work, we pinpoint the pivotal physics and optimization strategies for high-quality single-stage LWFAs that are crucial for high-gain FELs. We have delved into the synergistic injection mechanism, where the self-evolution injection threshold is far from reached at the injection position, with both the shock front and self-evolution of the laser playing a role in the injection process. A thorough discussion has been provided on the beam-quality degradation and optimization strategies, in terms of global (slice) energy spread and projected (slice) emittance. With the goal of achieving high-gain FELs driven by LWFAs, we have also explored the synthesis quality of the electron beam to determine an optimized power gain length. A comprehensive start-to-end simulation has been conducted, demonstrating the effectiveness of compact FELs powered by these high-quality electron beams. The resulting radiation reaches the saturation regime after a 4.5-meter-long undulator, with an energy of 17.4 {\mu}J and a power of 6.0 GW at a wavelength of 23.9 nm. This proposed scheme offers not only a framework for optimizing beam quality in LWFAs, but also a promising path for future compact LWFA-driven FELs to achieve saturated regimes, opening up new possibilities for widespread applications.</description>

      <title>Resolving discrepancies in bang-time predictions for ICF experiments on the NIF: Insights from the Build-A-Hohlraum Campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigated discrepancies between measured and simulated x-ray drive in Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF) hohlraums at the National Ignition Facility (NIF). Despite advances in radiation-hydrodynamic simulations, a consistent "drive deficit" remains. Experimentally measured ICF capsule bang-times are systematically 400-700 ps later than simulations predict. The Build-A-Hohlraum (BAH) campaign explored potential causes for this discrepancy by systematically varying hohlraum features, including laser entrance hole (LEH) windows, capsules, and gas fills. Overall, the agreement between simulated and experimental x-ray drive was found to be largely unaffected by these changes. The data allows us to exclude some hypotheses put forward to potentially explain the discrepancy. Errors in the local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) atomic modeling, errors in the modeling of LEH closure and errors due to a lack of plasma species mix physics in simulations are shown to be inconsistent with our measurements. Instead, the data supports the hypothesis that errors in NLTE emission modeling are a significant contributor to the discrepancy. X-ray emission in the 2 - 4 keV range is found to be approximately 30% lower than in simulations. This is accompanied by higher than predicted electron temperatures in the gold bubble region, pointing to errors in non-LTE modeling. Introducing an opacity multiplier of 0.87 on energy groups above 1.8 keV improves agreement with experimental data, reducing the bang-time discrepancy from 300 ps to 100 ps. These results underscore the need for refined NLTE opacity models to enhance the predictive power of hohlraum simulations.</description>

      <title>Invariant tori for the pressure-jump Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major achievement of Dewar and coworkers is the SPEC code to construct stepped-pressure equilibria in magnetohydrostatics without axisymmetry. Their existence had been proved by Bruno and Laurence. As part of the procedure of Bruno and Laurence, it is required to solve the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a magnetic potential on the outside of an interface given the field on the inside and the pressure-jump across the interface. For non-axisymmetric interface, it was understood that solutions with insufficiently irrational rotational transform might not exist, and examples have been given for which there are no solutions at all for large enough pressure-jump. The present paper gives a method to compute regions in the phase space for the pressure-jump Hamiltonian through which no invariant tori pass. The paper also shows how to present the results as regions in the space of pressure-jumps and outer rotational transform for which there is no solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The method is expected to reach arbitrarily close to the full non-existence region with enough computational work, so what is left over can be relied on to be mostly invariant tori. The paper also brings to attention a class of metrics on tori that are not necessarily axisymmetric yet have integrable geodesic flow. They could give interfaces with solutions for all but finitely many rotational transforms.</description>

      <title>Time-Resolved Measurements of Cumulative Effects in Gas Dynamics Induced by High-Repetition-Rate Femtosecond Laser Filamentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of high-average-power, ultrafast ytterbium-based lasers allows us to generate laser filaments at repetition rates ranging from 10s of kHz up to 100s of kHz. At such high repetition rates, the inter-pulse time lies below the time required for the total diffusion of the deposited heat by each laser pulse, leading to cumulative hydrodynamic effects that have so far been rarely studied. Here, we present, to the best of our knowledge, the first experimental time-resolved measurements of these dynamics in air for laser repetition rates between 1 kHz and 100 kHz. We measure the change in the air refractive index caused by the localized heat deposition and the length of the filament-generated plasma channel, with which we can infer the corresponding change in air density. We observe that at repetition rates above 10 kHz, stationary density depletions with vanishing dynamics emerge. Our findings are of wide relevance for the fields of high-repetition-rate laser filamentation and its applications, as well as THz generation from laser-induced plasma sources.</description>

      <title>Fundamental MHD scales -- II: the kinematic phase of the supersonic small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17036v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many astrophysical small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify weak magnetic fields via highly compressible, supersonic turbulence, but established SSD theories have overlooked these compressible effects. To address this, we perform visco-resistive SSD simulations across a range of sonic Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}$), hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$), and magnetic Prandtl numbers ($\mathrm{Pm}$). We develop robust methods to measure kinetic and magnetic energy dissipation scales ($\ell_\nu$ and $\ell_\eta$) and the scale of strongest magnetic fields ($\ell_\mathrm{p}$) during the kinematic phase. We demonstrate that $\ell_\nu/\ell_\eta \sim \mathrm{Pm}^{1/2}$ is a universal feature for $\mathrm{Pm} \geq 1$ SSDs, regardless of $\mathcal{M}$ or $\mathrm{Re}$. Incompressible SSDs (either $\mathcal{M} \leq 1$ or $\mathrm{Re} &lt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit} \approx 100$) concentrate magnetic energy at $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim \ell_\eta$ with inversely correlated field strength and curvature. However, for compressible SSDs ($\mathcal{M} &gt; 1$ and $\mathrm{Re} &gt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit}$), shocks concentrate magnetic energy in large structures with $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim (\ell_\mathrm{turb} / \ell_\mathrm{shock})^{1/3} \ell_\eta \gg \ell_\eta$, where $\ell_\mathrm{shock}$ is the characteristic shock width, and $\ell_\mathrm{turb}$ is the outer scale of the turbulent field. In this regime, magnetic field-line curvature becomes nearly independent of field strength. These results have implications for galaxy mergers and cosmic ray transport models in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>A tuneable frequency comb via dual-beam laser-solid harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03599v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A high-power laser pulse at normal incidence onto a plane solid target will generate odd harmonics of its frequency. However, the spacing of the harmonic lines in this configuration is fixed. Here, we study harmonic generation using two laser beams incident on a plane target at small, opposite angles to the target normal, via particle-in-cell simulations. When looking at the harmonic radiation in a specific direction via a narrow slit or pinhole, we select an angle-dependent subset of the harmonic spectrum. This way, we obtain a harmonic frequency comb that we control via the observation angle and the input laser frequency. The spectra for s- and p-polarised harmonics are studied separately, as they offer different frequency combs. The divergence of the harmonic radiation will be reduced by using wider laser spots, thus increasing the efficacy of the scheme. We will discuss extensions to this scheme, such as using beams with unequal frequencies, a slight tilt of the target, or employing more than two beams.</description>
