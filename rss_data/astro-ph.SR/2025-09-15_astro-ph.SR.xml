      <title>Sensitivity of spectral lines to granulation: The Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic variability of stars, due to acoustic oscillations, surface granulation, and magnetic activity, introduces radial velocity (RV) jitter in spectral lines, obscuring true planetary signals and hindering the detection of Earth-like planets. Granulation is particularly challenging, as it affects even the most inactive stars introducing substantial signals, with amplitudes up to 1 m/s. Disentangling granulation-induced RV jitter from signal caused by planetary reflex motion requires reliable models of stellar granulation. In this study, we present a new approach for calculating sensitivities of spectral lines to granulation. We simulate near-surface convection with 3D radiative MHD code MURaM and calculate high-resolution emergent spectra with the radiative transfer code MPS-ATLAS. We then introduce a novel methodology that uses spatial variability of spectral lines across the granulation pattern at a single moment in time to compute their temporal variability. This approach significantly reduces computational costs. We apply our approach to analyze the response of lines from neutral and singly ionized elemental species to solar granulation.We find a clear distinction between the two groups of lines: those from neutral elements tend to show stronger variations in line strength, whereas those from singly ionized elements exhibit larger variations in central wavelength. These results enable the development of spectral line masks tailored to granulation sensitivity, offering a promising strategy to reduce granulation-induced RV noise and improve exoplanet detection.</description>

      <title>Supra-arcade downflows in an extensive fan associated with a giant quiescent solar filament eruption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the aftermath of a giant quiescent solar filament eruption on December 24, 2023. One feature of the eruption is an extensive fan above the filament channel that is about three times as wide as similar structures that appear above active regions (ARs) during solar flares. The fan contains numerous supra-arcade downflows (SADs), and we investigate the largest SADs with continuous Hinode X-ray Telescope (XRT) observations. The measured maximum width of the SADs in this event is at least three times the maximum width of SADs observed in AR flares, whereas the velocities of the largest SADs are similar to the typical values of AR SADs. The kinetic characteristics of the largest SADs observed in this event align with previous model predictions, where SADs originate from the non-linear development of Rayleigh-Taylor type instabilities. In this scenario, the larger system size allows the existence of larger-scale instabilities, while the development of the velocities of these instabilities is expected to be independent of the system size. Compared to AR flares, the temperature and emission measure in this event are lower, and there is less overall radiation, resulting in no evident Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) signature. Similar to those in AR flares, SADs show lower temperatures compared to the surrounding fan plasma. Our observations show that SADs are present in a wide variety of eruptions. The reconnection mechanisms present in quiescent filament eruptions are similar to those driving more compact eruptions originating from ARs.</description>

      <title>Which Solar Latitude Follows the Sunspot Cycle Exactly?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale convection in the Sun known as supergranulation is manifested as a network structure on the solar surface. The network cells have an average lifetime of 24 hr, a size of about 30 Mm, and a lane width of about 6 Mm. We have obtained the lane widths and intensities at different latitudes from the Ca {\sc ii} K spectroheliograms from the 100 yr Kodaikanal archival data. We have then calculated the cross correlation function of lane widths and intensities with sunspot number at every latitude from 60$^{\circ}$ N to 60$^{\circ}$ S. The correlation coefficients of the quantities show an approximate North-South symmetry with broad peaks around $\pm$(11--22)$^{\circ}$ latitude with values of about 0.8. The results imply that these latitudes follow the sunspot cycle strongly. The maximum correlation for the lane widths occurs (18$\pm$2)$^{\circ}$ N and (20$\pm$2)$^{\circ}$ S with no phase difference. For intensities, this happens at (13$\pm$2)$^{\circ}$ N and (14$\pm$2)$^{\circ}$ S with a phase difference of 1.25 to 1.5 yr. It is interesting to note that the lane width correlations peak during the solar maximum whereas the intensitiy correlations peak 1.25--1.5 yr after the solar maximum. The results, generally show that no unique latitude exactly follows the solar cycle for all quantities. The results are important in flux transport on the solar surface and have implications for the quiet Sun UV irradiance variations.</description>

      <title>Unified $g$-mode and $r$-mode Analysis of Accreting White Dwarf Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dwarf novae are a subset of cataclysmic variables that accrete material intermittently in short-duration outbursts with sometimes long quiescent intervals in between. During the quiescent state, the white dwarf (WD) photosphere may be observable. Some of these systems show periodic variability consistent with a non-radial oscillation. Asteroseismology has become a unique tool for the measurement of internal structure of the WDs, such as their masses, radii, temperatures and rotation profiles. A few stable periodicities have been observed for accreting WDs, but the lack of complete and accurate theoretical models has hindered the real diagnosis of the observed pulsations. Though the associated pulsations in accreting WDs are thought to be $g$-modes, some work in the literature suggests that these pulsations could be Rossby modes ($r$-modes). Here, to elucidate this, we present a first simultaneous analysis of $g$- and $r$-mode pulsations in accreting white dwarfs including a full computation of visibility accounting for the distribution of variation over the WD surface. We show that, up to the second lowest degree ($\ell =2$), neither $g-$ nor $r$-modes have a clear advantage in visibility. Although a few retrograde $r$-mode orders exhibit a larger visibility, the low-order $g$ modes possess higher frequency in the star's frame, making them more likely to be driven within the convective driving scenario commonly applied to isolated WDs. Therefore, we favor a $g$-mode origin for the observed periods in accreting WDs, though $r$-modes will be important for stars with more observed modes.</description>

      <title>Effects of harmonic magnetic field boundary conditions in mean-field solar dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09985v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider effects of the harmonic magnetic field boundary conditions at the top of the dynamo domain on the dynamo stability inside the solar convection zone. These boundary conditions allow us to quantify the helical properties of the coronal magnetic field that stems from the dynamo region. In sewing the tangential component of the mean electric field we are able to take into account the effect the diffusive properties of the stellar corona on the dynamo instability. The model shows that effect of the vacuum boundary conditions can be restored if we introduce a few orders of magnitude jump of the coronal magnetic field turbulent diffusion over its typical value at the top of the dynamo domain. The parameters of this jump define the critical instability threshold of the $\alpha$ effect in the $\alpha^{2}\Omega$ dynamo.</description>

      <title>A star-by-star correspondence between X-ray activity and rotation in the young open cluster NGC 2516 with eROSITA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coronal soft X-ray emission of cool stars, especially when taken in combination with their measured rotation periods, offers insights into their levels of magnetic activity and related transitions. We study the X-ray properties of low-mass members of the open cluster NGC 2516 to explicate their detailed dependencies on mass and rotation. We analysed the pointed SRG/eROSITA satellite observations of NGC 2516 obtained during the calibration and performance verification phase of the mission. We found 1561 X-ray sources within the field of view and related 1007 of them to their optical stellar counterparts, including 655 members of NGC 2516 (433 with rotation periods). We combined these detections with auxiliary optical data to facilitate their interpretation. Furthermore, we extracted X-ray spectra for all sources and fit two-component APEC models to them. To aid the analysis, we grouped stars with similar mass and rotational properties together, which allowed us to investigate the influence of rotation on various X-ray properties. The colour-activity diagram of NGC 2516 displays a general increase in the fractional X-ray luminosity with spectral type change from F through G and K to M-type. However, the behaviour of K-type stars, representing the ones that best sample the fast-to-slow rotational transition, is more complex, with both increased and decreased X-ray emission relative to G-type stars for fast and slow rotators, respectively. The rotation-activity diagram is analogous, with an identifiable desaturated group of X-ray emitters that corresponds to stars in the rotational gap between the fast and slow rotator sequences. We prefer to describe the normalised X-ray emission for all cluster stars as declining logarithmically with Rossby number over those using broken power laws. Coronal temperatures appear to be largely independent of mass or rotation. (abridged)</description>

      <title>High Power Accretion in Massive Binary Systems and the Impact of Metallicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During a giant eruption of a very massive star in the binary system, the companion star can accrete a large amount of mass that can change its properties and potentially its subsequent evolution. The effect depends on the companion mass, metallicity, the amount of mass it accreted, orbital parameters and other parameters. We simulate individual companion stars assuming they undergo such accretion events. We study the envelope properties of 20 $\rm M_\odot$ and 30 $\rm M_\odot$ single massive stars at different matallicities ($Z= 0.02$, $Z=0.008$ and $Z=0.004$) during accretion at different rates, from $\rm 10^{-5}$ to $\rm 10^{-2}~M_\odot\,yr^{-1}$. For the lower accretion rates we simulate, the stars remains hot, while at higher accretion rates, it becomes cooler and inflates. This behavior is observed in both stars but occurs at different accretion rates. Higher metallicity stars exhibit greater variations in accretion luminosity for the same accretion rate and stellar mass compared to lower metallicity stars. While higher metallicity stars typically have larger stellar envelopes, suggesting smaller variations in luminosity at Galactic metallicity compared to the LMC and SMC, our results show the opposite.</description>

      <title>An intense geomagnetic storm originated from stealth Coronal Mass Ejection: remote and $in situ$ observations by near radially aligned spacecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the solar origin and heliospheric evolution of an intense geomagnetic storm that occurred on March 23-24, 2023. Despite multiple candidate CMEs observed between March 19-21, a weak CME detected on March 19 at 18:00 UT was identified as the cause, originating from the eruption of a longitudinal-filament channel near center of the sun. The channel underwent a smooth transition to eruption phase without detectable low coronal signatures. Wide-angle heliospheric imaging revealed asymmetric expansion and acceleration by solar wind drag, achieving an average CME velocity of $\approx$640 km/s. The radial evolution of the interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) was analyzed by three spacecraft in close radial alignment. Arrival times and propagation speeds were consistent across spacecraft, with a 21 hour delay between STEREO-A and WIND attributed to solar rotation and longitudinal separation. The ICME exhibits magnetic cloud (MC) signatures characterized by right-handed helicity, enhanced density at all three spacecraft. The MC underwent expansion (radial-size increases from 0.08AU at SolO to 0.18AU at STEREO-A), decrease in magnetic field strength with distance; $B_{av}\propto R_H^{-1.97}$ (SolO-STA) and $B_{av}\propto R_H^{-1.53}$ (SolO-WIND). The MC axis is inclined with the ecliptic at $-69^o$ at SolO, $-25^o$ at STA and $-34^o$ at WIND, indicating rotation during heliospheric transit. Importantly, the storm's main phase leads to a peak intensity ($SYM-H=-169$nT) occurring at 24/02:40UT followed by a second peak ($SYM-H=-170$nT) at 24/05:20UT due to density enhancement towards MC's tail. The study emphasizes the significant geoeffectiveness of weak, stealth CMEs with southward Bz and density enhancements.</description>

      <title>Extraction of neutron-capture cross sections on $^{92}$Zr using the charge-exchange Oslo method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $^{93}$Nb($t$,$^{3}$He) reaction at 115 MeV/u was studied to demonstrate that nuclear level densities and $\gamma$-ray strength functions can be extracted from charge-exchange reactions at intermediate energies using the Oslo technique. The matrix of excitation energy in $^{93}$Zr, reconstructed from the ($t$,$^{3}$He) reaction, versus the energy of $\gamma$ rays emitted by the excited $^{93}$Zr nuclei, was obtained in an experiment with the S800 Spectrograph operated in coincidence with the GRETINA $\gamma$-ray detector. The extracted level density and $\gamma$-ray strength function obtained by applying the Oslo method to this matrix were used to estimate the $^{92}$Zr($n$,$\gamma$)$^{93}$Zr cross section by combining the new results with other experimental data and theoretical calculations for $E$1 and $M$1 strength functions at higher energies. Good agreement with direct measurements of the $^{92}$Zr($n$,$\gamma$)$^{93}$Zr cross section was found. The contribution from the upbend in the extracted $\gamma$-ray strength function was important to achieve the consistency as the neutron-capture cross section without this contribution is significantly below the direct measurements otherwise. Since charge-exchange reactions at intermediate energies have long been used for extracting Gamow-Teller strengths, the successful demonstration of the charge-exchange Oslo method enables experiments in which ($n$,$\gamma$) cross sections and Gamow-Teller strengths can be measured simultaneously, which is of benefit for astrophysical studies.</description>

      <title>FLARE-SSM: Deep State Space Models with Influence-Balanced Loss for 72-Hour Solar Flare Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and reliable solar flare predictions are essential to mitigate potential impacts on critical infrastructure. However, the current performance of solar flare forecasting is insufficient. In this study, we address the task of predicting the class of the largest solar flare expected to occur within the next 72 hours. Existing methods often fail to adequately address the severe class imbalance across flare classes. To address this issue, we propose a solar flare prediction model based on multiple deep state space models. In addition, we introduce the frequency &amp; local-boundary-aware reliability loss (FLARE loss) to improve predictive performance and reliability under class imbalance. Experiments were conducted on a multi-wavelength solar image dataset covering a full 11-year solar activity cycle. As a result, our method outperformed baseline approaches in terms of both the Gandin-Murphy-Gerrity score and the true skill statistic, which are standard metrics in terms of the performance and reliability.</description>

      <title>A four-planet system orbiting the old thick disk star TOI-1203</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TOI-1203 is a bright (V=8.6) G3 V star known to host a transiting warm sub-Neptune on a 25.5 d orbit. Here we report on an intensive high-precision radial velocity and photometric follow-up campaign carried out with the HARPS spectrograph and the CHEOPS space telescope. We found that TOI-1203 has an enhancement of $\alpha$ elements relative to iron of [$\alpha$/Fe]=$0.21\pm0.04$. With an age of $\sim$12.5 Gyr, TOI-1203 belongs to the old, $\alpha$-element enhanced stellar population of the galactic thick disk. We spectroscopically confirmed the planetary nature of the 25.5 d sub-Neptune TOI-1203 d, measured its mass ($M_{d}=7.39\pm0.62~M_{\oplus}$) and refined its radius ($R_{d}=2.918_{-0.045}^{+0.046}~R_{\oplus}$). We discovered the presence of an additional transiting super-Earth on a 4.2 d orbit (TOI-1203 b) with a mass of $M_{b}=3.51_{-0.32}^{+0.33}~M_{\oplus}$ and a radius of $R_{b}=1.520_{-0.046}^{+0.045}~R_{\oplus}$. We also revealed the presence of two additional low-mass planets at 13.1 d and 204.6 d (TOI-1203 c and e), with minimum masses of $5.46_{-0.50}^{+0.51}~M_{\oplus}$ and $42.10_{-1.78}^{+1.83}~M_{\oplus}$. We found that the outer planet TOI-1203 e lies on an eccentric orbit with $e_{e}=0.152\pm0.029$. We performed a stability analysis of the system confirming that there are configurations consistent with the observed parameters that are dynamically stable over billion-year timescales. While analyzing the HARPS time series, we discovered that the FWHM of the HARPS cross-correlation function shows a significant long-period signal ($\sim$615 d) that has no counterpart in the radial velocity data or in the remaining HARPS ancillary time series. We significantly detected the same signal in the FWHM of the Th-Ar calibration lines used to compute the nightly wavelength solution, and attributed this systematic effect to a long-term variation of the HARPS instrumental profile.</description>

      <title>UV-irradiated outflows from low-mass protostars in Ophiuchus with JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main accretion phase of protostars is characterized by the ejection of material in the form of jets/outflows. External UV irradiation can potentially have a significant impact on the excitation conditions within these outflows. High-resolution observations in the mid-infrared allow us to investigate the details of those energetic processes through the emission of shock-excited H$_2$ . Our aim is to spatially resolve H$_2$ and ionic/atomic emission within the outflows of low-mass protostars, and investigate its origin in connection to shocks influenced by external ultraviolet irradiation. We analyze spectral maps of 5 Class I protostars in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI/MRS). Four out of five protostars show strong H$_2$, [\ion{Ne}{II}], and [\ion{Fe}{II}] emission associated with outflows/jets. Pure rotational H$_2$ transitions from S(1) to S(8) are found and show two distinct temperature components on Boltzmann diagrams with rotational temperatures of $\sim$500-600 K and $\sim$1000-3000 K respectively. Both $C$-type shocks propagating at high pre-shock densities (n$_\text{H} \ge$10$^4$ cm$^{-3}$) and $J$-type shocks at low pre-shock densities (n$_\text{H} \le$10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$) reproduce the observed line ratios. However, only $C$-type shocks produce sufficiently high column densities of H$_2$, whereas predictions from a single $J$-type shock reproduce the observed rotational temperatures of the gas better. A combination of various types of shocks could play a role in protostellar outflows as long as UV irradiation is included in the models. The origin of this radiation is likely internal, since no significant differences in the excitation conditions of outflows are seen at various locations in the cloud.</description>

      <title>The frequency-independent radio luminosity -- orbital/rotational period relation of RS CVn stars</title>

Abstract: Radio emissions from RS CVn objects exhibit distinct characteristics at low and high frequencies, widely attributed to differing radiation mechanisms. The disparate processes of high-frequency gyrosynchrotron and low-frequency electron cyclotron maser emissions have traditionally suggested an absence of correlation in their radio luminosities. Our study presents a frequency-independent linear correlation between radio luminosity ($L_R$) and orbital/rotational periods ($P$) in RS CVn binaries. Analyzing the Sydney Radio Star Catalogue (SRSC) data, we derived orbital periods for 42 of 60 RS CVn sources using TESS light curves, revealing a strong positive correlation (PCC = 0.698, $P$ = 3.95e-7) between $\log_{10}L_R$ and $\log_{10}P$. This correlation remains across frequencies from 144-3000 MHz, showing uniform luminosity behavior. By combining light curve analysis with stellar mass-radius-luminosity relationships, we calculated parameters like binary mass, primary/secondary mass, Rossby number, and binary separation for eight RS CVn systems. The results show a notable correlation between radio luminosity and binary mass, primary mass, and separation (PCC = 0.663, 0.663, 0.719), with separation showing the strongest correlation. This suggests the radio emission may largely originate from the binary components' interaction, challenging existing models of RS CVn radio emission mechanisms and offering insights into the individual versus collective origins of these emissions.</description>

      <title>Inner crust of neutron stars: Polymorphism and superconductivity in the liquid drop model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the liquid drop model built up with the nuclear interaction parametrization Sk$\chi$450, which is based on the chiral effective field theory, we calculate numerically the internal energy density for each of nuclear pasta phases and for the uniform nuclear matter. We provide quantitative arguments in favor of coexistence of various nuclear matter phases at a significant range of total pressure within the inner crust of neutron stars, a concept known as crystal polymorphism. Specifically, we find that differences of the internal energy per baryon for various phases are typically less than the thermal energy per a freedom degree at temperature about $10^8$--$10^9$ K, which sets the energetic scale for thermal fluctuations of state of Fermi liquid from the ground state. The nuclear energy contributions are described using the same parametrization Sk$\chi$450 for the bulk, plain surface and curvature terms. We find that the introduction of the curvature correction changes the ground state in a relevant way. This may be understood as a consequence of the corresponding change in size of the nucleus, which significantly modifies the phase transition densities. Using the calculated structural parameters from liquid drop model, we explore the physical consequences of the expected Cooper pairing of protons in lasagna phase. In this case, we find a crossover between the discreet layered and the three-dimensional anisotropic regimes of superconductivity. Additionally, we study the magnetic stress in lasagna accounting for a rotational lag between superfluid neutrons and the crystal lattice, which is believed to develop naturally in pulsars and magnetars. Our results offer a preliminary insight into rich magnetic properties of the inner crust of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Pushing the limits of eccentricity in planet-disc interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19917v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modelling the gravitational interaction between an eccentric perturber and a differentially shearing gas disc is a longstanding problem with various astrophysical applications, ranging from the evolution of planetary systems to the migration of black holes embedded in AGN discs. Recent work has advanced a global, linear, modal approach for calculating the excited wake and the resulting feedback on the perturber's orbital evolution. In this work we perform a complementary suite of targeted hydrodynamic simulations to test this linear framework across a range of disc temperature and density profiles. In particular, we push from circular orbits to highly eccentric trajectories for which the perturber moves supersonically with respect to the background gas. We find remarkable agreement between our simulations and the linear methodology across a range of diagnostics -- lending support to the predicted wake morphologies, complex radial torque density profiles, and torque reversal phenomena, which occur when the eccentricity exceeds the local aspect ratio. In contrast, comparison with previous fitting functions exposes noticeable discrepancies, cautioning against their indiscriminate use in studies which explore a wide range of perturber eccentricities, in varied disc structures. Our simulations also probe the fundamentally nonlinear effects of shock induced angular momentum deposition and coorbital horseshoe drags, which exhibit clear variations with eccentricity. Finally, this careful comparison between linear theory and numerics provides a detailed benchmark for planet-disc interaction problems and therefore we have provided a repository of our linear calculations for use as a rigorous test of future numerical investigations.</description>

      <title>The NEID Earth Twin Survey. III. Survey Performance After Three Years on Sky</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.23704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NEID Earth Twin Survey (NETS) has been delivering a rich set of precise radial velocity (RV) measurements for 41 bright, nearby main sequence stars. Here, we describe the status of the survey after three years on sky and we present the full set of RV measurements and accompanying stellar activity indicators. We discuss intermediate survey diagnostics, including calibration of the known RV zero point offset introduced following the Contreras fire in 2022 and the identification of an undiagnosed and previously unknown zero point offset in 2021. An analysis of our data set using RVSearch demonstrates that for these target stars, NEID is independently sensitive to nearly all known planets with periods shorter than the NETS observing baseline. We also highlight a number of newly detected RV signals, which present exciting opportunities for future investigations.</description>

      <title>Detection of a septuple stellar system in formation via disk fragmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar multiple systems play a pivotal role in cluster dynamics and stellar evolution, leading to intense astronomical phenomena like X-ray binaries, gamma-ray bursts, Type Ia supernova, and stellar mergers, which are prime sources of gravitational waves. However, their origin remains poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of a septuple protostellar system embedded in a Keplerian disk within the high-mass star-forming region NGC\,6334IN, with close separations of 181-461 AU. The stability analysis reveals that the disk surrounding the septuple system is dynamically unstable, indicating that the septuple system formed via disk fragmentation. Previous studies have typically found only 2--3 members forming via disk fragmentation in both low- and high-mass star-forming regions. Our findings provide compelling observational evidence that the fragmentation of a gravitationally unstable disk is a viable mechanism for the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity, confirming what was previously only a theoretical concept. The results shed new light on the formation of extreme high-order multiplicity in cluster environments.</description>
