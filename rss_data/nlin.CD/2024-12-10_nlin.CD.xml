      <title>Isochronous and period-doubling diagrams for symplectic maps of the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05541v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symplectic mappings of the plane serve as key models for exploring the fundamental nature of complex behavior in nonlinear systems. Central to this exploration is the effective visualization of stability regimes, which enables the interpretation of how systems evolve under varying conditions. While the area-preserving quadratic H\'enon map has received significant theoretical attention, a comprehensive description of its mixed parameter-space dynamics remain lacking. This limitation arises from early attempts to reduce the full two-dimensional phase space to a one-dimensional projection, a simplification that resulted in the loss of important dynamical features. Consequently, there is a clear need for a more thorough understanding of the underlying qualitative aspects.
  This paper aims to address this gap by revisiting the foundational concepts of reversibility and associated symmetries, first explored in the early works of G.D. Birkhoff. We extend the original framework proposed by H\'enon by adding a period-doubling diagram to his isochronous diagram, which allows to represents the system's bifurcations and the groups of symmetric periodic orbits that emerge in typical bifurcations of the fixed point. A qualitative and quantitative explanation of the main features of the region of parameters with bounded motion is provided, along with the application of this technique to other symplectic mappings, including cases of multiple reversibility. Modern chaos indicators, such as the Reversibility Error Method and the Generalized Alignment Index, are employed to distinguish between various dynamical regimes in the mixed space of variables and parameters. These tools prove effective in differentiating regular and chaotic dynamics, as well as in identifying twistless orbits and their associated bifurcations.</description>

      <title>Absence of the breakdown of ferrodark solitons exhibiting a snake instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05351v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamical stability and real time dynamics of the two-types of ferrodark solitons (FDSs) which occur as topological magnetic domain walls in the easy-plane phase of a quasi-two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate. The type-I FDS has positive inertial mass and exhibits a single dynamical instability that generates in plane spin winding, causing polar-core spin vortex dipoles. The positive inertial mass leads to the elastic oscillations of the soliton under transverse perturbations. The type-II FDS has negative inertial mass and exhibits a snake instability and a spin-twist instability, with the latter involving the generation of out of plane spin winding. Distinct from the normal dynamics of negative mass solitons under long wave length transverse perturbations, the snake instability does not lead to the type-II FDS breaking down. Instead, segments of the type-II FDS convert to type-I and mass vortex dipoles are produced. The resulting hybridized-chain of the two soliton types and vortices exhibits complex 2D soliton dynamics at long times while the vortices remain confined and the topological structure of a magnetic domain wall is preserved.</description>
