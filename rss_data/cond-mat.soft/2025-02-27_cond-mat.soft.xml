      <title>Nonlinear contractile response of actomyosin active gels to control signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological systems tightly regulate their physiological state using control signals. This includes the actomyosin cytoskeleton, a contractile active gel that consumes chemical free energy to drive many examples of cellular mechanical behavior. Upstream regulatory pathways activate or inhibit actomyosin activity. However, the contractile response of the actomyosin cytoskeleton to control signals remains poorly characterized. Here we employ reconstituted actomyosin active gels and subject them to step and pulsatile activation inputs. We find evidence for a nonlinear impulse response, which we quantify via a transfer function $\delta \varepsilon / \delta g$ that relates input free-energy pulses $\delta g$ to output strain pulses $\delta \varepsilon$. We find a scaling relation $\delta \varepsilon / \delta g \sim g^{-0.3}$. The negative sign of the exponent represents a decreased effectiveness of a contracting gel in converting energy to strain. We ascribe nonlinearity in our system to a density-dependent mechanism, which contrasts strain-stiffening nonlinear responses to external stresses. Contractile response to control signals is an essential step toward understanding how information from mechanical signaling processes flow through actomyosin networks in living, and likely also synthetic, cells.</description>

      <title>Robust Prediction of Frictional Contact Network in Near-Jamming Suspensions Employing Deep Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The viscosity of the suspension consisting of fine particles dispersed in a Newtonian liquid diverges close to the jamming packing fraction. The contact microstructure in suspensions governs this macroscopic behavior in the vicinity of jamming through a frictional contact network (FCN). FCN is composed of mechanical load-bearing contacts that lead to the emergence of rigidity near the jamming transition. The stress transmission and network topology, in turn, depend sensitively on constraints on the relative motion of the particles. Despite their significance, predicting the FCN, especially close to jamming conditions, remains challenging due to experimental and computational impediments. This study introduces a cost-effective machine learning approach to predict the FCN using a graph neural network (GNN), which inherently captures hidden features and underlying patterns in dense suspension by mapping interparticle interactions. Employing a variation of GNN called the Deep Graph Convolutional Network (DeepGCN) trained on data-driven simulations, this study demonstrates robust generalization and extrapolation capabilities, accurately predicting FCNs in systems with divergent flow parameters and phase spaces, despite each being trained exclusively on a single condition. The study covers a wide range of phase space, from semi-dilute to jammed states, spanning transient to steady states, while systematically varying parameters such as shear stress (${\sigma}_{xy}$), packing fraction(${\phi}$) and sliding and rolling friction (${{\mu}_s, {\mu}_r}$). The results of this research pave the way for innovative transferable techniques in predicting the properties of particulate systems, offering new avenues for advancement in material science and related fields.</description>

      <title>Pinch-point Singularities in Stress-Stress Correlations Reveal Rigidity in Colloidal Gels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the spatial correlations of microscopic stresses in 2D model colloidal gels obtained in computer simulations can be quantitatively described by the predictions of a theory for emergent elasticity of pre-stressed solids (vector charge theory). By combining a rigidity analysis with the characterization provided by the stress correlations, we show that the theoretical predictions are able to distinguish rigid from floppy gels, and quantify that distinction in terms of the size of a pinch-point singularity emerging at large length scales, which, in the theory, directly derives from the constraints imposed by mechanical equilibrium on the internal forces. We also use the theoretical predictions to investigate the coupling between stress-transmission and rigidity, and we explore the possibility of a Debye-like screening mechanism that would modify the theory predictions below a characteristic length scale.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Crystalline Order from Glassy Behavior of Charged Rods at Very Low Salt Concentrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charged colloids can form ordered structures like Wigner crystals or glasses at very low concentrations due to long-range electrostatic repulsions. Here, we combine small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) and optical experiments with simulations to investigate the phase behavior of charged rodlike colloids across a wide range of salt concentrations and packing fractions. At ultra low ionic strength and packing fractions, we reveal both experimentally and numerically a direct transition from a nematic to a crystalline smectic-B phase, previously identified as a glass state. This transition, bypassing the smectic-A intermediate phase, results from minimizing Coulomb repulsion and maximizing entropic gains due to fluctuations in the crystalline structure. This demonstrates how long-range electrostatic repulsion significantly alters the phase behavior of rod-shaped particles and highlights its key-role in driving the self-organization of anisotropic particles.</description>

      <title>Machine learning short-ranged many-body interactions in colloidal systems using descriptors based on Voronoi cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) strategies are opening the door to faster computer simulations, allowing us to simulate more realistic colloidal systems. Since the interactions in colloidal systems are often highly many-body, stemming from e.g. depletion and steric interactions, one of the challenges for these algorithms is capturing the many-body nature of these interactions. In this paper, we introduce a new ML-based strategy for fitting many-body interactions in colloidal systems where the many-body interaction is highly local. To this end, we develop Voronoi-based descriptors for capturing the local environment and fit the effective potential using a simple neural network. To test this algorithm, we consider a simple two-dimensional model for a colloid-polymer mixture, where the colloid-colloid interaction and colloid-polymer interactions are hard-disk like, while the polymers themselves interact as ideal gas particles. We find that a Voronoi-based description is sufficient to accurately capture the many-body nature of this system. Moreover, we find that the Pearson correlation function alone is insufficient to determine the predictive power of the network emphasizing the importance of additional metrics when assessing the quality of ML-based potentials.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization to infer parameters in viscoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring viscoelasticity parameters is a key challenge that often leads to non-unique solutions when fitting rheological data. In this context, we propose a machine learning approach that utilizes Bayesian optimization for parameter inference during curve-fitting processes. To fit a viscoelastic model to rheological data, the Bayesian optimization maps the parameter values to a given error function. It then exploits the mapped space to identify parameter combinations that minimize the error. We compare the Bayesian optimization results to traditional fitting routines and demonstrate that our approach finds the fitting parameters in a less or similar number of iterations. Furthermore, it also creates a "white-box" and supervised framework for parameter estimation in linear viscoelasticity modeling.</description>

      <title>Embodying mechano-fluidic memory in soft machines to program behaviors upon interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft machines display shape adaptation to external circumstances due to their intrinsic compliance. To achieve increasingly more responsive behaviors upon interactions without relying on centralized computation, embodying memory directly in the machines' structure is crucial. Here, we harness the bistability of elastic shells to alter the fluidic properties of an enclosed cavity, thereby switching between stable frequency states of a locomoting self-oscillating machine. To program these memory states upon interactions, we develop fluidic circuits surrounding the bistable shell, with soft tubes that kink and unkink when externally touched. We implement circuits for both long-term and short-term memory in a soft machine that switches behaviors in response to a human user and that autonomously changes direction after detecting a wall. By harnessing only geometry and elasticity, embodying memory allows physical structures without a central brain to exhibit autonomous feats that are typically reserved for computer-based robotic systems.</description>

      <title>Time-Reversal Mirror inside a granular suspension: a way of measuring the ultrasound diffusion coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the diffusion coefficient, $D$, for ultrasound propagating in a multiple scattering medium, such as a dense granular suspension, can be measured using a time reversal experiment. This requires an unprecedented experimental setup in which a piezoelectric transducer, acting as a Time-Reversal Mirror (TRM), is embedded within the granular suspension at a depth much larger than the scattering mean free path, while an array of transducers is placed in the far field of the scattering sample. A single element of the array emits a short pulse and the TRM records the resulting ultrasonic field, which consists of a ballistic coherent wave followed by a coda wave. When the entire coda wave is time-reversed and re-emitted from the TRM, it is observed to refocus on the original source, with a focal spot size that decreases with the inverse depth of the TRM, characteristic of a diffusive regime. Time-reversal of short windows selected at different times $t$ in the coda wave reveals a focal spot size that decreases as the inverse square root of time, i.e., $1 / \sqrt{Dt}$. By fitting the predictions of a microscopic diffusion theory to our experimental data, we are able to accurately measure the diffusion coefficient in the granular suspension. Remarkably, this method does not require ensemble averaging due to stability of time-reversal against statistical fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Light-Emitting Microfibers from Lotus Root for Eco-friendly Optical Waveguides and Biosensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical biosensors based on micro-/nano-fibers are highly valuable for probing and monitoring liquid environments and bioactivity. Most of current optical biosensors, however, are still based on glass, semiconductors, or metallic materials, which might be not fully suited for biologically-relevant environments. Here, we introduce biocompatible and flexible microfibers from Lotus silk as micro-environmental monitors that exhibit waveguiding of intrinsic fluorescence as well as of coupled light. These features make single-filament monitors excellent building blocks for a variety of sensing functions, including pH-probing and detection of bacterial activity. These results pave the way for the development of new and entirely eco-friendly, potentially multiplexed biosensing platforms.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Efficiency in Shear-Loaded Brownian Gyrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Brownian gyrator is a system in which a particle experiences thermal noise from two distinct heat baths. This nonequilibrium setup inherently generates a nonzero torque, leading to gyrating motion around a potential energy minimum. As a minimal model for a heat engine, the Brownian gyrator provides valuable insights into energy conversion and nonequilibrium dynamics. Here, we investigate the effect of an externally imposed shear flow on a Brownian gyrator, treating it as a mechanical load. The shear flow introduces a tunable mechanism that allows the system to operate either as a heat engine, extracting work from the temperature gradient, or as a refrigerator, transferring heat from the colder to the hotter bath. Focusing on the heat engine regime, we analytically derive the steady-state probability distribution to compute the average torque exerted by the gyrator and quantify the mechanical power extracted from the shear. Our results show a remarkable increase in efficiency compared to the standard Brownian gyrator without shear, approaching Carnot efficiency at maximum power. Surprisingly, we also find that while the system can operate efficiently as a heat engine, it may become unstable before reaching the stall condition, highlighting a fundamental trade-off between efficiency and stability in shear-driven microscopic engines.</description>

      <title>U-Net 3+ for Anomalous Diffusion Analysis enhanced with Mixture Estimates (U-AnD-ME) in particle-tracking data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biophysical processes within living systems rely on encounters and interactions between molecules in complex environments such as cells. They are often described by anomalous diffusion transport. Recent advances in single-molecule microscopy and particle-tracking techniques have yielded an abundance of data in the form of videos and trajectories that contain critical information about these biologically significant processes. However, standard approaches for characterizing anomalous diffusion from these measurements often struggle in cases of practical interest, e.g. due to short, noisy trajectories. Fully exploiting this data therefore requires the development of advanced analysis methods -- a core goal at the heart of the recent international Anomalous Diffusion Challenges. Here, we introduce a novel machine-learning framework, U-net 3+ for Anomalous Diffusion analysis enhanced with Mixture Estimates (U-AnD-ME), that applies a U-Net 3+ based neural network alongside Gaussian mixture models to enable highly accurate characterisation of single-particle tracking data. In the 2024 Anomalous Diffusion Challenge, U-AnD-ME outperformed all other participating methods for the analysis of two-dimensional anomalous diffusion trajectories at both single-trajectory and ensemble levels. Using a large dataset inspired by the Challenge, we further characterize the performance of U-AnD-ME in segmenting trajectories and inferring anomalous diffusion properties.</description>

      <title>Micellization in active matter of asymmetric self-propelled particles: Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active matter composed of self-propelled particles features fascinating self-organization phenomena, spanning from motility-induced phase separation to phototaxis to topological excitations depending on the nature and parameters of the system. In the present paper, we consider micelle formation by active particles with a broken symmetry having a circular back and a sharpened nose toward which the particles accelerate. As we demonstrate in experiments with robotic swarms, such particles can either remain in the isotropic phase or form micelles depending on the location of their center of inertia, in accordance with a recent theoretical proposal [T. Kruglov, A. Borisov, Particles 2021, 2 (2021)]. Such a behavior is observed for both non-chiral particles moving linearly and placed in a parabolic potential and for chiral particles moving along circular trajectories on a flat surface. By performing experiments with single robots and two-robot collisions, we unveil that the observed emergence of micellization associated with shifting robots' center of inertia towards their noses is governed by at least two-particle effects, in particular, by a difference in the formation of stable two-robot clusters. Finally, we consider the dependence of micelle lifetime and formation probability as well as two-robot collisions on friction between the lateral surfaces of the robots. Crucially, the predicted micellization does not involve any solvation shells that give rise to the micellization of surfactants but is instead driven by an interplay of activity and particle shape asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Shape of a membrane on a liquid interface with arbitrary curvatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the deformation of a liquid interface with arbitrary principal curvatures by a flat circular sheet. We use the membrane limit, where the sheet is inextensible yet free to bend and compress, and restrict ourselves to small slopes. We find that the sheet takes a cylindrical shape on interfaces with negative Gaussian curvature. On interfaces with positive Gaussian curvature, an inner region still adopts a cylindrical shape while the outer region is under azimuthal compression. Our predictions are confirmed by numerical energy minimization. Finally, we compute the energy of placing the sheet on the curved interface and find that it is much lower for positive Gaussian curvatures than for negative ones, that is, peaks and valleys are covered more efficiently than saddles.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion at various length scales with hydrodynamic and direct interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brownian motion is essential for describing diffusion in systems ranging from simple to complex liquids. Unlike simple liquids, which consist of only a solvent, complex liquids, such as colloidal suspensions or the cytoplasm of a cell, are mixtures of various constituents with different shapes and sizes. Describing Brownian motion in such multiscale systems is extremely challenging because direct and many-body hydrodynamic interactions (and their interplay) play a pivotal role. Diffusion of small particles is mainly governed by a low viscous character of the solution, whereas large particles experience a highly viscous flow of the complex liquid on the macro scale. A quantity that encodes hydrodynamics on both length scales is the wave-vector-dependent viscosity. Assuming this quantity to be known -- in contrast to most studies in which the solvent shear viscosity is given -- provides a new perspective on studying the diffusivity of a tracer, especially in situations where the tracer size can vary by several orders of magnitude. Here, we start systematic studies of exact formal microscopic expressions for the short- and long-time self-diffusion coefficients of a single probe particle in a complex liquid in terms of short-ranged hydrodynamic response kernels. We study Brownian motion as a function of the probe size, contrasting most theories that focus on self-diffusion as a function of the crowder volume fraction. We discuss the limits of small and large probe sizes for various levels of approximations in our theory, and discuss the current successes and shortcomings of our approach.</description>
