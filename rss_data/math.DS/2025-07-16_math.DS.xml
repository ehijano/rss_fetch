      <title>Normal Hyperbolicity in Secondary Hopf Bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We combine results available in the literature to prove that the torus emerging in a secondary Hopf bifurcation is normally hyperbolic. This result is then applied to establish sufficient conditions for the bifurcation of normally hyperbolic invariant tori in the extended phase space of systems with small time-periodic perturbations via an application of the averaging method.</description>

      <title>Universality in computable dynamical systems: Old and new</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relationship between computational models and dynamics has captivated mathematicians and computer scientists since the earliest conceptualizations of computation. Recently, this connection has gained renewed attention, fueled by T. Tao's programme aiming to discover blowing-up solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations using an embedded computational model. In this survey paper, we review some of the recent works that introduce novel and exciting perspectives on the representation of computability through dynamical systems. Starting from dynamical universality in a classical sense, we shall explore the modern notions of Turing universality in fluid dynamics and Topological Kleene Field Theories as a systematic way of representing computable functions by means of dynamical bordisms. Finally, we will discuss some important open problems in the area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide extensions of the $\lambda$-Lemma (also known as Inclination Lemma) for piecewise smooth vector fields and maps. In order to achieve our main result, we investigate the regularity of time-T-maps of piecewise smooth vector fields defined at crossing orbits. We prove that these maps are homeomorphisms and also piecewise smooth diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimensions of Beatty multiple shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the Beatty multiple shift is introduced, which is a generalization of the multiplicative shift of finite type (multiple SFT) [Kenyon, Peres and Solomyak, Ergodic Theory and Dynamical Systems, 2012] and the affine multiple shift [Ban, Hu, Lai and Liao, Advances in Mathematics, 2025]. The Hausdorff and Minkowski dimension formulas are obtained, and the coefficients of the formula is closely related to the classical disjoint covering of the positive integers in number theory.</description>

      <title>Entropy Flexibility of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by Katok's intermediate entropy property [Inst. Hautes \'Etudes Sci. Publ. Math. 51 (1980), 137-173], we introduce and study the notion of entropy flexibility for discrete-time and continuous-time dynamical systems. By using renewal systems techniques, we show that this property is present in several classes of systems where any intermediate value of entropy can be attained on a strictly ergodic sub-system. In addition, we prove an entropy flexibility analogue of Katok's conjecture: Entropy flexibility is a typical property for vector fields on 3-manifolds and surface diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional statistics for finite orbits of generalised continued fractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We statistically compare the relationships between frequencies of digits in continued fraction expansions of typical rational points in the unit interval and higher dimensional generalisations. This takes the form of a Large Deviation and Central Limit Theorem, including multidimensional results for random vectors. These results apply to classical multidimensional continued fraction transformations including Brun's algorithm and the Jacobi--Perron algorithm, and more generally for maps satisfying mild contraction hypothesis on the inverse branches. We prove in particular that the finite trajectories capture the generic ergodic behaviour of infinite trajectories.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Joint Spectral Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a nonlinear extension of the joint spectral radius (JSR) for switched discrete-time dynamical systems governed by sub-homogeneous and order-preserving maps acting on cones. We show that this nonlinear JSR characterizes both the asymptotic stability of the system and the divergence or convergence rate of trajectories originating from different points within the cone. Our analysis establishes upper and lower bounds on the nonlinear JSR of a sub-homogeneous family via the JSRs of two associated homogeneous families obtained through asymptotic scaling. In the homogeneous case, we develop a dual formulation of the JSR and investigate the equality between the joint spectral radius and the generalized joint spectral radius, extending classical results from linear theory to the nonlinear setting. We also propose a polytopal-type algorithm to approximate the nonlinear JSR and provide conditions ensuring its finite-time convergence. The proposed framework is motivated by applications such as the analysis of deep neural networks, which can be modeled as switched systems with structured nonlinear layers. Our results offer new theoretical tools for studying the stability, robustness, and convergence behavior of such models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The escaping set of an entire function consists of the points in the complex plane that tend to infinity under iteration. This set plays a central role in the dynamics of transcendental entire functions. The goal of this survey is to explain this role, to summarise some of the main results in the area, and to identify a number of open questions.</description>

      <title>Morse decomposition for semi-dynamical systems with an application to systems of state-dependent delay differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the structure of the global attractor is crucial in the field of dynamical systems, where Morse decompositions provide a powerful tool by partitioning the attractor into finitely many invariant Morse sets and gradient-like connecting orbits. Building on Mallet-Paret's pioneering use of discrete Lyapunov functions for constructing Morse decompositions in delay differential equations, similar approaches have been extended to various delay systems, also including state-dependent delays. In this paper, we develop a unified framework assuming the existence and some properties of a discrete Lyapunov function for a semi-dynamical system on an arbitrary metric space, and construct a Morse decomposition of the global attractor in this general setting. We demonstrate that our findings generalize previous results; moreover, we apply our theorem to a cyclic system of differential equations with threshold-type state-dependent delay.</description>

      <title>Conditioned random walks on linear groups II: local limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05897v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate random walks on the general linear group constrained within a specific domain, with a focus on their asymptotic behavior. In a previous work [38], we constructed the associated harmonic measure, a key element in formulating the local limit theorem for conditioned random walks on groups. The primary aim of this paper is to prove this theorem. The main challenge arises from studying the conditioned reverse walk, whose increments, in the context of random walks on groups, depend on the entire future. To achieve our goal, we combine a Caravenna-type conditioned local limit theorem with the conditioned version of the central limit theorem for the reversed walk. The resulting local limit theorem is then applied to derive the local behavior of the exit time.</description>

      <title>Making rare events typical in $d$-dimensional chaotic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the deterministic nature of chaotic systems, fluctuations in their trajectories arise solely from the choice of initial conditions. Some of these dynamical fluctuations may lead to extremely unlikely scenarios. Understanding the impact of such rare events and the trajectories that give rise to them is of significant interest across disciplines. Yet, identifying the initial conditions responsible for those events is a challenging task due to the inherent sensitivity to small perturbations of chaotic dynamics. In a recent paper [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 227201 (2023)], this challenge was addressed by finding the effective dynamics that make rare events typical for one-dimensional chaotic maps. Here we extend such large-deviation framework to $d$-dimensional chaotic maps. Specifically, for any such map, we propose a method to find an effective topologically-conjugate map which reproduces the rare-event statistics in the long-time limit. We demonstrate the applicability of this result using several observables of paradigmatic examples of two-dimensional chaos, namely the two-dimensional tent map and Arnold's cat map.</description>

      <title>Invariant measures on moduli spaces of twisted holomorphic 1-forms and strata of dilation surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The moduli space of twisted holomorphic 1-forms on Riemann surfaces, equivalently dilation surfaces with scaling, admits a stratification and GL(2,R)-action as in the case of moduli spaces of translation surfaces. We produce an analogue of Masur-Veech measure, i.e. an SL(2,R)-invariant Lebesgue class measure on strata or explicit covers thereof. This relies on a novel computation of cohomology with coefficients for the mapping class group. The computation produces a framed mapping class group invariant measure on representation varieties that naturally appear as the codomains of the periods maps that coordinatize strata.</description>

      <title>Learning from Imperfect Data: Robust Inference of Dynamic Systems using Simulation-based Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: System inference for nonlinear dynamic models, represented by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), remains a significant challenge in many fields, particularly when the data are noisy, sparse, or partially observable. In this paper, we propose a Simulation-based Generative Model for Imperfect Data (SiGMoID) that enables precise and robust inference for dynamic systems. The proposed approach integrates two key methods: (1) physics-informed neural networks with hyper-networks that constructs an ODE solver, and (2) Wasserstein generative adversarial networks that estimates ODE parameters by effectively capturing noisy data distributions. We demonstrate that SiGMoID quantifies data noise, estimates system parameters, and infers unobserved system components. Its effectiveness is validated validated through realistic experimental examples, showcasing its broad applicability in various domains, from scientific research to engineered systems, and enabling the discovery of full system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Closed Form Time Derivatives of the Equations of Motion of Rigid Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Derivatives of equations of motion(EOM) describing the dynamics of rigid body systems are becoming increasingly relevant for the robotics community and find many applications in design and control of robotic systems. Controlling robots, and multibody systems comprising elastic components in particular, not only requires smooth trajectories but also the time derivatives of the control forces/torques, hence of the EOM. This paper presents the time derivatives of the EOM in closed form up to second-order as an alternative formulation to the existing recursive algorithms for this purpose, which provides a direct insight into the structure of the derivatives. The Lie group formulation for rigid body systems is used giving rise to very compact and easily parameterized equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New recursive least squares algorithms with rank two updates (RLSR2) that include both exponential and instantaneous forgetting (implemented via a proper choice of the forgetting factor and the window size) are introduced and systematically associated in this report with well-known RLS algorithms with rank one updates. Moreover, new properties (which can be used for further performance improvement) of the recursive algorithms associated with the convergence of the inverse of information matrix and parameter vector are established in this report. The performance of new algorithms is examined in the problem of estimation of the grid events in the presence of significant harmonic emissions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct analytic symplectomorphisms of the cylinder or the sphere with zero or exactly two periodic points and which are not conjugated to a rotation. In the case of the cylinder, we show that these symplectomorphisms can be chosen ergodic or to the contrary with local emergence of maximal order. In particular, this disproves a conjecture of Birkhoff (1941) and solve a problem of Herman (1998). One aspect of the proof provides a new approximation theorem, it enables in particular to implement the Anosov-Katok scheme in new analytic settings.</description>

      <title>Strong primeness for equivalence relations arising from Zariski dense subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that orbit equivalence relations arising from essentially free ergodic probability measure preserving actions of Zariski dense discrete subgroups of simple algebraic groups are strongly prime. As a consequence, we prove the existence and the uniqueness of a prime factorization for orbit equivalence relations arising from direct products of higher rank lattices. This extends and strengthens Zimmer's primeness result for equivalence relations arising from actions of lattices in simple Lie groups. The proof of our main result relies on a combination of ergodic theory of algebraic group actions and Popa's intertwining theory for equivalence relations.</description>

Abstract: We treat three cubic recurrences, two of which generalize the famous iterated map $x \mapsto x (1-x)$ from discrete chaos theory. A feature of each asymptotic series developed here is a constant, dependent on the initial condition but otherwise intrinsic to the function at hand.</description>

      <title>Fractal tiles induced by tent maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present article we introduce geometrical objects induced by the tent maps associated with special Pisot numbers that we call tent-tiles. They are compact subsets of the one-, two-, or three-dimensional Euclidean space, depending on the particular special Pisot number. Most of the tent-tiles have a fractal shape and we study the Hausdorff dimension of their boundary. Furthermore, we are concerned with tilings induced by tent-tiles. It turns out that tent-tiles give rise to two types of lattice tilings. In order to obtain these results we establish and exploit connections between tent-tiles and Rauzy fractals induced by substitutions and automorphisms of the free group.</description>

      <title>On qc compatibility of satellite copies of the Mandelbrot set: II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16195v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mandelbrot set is a fractal which classifies the behaviour of complex quadratic polynomials. Although its remarkably simple definition: $\mathcal{M}:=\{c \in \mathbb{C}\,|\,Q_c(0)^n \nrightarrow \infty \mbox{ as } n\rightarrow \infty, \mbox{ where } Q_c(z)=z^2+c\}$, it is a central object in complex dynamics, and it has been charming and intriguing since it has first been defined and drawn. A fascinating fact is the presence of little copies of the Mandelbrot set in the Mandelbrot set itself (and in many other parameter planes). There exist two different kinds of little copies of the Mandelbrot set within the Mandelbrot set: the primitive copies, visually similar to the Mandelbrot set, with a cusp at the root of the principal hyperbolic component, and the satellite copies, whose principal hyperbolic component has no cusp, i.e. has smooth boundary across the root point. Lyubich proved that the primitive copies of $\mathcal{M}$ satisfy a stronger regularity condition: they are quasiconformally homeomorphic to $\mathcal{M}$. The satellite copies are homeomorphic to $\mathcal{M}$, but the homeomorphism is only quasiconformal outside neighbourhoods of the root. The question that remained open was: are the satellite copies mutually quasiconformally homeomorphic? In a previous work, we showed that the satellite copies with rotation numbers with different denominators are not quasiconformally homeomorphic. Here we complete the picture, by showing that, for any $q$, the satellite copies $\mathcal{M}_{p/q}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{p'/q}$ of the Mandelbrot set $\mathcal{M}$ with rotation numbers with the same denominator $q$ are quasiconformal homeomorphic.</description>

      <title>A Garden of Eden theorem for Smale spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a dynamical system $(X,f)$ consisting of a compact metrizable space $X$ and a homeomorphism $f \colon X \to X$, an endomorphism of $(X,f)$ is a continuous map of $X$ into itself which commutes with $f$. One says that a dynamical system $(X,f)$ is surjunctive if every injective endomorphism of $(X,f)$ is surjective. An endomorphism of $(X,f)$ is called pre-injective if its restriction to each $f$-homoclinicity class of $X$ is injective. One says that a dynamical system has the Moore property if every surjective endomorphism of the system is pre-injective and that it has the Myhill property if every pre-injective endomorphism is surjective. One says that a dynamical system satisfies the Garden of Eden theorem if it has both the Moore and the Myhill properties. We prove that every irreducible Smale space satisfies the Garden of Eden theorem and that every non-wandering Smale space is surjunctive and has the Moore property.</description>

      <title>Operator algebraic characterization of the noncommutative Poisson boundary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain an operator algebraic characterization of the noncommutative Furstenberg-Poisson boundary $\operatorname{L}(\Gamma) \subset \operatorname{L}(\Gamma \curvearrowright B)$ associated with an admissible probability measure $\mu \in \operatorname{Prob}(\Gamma)$ for which the $(\Gamma, \mu)$-Furstenberg-Poisson boundary $(B, \nu_B)$ is uniquely $\mu$-stationary. This is a noncommutative generalization of Nevo-Sageev's structure theorem [NS11]. We apply this result in combination with previous works to provide further evidence towards Connes' rigidity conjecture for higher rank lattices.</description>

      <title>Entropy and determinants for unitary representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13751v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several notions of entropy have been studied widely in the ergodic theory of probability-preserving actions of countable groups. These include the generalization of Kolmogorov--Sinai entropy to amenable groups based on F{\o}lner sequences, percolative entropy for general countable groups, and Bowen's sofic entropy for sofic groups. In this work we pursue these notions across an analogy between ergodic theory and representation theory. We arrive at new quantities associated to unitary representations of groups and representations of other C*-algebras. Our main results show that these new quantities can often be evaluated as Fuglede--Kadison determinants. The resulting determinantal formulas offer various non-commutative generalizations of Szeg\H{o}'s limit theorem for Toeplitz determinants. They make contact with Arveson's theory of subdiagonal subalgebras, and also with some exact entropy calculations in the ergodic theory of actions by automorphisms of compact Abelian groups.</description>
