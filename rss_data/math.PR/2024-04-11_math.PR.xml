      <title>Small fluctuations for time-dependent spherical random fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider time-dependent space isotropic and time stationary spherical Gaussian random fields. We establish Chung's law of the iterated logarithm and solve the small probabilities problem. Our results depend on the high-frequency behaviour of the angular power spectrum: the speed of decay of the small ball probability is faster as either the memory parameter or the space-parameter decreases.</description>

Abstract: We derive explicitly the adapted $2$-Wasserstein distance between arbitrary non-degenerate Gaussian distributions on $\mathbb{R}^N$ and characterize the optimal bicausal coupling(s). This leads to an adapted version of the Bures-Wasserstein distance on the space of positive definite matrices.</description>

      <title>Relative entropy bounds for sampling with and without replacement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sharp, nonasymptotic bounds are obtained for the relative entropy between the distributions of sampling with and without replacement from an urn with balls of $c\geq 2$ colors. Our bounds are asymptotically tight in certain regimes and, unlike previous results, they depend on the number of balls of each colour in the urn. The connection of these results with finite de Finetti-style theorems is explored, and it is observed that a sampling bound due to Stam (1978) combined with the convexity of relative entropy yield a new finite de Finetti bound in relative entropy, which achieves the optimal asymptotic convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Brownian particles controlled by their occupation measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study a finite horizon linear-quadratic stochastic control problem for Brownian particles, where the cost functions depend on the state and the occupation measure of the particles. To address this problem, we develop an It\^o formula for the flow of occupation measure, which enables us to derive the associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Then, thanks to a Feynman-Kac formula and the Bou\'e-Dupuis formula, we construct an optimal strategy and an optimal trajectory. Finally, we illustrate our result when the cost-function is the volume of the sausage associated to the particles.</description>

      <title>Approximations of expectations under infinite product measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are given a bounded Borel-measurable real-valued function on a product of countably many Polish spaces, and a product probability measure. We are interested in points in the product space that can be used to approximate the expected value of this function. We define two notions. A point is called a weak $\epsilon$-approximation, where $\epsilon \geq 0$, if the Dirac measure on this point, except in finitely many coordinates where another measure can be taken, gives an expected value that is $\epsilon$-close to the original expected value. A point is called a strong $\epsilon$-approximation if the same holds under the restriction that in those finitely many coordinates the measure is equal to the original one. We prove that both the set of weak 0-approximation points and the set of strong $\epsilon$-approximation points, for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, have measure 1 under the original measure. Finally, we provide two applications: (i) in Game Theory on the minmax guarantee levels of the players in games with infinitely many players, and (ii) in Decision Theory on the set of feasible expected payoffs in infinite duration problems.</description>

Abstract: These notes expound the recent use of the signature transform and rough path theory in data science and machine learning. We develop the core theory of the signature from first principles and then survey some recent popular applications of this approach, including signature-based kernel methods and neural rough differential equations.

      <title>Quadratically Regularized Optimal Transport: Existence and Multiplicity of Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimal transport problem with quadratic regularization is useful when sparse couplings are desired. The density of the optimal coupling is described by two functions called potentials; equivalently, potentials can be defined as a solution of the dual problem. We prove the existence of potentials for a general square-integrable cost. Potentials are not necessarily unique, a phenomenon directly related to sparsity of the optimal support. For discrete problems, we describe the family of all potentials based on the connected components of the support, for a graph-theoretic notion of connectedness. On the other hand, we show that continuous problems have unique potentials under standard regularity assumptions, regardless of sparsity. Using potentials, we prove that the optimal support is indeed sparse for small regularization parameter in a continuous setting with quadratic cost, which seems to be the first theoretical guarantee for sparsity in this context.</description>

      <title>On weighted failure rate, its means and associated quantile version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we define weighted failure rate and their different means from the stand point of an application. We begin by emphasizing that the formation of n independent component series system having weighted failure rates with sum of weight functions being unity is same as a mixture of n distributions. We derive some parametric and non-parametric characterization results. We discuss on the form invariance property of baseline failure rate for a specific choice of weight function. Some bounds on means of aging functions are obtained. Here, we establish that weighted IFRA class is not closed under formation of coherent systems unlike the IFRA class. An interesting application of the present work is credited to the fact that the quantile version of means of failure rate is obtained as a special case of weighted means of failure rate.</description>

      <title>Zero-one Laws for a Control Problem with Random Action Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many control problems there is only limited information about the actions that will be available at future stages. We introduce a framework where the Controller chooses actions $a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots$, one at a time. Her goal is to maximize the probability that the infinite sequence $(a_{0}, a_{1}, \ldots)$ is an element of a given subset $G$ of $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$. The set $G$, called the goal, is assumed to be a Borel tail set. The Controller's choices are restricted: having taken a sequence $h_{t} = (a_{0}, \ldots, a_{t-1})$ of actions prior to stage $t \in \mathbb{N}$, she must choose an action $a_{t}$ at stage $t$ from a non-empty, finite subset $A(h_{t})$ of $\mathbb{N}$. The set $A(h_{t})$ is chosen from a distribution $p_{t}$, independently over all $t \in \mathbb{N}$ and all $h_{t} \in \mathbb{N}^{t}$. We consider several information structures defined by how far ahead into the future the Controller knows what actions will be available.
  In the special case where all the action sets are singletons (and thus the Controller is a dummy), Kolmogorov's 0-1 law says that the probability for the goal to be reached is 0 or 1. We construct a number of counterexamples to show that in general the value of the control problem can be strictly between 0 and 1, and derive several sufficient conditions for the 0-1 ``law" to hold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of Schatten classes has a long tradition in geometric functional analysis and related fields. In this paper we study a variety of geometric and probabilistic aspects of finite-dimensional Schatten classes of not necessarily square matrices. Among the main results are the exact and asymptotic volume of the Schatten-$\infty$ unit ball, the boundedness of its isotropy constant, a Poincar\'e-Maxwell-Borel lemma for the uniform distribution on the Schatten-$\infty$ ball, and Sanov-type large deviations principles for the singular values of matrices sampled uniformly from the Schatten-$p$ unit ball for any $0 &lt; p \leq \infty$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic normality of degree counts in a general preferential attachment model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2102.07570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the preferential attachment model. This is a growing random graph such that at each step a new vertex is added and forms $m$ connections. The neighbors of the new vertex are chosen at random with probability proportional to their degree. It is well known that the proportion of nodes with a given degree at step $n$ converges to a constant as $n\rightarrow\infty$. The goal of this paper is to investigate the asymptotic distribution of the fluctuations around this limiting value. We prove a central limit theorem for the joint distribution of all degree counts. In particular, we give an explicit expression for the asymptotic covariance. This expression is rather complex, so we compute it numerically for various parameter choices. We also use numerical simulations to argue that the convergence is quite fast. The proof relies on the careful construction of an appropriate martingale.</description>

      <title>Horizontal $\Delta$-semimartingales on orthonormal frame bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.04824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we deal with stochastic horizontal lifts and anti-developments of semimartingales with jumps on complete and connected Riemannian manifolds without any assumption for their curvatures. We prove two one-to-one correspondences among some classes of discontinuous semimartingales on Riemannian manifolds, orthonormal frame bundles and Euclidean spaces by using the stochastic differential geometry with jumps introduced by Cohen (1996). Both of these two results are extension of the one shown in Pontier-Estrade (1992). The first result is the correspondence in the case where jumps of semimartingales are regarded as initial velocities of geodesics which are not necessarily minimal. In the second result, we also established the correspondence in the situation where jumps of semimartingales are given by connection rules, but we impose the condition that the jumps of semimartingales are small. The latter result enables us to construct martingales for a given connection rule with small jumps on any compact manifold from local martingales on a Euclidean space through horizontal semimartingales on orthonormal semimartingales.</description>

Abstract: We use a version of the Skorokhod integral to give a simple and rigorous formulation of the Wick-ordered (stochastic) heat equation with planar white noise, representing the free energy of an undirected random polymer. The solution for all times is expressed as the L1 limit of a martingale given by the Feyman-Kac formula and defines a randomized shift, or Gaussian multiplicative chaos. The fluctuations far from the centre are shown to be given by the one-dimensional KPZ equation.</description>

Abstract: Exact recursion formulas for mixed moments of four fundamental random matrix ensembles are derived. The reason such recursive formulas are possible is closely related to properties of polygon gluings studied by Harer and Zagier as well as Akhmedov and Shakirov. The proofs of the formulas are direct and written in such a way that they do not rely on understanding of polygon gluings.</description>

      <title>Remarkable structures in integrable probability, I: max-independence structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse in a systematic way the occurrences of a remarkable structure in the theory of integrable probability that we call a ``max-independence structure'', when random variables are constructed as a maximum of a sequence of independent random variables.
  The list of treated examples contains~: the $ GU\!E $ and $ GO\!E $ Tracy-Widom distributions, the extreme eigenvalues/eigenangles of random hermitian/unitary matrices (and in particular the historical example of the $ GU\!E $ extreme eigenvalues), the Hopf-Cole solution to the $ KPZ $ equation with Dirac initial condition (continuum random polymer) and the symmetric Schur measure. %
  In this last case, the largest part of the underlying random partition is the maximum of an i.i.d randomisation of the deterministic sequence of negative integers. In the case of the $ GU\!E $ Tracy-Widom distribution, the laws of the random variables use a rescaling of the prolate hyperspheroidal wave functions that were introduced by Heurtley and Slepian in the context of circular optical mirrors, and in the case of the $ GU\!E $, the distributions use the sigma-form of the Painlev\'e $ I\!V $ equation.
  To illustrate the utility of such a structure, we rescale the largest eigenvalue of the $ GU\!E $ written as a maximum of $N$ independent random variables with the classical Poisson approximation for sums of indicators. We use for this the Okamoto-Noumi-Yamada theory of the sigma-form of the Painlev\'e equation applied to random matrix theory by Forrester-Witte. By doing so, we find a new expression for the cumulative distribution function of the $ GU\!E $ Tracy-Widom distribution which is shown to be equivalent to the classical one using manipulations \`a la Forrester-Witte.</description>

      <title>Quenched local limit theorem for random conductance models with long-range jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07212v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the quenched local limit theorem for reversible random walk on $\Z^d$ (with $d\ge 2$) among stationary ergodic random conductances that permit jumps of arbitrary length. The proof is based on the weak parabolic Harnack inequalities and on-diagonal heat-kernel estimates for long-range random walks on general ergodic environments. In particular, this partly solves \cite[Open Problem 2.7]{BCKW}, where the quenched invariance principle was obtained. As a byproduct, we prove the maximal inequality with an extra tail term for long-range reversible random walks, which in turn yields the everywhere sublinear property for the associated corrector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we give a local non-determinism condition applicable to general Volterra Ito processes that allow us to obtain the space-time regularity of the occupation measure and the self-intersection measure. For the particular case of solutions to a stochastic Volterra equation, we also obtain the regularity of the one-dimensional distributions and study the absolute continuity of the finite-dimensional distributions. Finally, based on the previously shown regularity of the self-intersection measure, we prove the existence, uniqueness and stability of Volterra equations with distributional drifts of "self-intersection" type in terms of corresponding nonlinear Young equations.</description>

      <title>Percolation on High-dimensional Product Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.03722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider percolation on high-dimensional product graphs, where the base graphs are regular and of bounded order. In the subcritical regime, we show that typically the largest component is of order logarithmic in the number of vertices. In the supercritical regime, our main result recovers the sharp asymptotic of the order of the largest component, and shows that all the other components are typically of order logarithmic in the number of vertices. In particular, we show that this phase transition is quantitatively similar to the one of the binomial random graph.
  This generalises the results of Ajtai, Koml\'os, and Szemer\'edi and of Bollob\'as, Kohayakawa, and \L{}uczak who showed that the $d$-dimensional hypercube, which is the $d$-fold Cartesian product of an edge, undergoes a phase transition quantitatively similar to the one of the binomial random graph.</description>

      <title>Expander graphs are globally synchronizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model is fundamental to the study of synchronization. It consists of a collection of oscillators with interactions given by a network, which we identify respectively with vertices and edges of a graph. In this paper, we show that a graph with sufficient expansion must be globally synchronizing, meaning that a homogeneous Kuramoto model of identical oscillators on such a graph will converge to the fully synchronized state with all the oscillators having the same phase, for every initial state up to a set of measure zero. In particular, we show that for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ and $p \geq (1 + \varepsilon) (\log n) / n$, the homogeneous Kuramoto model on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $G(n, p)$ is globally synchronizing with probability tending to one as $n$ goes to infinity. This improves on a previous result of Kassabov, Strogatz, and Townsend and solves a conjecture of Ling, Xu, and Bandeira. We also show that the model is globally synchronizing on any $d$-regular Ramanujan graph, and on typical $d$-regular graphs, for large enough degree $d$.</description>

      <title>On the prevalence of the periodicity of maximizing measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a continuous map $T: X\rightarrow X$ on a compact metric space $(X,d)$, we say that a function $f: X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ has the property $\mathscr{P}_T$ if its time averages along forward orbits of $T$ are maximized at a periodic orbit. In this paper, we prove that for the one-side full shift of two symbols, the property $\mathscr{P}_T$ is prevalent (in the sense of Hunt--Sauer--Yorke) in spaces of Lipschitz functions with respect to metrics with mildly fast decaying rate on the diameters of cylinder sets. This result is a strengthening of \cite[Theorem~A]{BZ16}, confirms the prediction mentioned in the ICM proceeding contribution of J. Bochi (\cite[Seciton 1]{Boc18}) suggested by experimental evidence, and is another step towards the Hunt--Ott conjectures in the area of ergodic optimization.</description>

      <title>Is Learning in Biological Neural Networks based on Stochastic Gradient Descent? An analysis using stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05102v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been an intense debate about how learning in biological neural networks (BNNs) differs from learning in artificial neural networks. It is often argued that the updating of connections in the brain relies only on local information, and therefore a stochastic gradient-descent type optimization method cannot be used. In this paper, we study a stochastic model for supervised learning in BNNs. We show that a (continuous) gradient step occurs approximately when each learning opportunity is processed by many local updates. This result suggests that stochastic gradient descent may indeed play a role in optimizing BNNs.</description>

      <title>Six-Vertex Model and Random Matrix Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12495v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We survey the connections between the six-vertex (square ice) model of 2d statistical mechanics and random matrix theory. We highlight the same universal probability distributions appearing on both sides, and also indicate related open questions and conjectures. We present full proofs of two asymptotic theorems for the six-vertex model: in the first one the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble and GUE-corners process appear; the second one leads to the Tracy-Widom distribution $F_2$. While both results are not new, we found shorter transparent proofs for this text. On our way we introduce the key tools in the study of the six-vertex model, including the Yang-Baxter equation and the Izergin-Korepin formula.</description>

      <title>Joint distribution of primes in multiple short intervals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04000v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assuming the Riemann hypothesis (RH) and the linear independence conjecture (LI), we show that the weighted count of primes in multiple disjoint short intervals has a multivariate Gaussian logarithmic limiting distribution with weak negative correlation. As a consequence, we derive short-interval counterparts for many important works in the literature of the Shanks-R\'enyi prime number race, including the sharp phase transition from all races being asymptotically unbiased to the existence of biased races. Our result remains novel, even for primes in a single moving interval, especially under a quantitative formulation of the linear independence conjecture (QLI).</description>

      <title>From Zero-Freeness to Strong Spatial Mixing via a Christoffel-Darboux Type Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unifying approach to derive the strong spatial mixing (SSM) property for the general 2-spin system from zero-free regions of its partition function. Our approach works for the multivariate partition function over all three complex parameters $(\beta, \gamma, \lambda)$, and we allow the zero-free regions of $\beta, \gamma$ or $\lambda$ to be of arbitrary shapes. As long as the zero-free region contains a positive point and it is a complex neighborhood of $\lambda=0$ when fixing $\beta, \gamma \in \mathbb{C}$, or a complex neighborhood of $\beta\gamma=1$ when fixing $\beta, \lambda\in \mathbb{C}$ or $\gamma, \lambda\in \mathbb{C}$ respectively, we are able to show that the corresponding 2-spin system exhibits SSM on such a region. The underlying graphs of the 2-spin system are not necessarily of bounded degree, while are required to include graphs with pinned vertices. We prove this result by establishing a Christoffel-Darboux type identity for the 2-spin system on trees. This identity plays an important role in our approach and is of its own interests. We also use certain tools from complex analysis such as Riemann mapping theorem.
  Our approach comprehensively turns all existing zero-free regions (to our best knowledge) of the partition function of the 2-spin system where pinned vertices are allowed into the SSM property. As a consequence, we obtain new SSM results for the 2-spin system beyond the direct argument for SSM based on tree recurrence. Moreover, we extend our approach to handle the 2-spin system with non-uniform external fields. As an application, we obtain a new SSM result for the non-uniform ferromagnetic Ising model from the celebrated Lee-Yang circle theorem.</description>
