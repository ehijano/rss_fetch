      <title>Investigation of mass substructure in gravitational lens system SDP.81 with ALMA long-baseline observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevalence and properties of low-mass dark matter haloes serve as a crucial test for understanding the nature of dark matter, and may be constrained through the gravitational deflection of strongly lensed arcs. Previous studies found evidence for the presence of low-mass dark matter haloes in observations of the gravitationally lensed, dusty star-forming galaxy SDP.81, using the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA). In this work, we analyse these observations to assess the robustness of these reported results. While our analysis indicates that the data support additional angular structure in the lensing mass distribution beyond an elliptical power-law density profile, we do not find evidence for two previously reported sub-halo detections. However, we verify with realistic mock data that we could have found evidence in favour of a previously reported $\approx 10^{9}\,{\rm M_{\odot}}$ sub-halo with a log Bayes factor of 29, should it exist in the real data. After testing various systematics, we find that this previous sub-halo inference was most likely spurious and resulted from an inadequate smooth model, specifically, poorly fitting multipoles. While we do not find evidence in favour of any individual sub-halo, we find evidence for similarity in the lensing signatures of multipoles ($m=3,4$) and single massive sub-haloes, consistent with other recent work. We suggest that future searches for low-mass haloes in lensed arcs include lens angular structure in the form of multipoles up to 4th order and require a good-fitting smooth model as a prerequisite. Overall, our findings demonstrate the suitability of ALMA data of this quality to simultaneously constrain the abundance of low-mass haloes and lens angular structure.</description>

      <title>Luminous Mid-IR Selected Obscured Quasars at Cosmic Noon in SDSS Stripe82 II: Spectroscopic Diversity and Broad H$\alpha$ Emissions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multiwavelength spectroscopic survey of 23 luminous mid-infrared-selected Type-2 quasars at redshifts z = 0.88 to 3.49. The targets were selected in the SDSS Stripe 82 field based on their bright WISE W4 detections (flux &gt; 5 mJy) and extremely faint or red optical counterparts (e.g., r &gt; 23 or r - W4 &gt; 8.4), designed to identify heavily obscured quasars. Deep near-infrared (Gemini/GNIRS) and optical (Keck/LRIS and KCWI) spectroscopy confirm 23 out of 24 candidates as Type-2 quasars in this redshift range, including 12 objects at z &gt; 2. The spectra exhibit strong rest-frame UV and optical emission lines (Ly-alpha, C IV, [O III], H-alpha) with a wide range of line widths, indicating significant spectral diversity. Approximately one-third of the sample (8 of 23) shows broad H-alpha emission (FWHM &gt; 2000 km/s) despite their Type-2 classification, while the rest have only narrow lines (FWHM &lt; 2000 km/s) characteristic of classical obscured quasars. Notably, these broad-line Type-2 quasars share similar spectral energy distributions with the JWST-discovered "little red dot" (LRD) AGNs, suggesting that our sample could be lower-redshift analogues of the heavily obscured broad-line AGNs uncovered by JWST. We also find that the [O III] 5007 angstrom emission is relatively weak for their high bolometric luminosities, deviating from trends seen in lower-redshift Type-2 QSOs. A new composite spectrum for Type-2 QSOs is built using our sample. Overall, our results demonstrate that mid-IR selection efficiently uncovers a diverse population of obscured quasars and that spectroscopic follow-up is crucial for revealing their true nature. This study provides new insights into heavily obscured SMBH growth at cosmic noon and bridges the gap to the obscured AGN populations now being revealed by JWST.</description>

      <title>Memoirs of mass accretion: probing the edges of intracluster light in simulated galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffuse starlight extending throughout massive galaxy clusters, known as intracluster light (ICL), has the potential to be read as a memoir of mass accretion: informative, individual, and yet imperfect. Here, we combine dark matter-only zoom-in simulations from the Symphony suite with the Nimbus "star-tagging" model of the stellar halo to assess how much information about the mass assembly of an individual galaxy cluster can be gleaned from idealized measurements of ICL outskirts. We show that the edges of a cluster's stellar profile -- the primary (Rsp*1) and secondary (Rsp*2) stellar "splashback" radii -- are sensitive to both continuous mass accretion histories and discrete merger events, making them potentially powerful probes of a cluster's past. We find that Rsp*1 strongly correlates with the cluster's mass ~1 dynamical time ago, while Rsp*2 traces more recent mass accretion history to a slightly lesser degree. In combination, these features can further distinguish between clusters that have and have not undergone a major merger within the past dynamical time. We use both to predict realistic cluster mass accretion histories with the MultiCAM framework. These outer ICL features are significantly more sensitive to mass accretion and merger histories than the stellar mass gap and halo concentration, and perform comparably to the commonly used X-ray-based tracer of relaxedness, x_off. While our analysis is idealized, the relevant ICL features are potentially detectable in next-generation deep imaging of nearby clusters. This work highlights the promise of ICL measurements and lays the groundwork for more detailed forecasts of their power.</description>

      <title>Survey of (sub)mm water masers in low-mass star-forming regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water masers are common in star-forming regions (SFRs), with the 22.235 GHz transition widely detected in both high- and low-mass protostars. In contrast, (sub)millimeter water maser transitions remain poorly studied, especially in low-mass SFRs. We search for millimeter water masers in a sample of low-mass SFRs previously known to exhibit 22 GHz emission. We target the transitions at 183.3, 321.2, and 325.2 GHz, respectively. We also examine their potential as probes of evolutionary stage by comparing them with previously reported Class I methanol masers (MM). We used the APEX 12m telescope. To assess the evolutionary stage of each source, we modeled their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using archival data and used the derived dust temperatures as proxies of ages. We then compared the occurrence of water and methanol masers across the sample. We detected 183.3 GHz water masers in 5 out of 18 sources. IRAS 16293-2422 shows all three transitions, while Serpens FIRS 1 also displays the 321.2 GHz line. Despite excellent observing conditions, detection rates drop with increasing frequency, reflecting both intrinsic line weakness and variability. Notably, the brightest (sub)millimeter masers can reach flux densities comparable to the 22 GHz line. Comparisons of velocity profiles show that different transitions often trace distinct gas components. Water masers generally appear at earlier or comparable evolutionary stages than MM, suggesting no universal maser-based age sequence. Our results demonstrate the detectability of submillimeter water in low-mass SFRs, although their occurrence is sparse. Velocity overlap between some centimeter and millimeter components suggests partial spatial coincidence, but many features appear uniquely in one frequency regime, indicating that different transitions often trace distinct gas regions with varying physical conditions.</description>

      <title>The Diversity of Metal-Enrichment and Abundance Patterns at High Redshift: A Magellan Survey of Gas-rich Galaxies Traced by Damped Lyman-alpha Absorbers at z~5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A powerful technique to trace the signatures of the first stars is through the metal enrichment in concentrated reservoirs of hydrogen, such as the damped Lyman-alpha absorbers (DLAs) in the early universe. We conducted a survey aimed at discovering DLAs along sight lines to high-z quasars in order to measure element abundances at z&gt;4. Here we report our first results from this survey for 10 DLAs with redshifts of ~4.2-5.0. We determine abundances of C, O, Si, S, and Fe, and thereby the metallicities and dust depletions. We find that DLA metallicities at z&gt;4.5 show a wide diversity spanning ~3 orders of magnitude. The metallicities of DLAs at 3.7&lt;z&lt;5.3 show a larger dispersion compared to that at lower redshifts. Combining our sample with the literature, we find a relatively smooth evolution of metallicity with redshift out to z~5.3, with a tentative (~2 sigma) indication of a slight rise in metallicity at 4.5&lt;z&lt;5.3. The relative abundances exhibit C enhancement for both metal-poor and metal-enriched DLAs. In addition, alpha-element enhancement is evident in some DLAs, including a DLA at z=4.7 with a super-solar metallicity. Comparing [C/O] and [Si/O] with model predictions, 4 DLAs in our survey seem consistent with a non-zero Pop III contribution (3 with &gt;=30% Pop-III contribution). Combining our sample and the literature, we find the dust depletion strength and dust-to-metal ratios to correlate positively with the total (gas+solid phase) metallicity, confirming the presence of metal-rich, dusty DLAs even at ~1 billion years after the Big Bang.</description>

      <title>Re-examination of the CO absorption line in the M87 nucleus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyzed the archival ALMA data of the nuclear region of M87 and evaluate the molecular gas content from the CO(2--1) absorption line. We found an enigmatic variability in the absorption line depth between two epochs separated by only two months. We reexamined the dataset used in the analysis and found that the bandpass calibration source within the same dataset also revealed a similar absorption line structure. Furthermore, we observed a rise in the system noise temperature spectrum. We concluded that the absorption line structure identified in a previous study, and attributed to CO(2--1), does not originate from M87 but instead results from telluric contamination, and that we still have only the upper limit on the molecular gas around the nucleus of M87.</description>

      <title>Intergalactic Wandering Stars in the Local Universe: Theoretical Predictions for Their Distance and Luminosity Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intergalactic wandering stars (IWSs) within 10 Mpc remain a poorly explored area of astronomy. Such stars, if they exist, are supposed to be wandering objects as they are not bounded by the gravitational potential of any galaxy. We set out to conduct dedicated studies for unraveling such a wandering stellar population. As the first paper of the series, in the present work we model the distance distribution and luminosity function of IWSs formed via the Hills mechanism of the Galactic central massive black hole (GCMBH). We implement a numerical simulation to generate IWSs taking the ejection history of the GCMBH and the stellar evolution process into consideration, and present their luminosity function in the distance range of 200kpc - 10Mpc. Our results suggest that a few hundred thousand IWSs have been generated by the GCMBH via the Hills mechanism in the past 14 billion years. These IWSs have an apparent magnitude peaking at 30 to 35 mag in SDSS $r-$band, which are hard to detect. However, a few thousand of them at the bright end are detectable by upcoming wide-field deep surveys, such as China Space Station Telescope (CSST) and Vera Rubin Observatory (LSST). The forthcoming discovery of such a wandering stellar population will open a door for precise understanding of the matter constitution of the nearby intergalactic space and the dynamical history of galaxies in the local universe.</description>

      <title>The ALMA-QUARKS Survey: III. Clump-to-core fragmentation and search for high-mass starless cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Querying Underlying mechanisms of massive star formation with ALMA-Resolved gas Kinematics and Structures (QUARKS) survey observed 139 infrared-bright (IR-bright) massive protoclusters at 1.3 mm wavelength with ALMA. This study investigates clump-to-core fragmentation and searches for candidate high-mass starless cores within IR-bright clumps using combined ALMA 12-m (C-2) and Atacama Compact Array (ACA) 7-m data, providing $\sim$ 1 arcsec ($\sim\rm0.02~pc$ at 3.7 kpc) resolution and $\sim\rm0.6\,mJy\,beam^{-1}$ continuum sensitivity ($\sim 0.3~M_{\odot}$ at 30 K). We identified 1562 compact cores from 1.3 mm continuum emission using getsf. Observed linear core separations ($\lambda_{\rm obs}$) are significantly less than the thermal Jeans length ($\lambda_{\rm J}$), with the $\lambda_{\rm obs}/\lambda_{\rm J}$ ratios peaking at $\sim0.2$. This indicates that thermal Jeans fragmentation has taken place within the IR-bright protocluster clumps studied here. The observed low ratio of $\lambda_{\rm obs}/\lambda_{\rm J}\ll 1$ could be the result of evolving core separation or hierarchical fragmentation. Based on associated signatures of star formation (e.g., outflows and ionized gas), we classified cores into three categories: 127 starless, 971 warm, and 464 evolved cores. Two starless cores have mass exceeding 16$\,M_{\odot}$, and represent high-mass candidates. The scarcity of such candidates suggests that competitive accretion-type models could be more applicable than turbulent core accretion-type models in high-mass star formation within these IR-bright protocluster clumps.</description>

      <title>Mass loss and dynamical friction on the Fornax dSph galaxy in the Milky Way potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interplay between mass-loss and dynamical friction (DF) on the orbital decay of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy in the potential of the Milky Way (MW). Using a simplified single particle approach combined with a mass-loss rate extrapolated by $N-$body simulations we find that the the effect of a time-dependent mass partially compensates DF, and typically produces a much less evident decay of the pergalactic distance, thus confirming that $N-$body simulations in smooth MW potentials without DF can be taken as a good model of the dynamics of dwarf satellite galaxies.</description>

      <title>Spatial mixing of stellar populations in globular clusters via binary-single star scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of Galactic globular star clusters (GCs) have been reported to contain at least two populations of stars (we use P1 for the primordial and P2 for the chemically-enriched population). Recent observational studies found that dynamically-old GCs have P1 and P2 spatially mixed due to relaxation processes. However, in dynamically-young GCs, where P2 is expected to be more centrally concentrated from birth, the spatial distributions of P1 and P2 are sometimes very different from system to system. This suggests that more complex dynamical processes specific to certain GCs might have shaped those distributions. We aim to investigate the discrepancies between the spatial concentration of P1 and P2 stars in dynamically-young GCs. Our focus is to evaluate whether massive binary stars (e.g. BHs) can cause the expansion of the P2 stars through binary-single interactions in the core, and whether they can mix or even radially invert the P1 and P2 distributions. We use a set of theoretical and empirical arguments to evaluate the effectiveness of binary-single star scattering. We then construct a set of direct N-body models with massive primordial binaries to verify our estimates further and gain more insights into the dynamical processes in GCs. We find that binary-single star scatterings can push the central P2 stars outwards within a few relaxation times. While we do not produce radial inversion of P1 and P2 for any initial conditions we tested, this mechanism systematically produces clusters where P1 and P2 look fully mixed even in projection. The mixing is enhanced 1) in denser GCs, 2) in GCs containing more binary stars, and 3) when the mass ratio between the binary components and the cluster members is higher. Binary-single star interactions seem able to explain the observable properties of some dynamically-young GCs (e.g. NGC4590 or NGC5904) where P1 and P2 are fully radially mixed.</description>

      <title>X-ray Halos of Early-Type Galaxies with AGN Feedback and Accretion from a Circumgalactic Medium: models and observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The knowledge of the X-ray properties of the hot gas halos of early-type galaxies has significantly advanced in the past years, for large and homogeneously investigated samples. We compare these results with the X-ray properties of an exploratory set of gas evolution models in realistic early-type galaxies, produced with our high-resolution 2D hydrodynamical code MACER that includes AGN feedback and accretion from a circumgalactic medium. The model X-ray emission and absorption are integrated along the line of sight, to obtain maps of the surface brightness Sigma_X and temperature Tx. The X-ray diagnostics considered are the luminosity and average temperature for the whole galaxy (Lx and &lt;Tx&gt;) and within 5 optical effective radii (Lx5 and &lt;Tx5&gt;), and the circularized profiles Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R). The values for Lx, Lx5, &lt;Tx&gt;, and &lt;Tx5&gt; compare very well with those observed. The Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R) also present qualitative similarities with those of the representative galaxy NGC5129, and of ETGs with the most commonly observed shape for Tx(R): Sigma_X(R) matches the observed profile over many optical effective radii Re, and Tx(R) reproduces the characteristic bump that peaks at R=(1 - 3)Re. Inside the peak position, Tx(R) declines towards the center, but the explored models are systematically hotter by ~30%; possible explanations for this discrepancy are discussed. Interestingly, Sigma_X(R) and Tx(R) as large as observed outside of R~Re are reproduced only with significant accretion from a circumgalactic medium, highlighting its importance.</description>

      <title>Renzo's rule revisited: A statistical study of galaxies' baryon - dark matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03569</link>

Abstract: We present a systematic statistical analysis of an informal astrophysical phenomenon known as Renzo's rule (or Sancisi's law), which states that "for any feature in a galaxy's luminosity profile, there is a corresponding feature in the rotation curve, and vice versa." This is often posed as a challenge for the standard LCDM model while supporting alternative theories such as MOND. Indeed, we identify clear features in the dwarf spiral NGC 1560 -- a prime example for Renzo's rule -- and find correlation statistics which support Renzo's rule with a slight preference for MOND over LCDM halo fits. However, a broader analysis on galaxies in the SPARC database reveals an excess of features in rotation curves that lack clear baryonic counterparts, with correlation statistics deviating up to $3\sigma$ on average from that predicted by both MOND and LCDM haloes, challenging the validity of Renzo's rule. Thus we do not find clear evidence for Renzo's rule in present galaxy data overall. We additionally perform mock tests, which show that a definitive test of Renzo's rule is primarily limited by the lack of clearly resolved baryonic features in current galaxy data.</description>

      <title>JWST NIRCam Observations of the Globular Cluster Population of RXJ 2129.7+0005</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the globular cluster (GC) population in the galaxy cluster RXJ 2129.7+0005 (z = 0.234) based on JWST NIRCam imaging in three filters: F115W, F150W, and F200W. We use this material to provide a detailed look at the color-magnitude distribution of the GCs and their spatial distribution around the central giant galaxy. We identified 3,160 GC candidates brighter than F150W=29.5, and assessed photometric completeness through artificial star tests. We determined that the GCs follow a radial power-law distribution with an index of $1.58 \pm 0.04$, with the redder GCs exhibiting a slightly greater central concentration. Their spatial distribution is also highly elliptical, closely following the shape of the BCG halo light.</description>

      <title>The Nature of an Unidentified X-ray Source in the 7 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the 7 Ms Chandra Deep Field-South catalog, only one source, XID 912, was highly significantly detected in X-rays but had no formally reported counterparts in the UV, optical, infrared, or radio bands. We identified its potential JWST and VLT VIMOS counterparts and measured the corresponding aperture photometry to construct its spectral energy distribution (SED). We fitted this SED using CIGALE. The results indicate that the source is most likely an off-nuclear ultraluminous X-ray source, rather than a background active galactic nucleus.</description>

      <title>SED Fitting of Globular Clusters in NGC 4874: Masses and Metallicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In most nearby galaxies, photometry of the integrated light of their globular clusters (GCs) has been obtained in only two filters, yielding just a single color index. However, NGC 4874, the brightest central galaxy in the Coma cluster, now has Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry available in ten filters, giving us a special opportunity to test SED fitting procedures on GCs in distant galaxies. We fitted 29 of the brightest GCs with a library of SEDs from E-MILES and calculated the best-fit metallicity and mass of each cluster. Using the fitted masses and luminosities derived from the reddest magnitudes, in the flat portion of the GC spectrum, we also calculated inferred mass-to-light ratios for our sample GCs; these were in the range (M/L) $\simeq 2 - 4$, slightly larger than the average values for Milky Way GCs but within the conventional range.</description>

      <title>Spectral Characteristics of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS from SOAR Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs) provide unique insights into the building blocks and conditions of extrasolar planetary systems. The newly discovered object, 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1), represents the third known ISO after 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. We present initial spectroscopic characterizations of 3I using observations from the Goodman High Throughput Spectrograph on the 4.1 m SOAR Telescope in Chile during the night of July 3rd. The reflectance spectrum of 3I, covering 3700-7000\,\AA\, reveals a red continuum, comparable to extreme trans-Neptunian objects, with a weak UV-optical turnover indicative of complex carbonaceous and irradiated organics. At the time of observation, when 3I was at a heliocentric distance of 4.4 AU, we detected no discernible gas emission from canonical cometary species (CN, C$_3$, C$_2$, CO$^+$, [O{\sc i}]). This is in agreement with expectations from our thermal-evolution model, which indicates sublimation-driven activity should commence once 3I/ATLAS approaches smaller heliocentric distances. Nonetheless, the paradoxical situation of early onset coma without evidence of sublimation tracers calls for other dust-liberating mechanisms that ancient ISOs may be subjected to at large heliocentric distances.</description>

      <title>EUCLID: Photometric redshift calibration with self-organising maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Euclid survey aims to trace the evolution of cosmic structures up to redshift $z$ $\sim$ 3 and beyond. Its success depends critically on obtaining highly accurate mean redshifts for ensembles of galaxies $n(z)$ in all tomographic bins, essential for deriving robust cosmological constraints. However, photometric redshifts (photo-$z$s) suffer from systematic biases arising from various sources of uncertainty. To address these challenges, we utilised self-organising maps (SOMs) with mock samples resembling the Euclid Wide Survey (EWS), to validate Euclid's uncertainty requirement of $|\Delta\langle z \rangle| = \langle z_{\text{est}} \rangle - \langle z \rangle \leq 0.002 (1+z)$ per tomographic bin, assuming DR3-level data. We observe that defining the redshift tomography using the mean spectroscopic redshift (spec-$z$) per SOM cell, results in none of the ten tomographic redshift bins satisfying the requirement. In contrast, the redshift tomography on the photo-$z$s of the EWS-like sample yields superior results, with eight out of ten bins [$0 &lt; z\leq 2.5$] meeting the Euclid requirement. To enhance the realism of our study, we morph our calibration sample to mimic the C3R2 survey in incremental steps. In this context, a maximum of six out of ten bins meet the requirement, strongly advocating the adoption of a redshift tomography defined by the photo-$z$s of individual galaxies rather than the commonly used mean spec-$z$ of SOM cells. To examine the impact on the expected biases for $\Omega_{\text{m}}$, $\sigma_{8}$, and $\Delta w_{0}$ measured by Euclid, we perform a Fisher forecast for cosmic shear only, based on our redshift uncertainties. Here, we find that even under an evaluation of the uncertainty where the impact of the redshift bias is substantial, most absolute biases remain below 0.1$\sigma$ in the idealised scenario and below 0.3$\sigma$ in the more realistic case.</description>

      <title>NASIM: Revealing the low surface brightness Universe from legacy VISTA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near-infrared imaging is a powerful technique in observational astronomy, but the bright background, primarily from the Earth\'s atmosphere, makes the detection of faint features particularly challenging. To recover low surface brightness (LSB) structures in such data, we present NASIM (Near-infrared Automated low Surface brightness reduction In Maneage), a fully automated and reproducible data reduction pipeline optimised for VISTA/VIRCAM observations. NASIM builds on GNU Astronomy Utilities (Gnuastro) to effectively remove large-scale instrumental artefacts while preserving faint, diffuse emission. As a key science application, we focus on deep Ks-band observations of the Euclid Deep Field South (KEDFS), one of the deepest VISTA/VIRCAM datasets and a high-priority field for synergy with current and future facilities, including Euclid, JWST, LSST, Roman, Spitzer, and ALMA. With VIRCAM no longer operational, KEDFS now stands as a unique legacy dataset. We release selected tiles from the KEDFS survey and highlight science cases, including galaxy outskirts, LSB galaxies, and intracluster light, that demonstrate NASIM\'s ability to recover diffuse structures. A direct comparison with conventional VISTA data reduction pipelines demonstrates the advantages of NASIM in preserving diffuse emission without compromising compact source detection. All quantitative results presented in this paper are fully reproducible with Maneage (commit 4d32667).</description>

      <title>The binary fraction of Blue Horizontal-Branch (BHB) Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blue horizontal-branch (BHB) stars are old, low-mass, metal-poor stars that serve as important tracers of the Galactic halo structure, kinematics, and evolution.Understanding their binary properties provides key insights into their formation channels and the role of binary interactions in the evolution of horizontal branch stars. We intend to investigate the intrinsic binary fraction $f_{\rm b}^{\rm in}$ of BHB stars and its dependencies on metallicity, kinematics, and effective temperature. We collect \GG{299} BHB stars from LAMOST with multiple radial velocity (RV) measurements and classify the sample into halo-like and disk-like BHBs based on their kinematics and metallicity, as well as into bluer and redder BHBs based on their \G{effective temperature}. We then investigate the observed binary fraction for each group based on the radial velocity variations and apply a set of Monte Carlo simulations, assuming distributions of $f(P) \propto P^\pi$ and $f(q) \propto q^\kappa$, to correct the observed binary fraction for observational biases and derive the intrinsic binary fraction. After correcting for observational biases, the intrinsic binary fraction increases to 31% for n &gt; 2 and 32% for n &gt; 3. A clear contrast is observed between halo-like and disk-like BHB stars, with halo-like BHBs exhibiting a lower intrinsic binary fraction (28% for n &gt; 2 and 29% for n&gt; 3) compared to disk-like BHBs (46% and 51%, respectively), indicating different formation pathways. Additionally, we find that bluer BHB stars exhibit a significantly higher binary fraction (42% for n &gt; 2 and 45% for n&gt; 3) than redder BHB stars (24% and 23%, respectively), which suggests a possible link between binarity and the effective temperature, although more samples are required to confirm this.</description>

      <title>The X-ray Variability and Luminosity Function of High Mass X-ray Binaries in the Dwarf Starburst Galaxy IC 10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of $\sim$235 ks of Chandra observations obtained over $\sim$19 years of the nearby dwarf starburst galaxy IC 10 in order to study the X-ray variability and X-ray luminosity function (XLF) of its X-ray binary (XRB) population. We identify 23 likely XRBs within the 2MASS $K_S$ isophotal radius and find the distributions of their dynamic ranges and duty cycles are consistent with a young, high-mass XRB population dominated by supergiant (sg)-fed systems, consistent with previous work. In general, we find that brighter HMXBs (those with $L_X\gtrsim$several$\times10^{36}$ erg s$^{-1}$) have higher duty cycles (i.e., are more persistent X-ray sources) than fainter objects, and the dynamic ranges of the sgHMXBs in the lower metallicity environment of IC 10 are higher than what is observed for comparable systems in the Milky Way. After filtering out foreground stars on the basis of Gaia parallaxes we construct, for the first time, the XLF of IC 10. We then use the XLF to model the star formation history of the galaxy, finding that a very recent (3-8 Myr) burst of star formation with rate of $\sim$0.5 $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ is needed to adequately explain the observed bright-end ($L_X\sim10^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$) of the HMXB XLF.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high angular resolution observations of the third known interstellar interloper, 3I/ATLAS, from the Hubble Space Telescope. The object is clearly active at 3.8 au pre-perihelion, showing dust emitted from the hot Sun-facing side of the nucleus and a weak, radiation pressure swept tail away from the Sun. We apply a simple model to estimate the mass loss rate in dust as dM/dt = 6 a kg/s, where a is the mean particle size in microns. With 1 &lt; a &lt; 100, we infer dM/dt = 6 to 60 kg/s. A fit to the surface brightness distribution of the inner coma limits the effective radius of the nucleus to be r &lt; 2.8 km, assuming red geometric albedo 0.04. Conversely, the nucleus cannot be smaller than 0.16 km in radius if its coma is supplied by sublimation of carbon monoxide, and must be larger if a less volatile molecule drives the mass loss.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Jet Width Profile of CTA 102 with Very Long Baseline Interferometry at Parsec Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nucleus jets have long be thought to exhibit a conical jet shape, but recently, several jets were found to have a transition from parabolic to conical structure. As more sources are investigated, this collimation profile appears to represent a common paradigm. Previous works suggest that the Bondi radius may serve as an indicator of the transition location, although discrepancies have been observed in some sources. To explore this further, we selected CTA 102 for which existing literature presents mixed evidence regarding the presence of a jet geometry break. We investigated the jet width profile of CTA 102 to study the possible transition changes in the jet, thereby improving the understanding of connection between Bondi radius and jet transition. We used multi-frequency VLBA images of CTA 102 at 2, 5, and 8 (single epoch), and 15, 22 and 43 GHz (stacked). The jet width profile was modeled with a single power law $W_{jet}\propto r^{\epsilon}$ yielding a power-law index of $\epsilon=0.69\pm0.02$, indicative of a quasi-parabolic geometry with no clear transition to a conical regime. The absence of discernible structural break around the Bondi radius implies that the physical conditions associated with the radius alone are insufficient to explain the jet collimation behaviour. On the other hand, we observe oscillatory features in the jet width profile, suggesting the influence of additional physical processes beyond gravitational confinement. These findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of jet collimation in AGN and highlight the complexity of jet-environment interactions.</description>

      <title>Li-enrichment in red clump giants: Clues for past binary interaction or merger events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To understand the underlying mechanisms for high lithium abundances among core He-burning or red clump (RC) giants, we analyzed a sample of 5227 RC giants of mass M $\leq$ 2~M$_{\odot}$ using spectra and asteroseismic data. We found 120 RC giants ($\sim$2~$\%$) with a lower limit of A(Li) = 0.7~dex, a factor of 40 more than their predecessors close to the RGB tip. Of the 120 RC giants, we could measure actual rotations for 16 RC giants using stellar spots from the Kepler light curve analysis. We found that most of the high rotation RC giants are also very high Li-rich RC giants, and the rotation seems to decline rapidly with Li abundance depletion, suggesting that both the high rotation and high Li abundance are transient phenomena and associated with a single source. Further, we found a significantly high occurrence of 15~$\%$ and 12~$\%$ of Li-rich RC giants among extremely low-mass RC giants and RC giants with anomalous [C/N] ratios, respectively. The extremely low mass, fast rotation and anomalous [C/N] values of RC giants are attributed to their past binary interaction/merger history. The results pose a question of whether the binary interaction/merger is a prerequisite along with the He-flash for Li-enhancement among RC giants.</description>

      <title>Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages (POETS). VIII. The jets in the intermediate-mass star-forming region G105.42+9.88 (alias LkH{\alpha} 234)</title>

Abstract: Our aim is to investigate the protostellar jets inside the young stellar object (YSO) cluster G105.42+9.88 (alias LkH$\alpha$ 234). This is one of the least luminous targets of the Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages (POETS) survey, which has been recently carried out to study young outflow emission on scales of 10-100 au. The combination of multi-epoch water maser very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations with sensitive Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) continuum and Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) H$_2$ 2.12 $\mu$m observations, allows us to study the protostellar outflows from the intermediate-mass binary system VLA 3A and 3B, separated by ~0.22", and from VLA 2, an intermediate-mass YSO placed ~1" to northwest of VLA 3. Toward VLA 2, the 2001 and 2011 Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations consistently show that the water masers are tracing a jet. The analysis of the 3D flow velocities proves that the jet is magneto-centrifugally launched in a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) disk wind (DW). We infer launch radii in the range 10-50 au for the streamlines traced by the water masers. The global VLBI 2023 water maser observations indicate that the jet propagation can be hindered by a very dense clump placed northeast of VLA 2 and that is consistent with the large-scale LBT H$_2$ emission, tracing only the southwest lobe of the VLA 2 jet. Instead, the parallel jets emitted by the nearby YSOs VLA 3A and 3B can be reliably tracked with the H$_2$ emission at scales of a few 10" to both the southwest and the northeast. In particular, northeast of VLA 3 the direction of these two jets crosses a linear chain of spaced H$_2$ knots, which is a clear signature of an episodic jet. The variable ejection from VLA 3B, witnessed by the water masers at scales of ~10 au, could be the origin of the episodic jet observed at larger scales.</description>

      <title>Human vs. machine -- 1:3. Joint analysis of classical and ML-based summary statistics of the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In order to compress and more easily interpret Lyman-$\alpha$ forest (Ly$\alpha$F) datasets, summary statistics, e.g. the power spectrum, are commonly used. However, such summaries unavoidably lose some information, weakening the constraining power on parameters of interest. Recently, machine learning (ML)-based summary approaches have been proposed as an alternative to human-defined statistical measures. This raises a question: can ML-based summaries contain the full information captured by traditional statistics, and vice versa? In this study, we apply three human-defined techniques and one ML-based approach to summarize mock Ly$\alpha$F data from hydrodynamical simulations and infer two thermal parameters of the intergalactic medium, assuming a power-law temperature-density relation. We introduce a metric for measuring the improvement in the figure of merit when combining two summaries. Consequently, we demonstrate that the ML-based summary approach not only contains almost all of the information from the human-defined statistics, but also that it provides significantly stronger constraints by a ratio of better than 1:3 in terms of the posterior volume on the temperature-density relation parameters.</description>

      <title>Investigation on deep learning-based galaxy image translation models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galaxy image translation is an important application in galaxy physics and cosmology. With deep learning-based generative models, image translation has been performed for image generation, data quality enhancement, information extraction, and generalized for other tasks such as deblending and anomaly detection. However, most endeavors on image translation primarily focus on the pixel-level and morphology-level statistics of galaxy images. There is a lack of discussion on the preservation of complex high-order galaxy physical information, which would be more challenging but crucial for studies that rely on high-fidelity image translation. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of generative models in preserving high-order physical information (represented by spectroscopic redshift) along with pixel-level and morphology-level information. We tested four representative models, i.e. a Swin Transformer, an SRGAN, a capsule network, and a diffusion model, using the SDSS and CFHTLS galaxy images. We found that these models show different levels of incapabilities in retaining redshift information, even if the global structures of galaxies and morphology-level statistics can be roughly reproduced. In particular, the cross-band peak fluxes of galaxies were found to contain meaningful redshift information, whereas they are subject to noticeable uncertainties in the translation of images, which may substantially be due to the nature of many-to-many mapping. Nonetheless, imperfect translated images may still contain a considerable amount of information and thus hold promise for downstream applications for which high image fidelity is not strongly required. Our work can facilitate further research on how complex physical information is manifested on galaxy images, and it provides implications on the development of image translation models for scientific use.</description>

      <title>The compact object and innermost ejecta of SN 1987A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first JWST observations of SN 1987A provided clear evidence that a compact object is ionizing the innermost ejecta. Here we analyze a second epoch of JWST NIRSpec and MIRI/MRS observations to better characterize the properties of this region, aided by a higher spectral resolving power for the new NIRSpec data. We confirm the presence of the previously identified narrow lines from the central region; [Ar VI] 4.5292 $\mu$m, [Ar II] 6.9853 $\mu$m, [S IV] 10.5105 $\mu$m, and [S III] 18.7130 $\mu$m, and also identify similar components in [Ca V] 4.1585 $\mu$m, [Cl II] 14.3678 $\mu$m, and possibly [Fe II] 1.6440 $\mu$m. These lines are blueshifted by $\sim$ -250 km/s, while the emission region is spatially unresolved and located southeast of the center. The offset and blueshift could imply a kick velocity of $510 \pm 55$ km/s for the neutron star. We also identify [Ca IV] 3.2068 $\mu$m near the center, but it is displaced to the north and has a redshift of $\sim 700$ km/s. We find that scattering by dust in the ejecta with a typical grain size $\sim 0.3\ \mu$m can explain the [Ca IV] properties and the absence of other narrow lines at shorter wavelengths, while dust absorption is important at $\lambda \gtrsim 8\ \mu$m. Photoionization models for a pulsar wind nebula and a cooling neutron star are both compatible with the observations, with the exception of the [Fe II] feature. The two models primarily differ at short wavelengths, where new lines are expected to emerge over time as the optical depth of dust in the expanding ejecta decreases.</description>

      <title>JWST observations of the Ring Nebula (NGC 6720) -- II. PAH emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and carbonaceous dust have been observed in clumpy circumstellar environments, yet their formation and evolutionary pathways in such environments remain elusive. We aim to characterize the PAH emission in a clumpy planetary nebula to decipher their formation and evolution pathways. We obtained JWST Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) and Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) integral field unit spectroscopic observations of two individual knots in the Ring Nebula (NGC 6720), a clumpy planetary nebula, and determine the PAH spectral characteristics. We detect the 3.3 and 11.2 um PAH emission bands in both knots but do not detect PAH emission in the 6-9 um range. We supplement our data with Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) Short-Low 1 (SL1) and SL2 data, containing 11.2, weak 6.2, and weak 7.7 um PAH emission bands. The JWST data confirm the unusual profile of the 11.2 um band, which is very broad and redshifted with respect to typical 11.2 um PAH profiles. We estimate the PAH population to be largely neutral. The relative integrated surface brightness of the 3.3 and 11.2 um bands indicates the presence of small-sized PAHs, consisting of 35 +/- 6 carbon atoms. We find that the PAH emission is concentrated outside of the clumps, in the inter-clump medium, and confirm the existence of enhanced PAH emission in a narrow 'PAH ring' centred on the central star. This morphology suggests that PAHs formed during the Ring Nebula's asymptotic giant branch phase, in the central star's dust-driven wind.</description>

      <title>High Frequency Peak Radio Sources from the AT20G Catalogue and Their Radio Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A sample of high-frequency peaker (HFP) candidates was formed from the AT20G catalog radio sources with spectral indices of the optically thick emission region $\alpha_{below}$ exceeding +0.5. A study of the spectral properties of the sources in the sample, which included 269 radio sources, was performed. The spectra of the sources were constructed and the spectral indices below $\alpha_{below}$ and above the peak $\alpha_{above}$, the peak frequency $\nu_{obs}$, the flux density at the peak frequency $S_{peak}$, and the peak half-width in the radio spectrum were determined. Analysis of the spectra showed that the sample is fairly homogeneous and consists of HFPs with $\nu_{obs}&gt;5$ GHz. Most sources (67%) do not have data at frequencies below 0.8 GHz. 187 sources have ultra-inverted spectra ($\alpha_{below}&gt;$+0.7), which is 3.2% of all sources in the AT20G catalog and 70% of radio sources in our sample. Optical identification of radio sources in the sample showed that 70% of the hosts are quasars. The sample consists of compact objects with radio luminosity at 20 GHz in the range of $10^{23}$-$10^{30}$ W/Hz, angular sizes of emitting regions of radio sources are 0.002-0.25 mas, projected linear sizes are from 0.2 to 30 pc. The dependence of the peak frequencies of radio sources on their angular sizes is in good agreement with that previously discovered for CSS and GPS sources.</description>

      <title>The role of migration traps in the formation of binary black holes in AGN disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary black holes (BBHs) forming in the accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) represent a promising channel for gravitational-wave production. BBHs are typically expected to originate at migration traps, i.e. radial locations where the Type I migration of embedded stellar-mass black holes (BHs) transitions from outwards to inwards. In this work, we test this assumption by explicitly simulating the radial migration of BH pairs in AGN disks under different torque prescriptions, including thermal effects and the switch to Type II migration. We quantify where and when binaries form as a function of supermassive BH (SMBH) mass, disk viscosity, and migrating BH mass. We find that while the majority of pair-up events occur near migration traps, a substantial fraction takes place elsewhere in the disk, particularly for high-viscosity disks ($\alpha=0.1-0.4$) and SMBHs with mass above a threshold of $10^{7.5}$ solar masses, where differential migration is most efficient. The inclusion of thermal torques favors pair-up in outer locations of the disk and facilitates rapid pair-up. We also investigate hierarchical BBH formation, showing that higher-generation pair-ups are more tightly clustered around trap locations. Our results provide realistic prescriptions for BBH pair-up locations and timescales, highlighting the limitations of assuming fixed BBH formation sites.</description>

      <title>Taking control of compressible modes: bulk viscosity and the turbulent dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03984v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many polyatomic astrophysical plasmas are compressible and out of chemical and thermal equilibrium, introducing a bulk viscosity into the plasma via the internal degrees of freedom of the molecular composition, directly impacting the decay of compressible modes, $\mathbf{v}_{\parallel}(\mathbf{k})$. This is especially important for small-scale, turbulent dynamo processes in the interstellar medium, which are known to be sensitive to the effects of compression. To control the viscous properties of $\mathbf{v}_{\parallel}(\mathbf{k})$, we perform trans-sonic, visco-resistive dynamo simulations with additional bulk viscosity $\nu_{\rm bulk}$, deriving a new $\nu_{\rm bulk}$ Reynolds number $\rm{Re}_{\rm bulk}$, and viscous Prandtl number $\rm{P}\nu \equiv \rm{Re}_{\rm bulk} / \rm{Re}_{\rm shear}$, where $\rm{Re}_{\rm shear}$ is the shear viscosity Reynolds number. We derive a framework for decomposing $E_{\rm mag}$ growth rates into incompressible and compressible terms via orthogonal tensor decompositions of $\nabla\otimes\mathbf{v}$, where $\mathbf{v}$ is the fluid velocity. We find that $\mathbf{v}_{\parallel}(\mathbf{k})$ play a dual role, growing and decaying $E_{\rm mag}$, and that field-line stretching is the main driver of growth, even in compressible dynamos. In the absence of $\nu_{\rm bulk}$ ($\rm{P}\nu \to \infty$), $\mathbf{v}_{\parallel}(\mathbf{k})$ pile up on small-scales, creating a spectral bottleneck, which disappears for $\rm{P}\nu \approx 1$. (abridged). We emphasize the importance of further understanding the role of $\nu_{\rm bulk}$ in compressible astrophysical plasmas, which we estimate could be as strong as the shear viscosity in the cold ISM, and highlight that compressible direct numerical simulations without bulk viscosity have unresolved compressible mode dissipation scales.</description>

Abstract: A method is presented for obtaining unified radial distributions of dark matter properties for different galaxies independent of their mass, type, or size. The publicly available measurements of 2693 stellar objects of 153 different galaxies of the SPARC-group [3] are used to demonstrate the effectivity of the method. The obtained unified radial distributions of dark matter properties like velocity, acceleration, mass and mass density give a detailed understanding of the general dark matter behavior within in the galaxies.</description>

      <title>Sub-Parsec Acceleration and Collimation of NGC 4261's Twin Jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the first robust evidence for a co-spatial sub-parsec acceleration and collimation zone (ACZ) in the twin jets of the nearby low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (LLAGN) NGC 4261. This result is derived from multifrequency Very Long Baseline Array imaging, combined with the frequency-dependent properties of the radio core (core shift and core size) and jet kinematics determined from the jet-to-counterjet brightness ratio. By applying multiple analysis methods and incorporating results from the literature, we identify a parabolic-to-conical structural transition in both the jet and counterjet, with the transition occurring at $(1.23\pm0.24)$ pc or $(8.1\pm1.6)\times10^3 R_{\rm s}$ (Schwarzschild radii) for the jet and $(0.97\pm0.29)$ pc or $(6.4\pm1.9)\times10^3 R_{\rm s}$ for the counterjet. We also derive the jet velocity field at distances of $\sim (10^3-2\times10^4) R_{\rm s}$. While local kinematic variations are present, the jet shows an overall acceleration to relativistic speeds from $\sim 10^3$ to $\sim8\times10^3 R_{\rm s}$, with a maximum Lorentz factor of $\Gamma_{\rm max} \approx 2.6$. Beyond this region, the jet gradually decelerates to sub-relativistic speeds. These findings support the existence of a sub-parsec-scale ($\lesssim 1.5$ pc) ACZ in NGC 4261, where the jet is accelerated via magnetic-to-kinetic energy conversion while being confined by external pressure. A brief comparison with M 87 suggests that the ACZ in NGC 4261 may represent a scaled-down analogue of that in M 87. These results point towards a potential diversity in jet ACZ properties, emphasizing the importance of extending such studies to a broader AGN population to elucidate the physical mechanisms at play.</description>

      <title>Searching for stars ejected from the Galactic Centre in DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dynamical interactions between stars and the super massive black hole Sgr A* at the Galactic Centre (GC) may eject stars into the Galactic halo. While recent fast ejections by Sgr A* have been identified in the form of hypervelocity stars (hundreds to thousands km/s), it is also expected that the stellar halo contains slower stars, ejected over the last few billion years. In this study, we use the first data release of DESI to search for these slower GC ejecta, which are expected to stand out from the stellar halo population for their combined high metallicity (${\rm [Fe/H]}\gtrsim0$) and small values of their vertical angular momentum ($L_Z$), whose distribution should peak at zero. Our search does not yield a detection, but allows us to place an upper limit on the ejection rate of stars from the GC of $\sim2.8\times10^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ over the past ~5 Gyr, which is ejection model independent. This implies that our result can be used to put constraints on different ejection models, including that invoking mergers of Sgr A* with other massive black holes in the last last few billion years.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised classification of stars, galaxies and quasars using K-means and random-forest approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14072v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classifying stars, galaxies, and quasars is essential for understanding cosmic structure and evolution; however, the vast data from modern surveys make manual classification impractical, while supervised learning methods remain constrained by the scarcity of labeled spectroscopic data. We aim to develop a scalable, label-efficient method for astronomical classification by leveraging semi-supervised learning (SSL) to overcome the limitations of fully supervised approaches. We propose a novel SSL framework combining K-means clustering with random forest classification. Our method partitions unlabeled data into 50 clusters, propagates labels from spectroscopically confirmed centroids to 95% of cluster members, and trains a random forest on the expanded pseudo-labeled dataset. We applied this to the CPz catalog, containing multi-survey photometric and spectroscopic data, and compared performance with a fully supervised random forest. Our SSL approach achieves F1 scores of 98.8%, 98.9%, and 92.0% for stars, galaxies, and quasars, respectively, closely matching the supervised method with F1 scores of 99.1%, 99.1%, and 93.1%, while outperforming traditional color-cut techniques. The method demonstrates robustness in high-dimensional feature spaces and superior label efficiency compared to prior work. This work highlights SSL as a scalable solution for astronomical classification when labeled data is limited, though performance may be degraded in lower dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Euclid Quick Data Release (Q1) -- Spectroscopic search, classification and analysis of ultracool dwarfs in the Deep Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Near-Infrared Spectrometer and Photometer onboard the Euclid space mission has obtained near-infrared (NIR) slitless spectra of millions of objects, including hundreds of ultracool dwarfs. Euclid observations retrieve images and spectra simultaneously. This observing mode marks a new era in the discovery of new objects, such as L- and T-type dwarfs, which can be found from direct identification through the H2O and CH4 absorption bands. NISP spectral resolution (R~450) is enough to classify the objects by the spectral type using known standard templates. Q1 provided more than 4 million NIR spectra in one visit to the Euclid Deep Fields. The large amount of spectra released in these fields allowed us to: a) confirm the ultracool dwarf nature of almost half of the photometric candidates compiled by Zhang et al. (2024); b) discover at least 11 new late L- and T-type dwarfs by a specific spectral index search in Q1 data; and c) spectroscopically confirm one hundred more candidates from a new photometric selection conducted by Zerjal et al. (in prep.). We present a preliminary list of Euclid ultracool dwarf templates built by the combination of the best spectra from all these searches. We include the first spectral analysis of confirmed ultracool dwarfs from Q1 data; spectral classifications; determination of effective temperatures; H2O, CH4 and NH3 spectral indices; and measurements of the KI absorption doublet. This paper is a first step in the study of Euclid ultracool dwarfs and will be improved with each subsequent data release.</description>

      <title>Cluster Lensing Mass Inversion (CLUMI+): Combining Dynamics and Weak Lensing around Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04694v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present CLUMI+, a self-consistent, multiprobe methodology for reconstructing the mass distribution in and around galaxy clusters by combining gravitational lensing and dynamical observations. Building on the joint likelihood framework of K. Umetsu (2013), CLUMI+ integrates weak-lensing shear and magnification data with projected escape velocity measurements in the cluster infall region, yielding tighter constraints on the gravitational potential without relying on equilibrium assumptions. The mass distribution is modeled using a flexible, piecewise-defined convergence profile that characterizes the azimuthally averaged surface mass density within the lensing field, transitioning to a projected power-law form at larger radii where phase-space constraints complement lensing. Additional strong-lensing constraints are incorporated via central aperture-mass measurements, enabling full-scale mass reconstruction from the cluster core to the outskirts. We validate CLUMI+ using synthetic weak-lensing and phase-space data for a massive cluster from the IllustrisTNG simulations, demonstrating unbiased recovery of projected and three-dimensional mass profiles and achieving 10%--30% improvement in precision at large radii. As a case study, we apply CLUMI+ to A2261, combining Subaru and Hubble Space Telescope weak+strong lensing data with spectroscopic measurements from the Hectospec Cluster Survey. This analysis demonstrates the power of multiprobe, equilibrium-free modeling for robust cluster mass reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Polarisation as a probe of neutrino emission from blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The source of extragalactic neutrinos in the TeV-PeV range is a matter of very active research, with blazar jets having been postulated to be the origin of at least some of the detections. The blazar PKS 0735+178 is a prominent example; during its multi-band flare in late 2021 a neutrino event was reported by four observatories, with its origin consistent with the direction of that source. While no new jet component was observed to be ejected during that narrow time-frame, our analysis shows that a propagating shock front originating from the core region was the likely source of the multi-band flare, using very-long-baseline interferometry images of PKS 0735+178 in polarised light. Taken together, our findings are suggestive of a coherent scenario in which the shock may contribute to the acceleration of protons, with the target photons potentially originating either from the ambient medium surrounding the jet or from proton synchrotron radiation. The necessary conditions for neutrino emission via proton-photon interactions are, hence, present in this jet.</description>
