      <title>$\overline{\Sigma}^{\pm}$ production in pp and p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV with ALICE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse momentum spectra and integrated yields of $\overline{\Sigma}^{\pm}$ have been measured in pp and p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 5.02$ TeV with the ALICE experiment. Measurements are performed via the newly accessed decay channel $\overline{\Sigma}^{\pm} \rightarrow {\rm\overline{n}}\pi^{\pm}$. A new method of antineutron reconstruction with the PHOS electromagnetic spectrometer is developed and applied to this analysis. The $p_{\rm T}$ spectra of $\overline{\Sigma}^{\pm}$ are measured in the range $0.5 &lt; p_{\rm T} &lt; 3$ GeV/$c$ and compared to predictions of the PYTHIA 8, DPMJET, PHOJET, EPOS LHC and EPOS4 models. The EPOS LHC and EPOS4 models provide the best descriptions of the measured spectra both in pp and p-Pb collisions, while models which do not account for multiparton interactions provide a considerably worse description at high $p_{\rm T}$. The total yields of $\overline{\Sigma}^{\pm}$ in both pp and p-Pb collisions are compared to predictions of the Thermal-FIST model and dynamical models PYTHIA 8, DPMJET, PHOJET, EPOS LHC and EPOS4. All models reproduce the total yields in both colliding systems within uncertainties. The nuclear modification factors $R_{\rm pPb}$ for both $\overline{\Sigma}^{+}$ and $\overline{\Sigma}^{-}$ are evaluated and compared to those of protons, $\Lambda$ and $\Xi$ hyperons, and predictions of EPOS LHC and EPOS4 models. No deviations of $R_{\rm pPb}$ for $\overline{\Sigma}^{\pm}$ from the model predictions or measurements for other hadrons are found within uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Medium-induced modification of azimuthal correlations of electrons from heavy-flavor hadron decays with charged particles in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}} = 5.02}$ TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The azimuthal-correlation distributions between electrons from the decays of heavy-flavor hadrons and associated charged particles in Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV are reported for the 0-10% and 30-50% centrality classes. This is the first measurement to provide access to the azimuthal-correlation observables in the heavy-flavor sector in Pb-Pb collisions. The analysis is performed for trigger electrons from heavy-flavor hadron decays with transverse momentum $4 &lt; p_{\rm T}^{\rm e} &lt; 16$ GeV/$c$, considering associated particles within the transverse-momentum range $1 &lt; p_{\rm T}^{\rm assoc} &lt; 7$ GeV/$c$, and a pseudorapidity difference of $|\Delta\eta| &lt; 1$ between the trigger electron and associated particles. The per-trigger nuclear modification factor ($I_{\rm AA}$) is calculated to compare the near- and away-side peak yields to those in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ TeV. In 0-10% central collisions, the $I_{\rm AA}$ indicates a hint of enhancement of associated-particle yields with $p_{\rm T} &lt; 3$ GeV/$c$ on the near side, and a suppression of yields with $p_{\rm T} &gt; 4$ GeV/$c$ on the away side. The $I_{\rm AA}$ for electron triggers from heavy-flavor hadron decays is compared with that for light-flavor and strange-particle triggers to investigate the dependence on different fragmentation processes and parton-medium dynamics, and is found to be the same within uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Precise Measurement of $^{216}$Po Half-life with Exact Parent-daughter Pairing in PandaX-4T</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a precise measurement of $^{216}\rm Po$ half-life using the PandaX-4T liquid xenon time projection chamber (TPC). $^{220}\rm Rn $, emanating from a $^{228}\rm Th $ calibration source, is injected to the detector and undergoes successive $\alpha$ decays, first to $^{216}\rm Po$ and then to $^{212}\rm Pb$. PandaX-4T detector measures the 5-dimensional (5D) information of each decay, including time, energy, and 3-dimensional positions. Therefore, we can identify the $^{220}\rm Rn $ and $^{216}\rm Po$ decay events and pair them exactly to extract the lifetime of each $^{216}\rm Po$. With a large data set and high-precision $^{220}\rm $Rn-$^{216}\rm $Po pairing technique, we measure the $^{216}\rm Po$ half-life to be $143.7\pm0.5$ ms, which is the most precise result to date and agrees with previously published values. The leading precision of this measurement demonstrates the power of 5D calorimeter and the potential of exact parent-daughter pairing in the xenon TPC.</description>

      <title>Parton Distribution Functions and their Generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article is an introduction to parton distribution functions and their generalizations which describe the quark and gluon structure of hadrons, and can be measured in various high-energy scattering processes. We provide the theoretical background, highlight both historical and recent developments, explain the connections between the different functions, and expose in which processes these functions can be accessed and what we can learn from them about hadron structure.</description>

      <title>Search for jet quenching with dijets from high-multiplicity pPb collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first measurement of the dijet transverse momentum balance $x_j$ in proton-lead (pPb) collisions at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 8.16 TeV is presented. The $x_j$ observable, defined as the ratio of the subleading over leading jet transverse momentum in a dijet pair, is used to search for jet quenching effects. The data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 174.6 nb$^{-1}$, were collected with the CMS detector in 2016. The $x_j$ distributions and their average values are studied as functions of the charged-particle multiplicity of the events and for various dijet rapidity selections. The latter enables probing hard scattering of partons carrying distinct nucleon momentum fractions $x$ in the proton- and lead-going directions. The former, aided by the high-multiplicity triggers, allows probing for potential jet quenching effects in high-multiplicity events (with up to 400 charged particles), for which collective phenomena consistent with quark-gluon plasma (QGP) droplet formation were previously observed. The ratios of $x_j$ distributions for high- to low-multiplicity events are used to quantify the possible medium effects. These ratios are consistent with simulations of the hard-scattering process that do not include QGP production. These measurements set an upper limit on medium-induced energy loss of the subleading jet of 1.26% of its transverse momentum at the 90% confidence level in high multiplicity pPb events.</description>

      <title>Reaction mechanism of quasi-free knockout processes in exotic RI beam era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quasi-free nucleon knockout reaction has been revealed the single-particle nature of nuclei. Thanks to the advances in experimental techniques and reaction theory, various new aspects of nuclei are being revealed by knockout reactions. In this article, we review the basic concept of the quasi-free knockout reaction, and recent achievements in the SEASTAR project using the MINOS system. We also present our new findings on the low-energy nucleon knockout reaction and the $\alpha$ knockout reaction. The combination of the (microscopic) structure theory, reaction theory and experiments will be the key to a complete understanding of the $\alpha$ formation and its universality in the coming decades. Noble clusters, e.g., $d$, $t$, $^{3}$He, etc. are in the scope of the ONOKORO project. The implementation of the two (and more) nucleon correlation in the reaction theory is essential to connect the properties of such clusters and the reaction observables. A new framework, CDCCIA, is introduced for this purpose, which will also be applicable to the two-nucleon knockout reactions, e.g., $(p,3p)$, $(p,2pn)$, and $(p,p2n)$.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Cold QCD: Review and Future Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This review examines data from hadron-nucleus collisions, primarily focusing on hard processes like Drell-Yan, heavy flavor and quarkonium production. It highlights observed modifications of particle yields as functions of momentum and rapidity, aiming to clarify the underlying QCD effects in cold nuclear matter (CNM). The paper outlines strategies for future experiments, including the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC), to distinguish between these effects. Key questions address the universality of suppression mechanisms and the role of non-perturbative physics, providing a road map for upcoming nuclear data.</description>
