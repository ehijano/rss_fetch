      <title>Prediction of Ambient-Pressure High-Temperature Superconductivity in Doped Transition-Metal Hydrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for conventional superconductors with high transition temperatures ($T_c$) has largely focused on intrinsically metallic compounds. In this work, we explore the potential of intrinsically non-metallic compounds to exhibit high-$T_c$ superconductivity under ambient pressure through carrier doping. We identify $\rm MgAlFeH_6$, a representative of carrier-doped transition-metal hydrides like $\rm Mg_2FeH_6$, as a promising example with a predicted $T_c \approx 130~\rm K$. We propose that the average projected electron density of states, defined as the geometric mean of the total and hydrogen-projected density of states at the Fermi level, serves as a simple and computationally inexpensive indicator of high-$T_c$ behavior. We also highlight the tradeoff between high-$T_c$ and dynamic stability, both of which depend on the electron density of states. Our findings thus expand the pool of potential superconducting materials and offer a practical route for accelerating the discovery of superconductors suitable for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Theoretical study of the electronic correlation and superconducting pairing in La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ film grown on SrLaAlO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the electronic correlation effects in La$_{2.85}$Pr$_{0.15}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ film grown on SrLaAlO$_4$ by fluctuation-exchange approximation. The $\gamma$ and $\delta$ bands are found to shift down with correlation while their Fermi surfaces become highly damped and cannot to be resolved experimentally. In contrast, the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Fermi surfaces do not vary much with correlation and they are sharp enough to be detected in experiments. The spin susceptibility peaks at a wave vector in the odd channel, connecting the symmetric $\gamma$ band and the asymmetric $\delta$ band. The superconducting pairing symmetry is robustly $s$-wave and the $\delta$ band has the largest pairing magnitude. All the findings suggest a dominant role of the $3d_{z^{2}}$ orbital in this material.</description>

      <title>Anomalous superconductivity and unusual normal state properties of bilayer and twisted graphene (Brief review)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that the Kohn--Luttinger superconductivity mechanism interplaying with other types of ordering can be implemented in systems with a hexagonal lattice. A number of unusual properties of such systems in the normal phase have also been considered. Our previous results on Kohn--Luttinger superconductivity with $p$-, $d$-, and $f$-wave pairing in monolayer and AB bilayer graphene, obtained disregarding the effect of substrate potential and impurities, have been presented in the first part. Then, the interplay of the superconducting Kohn--Luttinger state with the spin density wave state in actual AB, AA, and twisted bilayer graphene has been discussed in detail. In the last parts, a number of anomalous properties in the normal phase and the appearance of nematic superconductivity alongside with the spin density wave in the twisted bilayer graphene have been presented.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity emerging from the N${\'e}$el state in ${\it infinite}$-${\it stage}$ single-layer cuprate La$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In copper oxides (cuprates) with single CuO$_2$ layer such as La$_{2-x}$Ba(Sr)$_x$CuO$_4$, antiferromagnetism coexists with superconductivity at small doping levels $x$, where chemical disorders are significant. Here, we report that superconductivity occurs in a uniform and fully ordered N${\'e}$el state in a single-layer cuprate La$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ with a small amount of excess oxygen $(\delta = 0.015)$ as demonstrated by the $^{139}$La nuclear quadrupole resonance measurement. A uniform oxygen distribution in the crystal is crucial for achieving microscopic phase coexistence and overcoming the miscibility gap associated with the staging instability; self-organized periodic oxygen arrangement driven by mobile oxygen atoms. This finding prompts the reconsideration of superconductivity in cuprates, highlighting that it can emerge in a robust N${\'e}$el state that retains sizable magnetic moments and hosts only a small carrier density.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle interaction originating from Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces under pressure in 18%-S substituted FeSe studied via NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: S-substituted FeSe superconductors in the tetragonal phase display several unique features among iron-based superconductors, particularly the presence of zero-energy excitations in the superconducting (SC) state.The recent concept of Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces (BFSs), a theoretical model describing ultranodal states, has attracted considerable interest. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies on FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ (x=0.18) have revealed an anomalous low-energy spin fluctuations deep in the SC state. The low-energy spin fluctuations are enhanced with decreasing temperature, supporting strong Bogoliubov quasiparticle interactions associated with BFSs. Here, we further investigate these correlation effects through $^{77}$Se-NMR measurements of FeSe$_{1-x}$S$_x$ (x=0.18) under pressures up to 2.0 GPa and temperatures down to ~100 mK. The results demonstrate that the anomalous enhancement is suppressed but persists under pressure, implying that quasiparticle interactions become weak by applying pressure. Furthermore, spin fluctuations in the normal state exhibit different temperature dependence from those deep in the SC state, suggesting that the nesting properties of normal electrons differ from those of Bogoliubov quasiparticles. These findings are consistent with the theoretical model of BFSs with C$_2$ symmetry and strengthen evidence for Bogoliubov quasiparticle interactions, providing insights into the unconventional pairing state of this system.</description>

      <title>Pairing without $\gamma$-Pocket in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ ultrathin film at ambient pressure has aroused great research interest. The $\gamma$-pocket formed by the bonding $d_{z^2}$ band, which was previously proposed to be crucial in the pairing mechanism of pressurized bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, is reported to be either present or absent here by different experimental groups, giving rise to the problem: what is the pairing mechanism and pairing nature without the $\gamma$-pocket? Here, we start from a band structure obtained via density-functional-theoretical calculation, which exhibits no $\gamma$-pocket. Then, equipped with electron interactions, we study the pairing nature via combined weak- and strong- coupling approaches, which provide consistent results. In the weak-coupling study, the nesting between the $\alpha$- and $\beta$- pockets leads to an $s^\pm$-wave pairing in which the gap signs on the two pockets are opposite, as provided by our random-phase-approximation based calculations. In real-space, the pairing pattern is dominated by the interlayer pairing of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital. In the strong-coupling study, as the $d_{z^2}$ orbitals are nearly half-filled and hence localized, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals carry the HTSC. Driven by the interlayer superexchange transferred from the $d_{z^2}$ orbital through the Hund's rule coupling, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital electrons form interlayer $s$-wave pairing, as suggested by our slave-boson-mean-field study on the related two-orbital $t$-$J$ model. Projected onto the Fermi surface, this pairing just gives the $s^\pm$-wave pattern consistent with that obtained in the weak-coupling study. Our result is consistent with that obtained in recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiment.</description>

      <title>Geometric Superfluid Weight in Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometric contribution to the superfluidity in quasicrystals in which the conventional momentum-space quantum geometric tensor cannot be defined due to the lack of translational invariance. Based on the correspondence between the momentum and magnetic flux, we introduce the flux-space quantum metric in finite-size closed systems and reveal its contribution to the superfluid weight in quasicrystalline superconductors. As a toy model, we study the attractive Hubbard model on the Fibonacci quasiperiodic stub lattices that host flat energy spectra even in the presence of quasiperiodic hoppings. In the weak-coupling limit, we establish the relation between superfluid weight and the flux-space quantum metric in quasicrystal superconductors with flat energy spectra. Moreover, by analyzing the spread of Wannier functions, we propose a general fluctuation mechanism that explains how quasiperiodicity modulates the integrated flux-space quantum metric. Our theory provides a general way to examine the effect of the quantum geometry in systems lacking translational symmetry.</description>

      <title>Finite-momentum mixed singlet-triplet pairing in chiral antiferromagnets induced by even-parity spin texture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-relativistic spin-splitting in unconventional antiferromagnets has garnered much attention for its promising spintronic applications and open fundamental questions. Here, we uncover a unique even-parity spin texture in chiral non-collinear antiferromagnets, exemplified using a kagome lattice. We consider two distinct types of electrons in the system: one with Schr\"odinger-like dispersion and the other exhibiting Dirac-like behavior. Remarkably, we show that, for both electron types, this spin texture induces an exotic coexistence of opposite-spin singlet and equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs with finite momentum when proximity-coupled to conventional superconductors. The triplet pairing arises from the intrinsic spin rotation of the antiferromagnet and does not require net magnetization or spin-orbit coupling. Moreover, we identify an unprecedented and tunable phase difference between singlet and triplet pairings, controllable through junction orientation. This mixed pairing state can be experimentally probed via damped oscillations in order parameters and 0-$\pi$ transitions in Josephson junctions. Additionally, we analyze the effect of out-of-plane spin canting, elucidating its role in generating spin-polarized supercurrents, and discuss Mn$_3$Ga and Mn$_3$Ge to test our predictions.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Analysis of the Field-Free Josephson Diode Effect in a Multilayered Josephson Junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect (JDE) is a novel phenomenon in which a superconducting junction exhibits asymmetric Josephson currents with respect to the superconducting phase difference. In this study, we theoretically investigate how the interplay between a static exchange field and Rashba spin-orbit interaction (RSOI) influences the JDE. By employing the quasiclassical Green's function method and perturbative calculations, we derive analytical expressions for the Josephson current in a junction composed of a ferromagnetic layer and a normal metal with RSOI. Remarkably, the JDE is found to emerge even in the absence of any external magnetic field. In this regime, the Josephson current is exclusively carried by spin-triplet Cooper pairs, as spin-singlet components are strongly suppressed by the ferromagnet. Furthermore, our results show that the efficiency of the JDE can be enhanced by tuning the thickness of the normal metal and the strength of the RSOI. These findings offer valuable theoretical guidelines for the design of superconducting devices exhibiting nonreciprocal transport effects.</description>

      <title>Localized Edge States in Stacked Al/Ni Multilayers: Possible Evidence of Chiral Hinge Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we report experimental evidence suggesting the emergence of robust, possibly chiral, edge states in artificially engineered multilayers composed of alternating nanometer-thick layers of nonmagnetic aluminum (Al) and ferromagnetic nickel (Ni). Using phase-sensitive Josephson interferometry, we observed distinct SQUID-like oscillations (instead of the conventional Fraunhofer patterns) in the maximum supercurrent versus in-plane probing magnetic field patterns, which can be associated with one-dimensional current-carrying modes localized at the sample boundaries. These results were obtained for multilayers consisting of up to ten Al/Ni bilayers sandwiched between superconducting Nb electrodes to form Josephson junctions. The spatially confined flow of supercurrent suggests the possible presence of chiral Andreev edge states reminiscent of those found in higher-order topological insulators, despite the absence of strong spin-orbit coupling or intrinsic topological band structure. The discovery of edge-localized charge transport in structures made of materials without intrinsic topological order challenges the prevailing understanding of topological phenomena and highlights the possibility of developing topological metamaterials as a tunable platform for exploring nontrivial edge physics.</description>

      <title>Differentiation of Site-Specific Symmetry Breaking Orders in Y$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+y}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid matter is classified through symmetry of ordering phenomena. Experimentally, this approach is straightforward, except when distinct orderings occur with identical or almost identical symmetry breaking. Here we show that the cuprate system Y$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+y}$ hosts two distinct orderings with almost identical translational symmetry breaking. Only when applying site-sensitive resonant elastic x-ray scattering (REXS), charge ordering can be conclusively differentiated from a super-lattice structure. These two orderings occur with almost the same in-plane symmetry but manifest at different atomic sites and display different temperature dependence. Differentiating these orders provides an important clue to the anomalous behavior of PrBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ within the 123-series of high-temperature superconductors. We conclude that the symmetry breaking at the Pr-site is unfavorable for superconducting pairing.</description>

      <title>Superconducting density of states of PtPb4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PtPb$_4$ is a type II superconductor with a bulk critical temperature $T_{c}\approx 3 $K and an upper critical field of $H_{c2}=0.36 $T. PtPb$_4$ is related to non-superconducting PtSn$_4$, which presents nodal arc states at the surface. Here we measure the superconducting density of states of PtPb$_4$ using millikelvin Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). We observe a fully opened superconducting gap of $\Delta=0.48$\ meV similar to expectations from Bardeen Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS) theory ($\Delta_0=1.76k_BT_{c}=0.49 $meV). Measurements under magnetic fields applied perpendicular to the surface show a spatially inhomogeneous gap structure, presenting superconducting signatures at fields as high as 1.5 T, significantly above $H_{c2}=0.36 $T. On some locations we find that the superconducting density of states does not vanish above $T_{c}$. We can find signatures of a superconducting gap up to 5K. We discuss possible reasons for the observation of superconducting properties above $T_{c}$ and $H_{c2}$, emphasizing the role played by structural defects.</description>

      <title>Topological chiral superconductivity from antiferromagnetic correlations in moir\'{e} bands with extreme spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the strong-correlation phenomenology observed near the superconducting phase in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$, we study multi-orbital $t$-$J$ models that are derived from different parameter regimes. The models contain effective antiferromagnetic interactions that are influenced by the strong underlying spin-orbit coupling. The possible superconducting pairing states are investigated in these models. We find that the preferred pairing order parameters are associated with the $^{1,2}E$ representations of the three-fold rotation symmetry operator $C_3$, with the $p\pm i p$ component intermixing with the $d\pm id$ component. The chiral superconducting states are shown to be topological, based on the Wilson loops of the corresponding Bogoliubov quasiparticles. We discuss the implications of our findings for experimental observations, as well as the new connections our results uncover between the moir\'{e} superconductivity and its counterpart in bulk quantum materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid scaling of superconducting quantum computers has highlighted the impact of device-level variability on overall circuit fidelity. In particular, fabrication-induced fluctuations in device parameters such as capacitance and Josephson critical current pose significant challenges to large-scale integration. We propose a simulation methodology for estimating qubit fidelity based on classical circuit simulation, using a conventional Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis (SPICE) simulator. This approach enables the evaluation of the performance of superconducting quantum circuits with 10000 qubits on standard laptop computers. The proposed method provides an accessible tool for the early stage assessment of large-scale superconducting quantum circuit performance.</description>

      <title>Characterizing local Majorana properties using Andreev states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose using Andreev bound states (ABS) as spectroscopic probes to characterize Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in quantum-dot based minimal Kitaev chains. Specifically, we show that tunneling conductance measurements with a superconducting probe hosting an ABS reveal four subgap peaks whose voltage positions and relative heights enable extraction of the MZM energy splitting and Bogoliubov-de Gennes coherence factors. This provides direct access to zero-splitting regimes and to the local Majorana polarization - a measure of the Majorana character. The method is compatible with existing experimental architectures and remains robust in extended chains.</description>

      <title>Measuring coherence factors of states in superconductors through local current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coherence factors of quasiparticles in a superconductor determine their properties, including transport and susceptibility to electric fields. In this work, we propose a way to infer the local coherence factors using local transport to normal leads. Our method is based on measuring the local current through a lead as the coupling to a second one is varied: the shape of the current is determined by the ratio between the local coherence factors, becoming independent of the coupling to the second lead in the presence of local electron-hole symmetry, {\it i.e.} coherence factors $|u|=|v|$. We apply our method to minimal Kitaev chains: arrays of quantum dots coupled via narrow superconducting segments. These chains feature Majorana-like quasiparticles (zero-energy states with $|u|=|v|$) at discrete points in parameter space. We demonstrate that the local current allows us to estimate the local Majorana polarization (MP)--a measurement of the local Majorana properties of the state. We derive an analytical expression for the MP in terms of local currents and benchmark it against numerical calculations for 2- and 3-sites chains that include a finite Zeeman field and electron-electron interactions. These results provide a way to quantitatively assess the quality of Majorana states in short Kitaev chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use density functional theory calculations to study simple but diverse stoichiometries within the novel chemical capacitor (CC) setup. We look at main effects occurring in this device, extremes of the physicochemical properties, and we study limits of applicability of this nano-object. In the cases studied, CC permits achieving charge transfer of up to 1.74 e per atom. Tuning of the charge transfer may be achieved via judicious choice of chemical constituents of the CC as well as use of a ferroelectric material as a separator layer. Different classes of chemical systems may be doped, including metallic and nonmetallic elements, and chemical compounds, in certain cases leading to the appearance of superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Superconducting flux concentrator coils for levitation of particles in the Meissner state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic levitation of superconductors is a promising platform to study quantum mechanics in the large-mass limit. One major limitation is the weak trapping potential, which results in low vibrational eigenfrequencies and increased susceptibility to low-frequency noise. While generating strong magnetic fields is relatively straightforward, creating a tightly confined harmonic potential - essentially achieving a large magnetic field gradient - remains a significant challenge. In this work, we demonstrate a potential solution using superconducting cores that concentrate magnetic flux into arbitrarily small volumes. We show the ability to trap superconducting particles using an anti-Helmholtz coil configuration incorporating these cores. However, we observe rapid damping of the levitated particle motion due to flux trapping within the cores, occurring once the lower critical field is exceeded locally. To investigate this mechanism, we employ diamond NV center magnetometry and detect substantial remanent fields persisting after high-current operation of the coils. Finally, we discuss possible strategies to mitigate this effect and improve the levitation properties.</description>

      <title>The feedback driven atomic scale Josephson microscope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12783v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ultimate spatial limit to establish a Josephson coupling between two superconducting electrodes is an atomic-scale junction. The Josephson effect in such ultrasmall junctions has been used to unveil new switching dynamics, study coupling close to superconducting bound states or reveal non-reciprocal effects. However, the Josephson coupling is weak and the sensitivity to temperature reduces the Cooper pair current magnitude. Here we show that a feedback element induces a time-dependent bistable regime which consists of spontaneous periodic oscillations between two different Cooper pair tunneling states (corresponding to the DC and AC Josephson regimes respectively). The amplitude of the time-averaged current within the bistable regime is almost independent of temperature. By tracing the periodic oscillations in the new bistable regime as a function of the position in a Scanning Tunneling Microscope, we obtain atomic scale maps of the critical current in 2H-NbSe$_2$ and find spatial modulations due to a pair density wave. Our results fundamentally improve our understanding of atomic size Josephson junctions including a feedback element in the circuit and provide a promising new route to study superconducting materials through atomic scale maps of the Josephson coupling.</description>

Abstract: A highly effective method of the device linearity calculation on the stage of the device development is worked out and reported. The method allows expressing the linearity in terms of the achievable spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of the created devices, in particular superconductive electronic devices, and therefore can be easy correlated with the obtained experimental data. The algorithm scheme and the method accuracy are considered and discussed in detail.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that rotation of a thin superconducting cylinder in the presence of a magnetic field can increase the critical temperature of the superconducting phase transition substantially. The phenomenon originates from interaction energy of the dipole magnetic moment of the normal component with the background magnetic field, which encourages the formation of condensate that decouples from mechanical rotation. We give quantitative estimates for a thin cylinder of aluminum.</description>

      <title>Topotactical Hydrogen Induced Single-Band $d$-wave Superconductivity in La$_2$NiO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: La$_2$NiO$_4$ is an antiferromagnetic insulator with a structural resemblance to its cuprate counterpart, La$_2$CuO$_4$. However, La$_2$CuO$_4$ has a Cu$^{2+}$ or 3$d^9$ electronic configuration that needs to be hole or electron doped for superconductivity, whereas La$_2$NiO$_4$ is 3$d^8$ with divalent Ni$^{2+}$. Making a cuprate analog through conventional electron doping is impractical due to the rarity of tetravalent substituents for trivalent La. Here, we propose an alternative route: intercalating topotactical hydrogen, which is possible through electric-field-controlled protonation and transforms La$_2$NiO$_4$ into a 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ single-band two-dimensional antiferromagnetic Mott insulator analogous to La$_2$CuO$_4$. This we find through density-functional theory and dynamical mean-field theory calculations. The furthergoing dynamical vertex approximation predicts that H-La$_2$NiO$_4$ can host $d$-wave superconductivity under 15\% hole doping with a critical temperature above 20\,K. Our findings not only suggest a new method for tuning the electronic structure of layered nickelates but also provide theoretical evidence for a new nickelate superconductor, awaiting experimental synthesis.</description>

      <title>Higher order Jacobi method for solving system of linear equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes a higher-order iterative framework for solving matrix equations, inspired by the structure and functionality of neural networks. A modification of the classical Jacobi iterative method is introduced to compute higher-order coefficient matrices through matrix-matrix multiplications. The resulting method, termed the higher order Jacobi method (HOJM), structurally resembles a shallow linear network and allows direct computation of the inverse of the coefficient matrix. Building on this, an iterative scheme is developed that allows efficient resolution of system variations without recomputing the coefficients, once the network parameters are trained for a known system. This iterative process naturally assumes the form of a deep recurrent neural network. The proposed approach goes beyond conventional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) by providing an explicit, training-free definition of network parameters rooted in physical and mathematical formulations. Computational analysis on GPU reveals significant enhancement in the order of complexity, highlighting a compelling and transformative direction for advancing algorithmic efficiency in solving linear systems. This methodology opens avenues for interpretable and scalable solutions to physically motivated problems in computational science.</description>

      <title>Intertwined Orders and the Physics of High Temperature Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complex phase diagrams are generic feature of quantum materials that display high temperature superconductivity. In addition to d-wave superconductivity (or other unconventional states), these phase diagrams typically include various forms of charge-ordered phases, including charge-density-waves and/or spin-density waves, and electronic nematic states. In most cases these phases have critical temperatures comparable in magnitude to that of the superconducting state, and appear in a "pseudo-gap" regime. In these systems the high temperature state is not a good metal with well-defined quasiparticles but a "strange metal". These states typically arise from doping a strongly correlated Mott insulator. With my collaborators we have identified these behaviors as a problem with "Intertwined Orders". A Pair-density wave is a type of superconducting state which embodies the physics of intertwined orders. Here I discus the phenomenology of intertwined orders and the quantum materials that are known to display these behaviors.</description>

      <title>The gauge theory dual of the bilayer XY model with second order Josephson coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19401v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a duality transformation for a bilayer XY model where the layers are coupled by second order Josephson effect, which favors inter-layer phase difference of either $0$ or $\pi$. The model may represent a bilayer superconductor or a spin-1 ferromagnetic Bose gas in the easy-plane limit. The second order Josephson term is mapped to a U(1) gauge field, known to be trivially confining in two dimensions, and we argue that a Coulomb-gas analysis is not applicable to the dual theory. Instead, we appeal to the vast knowledge of gauge theory and infer that the only phase transition out of low-temperature ordered phase is an Ising transition driven by condensation of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ domain wall loops. The domain wall loops can be seen as a surviving vestige of single-layer vortex-anti-vortex pair, heavily deformed by the second order Josephson coupling. A theoretical or computational method that concentrates on point defects would most likely miss out on these excitations and reach erroneous results. Our dual theory offers a clear, intuitive picture of how the second order Josephson coupling induces confinement of vortices and drastically changes the physics.</description>

      <title>Chiral superconductivity near a fractional Chern insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity arising from fully spin-polarized, repulsively interacting electrons can host intrinsically chiral Cooper pairs and Majorana zero modes, yet no concrete microscopic route to such a state has been established. Motivated by recent observations in twisted homobilayer MoTe$_2$ and rhombohedral pentalayer graphene, where fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) appear adjacent to spin-valley-polarized superconductors, we investigate a minimal model: spinless electrons in the lowest Landau level subject to a tunable periodic potential. Large-scale density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations reveal that, as the FCI gap closes, two nearly degenerate phases emerge before the system turns metallic: a chiral $f$-wave superconductor and a $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$ charge-density wave (CDW) whose energies differ by less than $1\%$. These two competing states mirror the superconducting and re-entrant integer quantum Hall (RIQH) phases observed experimentally near the FCI regime. The superconducting dome survives realistic Coulomb interaction, light doping, and various lattice geometry. Melting the FCI therefore provides a new mechanism for realizing spin-polarized chiral superconductivity and RIQH order. We predict that twisted MoTe$_2$ at larger twist angles will develop a superconducting dome even at filling $\nu = 2/3$, and suppressing this superconductivity with a magnetic field should drive the system into an RIQH state.</description>
