      <title>JWST-TST DREAMS: Secondary Atmosphere Constraints for the Habitable Zone Planet TRAPPIST-1 e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TRAPPIST-1 system offers one of the best opportunities to characterize temperate terrestrial planets beyond our own solar system. Within the TRAPPIST-1 system, planet e stands out as highly likely to sustain surface liquid water if it possesses an atmosphere. Recently, we reported the first JWST/NIRSpec PRISM transmission spectra of TRAPPIST-1 e, revealing significant stellar contamination, which varied between the four visits. Here, we assess the range of planetary atmospheres consistent with our transmission spectrum. We explore a wide range of atmospheric scenarios via a hierarchy of forward modeling and retrievals. We do not obtain strong evidence for or against an atmosphere. Our results weakly disfavor CO$_2$-rich atmospheres for pressures corresponding to the surface of Venus and Mars and the cloud tops of Venus at 2$\sigma$. We exclude H$_2$-rich atmospheres containing CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ in agreement with past work, but find that higher mean molecular weight, N$_2$-rich atmospheres with trace CO$_2$ and CH$_4$ are permitted by the data. Both a bare rock and N$_2$-rich atmospheric scenario provide adequate fits to the data, but do not fully explain all features, which may be due to either uncorrected stellar contamination or atmospheric signals. Ongoing JWST observations of TRAPPIST-1 e, exploiting consecutive transits with TRAPPIST-1 b, will offer stronger constraints via a more effective stellar contamination correction. The present work is part of the JWST Telescope Scientist Team (JWST-TST) Guaranteed Time Observations, which is performing a Deep Reconnaissance of Exoplanet Atmospheres through Multi-instrument Spectroscopy (DREAMS).</description>

      <title>JWST-TST DREAMS: NIRSpec/PRISM Transmission Spectroscopy of the Habitable Zone Planet TRAPPIST-1 e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TRAPPIST-1 e is one of the very few rocky exoplanets that is both amenable to atmospheric characterization and that resides in the habitable zone of its star -- located at a distance from its star such that it might, with the right atmosphere, sustain liquid water on its surface. Here, we present a set of 4 JWST/NIRSpec PRISM transmission spectra of TRAPPIST-1 e obtained from mid to late 2023. Our transmission spectra exhibit similar levels of stellar contamination as observed in prior works for other planets in the TRAPPIST-1 system (Lim et al, 2023; Radica et al., 2024), but over a wider wavelength range, showcasing the challenge of characterizing the TRAPPIST-1 planets even at relatively long wavelengths (3-5 um). While we show that current stellar modeling frameworks are unable to explain the stellar contamination features in our spectra, we demonstrate that we can marginalize over those features instead using Gaussian Processes, which enables us to perform novel exoplanet atmospheric inferences with our transmission spectra. In particular, we are able to rule out cloudy, primary H$_2$-dominated ($\gtrsim$ 80$\%$ by volume) atmospheres at better than a 3$\sigma$ level. Constraints on possible secondary atmospheres on TRAPPIST-1 e are presented in a companion paper (Glidden et al., 2025). Our work showcases how JWST is breaking ground into the precisions needed to constrain the atmospheric composition of habitable-zone rocky exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive Analyses of the Strongly Carbon-chain Depleted Comets in Lowell Observatory's Narrowband Photometry Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present measurements, analyses and results for the seventeen strongly carbon-chain depleted comets in Lowell Observatory's narrowband photometry database. The majority of comets exhibit a very similar, i.e. typical, composition in optical wavelengths, though the existence of anomalous comets with lower abundances of carbon-chain molecules relative to CN has long been known. M. F. A'Hearn et al. (1995) identified an entire class of these carbon-chain depleted comets, and the most recent full analysis of our database reveals there are varying degrees of carbon-chain depletion. Here we focus on the most depleted comets, the strongly carbon-chain depleted class, which is the largest non-typical compositional class to emerge from our taxonomic analyses. All comets in this class are strongly depleted in both C2 and C3 with respect to OH and CN, with depletions for these ratios being 3-27x below the mean abundance ratios for comets with typical composition. Several comets in this class additionally exhibit depletion in NH, with the largest depletions being 11x below mean typical values. A number of these comets exhibit asymmetry in production rates as a function of time and heliocentric distance, and one exhibits evidence of small secular changes. Almost all of the strongly depleted comets are Jupiter-family comets, indicating a Kuiper belt origin for this compositional class. Multiple lines of evidence from our full database indicate this composition is due to primordial conditions when and where these comets were formed and is not due to thermal heating after their arrival in the inner solar system.</description>

      <title>Six microlensing planets detected via sub-day signals during the 2023 -- 2024 season</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present analyses of six microlensing events: KMT-2023-BLG-0548, KMT-2023-BLG-0830, KMT-2023-BLG-0949, KMT-2024-BLG-1281, KMT-2024-BLG-2059, and KMT-2024-BLG-2242. These were identified in KMTNet data from the 2023 -- 2024 seasons, selected for exhibiting anomalies shorter than one day -- potential signatures of low-mass planetary companions. Detailed modeling of the light curves reveals that the anomalies in all six events are caused by planetary companions to the lenses. The brief durations of the anomalies are attributed to various factors: a low planet-to-host mass ratio (KMT-2024-BLG-2059, KMT-2024-BLG-2242), a wide planet-host separation (KMT-2023-BLG-0548), small and elongated caustics restricting the source's interaction region (KMT-2023-BLG-0830, KMT-2024-BLG-1281), and a partial caustic crossing (KMT-2023-BLG-0949). { For KMT-2023-BLG-0548, the Bayesian posterior distribution of the lens mass shows two distinct peaks: a low-mass solution indicating a sub-Jovian planet orbiting an M dwarf in the Galactic disk, and a high-mass solution suggesting a super-Jovian planet around a K-type dwarf in the bulge. KMT-2023-BLG-0830 hosts a Neptune-mass planet orbiting an M dwarf in the Galactic bulge. KMT-2023-BLG-0949 involves a super-Jovian planet orbiting a $\sim 0.5~M_\odot$ host located at $\sim 6$ kpc. KMT-2024-BLG-2059Lb is a super-Earth with a mass about seven times that of Earth, orbiting an early M dwarf of $\sim 0.5~M_\odot$. KMT-2024-BLG-1281L hosts a planet slightly more massive than Neptune, orbiting an M dwarf of $\sim 0.3~M_\odot$. The short timescale and small angular Einstein radius of KMT-2024-BLG-2242 suggest a $\sim 0.07~M_\odot$ primary, likely a brown dwarf, with a Uranus/Neptune-mass planet.</description>

      <title>ATLAS Photometry of Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present calibrated ATLAS photometry of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) from 28 March through 29 Aug 2025, obtained with the five-site, robotic ATLAS network in the c (420-650~nm), o (560-820~nm), and Teide w (420-720~nm) bands. Stacked difference images yield reliable light curves measured in four fixed apertures that capture the evolving coma. We observe 3I/ATLAS transitioning in color from red (c-o)~0.7 before MJD 60860 to near-solar (c-o)~0.3 after MJD 60870, coincident with the appearance of a prominent anti-solar tail. The absolute magnitude curve H(t) shows a slope break near MJD 60890 at r~3.3 au from -0.035 to -0.014 mag/day, or in terms of coma cross section as a function of heliocentric distance, r^{-3.9} to r^{-1.2}. We interpret the evolution as a shift from dust lifted from a reddened surface to production of small, optically bright icy grains and changing coma optical depth. We release the aperture photometry with geometry and uncertainties to enable cross-instrument synthesis of 3I/ATLAS activity and color evolution.</description>

      <title>Non-Linear Solar EUV-Driven Sodium Release from the Lunar Surface: A Contrast to the Linear PSD Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correlation between solar Extreme Ultra-Violet (EUV) radiation above 8.8 eV and the release of sodium from the lunar surface via photon-stimulated desorption (PSD) is investigated. We use simultaneous measurements of EUV photon flux and Na optical spectral line flux ($F_{Na}$) from the lunar exosphere. Data were acquired with the high-resolution (R$\sim$72000) Echelle Spectrograph on the 2.34-m Vainu Bappu Telescope during the lunar first quarter (January-March 2024), observing $Na\,I$ D2 and D1 flux at altitudes below $\sim590\,km$ from the surface. Simultaneous EUV and FUV measurements were acquired from the GOES-R Series Extreme Ultraviolet Sensor (EUVS), while NUV data were obtained from the Total and Spectral Solar Irradiance Sensor-1 (TSIS-1) aboard the ISS. We correlated $F_{Na}$ with EUV photon flux from EUVS across six bands spanning $256-1405\,\text{\r{A}}$ (48.5-8.8 eV) and NUV (2000-4000 $\text{\r{A}}$) from TSIS-1. A non-linear rise in lunar exospheric sodium with increasing EUV and FUV fluxes was observed, contrasting with previous linear PSD models. The EUV radiation above 10 eV drives sodium release, with 256-304 $\text{\r{A}}$ wavelengths as dominant contributors. Additionally, the NUV flux and $F_{Na}$ are positively correlated, indicating the role of sodium release. The zenith column density averages $3.3\times10^{9}$ atoms cm$^{-2}$, with Characteristic temperatures averaging at $\sim$6700K and scale heights of $\sim$1500 km. Elevated temperatures and sodium densities during solar activity suggest enhanced Na release during flares. These results emphasize the need for a revised PSD model above 8.8 eV and improved constraints on the PSD cross-section.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present a preliminary orbit for the satellite of dwarf planet (136472) Makemake, based on archival Hubble Space Telescope images taken on 13 days between April 2015 and February 2019. The satellite was detected on twelve of them. A best-fit circular orbit has a period of $18.023 \pm 0.017$ d, a semi-major axis of $22250 \pm 780$ km, and an inclination of $83.7^{\circ} \pm 1.0^{\circ}$ relative to the line of sight. That orbit is nearly edge-on, raising the possibility of ongoing or imminent mutual events between Makemake and its satellite.</description>

      <title>Long-term monitoring of a dynamically new comet C/2020 V2 (ZTF)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comet C/2020 V2 (ZTF) is categorized as a dynamically new long-period comet, making its first approach to the inner Solar system. We have observed this comet for around 32 months (from January 2022 to July 2024) at heliocentric distances from 5.41 au (pre-perihelion) to 5.26 au (post-perihelion) through various telescopes, employing photometric (60 epochs) and spectroscopic techniques (5 epochs). Using these observations, we derived the production rates of different molecules such as CN$(0-0)$, C$_2(\Delta \nu=0)$, and C$_3$ and calculated the production rate ratios. The values of the ratios closest to the perihelion are found to be $\log$ (C$_2/$CN) $ = -0.04 \pm 0.03$ and $\log$ (C$_3/$CN) $ = -0.70 \pm 0.04$, which implies a typical carbon composition. The mean photometric broadband colours are found to be $B-V = 0.77\pm0.04$, $V-R = 0.43\pm0.04$, $R-I = 0.42\pm0.06$, and $B-R = 1.19\pm0.04$. The stability of the molecular production rate ratios and mean photometric broadband colours, pre- and post-perihelion, implies a homogeneous composition. The mean reflectivity gradient for $B-V$ colour is $10.90 \pm 3.62$ $\%/1000$ \AA; $V-R$ colour is $6.15 \pm 3.51$ $\%/1000$ \AA; and for $R-I$ colour is $4.94 \pm 3.56$ $\%/1000$ \AA\ which is similar to the mean value of the dynamically new comets. Additionally, using an asymmetric non-gravitational force model, we report the comet's nuclear radius to be $1.1 \pm 0.1$ km. Our results are expected to provide inputs to the selection of a potential dynamically new comet as a target for the Comet Interceptor mission.</description>

      <title>Capture of Interstellar Objects and Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar objects (ISOs) can become gravitationally bound to the solar system, enabling multiple observations. If these bound ISOs exist, they provide valuable opportunities to generalize models of planetesimal formation, composition, and ejection beyond our solar system. We explore two mechanisms for ISO capture: gravitational braking (primarily with Jupiter) and the Hills mechanism with the Sun. Using N-body simulations, we investigate ISO capture rates, ejection probabilities, and the resulting orbital elements. Our simulations suggest that approximately 10 ISOs may currently be bound to the solar system, with the vast majority captured through gravitational braking by Jupiter. These objects are bound by a Tisserand parameter with respect to Jupiter less than three, tend to have high eccentricities, semi-major axes larger than Jupiter's, and inclinations modestly biased toward the prograde direction. This region is sparsely populated by observed solar system objects. By comparing known solar system objects to the most probable orbital elements of our simulated ISOs, we identify 18 candidate objects in the current solar system population that may be bound ISOs captured by Jupiter. For the Hills mechanism, we find it to be a viable but less common capture pathway, typically producing isotropic inclinations and perihelia less than one au. Based on these characteristics, we identify seven additional candidate objects for ISOs captured through the Hills mechanism.</description>

      <title>GPI+SPHERE detection of a 6.1MJup circumbinary planet around HD 143811</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Owing to its sensitivity to wide-orbit giant exoplanets, direct imaging is uniquely positioned to shed light on the interplay between proto-planetary disks and stellar hosts. Besides constraining formation models, new detections are natural benchmarks for atmospheric characterization. Aims. The COBREX project performed an extensive reanalysis of archival observations from SPHERE and GPI using advanced post-processing techniques, enhancing detection sensitivity at close separation. Newly found companion candidates are being followed up to confirm new planets. Methods. Following the detection of a companion candidate around the young ($\sim 15$ Myr) binary star HD 143811, we collected a new observation with SPHERE@VLT ($0.95-1.67 {\mu}$m) to confirm the presence of the source and to assess its physical bond to the target. Results. We report the discovery of a new exoplanet orbiting HD 143811 at a projected separation of $0.43" \sim 60$ au. Thanks to a 9-yr-long baseline, we derive a mostly face-on and low eccentricity orbit with a period of $320^{+250}_{-90}$ years. The luminosity of the planet, constrained through H-band spectrum from GPI, H-band photometry from SPHERE/IRDIS and YJ upper limits from SPHERE/IFS, allows us to place strong constraints on the planet's intrinsic temperature ($T_{int} = 1000 \pm 30$K), corresponding to a mass of $6.1^{+0.7}_{-0.9}$ MJup. Conclusions. HD 143811(AB)b is the second planet ever discovered by GPI; it joins the small cohort of circumbinary planets discovered through imaging, becoming a prime target for follow-up formation, dynamical, and characterization studies.</description>

      <title>An updated catalog of HIRES/Keck radial velocity measurements. Including Ca II H&amp;K measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first HIRES/Keck precision radial velocity (RV) catalog was released in 2017; it was followed by a second release in 2019, which incorporated corrections for small but significant systematic errors. The manifestation of stellar activity accompanied by systematic errors could affect the detection of exoplanets via the RV method. We expanded the HIRES catalog to March 2023 using publicly available spectra. Furthermore, we included the chromospheric emission line Ca II H&amp;K indicator ($R_{\mathrm{HK}}^\prime$), which is among the most prominent tracers of stellar activity. The precision RVs were obtained using an iodine gas absorption cell and corrected for minor systematic errors. $R_{\mathrm{HK}}^\prime$ measurements were derived by rectifying the observed spectra with PHOENIX synthetic spectra models in six narrow bands surrounding the H and K lines, then subtracting the photospheric contribution. We present an updated HIRES/Keck precision RV catalog featuring 78,920 RV measurements for 1,702 stars. High-quality $R_{\mathrm{HK}}^\prime$ measurements are provided for ~ 40% of the HIRES catalog. The updated catalog can help distinguish stellar activity effects from planetary signals in RV time series, thereby corroborating previously detected planetary candidates and aiding in the detection of new ones.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Evaluation of the delta-Eddington, Hapke, and Shkuratov Models for Predicting the Albedo and Inferring the Grain Radius of Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the physical properties of ices across the solar system is essential for understanding the surface dynamics, volatile transport, and climate evolution on ice-covered planetary bodies. Here, we use well-constrained measurements of snow that has metamorphosed into coarse-grained firn and bubbly glacier ice in East Antarctica to test three commonly-used radiative transfer models: delta-Eddington, Hapke, and Shkuratov. Using the measured optical properties, we find that the delta-Eddington model generally shows the least deviation from the measured albedo, followed by the Shkuratov and Hapke models, respectively. But when the models are used to infer the grain radius using the measured albedo, the Shkuratov model provides closer best-fit grain radii (off by average factor 0.9) than delta-Eddington (0.6), and Hapke (1.8). Despite this, the spectral albedos estimated by the Shkuratov and Hapke models using their respective best-fit grain radii deviate more from the measurements than delta-Eddington. This result is caused by the Hapke and Shkuratov models not accounting for: (1) the increased absorption within dense ice, and (2) specular reflection at the surface of firn and ice. Additionally, all three models do not account for the nonsphericity of bubbles within ice. The combination of these factors leads to model errors generally increasing with increasing grain radius. Based on our quantitative comparison, we recommend using the delta-Eddington model for predicting the albedo and inferring the grain radius of ices across the solar system because it generally produces the least error while using realistic physical parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of a third interstellar object (ISO) 3I/ATLAS, following 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, has raised questions about the nature and origin of these enigmatic objects. With the Vera C. Rubin Observatory expected to discover dozens of new ISOs over the next decade, it is timely to use a classification scheme for their nature in the context of the recently proposed Loeb scale. Here, we provide a formalism for ranking ISOs quantitatively on the Loeb Scale in analogy to Sagan's formalism for mapping the Kardashev scale based on the energy output of technological civilizations.</description>

      <title>Toward Alternative Earths' Habitability of Solar System Bodies at Earth's Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first structured evaluation of Solar System bodies hypothetically relocated to Earth orbit (1 AU) to assess their potential as alternative habitats. Using comparative criteria, planetary size and gravity, atmospheric retention, volatile accessibility, weather system potential, soil development feasibility, and orbital transfer cost. We find that most bodies are unsuitable. Mercury and the Moon lack volatiles and atmospheres, while gas and ice giants offer no solid surfaces. Venus, despite strong atmospheric retention, remains constrained by extreme greenhouse forcing. Mars emerges as the most viable candidate, balancing accessibility and volatile resources. Titan provides a conditional long-term promise, with a dense atmosphere and rich organics that could transition to a water-based cycle at 1 AU. These findings highlight new pathways for planetary engineering and long-term human survival.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Constraints on a Population of Massive Interstellar Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate dynamical constraints on the population of large interstellar objects (ISOs) by combining encounter rate analysis, Eddington inversion, and Liouville mapping. Encounter rate scaling demonstrates that detections of kilometer-scale ISOs require flux enhancements beyond natural Maxwellian expectations. Using Eddington inversion, we show how steep density profiles imply phase-space biases consistent with strong gravitational focusing and we then develop a Liouville mapping formalism that propagates the interstellar velocity distribution inward under conservation of energy and angular momentum, revealing that low-angular momentum anisotropies can reproduce the observed size dependent detection rates. These results provide a self consistent dynamical framework for interpreting the observed population of ISOs and for assessing whether the required anisotropies arise from natural or artificial origins. The main results are framed in the context of the parameters for 3I/ATLAS, but the implications are general and go on to sharpen the distinction between natural dynamical mechanisms and potential artificial origins for ISOs.</description>

      <title>Understanding JWST water spectra: what can thermochemical models tell us about the (cold) water in protoplanetary disks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Abridged) Rotational H$_2$O spectra as observed with JWST/MIRI provide a good probe of the temperature and column density structure of the inner disk. H$_2$O emission can also be influenced by dynamical processes, such as dust grains drifting inwards and their icy mantles sublimating once they cross the snowlines, thus enriching the inner regions in H$_2$O vapor. Recent work has found that this process may leave an imprint in the H$_2$O spectrum in the form of excess flux in the cold H$_2$O lines. In this work, we aim to test the accuracy of several common retrieval techniques on full 2D thermochemical disk models. Moreover, we investigate the cold H$_2$O emission that has been proposed as a signature of drift, to gain further insights into the underlying radial and vertical distribution of H$_2$O. We present two sets of Dust And LInes (DALI) thermochemical models and run several retrieval techniques to investigate how the retrieved temperature and column density compare to our models. Single-temperature slab retrievals mainly trace the warm ($\sim$500 K) H$_2$O reservoir, whereas a three-component fit is able to better trace the full temperature gradient in the IR emitting region. Retrieved temperatures tend to underestimate the true temperature of the emitting layer due to non-LTE effects. The retrieved column density traces close to the mid-IR dust $\tau=1$ surface. We find that the strength of the cold H$_2$O emission is directly linked to the H$_2$O abundance above the snow surface at large radii (&gt;1 au). This implies that sources with excess cold H$_2$O flux likely have a high H$_2$O abundance in this region ($\gtrsim10^{-5}$), higher than predicted by the chemical network. This discrepancy is most likely caused by the absence of dust transport processes in our models, further strengthening the theory that this emission may be a signature of radial drift and vertical mixing.</description>

      <title>Origin of the lunar isotopic crisis from solidification of a stratified lunar magma ocean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the giant impact theory, the Moon formed through accreting the debris disk produced by a collision between Theia and the proto-Earth. The giant impact theory can explain most of the properties of the Earth-Moon system, however, simulations with respect to giant impact between a planetary embryo and the growing proto-Earth show that more than 40 percent of the materials in the circum-terrestrial debris disk produced by the giant impact originates from the impactor. Thus, the giant impact theory has difficulty explaining the Moon's Earth-like isotopic compositions, which is referred to as the lunar isotopic crisis. With the assumption that Theia may have possessed an iron-rich mantle compared with proto-Earth's mantle, here we show that, after the formation of the stratified lunar magma ocean, solidification of the stratified lunar magma ocean would result that the upper solid layer is composed of proto-Earth's mantle and the lower solid layer is made of Theia's mantle, meaning that the Moon's Earth-like isotopic composition is a natural result of the giant impact. The theory proposed here may provide a way of explaining the lunar isotopic crisis.</description>

      <title>Dense photometry validation of super-fast-rotating asteroid candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-fast rotators (SFRs; P &lt; 2.2 hr) are of great importance in asteroid studies; yet, many reported detections suffer from aliasing caused by an insufficient observation cadence. We present dense CCD photometry for 15 SFRs candidates (14 after excluding 11219 Benbohn, whose published period already exceeds the spin barrier) observed from 2023 Aug 11 to 2024 Aug 11 with the 1.5 m Sierra Nevada and 1.4 m AS Vidojevica telescopes. Our dataset comprises approximately 2,400 calibrated data points, with per-measurement formal errors of 0.02-0.04 mag and total on-target coverage of 2-13 hr per object. We have reliably determined periods for 9 targets. In terms of spin rate, we have confirmed four SFRs with periods of 1.06-1.84 hr and peak-to-peak amplitudes of 0.054-0.685 mag. Three candidates remain ambiguous, while the rest are reclassified, showing the best solutions with periods greater than 2.5 hr. By extrapolating from our confirmation rate (4/14) to the 3.9 percent occurrence rate found in the Light Curve Database (LCDB) yields a central SFR fraction of 1.1 percent, with a one-sigma lower bound of 0.6 percent among kilometre-scale asteroids.</description>

      <title>Late accretion offers pathway to misaligned disk around the planet-hosting IRAS 04125+2902</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a 3D hydrodynamical simulation of the accretion of a gas cloudlet onto the IRAS 04125+2902 binary system, where the 3-Myr primary hosts a transiting planet. We demonstrate that such an accretion event can naturally produce a circumstellar disk that is misaligned with respect to the rest of the system, consistent with the observed misaligned transition disk. In the model, the prescribed orbital plane of the cloudlet is largely retained by the resulting circumstellar disk after undergoing gravitational interactions with the secondary during the initial accretion. After ~4.4 binary orbits, a disk with $R_d=300~\mathrm{AU}$ has formed around the stellar primary made of ~13% of the cloudlet mass, $M_\mathrm{d,p}=2.1\times 10^{-3}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$. The companion also retains some of the cloudlet's mass and forms a disk with $M_\mathrm{d,c}=9.3\times 10^{-5}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$, though only the transition disk around the primary has been observed. Our findings highlight the importance of considering mass inflow onto protoplanetary disk for their evolution.</description>

      <title>Gas mixing through a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transport and mixing of gas species are of particular interest in planetary environments, where interactions among multiple species can occur within confined or porous media. In this work, we present a novel Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) approach for modeling the mixing of binary gas species. The model treats each gas as a separate fluid governed by its own set of Euler equations, coupled through collisional momentum and energy exchange terms derived from a kinetic relaxation model based on the Boltzmann equation. The numerical scheme employs a first-order operator splitting approach combined with a two-step Euler integrator. In this setup, the hydrodynamic evolution is first computed using standard SPH techniques to handle pressure forces. This is followed by a separate correction step that accounts for interspecies collisional exchanges. Such a decoupled treatment enables the use of a larger timestep dictated by hydrodynamics rather than the typically much smaller collisional timescale, enhancing computational efficiency. The model achieves good accuracy in reproducing the equilibration of density and temperature in a range of molecular mass ratios. Its modular structure supports natural extensions to polyatomic mixtures and enables the inclusion of additional physics, such as gas-solid interactions with dust and ice. These features make the method particularly well-suited for applications involving confined, multi-component gas systems, such as those expected during the ESA ExoMars mission.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical Simulations of Planet Rebound Migration in Photo-evaporating Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the orbital migration of a planet located near the truncated edge of protoplanetary disks, induced by X-ray photo-evaporation originating from the central star. The combined effects of turbulent viscous accretion and stellar X-ray photo-evaporation give rise to the formation of a cavity in the central few astronomical units in disks. Once the cavity is formed, the outer disk experiences rapid mass loss and the cavity expands inside out. We have conducted 2D hydrodynamical simulations of planet-disk interaction for various planet masses and disk properties. Our simulations demonstrate that planets up to about Neptune masses experience a strong positive corotation torque along the cavity edge that leads to sustained outward migration -- a phenomenon previously termed {\it rebound} migration. Rebound migration is more favorable in disks with moderate stellar photo-evaporation rates of ${\sim}10^{-8} ~ \rm M_{\odot}\,yr^{-1}$. Saturn-mass planets only experience inward migration due to significant gas depletion in their co-orbital regions. In contrast, Jupiter-mass planets are found to undergo modest outward migration as they cause the residual disk to become eccentric. This work presents the first 2D hydrodynamical simulations that confirm the existence and viability of rebound outward migration during the inside-out clearing in protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Fractal Aggregate Aerosols in the Virga Cloud Code I: Model Description and Application to a Benchmark Cloudy Exoplanet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce new functionality to treat fractal aggregate aerosol particles within the Virga cloud modeling framework. Previously, the open source cloud modeling code Virga (Batalha et al. 2025), the Python version of EddySed (Ackerman &amp; Marley, 2001), assumed spherical particles to compute particle mass and size distributions throughout the atmosphere. The initial release of Virga also assumed spherical particles to compute Mie scattering properties, which include the single scattering albedo, asymmetry parameter, and optical depth as a function of particle radius and composition. However, extensive evidence from Solar system aerosols, astrophysical disks and dust, and Earth climate studies suggests that non-spherical aggregate particles are common compared to idealized compact spherical particles. Following recent advances in microphysical and opacity modeling, we implement a simple parametrization for dynamical and optical (modified mean field theory) effects of fractal aggregate particles into Virga. We then use this new functionality to perform a case study using basic planetary parameters similar to the well-characterized, aerosol-laden mini-Neptune GJ 1214 b, using KCl clouds made of aggregate particles. We choose KCl to most directly explore comparisons to previous studies. We demonstrate 1) how our method compares to previous fractal aggregate particle treatments and 2) how our new fractal treatment affects theoretical spectra of cloudy atmospheres. Overall, our model is faster and more flexible for a wider range of parameter space than previous studies. We explore the limitations of our modeling set-up and offer guidance for future investigations using our framework.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the Host Binary of the Directly Imaged Exoplanet HD 143811 AB b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HD~143811~AB is the host star to the directly imaged planet HD~143811~AB~b, which was recently discovered using data from the Gemini Planet Imager and Keck NIRC2. A member of the Sco-Cen star-forming region with an age of $13 \pm 4$ Myr, HD~143811~AB is somewhat rare among hosts of directly imaged planets as it is a close stellar binary, with an $\sim$18 day period. Accurate values for the orbital and stellar parameters of this binary are needed to understand the formation and evolutionary history of the planet in orbit. We utilize archival high-resolution spectroscopy from FEROS on the MPG/ESO 2.2-meter telescope to fit the orbit of the binary, and combine with unresolved photometry to derive the basic stellar properties of the system. From the orbit, we derive precise values of orbital period of $18.59098 \pm 0.00007$ days, and mass ratio of $0.885 \pm 0.003$. When combined with stellar evolutionary models, we find masses of both components of $M_A = 1.30^{+0.03}_{-0.05}$ M$_\odot$ and $M_B = 1.15^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ M$_\odot$. While the current data are consistent with the planet and stellar orbits being coplanar, the 3D orientations of both systems are currently poorly constrained, with additional observations required to more rigorously test for coplanarity.</description>

      <title>HD 143811 AB b: A Directly Imaged Planet Orbiting a Spectroscopic Binary in Sco-Cen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present confirmation of HD 143811 AB b, a substellar companion to spectroscopic binary HD 143811 AB through direct imaging with the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI) and Keck NIRC2. HD 143811 AB was observed as a part of the Gemini Planet Imager Exoplanet Survey (GPIES) in 2016 and 2019 and is a member of the Sco-Cen star formation region. The companion object is detected $\sim 430$ mas from the host star by GPI. With two GPI epochs and one from Keck/NIRC2 in 2022, we confirm through common proper motion analysis that the object is bound to its host star. We derive an orbit with a semi-major axis of $64 ^{+32}_{-14}$ au and eccentricity $\sim 0.23$. Spectral analysis of the GPI $H$-band spectrum and NIRC2 \textit{L'} photometry provides additional proof that this object is a substellar companion. We compare the spectrum of HD 143811 AB b to PHOENIX stellar models and Exo-REM exoplanet atmosphere models and find that Exo-REM models provide the best fits to the data. From the Exo-REM models, we derive an effective temperature of $1042^{+178}_{-132}$ K for the planet and translate the derived luminosity of the planet to a mass of $5.6 \pm 1.1~M_\textrm{Jup}$ assuming hot-start evolutionary models. HD 143811 AB b is one of only a few planets to be directly imaged around a binary, and future characterization of this object will shed light on the formation of planets around binary star systems.</description>

      <title>A Scaling Law for the Orbital Architecture of Planetary Systems Formed by Gravitational Scattering and Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the standard formation models of terrestrial planets in the solar system and close-in super-Earths in non-resonant orbits recently discovered by exoplanet observations, planets are formed by giant impacts of protoplanets or planetary embryos after the dispersal of protoplanetary disk gas in the final stage. This study aims to theoretically clarify a fundamental scaling law for the orbital architecture of planetary systems formed by giant impacts. In the giant impact stage, protoplanets gravitationally scatter and collide with one another to form planets. Using {\em N}-body simulations, we investigate the orbital architecture of planetary systems formed from protoplanet systems by giant impacts. As the orbital architecture parameters, we focus on the mean orbital separation between two adjacent planets and the mean orbital eccentricity of planets in a planetary system. We find that the orbital architecture is determined by the ratio of the two-body surface escape velocity of planets $v_\mathrm{esc}$ to the Keplerian circular velocity $v_\mathrm{K}$, $k$ = The mean orbital separation and eccentricity are about $2 ka$  and $0.3 k$, respectively, where $a$ is the system semimajor axis. With this scaling, the orbital architecture parameters of planetary systems are nearly independent of their total mass and semimajor axis.</description>

      <title>Direct Detection of Known Exoplanets in Reflected Light: Predicting Sky Position with Literature Orbit Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next generation of ground- and space-based observatories will enable direct imaging and characterization of cold, mature planets through thermal emission and, for the first time, reflected light detection. Known RV and astrometrically detected planets provide a known population for detection and characterization observations. However, many of the most promising targets lack orbital parameters of sufficient precision to confidently predict their location on relative to the star for a direct imaging campaign. We have developed \texttt{projecc}, an open source Python package designed to generate sky-plane planet location posteriors from literature orbit solutions. This tool aims to facilitate community preparation for direct imaging observations of known planets. In this work we describe \texttt{projecc} and use it to examine two case study systems relevant to reflected light imaging with ELTs: GJ~876~b, which we find has a well-constrained prediction, and Proxima Centauri b, whose location remains highly uncertain.%, as well as one potential target for \textsl{Roman} CGI, HD~219134~h, which we estimate has a 40\% probability of being in a detectable sky location at any given time. We provide a web app for exploring reflected light planet targets and their orbit solutions, including predictions from literature for 17 additional planets, located at https://reflected-light-planets.streamlit.app/. We also discuss future upgrades to \texttt{projecc}.</description>

      <title>JWST Detection of Hydrocarbon Ices and Methane Gas on Makemake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST/NIRSpec observations of Makemake reveal a chemically complex surface and evidence of gaseous CH$_4$. Our spectral modeling indicates a surface composition consisting of CH$_4$, CH$_3$D, and possibly CH$_3$OH, combined with aggregates of C$_2$H$_2$ and C$_2$H$_6$. The presence of C$_2$H$_4$ is also considered given its expected photochemical origin. Both areal and layered configurations reproduce the observed spectrum, with the latter being preferred. This composition confirms earlier hydrocarbon detections and suggests that CH$_4$ photolysis is either ongoing or occurred recently. The detection of CH$_3$D yields a D/H ratio in CH$_4$ ice of $(3.98 \pm 0.34) \times 10^{-4}$, consistent within $2\sigma$ with previous estimates. We report the first detection of CH$_4$ fluorescence from Makemake, establishing it as only the second trans-Neptunian object$\unicode{x2014}$after Pluto$\unicode{x2014}$with confirmed volatile release. We explore two scenarios consistent with the observed CH$_4$ emission, though neither fully reproduces the data: an expanding coma, yielding production rates of $(0.2\unicode{x2013}1.6) \times 10^{28}$ molecules s$^{-1}$ and a rovibrational temperature of $\sim$35 K, possibly originating from a localized plume, and a gravitationally bound atmosphere, which, if adopted, implies gas kinetic temperatures near 40 K and surface pressures of $\sim$10 pbar$\unicode{x2014}$values consistent with stellar occultation constraints and an atmosphere in equilibrium with surface CH$_4$ ice. Discriminating between these scenarios will require higher spectral resolution and improved signal-to-noise observations. Together, the gas-phase CH$_4$, intermediate D/H ratio between that in water and CH$_4$ in comets, and complex surface composition challenge the traditional view of Makemake as a quiescent, frozen body.</description>

      <title>HET/HPF observations of Helium in warm, hot, and ultra-hot Jupiters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The near-infrared helium triplet line is a powerful tool for studying atmospheric escape processes of close-in exoplanets, especially irradiated gas giants. Line profile fitting provides direct insight into the mechanisms driving atmospheric mass loss of close-in, Jupiter-sized planets. We present high-resolution transmission spectroscopy results for the helium triplet line of sixteen gas giants ($R_{\rm p} &gt; 0.5 R_{\rm Jup}$). These observations are part of an extensive helium survey conducted using the Habitable Zone Planet Finder spectrograph on the 10m Hobby-Eberly Telescope. For the first time, we provide constraints on the helium line for HAT-P-12b, HAT-P-17b, HD118203b, TrES-1b, and WASP-156b. Additionally, we are able to confirm previous robust or tentative detections for HD189733b, HD209458b, WASP-52b, WASP-69b, and WASP-76b, and non-detections for HAT-P-3b, WASP-11b, WASP-80b, WASP-127b, and WASP-177\,b. We do not confirm the previous helium narrow-band detection in HAT-P-26b using high-resolution observations. To identify trends within the population of warm, hot, and ultra-hot Jupiters, we combined our results with available helium studies from the literature. As predicted by theory, we find that warm Jupiters with helium detections orbit K-type stars. However, the helium detections in hot Jupiters are found in low-density planets orbiting F-type stars. There are no helium detections in ultra-hot Jupiters. We compiled a list of 46 irradiated gas giants, but more helium studies are needed to increase the sample and improve our understanding of atmospheric mass loss through helium observations.</description>

      <title>Exploration of the Near-Infrared Colors of Cold Y Dwarfs from the Ground and Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST has provided critical mid-infrared data for cold brown dwarfs. It has also provided low-resolution near-infrared spectra, and for faint sources these are the first spectra at these wavelengths. We use these data and other literature sources to synthesize near-infrared photometry on the MKO system for 19 T and Y dwarfs, on the Euclid system for 44 T and Y dwarfs, and on the Roman system for 48 T and Y dwarfs. We also synthesize Euclid I_E magnitudes for 15 T and Y dwarfs. Using the Beiler et al. 2024 observational effective temperatures (T_eff), together with ATMO 2020++ model colors, we show that the absolute 4.6um magnitude can be used as a proxy for T_eff. We present a polynomial fit to the M_W2:T_eff relationship for cool dwarfs with 250 &lt; T_eff K &lt; 1000. We select five Y dwarfs with 275 &lt; T_eff K &lt; 400 which have a range in near- to mid-infrared colors. Comparison of the JWST spectral energy distribution to ATMO 2020++ models indicate that Y dwarfs which are bluer in J - W2 are lower gravity or more metal-rich than their redder counterparts, with stronger CO and CO_2 absorption at 4.2 &lt; lambda um &lt; 4.9. The near-infrared color diagrams show significant scatter, with complex dependencies on T_eff, metallicity and gravity. In order to disentangle these effects, opacity sources for cool model atmospheres need to be more complete at lambda &lt; 1um.</description>

      <title>Stereovision Image Processing for Planetary Navigation Maps with Semi-Global Matching and Superpixel Segmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mars exploration requires precise and reliable terrain models to ensure safe rover navigation across its unpredictable and often hazardous landscapes. Stereoscopic vision serves a critical role in the rover's perception, allowing scene reconstruction by generating precise depth maps through stereo matching. State-of-the-art Martian planetary exploration uses traditional local block-matching, aggregates cost over square windows, and refines disparities via smoothness constraints. However, this method often struggles with low-texture images, occlusion, and repetitive patterns because it considers only limited neighbouring pixels and lacks a wider understanding of scene context. This paper uses Semi-Global Matching (SGM) with superpixel-based refinement to mitigate the inherent block artefacts and recover lost details. The approach balances the efficiency and accuracy of SGM and adds context-aware segmentation to support more coherent depth inference. The proposed method has been evaluated in three datasets with successful results: In a Mars analogue, the terrain maps obtained show improved structural consistency, particularly in sloped or occlusion-prone regions. Large gaps behind rocks, which are common in raw disparity outputs, are reduced, and surface details like small rocks and edges are captured more accurately. Another two datasets, evaluated to test the method's general robustness and adaptability, show more precise disparity maps and more consistent terrain models, better suited for the demands of autonomous navigation on Mars, and competitive accuracy across both non-occluded and full-image error metrics. This paper outlines the entire terrain modelling process, from finding corresponding features to generating the final 2D navigation maps, offering a complete pipeline suitable for integration in future planetary exploration missions.</description>

      <title>Advancing Resource Extraction Systems in Martian Volcanic Terrain: Rover Design, Power Consumption and Hazard Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a schematic plan for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) in Martian volcanic terrains. The work investigated the complexity of volcanic terrains and Martian environmental hazards and suggested comprehensive engineering strategies to overcome the odds and establish a successful mining program in Martian volcanic regions. Slope stabilization methods - such as terracing and anchored drilling rigs - with terrain-adaptive rovers capable of autonomous operations on steep unstable slopes has been suggested as feasible solutions to navigate the complex geological terrains of Martian volcanoes. The mid range rover design with a mass of approximately 2.1 t, proposed here for mining operations, incorporates a six-wheel rocker-bogie suspension, anchoring-enabled drilling arm, dust-mitigation solar arrays, and advanced sensing systems for hazard detection and navigation. A comparative analysis regarding choice of roads and rails for building transport infrastructure has also been performed. We have also looked into the energy requirement of the rover to work under extreme environmental conditions of Mars and suggested a combination of solar and nuclear power to account for the huge energy requirements of sustained operations on Mars. The results demonstrate that mission success in these environments depends on integrating mechanical resilience, environmental adaptability, and operational autonomy, enabling sustainable access to resources in one of Mars' most geologically challenging settings.</description>

      <title>A Deep SETI Search for Technosignatures in the TRAPPIST-1 System with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) is the world's largest single-dish radio telescope, and the search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI) is one of its five key science objectives. We conducted a targeted narrowband search toward the TRAPPIST-1 system using FAST. The observations consisted of five independent L-band pointings, each with a 20-minute integration, for a total on-source time of 1.67h. The frequency coverage spanned 1.05--1.45GHz with a spectral resolution of ~7.5Hz. We searched for narrowband drifting signals with Doppler drift rates within +_4Hz/s and a signal-to-noise ratio threshold of S/N&gt;10 in two orthogonal linear polarizations separately.Based on the system parameters adopted in this work, we estimate a minimum detectable equivalent isotropic radiated power of 2.04x10^10W, placing one of the most stringent constraints to date on persistent or high-duty-cycle narrowband transmitters in this system. No credible technosignature candidates were identified within the searched parameter space. Nevertheless,TRAPPIST-1 remains a compelling target for future SETI efforts. We plan to extend our search to other signal types, such as periodic or transient transmitters, and to carry out broader surveys of nearby exoplanetary systems with FAST.</description>

      <title>Identification of Likely Methane Absorption Features in the Optical Spectra of Titan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical spectra of Titan reveal a rich set of absorption features, most of which are likely associated with methane (CH$_4$). Methane is a key molecule in planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres, yet a comprehensive high-resolution linelist at optical wavelengths remains incomplete. This study identified and characterized potential CH$_4$ absorption features in high-resolution optical spectra of Titan, providing essential data for linelist development and improving CH$_4$ detection and characterization. We analyzed Titan spectra from the ESPRESSO spectrograph (R $\approx$ 190,000), identifying intrinsic features and measuring their relative strengths. A conservative detection approach was employed, slightly overestimating solar and telluric contributions to distinguish them from Titan's intrinsic features. To assess the impact of spectral resolution, we compared the ESPRESSO data with Titan UVES data (R $\approx$ 110,000). We identified 6,195 absorption features in the ESPRESSO spectra potentially associated with CH$_4$, of which 5,436 are newly reported. ESPRESSO detected twice as many features as UVES in overlapping regions, highlighting the advantage of higher-resolution data. Most detected lines remained unresolved, so our reported features are primarily blended absorption structures. We estimated the detection limit for feature identification to correspond to a CH$_4$ absorption coefficient of approximately 0.02 km-am$^{-1}$. Comparison of our results with a previous analysis of Titan UVES spectra and with experimental CH$_4$ data at a similar temperature showed good agreement, while some discrepancies were observed when compared with data acquired at a different temperature. We provide a comprehensive list of Titan absorption features with key reliability metrics, along with Titan's intrinsic spectra, to support future studies.</description>

      <title>Influence of Boundary Conditions and Heating Modes on the Onset of Columnar Convection in Rotating Spherical Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the linear onset of thermal convection in rotating spherical shells with a focus on the influence of mechanical boundary conditions and thermal driving modes. Using a spectral method, we determine critical Rayleigh numbers, azimuthal wavenumbers, and oscillation frequencies over a wide range of Prandtl numbers and shell aspect ratios at moderate Ekman numbers. We show that the preferred boundary condition for convective onset depends systematically on both aspect ratio and Prandtl number: for sufficiently thick shells or for large $\text{Pr}$, the Ekman boundary layer at the outer boundary becomes destabilising, so that no-slip boundaries yield a lower $\text{Ra}_c$ than stress-free boundaries. Comparing differential and internal heating, we find that internal heating generally raises $\text{Ra}_c$, shifts the onset to larger wavenumbers and frequencies, and relocates the critical column away from the tangent cylinder. Mixed boundary conditions with no-slip on the inner boundary behave similarly to purely stress-free boundaries, confirming the dominant influence of the outer surface. These results demonstrate that boundary conditions and heating mechanisms play a central role in controlling the onset of convection and should be carefully considered in models of planetary and stellar interiors.</description>

      <title>A Seven-Day Multi-Wavelength Flare Campaign on AU Mic III: Quiescent and Flaring Properties of the X-ray Spectra and Chromospheric lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the X-ray quiescent and flaring properties from a unique, 7-day multiwavelength observing campaign on the M1 flare star AU Mic. Combining the XMM-Newton X-ray spectra with the chromospheric line and broadband NUV and optical continuum observations provides a dataset that is one of the most comprehensive to date. We analyze the sample of 38 X-ray flares and study in detail the X-ray flare temperature ($T$) and emission measure (EM) evolutions of three largest flares with the X-ray flare energies of $&gt;10^{33}$ erg. The $T-\mathrm{EM}$ evolution tracks and multi-wavelength emission evolutions of the largest-amplitude Neupert-type flare reveal that the so-called ``Flare H-R diagram" is consistent with thermal coronal flare emission evolution. The two other more gradual and longer duration X-ray flares are interpreted as having larger size scales. None of the 17 H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ flares show clear blue/red wing asymmetries, including the ones associated with the potential X-ray dimming event previously reported. The above largest-amplitude Neupert flare shows clear symmetric H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ broadenings with roughly $\pm$400 and $\pm$600 km s$^{-1}$, respectively, which are synchronized with the optical/NUV continuum emission evolution. Radiative hydrodynamic modeling results suggest that electron beam heating parameters that have been used to reproduce M-dwarf flare NUV/optical continuum emissions can reproduce these large broadenings of H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines. These results suggest that these most energetic M-dwarf flares are associated with stronger magnetic field flux densities and larger size scales than solar flares but can be interpreted in terms of the standard flare model.</description>

      <title>SPORES-HWO. II. Companion Mass Limits and Updated Planet Properties for 120 Future Exoplanet Imaging Targets from 35 Years of Precise Doppler Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One goal of the future Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) is to directly image and spectroscopically characterize true Earth analogs. However, if a large fraction of HWO target stars host unknown disruptive giant planets in their habitable zones (HZs), then additional targets that are farther away will need to be surveyed, potentially requiring a larger-aperture telescope and a coronagraph with a smaller inner working angle (IWA). Therefore, the sooner we constrain the presence of massive planets orbiting potential HWO target stars, the easier and less costly it will be to adjust key aspects of HWO's architecture. In this work, we uniformly analyze over 153,000 public radial velocity (RV) observations of 120 potential HWO target stars to derive mass limits on planetary companions. The RVs were measured by 23 spectrographs located at 15 observatories around the world, with the first data going back to 1987. Based on empirical search completeness tests, we determine that undetected Jupiter-mass (Saturn-mass) planets may be hiding in up to 38% (53%) of the HZs of targets in the ExEP Mission Star List. The median mass sensitivity limit in the middle of the conservative HZ is approximately 48 M$_\oplus$. The data also provide updated parameters for 53 known companions, and we detect at least 26 additional RV signals corresponding to stellar activity and 4 signals that are planet candidates. We note that 44 of the ExEP stars lack substantial RV monitoring history, and we advocate for community-coordinated observing campaigns of these stars using moderate-precision RV facilities.</description>

      <title>JWST Reveals Varied Origins Between Jupiter's Irregular Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report observations of eight Jovian irregular satellites with JWST's NIRSpec instrument: Himalia, Elara, Pasiphae, Sinope, Lysithea, Carme, Ananke, and Themisto. Irregular satellite families, which are presumed to have formed via collisions, contain various Trojan-like and C-type-asteroid-like surfaces. We sample the three largest members of the Himalia satellite family, detecting the presence of complexed CO$_2$ and a unique absorption band from $\sim2.7-3.6\ \mu m$ whose character correlates with satellite size. The two largest irregular satellites, Himalia family members Himalia and Elara, contain ammoniated phyllosilicates that are not seen in the meteorite inventory. We propose that the Himalia parent body was heterogeneous and formed with materials similar to Ceres-like ammonium-bearing asteroids. Several small ($D\sim 10km$) irregular satellites closely track the colors and absorption bands of ``red'' Jovian Trojans, demonstrating that these compositions are retained amongst the products of collisions that occurred after Jovian capture. We report the first detection of aqueous alteration products in the retrograde satellite swarm, finding Ananke's 3 micron band to closely match phyllosilicates seen in C2 chondrites. Notably, objects with OH absorption features similar to the Trojan asteroid Eurybates are found in both the retrograde Pasiphae family and the prograde Himalia family, confounding a simple link between such materials and a single surface type. The irregular satellites appear consistent with some materials that experienced alteration from liquid water and others that did not. Consequently, Jupiter may have captured bodies that formed from different initial compositions, or bodies that experienced different levels of heating, driving differential alteration processes.</description>

      <title>Year six photometric measurements of known Trans-Neptunian Objects and Centaurs by the Dark Energy Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identified known Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) and Centaurs in the complete Dark Energy Survey (DES) year six catalog (DES Y6) through the Sky Body Tracker (SkyBoT) tool. We classified our dataset of 144 objects into a widely used 4-class taxonomic system of TNOs. No such previous classification was available in the literature for most of these objects. From absolute magnitudes and average albedos, an estimation of the diameters of all these objects is obtained. Correlations involving colours, orbital parameters, dynamical classes and sizes are also discussed. In particular, our largest reddest object has a diameter of $390^{+68}_{-53}$ km and our largest cold classical, $255^{+19}_{-17}$ km. Also, a weak correlation between colour and inclination is found within the population of resonant TNOs in addition to weak correlations between colour and phase slope in different bands.</description>

      <title>Bridging Unstratified and Stratified Simulations of the Streaming Instability for $\tau_s=0.1$ Grains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The streaming instability (SI), driven by aerodynamic coupling between solids and the gas under a global radial pressure gradient, concentrates solids and facilitates planetesimal formation. Unstratified simulations are commonly used to study the SI, based on the assumption that they approximate conditions near the disk midplane. However, it remains unclear how accurately these unstratified simulations capture the midplane dust-gas dynamics in stratified disks. To address this, we examine the saturated state of the SI in stratified simulations and compare dust-gas dynamics to those in unstratified simulations across various radial pressure gradients. To this end, we consider a dimensionless dust stopping time ($\tau_s$) of 0.1 and perform 2D axisymmetric, stratified simulations. We find that the formation of dust filaments during dust settling exhibits morphological similarities to those in unstratified simulations. Vertical gravity acts to redistribute momentum vertically in response to momentum flux, resulting in midplane velocities in the center-of-mass frame that are consistent with those from unstratified models at any given pressure gradient. Furthermore, the velocity dispersions and density distributions of the gas and dust near the midplane of our stratified simulations closely match those in unstratified simulations. While further exploration across the parameter space is needed, our results suggest that, for $\tau_s=0.1$, unstratified simulations represents well the midplane dust--gas dynamics in stratified disks before any strong clumping occurs. Consequently, our results confirm that in the saturated state, the streaming turbulence in stratified simulations behaves similarly to that in unstratified simulations for the parameter values explored here.</description>

      <title>The tidal interaction of an orbiting giant planet with a star near the Kraft break: the excitation of $r$-modes and the retention of orbital and spin angular momenta misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the previous work of Papaloizou \&amp; Savonije on tidal interactions between a solar mass star and a closely orbiting giant planet which is such that the orbital and stellar spin angular momentum directions are misaligned. Here we consider the situation when the central star has a mass of $1.3 M_{\odot}$ and is in the vicinity of the Kraft break. We find and determine the properties of the lowest order $r$ modes and the tidal response arising from the secular non axisymmetric forcing associated with a misaligned orbit. We find that the response of the thin convective envelope, as well as the shift of $r$ mode frequencies from the low rotation frequency, limit can be understood by adopting a vertically averaged model that is similar to the well known one governed by the Laplace tidal equation for an incompressible ocean. From our results we are able to estimate lower bounds on realignment time scales for hot Jupiter systems with orbital periods in the range $2.8-5 d$ and rotation periods in the range $5-31 d$ that indicate the process is indeed markedly less effective than for a solar type star. This is on account of there being less dissipation in a relatively smaller convective envelope as well as the generally faster rotation and hence larger spin angular momentum expected for the more massive star.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Mean Plane of the Distant Kuiper Belt</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the absence of any unseen planetary-mass bodies in the outer solar system, the mean plane of the distant Kuiper belt should be the same as the plane orthogonal to the angular momentum vector of the solar system -- the invariable plane. Here, we measure the mean plane of the non-resonant Kuiper belt across semimajor axes 50 - 400 AU. We introduce a new method to measure the mean plane that we demonstrate to be independent of observational bias. In particular, our results are not biased by surveys that look only at limited areas on the celestial sphere. We find a warp relative to the invariable plane at semimajor axes of 80 - 400 AU (98% confidence) and 80 - 200 AU (96% confidence), but not at 50 - 80 AU or 200 - 400 AU. If it is not spurious, a possible explanation for this warp is an unseen planet in the outer solar system. With $n$-body simulations, we find that a planet with mass between that of Mercury and the Earth, semimajor axis in the range 100 - 200 AU, and inclination $\gtrsim 10^{\circ}$ to be the most likely cause of the warp; however, parameters outside of these ranges are still possible. Such a body is distinct in both mass and semimajor axis from the various versions of an unseen planet invoked to explain apsidal clustering in the outer solar system. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to confirm or deny the existence of the warp reported here, and might detect the planet that may produce it.</description>

Abstract: We report two warm Earth-sized exoplanets orbiting the close binary TOI-2267 (M5+M6, separation ~8 au). Data from TESS and ground-based facilities confirm the planets, but we cannot determine which star they orbit. The planets have radii of 1.00+/-0.11 R_Earth (TOI-2267 b, P=2.28 d) and 1.14+/-0.13 R_Earth (TOI-2267 c, P=3.49 d) if around TOI-2267A, or 1.22+/-0.29 R_Earth and 1.36+/-0.33 R_Earth if around TOI-2267B. TESS also shows a candidate signal (TOI-2267.02, P=2.03 d, 0.95+/-0.12 or 1.13+/-0.30 R_Earth). Dynamical analysis shows all three cannot orbit one star; the most stable configuration has planets b and c (near a 3:2 resonance) orbiting one star and the candidate the other. This scenario would make TOI-2267 the most compact binary system known to host planets, with both components harbouring transiting worlds, offering a unique benchmark for studying planet formation and evolution in compact binary.</description>

      <title>Proto-planetary disk composition-dependent element volatility in the context of rocky planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The compositions of the Solar System terrestrial bodies are fractionated from that of the Sun, where elemental depletions in the bulk rocky bodies correlate with element volatility, expressed in its 50% condensation temperature. However, because element volatility depends on disk gas composition, it is not mandated that elemental fractionation trends derived from the solar-terrestrial scenario apply to other planetary systems. Here, we expand upon previous efforts to quantify element volatility during disk condensation, and how this affects rocky planet compositional diversity.
  We simulate condensation sequences for a sample of 1000 initial disk compositions based on observed stellar abundances. We present parametrisations of how element 50% condensation temperatures depend on disk composition, and apply element fractionation trends with appropriate element volatilty to stellar abundances to simulate compositions of rocky exoplanets with the same volatile depletion pattern as the Earth, providing a robust and conservative lower limit to the compositional diversity of rocky exoplanets.
  Here we show that Earth-like planets emerge from low-C-to-O disks and graphite-bearing planets from medium-to-high-C-to-O disks. Furthermore, we identify an intermediate-C-to-O class of planets characterized by Mg and Si depletion, leading to relatively high abundances of Fe, Ca, and Al. We show that devolatilisation patterns could be adapted potentially with disk composition-dependent condensation temperatures to make predictions of rocky planet bulk compositions within individual systems. The outcomes of our analysis suggest that accounting for disk composition-dependent condensation temperatures means that we can expect an even broader range of possible rocky planet compositions than has previously been considered.</description>

      <title>Observing the Sun with the Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST): Forecasting Full-disk Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) has revolutionised the field of solar millimetre astronomy with its high angular resolution and cadence. However, with a limited field of view (FOV), targeted observations of highly dynamic phenomena such of flares are challenging. A large aperture single-dish telescope with a large FOV, such as the future Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), would prove useful in observing such phenomena, as one could scan the full solar disk on shorter timescales. We aimed to explore what FOVs, detector counts, and scan strategies are suitable for AtLAST to push the required full-disk scan times below 1 minute, enabling regular observations of dynamic solar phenomena. Utilising the maria code, we were able to simulate solar observations with AtLAST, and thoroughly explored how instrumental properties and scanning strategies affect the full-disk observations in the planned frequency bands. We find the double-circle scan pattern, currently employed at ALMA for full-disk mapping to also be an acceptable way of scanning the Sun with AtLAST. Using small to intermediately sized instruments (1000 - 50,000 detector elements), the estimated observational cadence would be less than 1 minute across AtLAST's frequency range with a reasonable pixel spacing. Using instruments with larger FOVs ($\gtrapprox 0.25^\circ$, equivalent to $\gtrapprox$ 1 R$_\odot$), we find a simple circular scan to be more efficient, achieving cadences on second time scales, but requiring more detector elements ($\gtrapprox$ 100,000). We find that a large FOV single-dish telescope such as AtLAST could provide the solar millimetre community with hitherto unachievable observations, namely full-disk observations at high cadence and adequate resolution. With cadences potentially down to seconds, such an instrument would be ideal in the study of quickly evolving solar phenomena.</description>

      <title>Dark matter signatures in cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study analyzes an 11-year cosmic ray dataset of positrons and antiprotons for planetary dependencies related to gravitationally focused dark matter streams. By projecting event timestamps onto planetary heliocentric longitudes, structured flux modulations are found. The results resemble previously reported planetary relationships in solar and terrestrial observables. This supports the possibility that streaming dark matter particles are focused toward Earth by solar system bodies, including the Moon. The findings suggest further searches using other cosmic ray channels, including existing very high-energy gamma-ray data.</description>
