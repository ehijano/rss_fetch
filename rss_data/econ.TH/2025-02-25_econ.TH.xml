      <title>Pricing Valid Cuts for Price-Match Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use valid inequalities (cuts) of the binary integer program for winner determination in a combinatorial auction (CA) as "artificial items" that can be interpreted intuitively and priced to generate Artificial Walrasian Equilibria. While the lack of an integer programming gap is sufficient to guarantee a Walrasian equilibrium, we show that it does not guarantee a "price-match equilibrium" (PME), a refinement that we introduce, in which prices are justified by an iso-revenue outcome for any hypothetical removal of a single bidder. We prove the existence of PME for any CA and characterize their economic properties and computation. We implement minimally artificial PME rules and compare them with other prominent CA payment rules in the literature.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Chaordic Economics: How Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain Transform Businesses, Economies and Societies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dee Hock, the founder of Visa, coined the term 'chaordic' to describe simultaneously chaotic and ordered systems. Based on his reasoning, we introduce the Theory of Chaordic Economics to explain how economic systems are transformed by two disruptive technologies: namely Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain. Artificial intelligence can generate novel output through algorithmic yet rather unpredictable processes. Blockchain creates deterministic results without central authorities and relies on elaborated protocols that prescribe how consensus can be reached within a network of peers. The amalgamation of chaos and order produces chaordic economic systems and can yield hitherto unthinkable economic structures.</description>

      <title>A new solution for cooperative game with public externalities: Analysis based on axiomatic method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new solution concept for the Cooperative Game with Public Externalities, called the w-value, which is characterized by three properties (axioms), namely Pareto-optimality (PO), Market-equilbrium (ME) and Fiscal-balance (FB). Additionally, the implementation mechanism for w-value is also provided. The w-value exists and is unique. It belongs to the core. And, more specifically, it belongs to the -core. Meanwhile, the computational cost of w-value is very low. Therefore, the w-value is a theoretically more compelling solution concept than the existing cooperation game solutions when analyzing cooperative games with public externalities. A numerical illustration shows the calculation steps of w-value. Meanwhile, the w-value well explains the reason why the mandatory emission reduction mechanism must be transformed into a "nationally determined contribution" mechanism in current international climate negotiations.</description>

      <title>Exclusion Zones of Instant Runoff Voting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent research on instant runoff voting (IRV) shows that it exhibits a striking combinatorial property in one-dimensional preference spaces: there is an "exclusion zone" around the median voter such that if a candidate from the exclusion zone is on the ballot, then the winner must come from the exclusion zone. Thus, in one dimension, IRV cannot elect an extreme candidate as long as a sufficiently moderate candidate is running. In this work, we examine the mathematical structure of exclusion zones as a broad phenomenon in more general preference spaces. We prove that with voters uniformly distributed over any $d$-dimensional hyperrectangle (for $d &gt; 1$), IRV has no nontrivial exclusion zone. However, we also show that IRV exclusion zones are not solely a one-dimensional phenomenon. For irregular higher-dimensional preference spaces with fewer symmetries than hyperrectangles, IRV can exhibit nontrivial exclusion zones. As a further exploration, we study IRV exclusion zones in graph voting, where nodes represent voters who prefer candidates closer to them in the graph. Here, we show that IRV exclusion zones present a surprising computational challenge: even checking whether a given set of positions is an IRV exclusion zone is NP-hard. We develop an efficient randomized approximation algorithm for checking and finding exclusion zones. We also report on computational experiments with exclusion zones in two directions: (i) applying our approximation algorithm to a collection of real-world school friendship networks, we find that about 60% of these networks have probable nontrivial IRV exclusion zones; and (ii) performing an exhaustive computer search of small graphs and trees, we also find nontrivial IRV exclusion zones in most graphs. While our focus is on IRV, the properties of exclusion zones we establish provide a novel method for analyzing voting systems in metric spaces more generally.</description>

      <title>A Deterministic and Linear Model of Dynamic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of infinite horizon linear dynamic optimization and obtain results concerning existence of solution and satisfaction of the Euler equation and transversality condition being unconditionally sufficient for optimality of a trajectory. We show that the optimal value function is concave and continuous and the optimal trajectory satisfies the functional equation of dynamic programming. Linearity bites when it comes to the definition of optimal decision rules which can no longer be guaranteed to be single-valued. We show that the optimal decision rule is an upper semi-continuous correspondence. For linear cake-eating problems, we obtain monotonicity results for the optimal value function and a conditional monotonicity result for optimal decision rules. We also introduce the concept of a two-phase linear cake eating problem and obtain a necessary condition that must be satisfied by all solutions of such problems.</description>

      <title>Optimal Salaries of Researchers with Motivational Emergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of scientific policy and science management, this study examines the system of nonuniform wage distribution for researchers. A nonlinear mathematical model of optimal remuneration for scientific workers has been developed, considering key and additive aspects of scientific activity: basic qualifications, research productivity, collaborative projects, skill enhancement, distinctions, and international collaborations. Unlike traditional linear schemes, the proposed approach is based on exponential and logarithmic dependencies, allowing for the consideration of saturation effects and preventing artificial wage growth due to mechanical increases in scientific productivity indicators.
  The study includes detailed calculations of optimal, minimum, and maximum wages, demonstrating a fair distribution of remuneration on the basis of researcher productivity. A linear increase in publication activity or grant funding should not lead to uncontrolled salary growth, thus avoiding distortions in the motivational system. The results of this study can be used to reform and modernize the wage system for researchers in Kazakhstan and other countries, as well as to optimize grant-based science funding mechanisms. The proposed methodology fosters scientific motivation, long-term productivity, and the internationalization of research while also promoting self-actualization and ultimately forming an adequate and authentic reward system for the research community.
  Specifically, in resource-limited scientific systems, science policy should focus on the qualitative development of individual researchers rather than quantitative expansion (e.g., increasing the number of scientists). This can be achieved through the productive progress of their motivation and self-actualization.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the continuity of expected utility functions, and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a weak order on the space of simple probabilities to have a continuous expected utility function. We also verify that almost the same condition is necessary and sufficient for a weak order on the space of probabilities with compact-support to have a continuous expected utility function.</description>

      <title>Multilateral matching with scale economies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies multilateral matching in which agents may negotiate contracts within any coalition. We assume scale economies such that an agent substitutes some existing contracts with new ones only if the latter involve a set of partners that is weakly larger than the original. A weakly setwise stable (or setwise stable) outcome exists and can be found by a Constrained Serial Dictatorship algorithm in markets with scale economies (resp. ordinal scale economies). The scale economies condition applies to an environment in which agents cooperate to achieve targets, such as markets in which countries sign bilateral agreements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09479v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses information design in a workhorse model of network games, where agents have linear best responses, the information designer optimizes a quadratic objective, and the payoff state follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution. We formulate the problem as semidefinite programming (SDP) and utilize the duality principle to characterize an optimal information structure. A Gaussian information structure is shown to be optimal among all information structures. A necessary and sufficient condition for optimality is that the induced equilibrium strategy profile and the state jointly satisfy a linear constraint derived from complementary slackness conditions. Consequently, the true state is typically revealed to the entire population of agents, even though individual agents remain only partially informed. In symmetric network games, an optimal information structure inherits the same degree of symmetry, which facilitates its computation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Auction Design with Contingent Payments and Costly Verification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19945v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the design of an auction for an income-generating asset such as an intellectual property license. Each bidder has a signal about his future income from acquiring the asset. After the asset is allocated, the winner's income from the asset is realized privately. The principal can audit the winner, at a cost, and then charge a payment contingent on the winner's realized income. We solve for an auction that maximizes revenue, net auditing costs. The winning bidder is charged linear royalties up to a cap. A higher bidder pays more in cash and faces a lower royalty cap.</description>

      <title>The role of substitution elasticity in Domar aggregation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The economy-wide production network, i.e., the monetary input-output coefficients, will no longer be stable against the general equilibrium propagation of sectoral productivity shocks, when the substitution elasticities of sectoral production are nonneutral. The associated network transformation hence renders nonlinearity in aggregating sectoral productivity shocks into the economy's output, i.e., Domar aggregation. In this study, we demonstrate the possibility of production networks being transformed into a singular one. We also explore the conditions under which the productivity shocks experience synergism in Domar aggregation.</description>

      <title>Nested Removal of Strictly Dominated Strategies in Infinite Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compare two procedures for the iterated removal of strictly dominated strategies. In the nested procedure, a strategy of a player is removed only if it is dominated by an unremoved strategy. The universal procedure is more comprehensive for it allows the removal of strategies that are dominated by previously removed ones. Outside the class of finite games, the two procedures may lead to different outcomes in that the universal one is always order independent while the other is not. Here we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the equivalence of the two procedures. The conditions we give are variations of the bounded mechanisms from the literature on full implementation. The two elimination procedures are shown to be equivalent in quasisupermodular games as well as in games with compact strategy spaces and upper semicontinuous payoff functions. We show by example that order independence of the nested procedure is not sufficient for its being equivalent to the universal one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06530v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes two rankings of statistical experiments using the linear convex order. These rankings provide simpler and more tractable characterizations than Blackwell order, which relies on the convex order. We apply these rankings to compare statistical experiments in binary-action decision problems and in decision problems that aggregate payoffs over a collection of binary-action decision problems. Furthermore, these rankings enable comparisons of statistical experiments in moral hazard problems without requiring the validity of the first-order approach, thereby complementing the results in Holmstr\"om (1979) and Kim (1995).</description>

      <title>Learning to Manipulate under Limited Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16412v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By classic results in social choice theory, any reasonable preferential voting method sometimes gives individuals an incentive to report an insincere preference. The extent to which different voting methods are more or less resistant to such strategic manipulation has become a key consideration for comparing voting methods. Here we measure resistance to manipulation by whether neural networks of various sizes can learn to profitably manipulate a given voting method in expectation, given different types of limited information about how other voters will vote. We trained over 100,000 neural networks of 26 sizes to manipulate against 8 different voting methods, under 6 types of limited information, in committee-sized elections with 5-21 voters and 3-6 candidates. We find that some voting methods, such as Borda, are highly manipulable by networks with limited information, while others, such as Instant Runoff, are not, despite being quite profitably manipulated by an ideal manipulator with full information. For the three probability models for elections that we use, the overall least manipulable of the 8 methods we study are Condorcet methods, namely Minimax and Split Cycle.</description>
