      <title>List Recoverable Codes: The Good, the Bad, and the Unknown (hopefully not Ugly)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: List recovery is a fundamental task for error-correcting codes, vastly generalizing unique decoding from worst-case errors and list decoding. Briefly, one is given ''soft information'' in the form of input lists S_1,...,S_n of bounded size, and one argues that there are not too many codewords that agree a lot with this soft information. This general problem appears in many guises, both within coding theory and in theoretical computer science more broadly.
  In this article we survey recent results on list recovery codes, introducing both the ''good'' (i.e., possibility results, showing that codes with certain list recoverability exist), the ''bad'' (impossibility results), and the ''unknown''. We additionally demonstrate that, while list recoverable codes were initially introduced as a component in list decoding concatenated codes, they have since found myriad applications to and connections with other topics in theoretical computer science.</description>

      <title>Is star complexity a proxy for information based complexity of graphs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information-based complexity (IBC) is a well-defined complexity measure of any object given a description in a language and a classifier that identifies those descriptions with the object. Of course, the exact numerical value will vary according to the descriptive language and classifier, but under certain universality conditions (eg the classifier identifies programs of a universal Turning machine that halt and output the same value), asymptotically, the complexity measure is independent of the classifier up to a constant of O(1). The hypothesis being investigated in this work that any practical IBC measure will similarly be asymptotically equivalent to any other practical IBC measure. Standish presented an IBC measure for graphs ${\cal C}$ that encoded graphs by their links, and identifies graphs as those that are automorphic to each other. An interesting alternate graph measure is {\em star complexity}, which is defined as the number of union and intersection operations of basic stars that can generate the original graph. Whilst not an IBC itself, it can be related to an IBC (called ${\cal C}^*$) that is strongly correlated with star complexity. In this paper, 10 and 22 vertex graphs are constructed up to a star complexity of 8, and the ${\cal C}^*$ compared emprically with ${\cal C}$. Finally, an easily computable upper bound of star complexity is found to be strongly related to ${\cal C}$.</description>

      <title>Integrated Localization, Mapping, and Communication through VCSEL-Based Light-emitting RIS (LeRIS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a light-emitting reconfigurable intelligent surface (LeRIS) architecture that integrates vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) to jointly support user localization, obstacle-aware mapping, and millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication in programmable wireless environments (PWEs). Unlike prior light-emitting diode (LED)-based LeRIS designs with diffuse emission or LiDAR-assisted schemes requiring bulky sensing modules, the proposed VCSEL-based approach exploits narrow Gaussian beams and multimode diversity to enable compact, low-power, and analytically tractable integration. We derive closed-form expressions to jointly recover user position and orientation from received signal strength using only five VCSELs, and reduce this requirement to three under specific geometric conditions by leveraging dual-mode operation. In parallel, we introduce a VCSEL-based mapping method that uses reflected signal time-of-arrival measurements to detect obstructions and guide blockage-resilient RIS beam routing. Simulation results demonstrate millimeter-level localization accuracy, robust obstacle detection, high spectral efficiency, and substantial gains in minimum user rate. These findings establish VCSEL-based LeRIS as a scalable and practically integrable enabler for resilient 6G wireless systems with multi-functional PWEs.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal Rank Adaptive Inference of High Dimensional Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of estimating a high-dimensional matrix from linear measurements, with a focus on designing optimal rank-adaptive algorithms. These algorithms infer the matrix by estimating its singular values and the corresponding singular vectors up to an effective rank, adaptively determined based on the data. We establish instance-specific lower bounds for the sample complexity of such algorithms, uncovering fundamental trade-offs in selecting the effective rank: balancing the precision of estimating a subset of singular values against the approximation cost incurred for the remaining ones. Our analysis identifies how the optimal effective rank depends on the matrix being estimated, the sample size, and the noise level. We propose an algorithm that combines a Least-Squares estimator with a universal singular value thresholding procedure. We provide finite-sample error bounds for this algorithm and demonstrate that its performance nearly matches the derived fundamental limits. Our results rely on an enhanced analysis of matrix denoising methods based on singular value thresholding. We validate our findings with applications to multivariate regression and linear dynamical system identification.</description>

      <title>Exponential Error Bounds for Information Bottleneck Source Coding Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the information bottleneck (IB) source coding problem, also known as remote lossy source coding under logarithmic loss. Based on a rate-limited description of noisy observations, the receiver produces a soft estimate for the remote source, i.e., a probability distribution, evaluated under the logarithmic loss. We focus on the excess distortion probability of IB source coding and investigate how fast it converges to 0 or 1, depending on whether the rate is above or below the rate-distortion function. The latter case is also known as the exponential strong converse. We establish both the exact error exponent and the exact strong converse exponent for IB source coding by deriving matching upper and lower exponential bounds. The obtained exponents involve optimizations over auxiliary random variables. The matching converse bounds are derived through non-trivial extensions of existing sphere packing and single-letterization techniques, which we adapt to incorporate auxiliary random variables.
  In the second part of this paper, we establish a code-level connection between IB source coding and source coding with a helper, also known as the Wyner-Ahlswede-K\"orner (WAK) problem. We show that every code for the WAK problem is a code for IB source coding. This requires noticing that IB source coding, under the excess distortion criterion, is equivalent to source coding with a helper available at both the transmitter and the receiver; the latter in turn relates to the WAK problem. Through this connection, we re-derive the best known sphere packing exponent of the WAK problem, and provide it with an operational interpretation.</description>

      <title>A Rate-Distortion Bound for ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the fundamental performance limits of Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems by introducing a novel converse bound based on rate-distortion theory. This rate-distortion bound (RDB) overcomes the restrictive regularity conditions of classical estimation theory, such as the Bayesian Cram\'er-Rao Bound (BCRB). The proposed framework is broadly applicable, holding for arbitrary parameter distributions and distortion measures, including mean-squared error and probability of error. The bound is proved to be tight in the high sensing noise regime and can be strictly tighter than the BCRB in the low sensing noise regime. The RDB's utility is demonstrated on two challenging scenarios: Nakagami fading channel estimation, where it provides a valid bound even when the BCRB is inapplicable, and a binary occupancy detection task, showcasing its versatility for discrete sensing problems. This work provides a powerful and general tool for characterizing the ultimate performance tradeoffs in ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Simulation of Quantum Repeater Networks under Decoherence and Purification Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-distance quantum communication requires reliable entanglement distribution, but direct generation with protocols such as Barrett--Kok suffers from exponentially decreasing success probability with distance, making it impractical over hundreds of kilometers. Quantum repeaters address this by segmenting the channel and combining entanglement generation, swapping, and purification. In this work, we present a simulation framework for chain-based repeaters under continuous-time depolarizing noise. Our model implements heralded entanglement generation, Bell-state swapping, and multi-round purification, with configurable chain length, noise levels, and purification depth. Numerical results highlight how memory decoherence constrains performance, how purification mitigates fidelity loss, and how time and entanglement costs scale with distance. While simplified, the framework offers a flexible tool for exploring trade-offs in repeater design and provides a basis for extensions toward more complex network scenarios.</description>

      <title>MIRANDA: short signatures from a leakage-free full-domain-hash scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present $\mathsf{Miranda}$, the first family of full-domain-hash signatures based on matrix codes. This signature scheme fulfils the paradigm of Gentry, Peikert and Vaikuntanathan ($\mathsf{GPV}$), which gives strong security guarantees. Our trapdoor is very simple and generic: if we propose it with matrix codes, it can actually be instantiated in many other ways since it only involves a subcode of a decodable code (or lattice) in a unique decoding regime of parameters. Though $\mathsf{Miranda}$ signing algorithm relies on a decoding task where there is exactly one solution, there are many possible signatures given a message to sign and we ensure that signatures are not leaking information on their underlying trapdoor by means of a very simple procedure involving the drawing of a small number of uniform bits. In particular $\mathsf{Miranda}$ does not use a rejection sampling procedure which makes its implementation a very simple task contrary to other $\mathsf{GPV}$-like signatures schemes such as $\mathsf{Falcon}$ or even $\mathsf{Wave}$.
  We instantiate $\mathsf{Miranda}$ with the famous family of Gabidulin codes represented as spaces of matrices and we study thoroughly its security (in the EUF-CMA security model). For~$128$ bits of classical security, the signature sizes are as low as~$90$ bytes and the public key sizes are in the order of~$2.6$ megabytes.</description>

      <title>Black-box Detection of LLM-generated Text Using Generalized Jensen-Shannon Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study black-box detection of machine-generated text under practical constraints: the scoring model (proxy LM) may mismatch the unknown source model, and per-input contrastive generation is costly. We propose SurpMark, a reference-based detector that summarizes a passage by the dynamics of its token surprisals. SurpMark quantizes surprisals into interpretable states, estimates a state-transition matrix for the test text, and scores it via a generalized Jensen-Shannon (GJS) gap between the test transitions and two fixed references (human vs. machine) built once from historical corpora. We prove a principled discretization criterion and establish the asymptotic normality of the decision statistic. Empirically, across multiple datasets, source models, and scenarios, SurpMark consistently matches or surpasses baselines; our experiments corroborate the statistic's asymptotic normality, and ablations validate the effectiveness of the proposed discretization.</description>

      <title>Efficient Generalization via Multimodal Co-Training under Data Scarcity and Distribution Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a multimodal co-training framework designed to enhance model generalization in situations where labeled data is limited and distribution shifts occur. We thoroughly examine the theoretical foundations of this framework, deriving conditions under which the use of unlabeled data and the promotion of agreement between classifiers for different modalities lead to significant improvements in generalization. We also present a convergence analysis that confirms the effectiveness of iterative co-training in reducing classification errors. In addition, we establish a novel generalization bound that, for the first time in a multimodal co-training context, decomposes and quantifies the distinct advantages gained from leveraging unlabeled multimodal data, promoting inter-view agreement, and maintaining conditional view independence. Our findings highlight the practical benefits of multimodal co-training as a structured approach to developing data-efficient and robust AI systems that can effectively generalize in dynamic, real-world environments. The theoretical foundations are examined in dialogue with, and in advance of, established co-training principles.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Computation Using Bias-Preserving Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Certain types of quantum computing platforms, such as those realized using Rydberg atoms or Kerr-cat qubits, are natively more susceptible to Pauli-Z noise than Pauli-X noise, or vice versa. On such hardware, it is useful to ensure that computations use only gates that maintain the Z-bias (or X-bias) in the noise. This is so that quantum error-correcting codes tailored for biased-noise models can be used to provide fault-tolerance on these platforms. In this paper, we follow up on the recent work of Fellous-Asiani et al. (npj Quantum Inf., 2025) in studying the structure and properties of bias-preserving gates. Our main contributions are threefold: (1) We give a novel characterization of Z-bias-preserving gates based on their decomposition as a linear combination of Pauli operators. (2) We show that any Z-bias-preserving gate can be approximated arbitrarily well using only gates from the set {X,R_z(\theta),CNOT,CCNOT}, where \theta is any irrational multiple of 2\pi. (3) We prove, by drawing a connection with coherence resource theory, that any Z-bias-preserving logical operator acting on the logical qubits of a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code can be realized by applying Z-bias-preserving gates on the physical qubits. Along the way, we also demonstrate that Z-bias-preserving gates are far from being universal for quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Deterministic algorithms for inhomogeneous Bernoulli trials: Shapley value of network devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppose that $n$ computer devices are to be connected to a network via inhomogeneous Bernoulli trials. The Shapley value of a device quantifies how much the network's value increases due to the participation of that device. Characteristic functions of such games are naturally taken as the belief function (containment function) and Choquet capacity (hitting probability) of a random set (random network of devices).
  Traditionally, the Shapley value is either calculated as the expected marginal contribution over all possible coalitions (subnetworks), which results in exponential computational complexity, or approximated by the Monte Carlo sampling technique, where the performance is highly dependent on the stochastic sampling process.
  The purpose of this study is to design deterministic algorithms for games formulated via inhomogeneous Bernoulli trials that approximate the Shapley value in linear or quadratic time, with rigorous error analysis (Sections 3 and 4). Additionally, we provide a review of relevant literature on existing calculation methods in Remark 3.1 and Appendix I.
  A further goal is to supplement Shapley's original proof by deriving the Shapley value formula using a rigorous approach based on definite integrals and combinatorial analysis. This method explicitly highlights the roles of the Binomial Theorem and the Beta function in the proof, addressing a gap in Shapley's work (Appendix II).</description>

      <title>Beyond Hoeffding and Chernoff: Trading conclusiveness for advantages in quantum hypothesis testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultimate limits of quantum state discrimination are often thought to be captured by asymptotic bounds that restrict the achievable error probabilities, notably the quantum Chernoff and Hoeffding bounds. Here we study hypothesis testing protocols that are permitted a probability of producing an inconclusive discrimination outcome, and investigate their performance when this probability is suitably constrained. We show that even by allowing an arbitrarily small probability of inconclusiveness, the limits imposed by the quantum Hoeffding and Chernoff bounds can be significantly exceeded, completely circumventing the conventional trade-offs between error exponents in hypothesis testing. Furthermore, such improvements over standard state discrimination are robust and can be obtained even when an exponentially vanishing probability of inconclusive outcomes is demanded. Relaxing the constraints on the inconclusive probability can enable even larger advantages, but this comes at a price. We show a 'strong converse' property of this setting: targeting error exponents beyond those achievable with vanishing inconclusiveness necessarily forces the probability of inconclusive outcomes to converge to one. By exactly quantifying the rate of this convergence, we give a complete characterisation of the trade-offs between error exponents and rates of conclusive outcome probabilities. Overall, our results provide a comprehensive asymptotic picture of how allowing inconclusive measurement outcomes reshapes optimal quantum hypothesis testing.</description>

      <title>Beyond AME: A Novel Connection between Quantum Secret Sharing Schemes and $k$-Uniform States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the connection between quantum secret sharing (QSS) schemes and $k$-uniform states of qubits beyond the equivalence between threshold QSS schemes and AME states. Specifically, we focus on homogeneous access structures and show that $3$-uniformity is a necessary but not sufficient condition for constructing a $3$-homogeneous QSS scheme using states of qubits. This gives a novel connection between non-threshold QSS schemes and $k$-uniform states. As an application of our result, we classify QSS schemes for up to 7 players and provide explicit characterizations of their existence. Our results offer new insights into the role of $k$-uniform states in the design of QSS schemes (not necessarily threshold) and provide a foundation for future classifications of QSS schemes with more complex structures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Tanner Color Codes on Qubits with Transversal Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work focuses on growing our understanding of how high dimensional expanders (HDX) can be utilized to construct highly performant quantum codes. While asymptotically good qLDPC codes have been constructed on 2D HDX built from products of graphs, these constructions have a number of limitations, like lack of structure useful for fault-tolerant logic. We develop a framework for transversal logical gates that can naturally utilize symmetric non-product simplicial HDX, and we demonstrate a particular code in this framework that offers various advantages over prior constructions. Specifically, we study the generalization of color codes to \emph{Tanner color codes}, which encompass color, pin, and rainbow codes, and should enable constructions with better parameters. We prove an `unfolding' theorem that characterizes the logical operators of the Tanner color code in terms of logical operators from several colored copies of the companion sheaf code. We leverage this understanding of the logical operators to identify a local condition that ensures such a code on a $D$-dimensional complex has a strictly-transversal $\frac{2 \pi}{2^D}$-phase gate on a single block, $\frac{2 \pi}{2^\ell}$-phase gates on subsets of a single block for $\ell&lt;D$, and $C^{D-1}Z$ across $D$ blocks that preserve the code space. We explicitly instantiate our paradigm in every dimension with codes on highly-symmetric expanding coset complexes. These are the first qubit codes explicitly defined on expanding (non-product) simplicial complexes. We investigate in detail the self-dual 2D family, which has large rate $\geq \frac{7}{64}$ and transversal $CZ$, $S$, and $H$ gates, among many other fault-tolerant (generalizations of) fold-transversal gates arising from the symmetry of the complex. We conjecture that it has constant relative distance. We conclude by describing a Floquet variant of this code with check weight 4.</description>

      <title>Some theoretical improvements on the tightness of PAC-Bayes risk certificates for neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents four theoretical contributions that improve the usability of risk certificates for neural networks based on PAC-Bayes bounds. First, two bounds on the KL divergence between Bernoulli distributions enable the derivation of the tightest explicit bounds on the true risk of classifiers across different ranges of empirical risk. The paper next focuses on the formalization of an efficient methodology based on implicit differentiation that enables the introduction of the optimization of PAC-Bayesian risk certificates inside the loss/objective function used to fit the network/model. The last contribution is a method to optimize bounds on non-differentiable objectives such as the 0-1 loss. These theoretical contributions are complemented with an empirical evaluation on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets. In fact, this paper presents the first non-vacuous generalization bounds on CIFAR-10 for neural networks.</description>

      <title>Quantum channel discrimination against jammers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of quantum channel discrimination between two channels with an adversary input party (a.k.a. a jammer). This setup interpolates between the best-case channel discrimination as studied by (Wang &amp; Wilde, 2019) and the worst-case channel discrimination as studied by (Fang, Fawzi, &amp; Fawzi, 2025), thereby generalizing both frameworks. To address this problem, we introduce the notion of minimax channel divergence and establish several of its key mathematical properties. We prove the Stein's lemma in this new setting, showing that the optimal type-II error exponent in the asymptotic regime under parallel strategies is characterized by the regularized minimax channel divergence.</description>

      <title>Mean dimension and rate-distortion function revisited</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Around the mean dimensions and rate-distortion functions, using some tools from local entropy theory this paper establishes the following main results:
  $(1)$ We prove that for non-ergodic measures associated with almost sure processes, the mean R\'enyi information dimension coincides with the information dimension rate. This answers a question posed by Gutman and \'Spiewak (in Around the variational principle for metric mean dimension, \emph{Studia Math.} \textbf{261}(2021) 345-360).
  $(2)$ We introduce four types of rate-distortion entropies and establish their relation with Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy.
  $(3)$ We show that for systems with the marker property, if the mean dimension is finite, then the supremum in Lindenstrauss-Tsukamoto's double variational principle can be taken over the set of ergodic measures. Additionally, the double variational principle holds for various other measure-theoretic $\epsilon$-entropies.</description>

      <title>The Tournament Tree Method for preference elicitation in Multi-criteria decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i) elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons, (ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii) derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters. Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making scenarios.</description>

      <title>Hardness of recognizing phases of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that recognizing the phase of matter of an unknown quantum state is quantum computationally hard. More specifically, we show that the quantum computational time of any phase recognition algorithm must grow exponentially in the range of correlations $\xi$ of the unknown state. This exponential growth renders the problem practically infeasible for even moderate correlation ranges, and leads to super-polynomial quantum computational time in the system size $n$ whenever $\xi = \omega(\log n)$. Our results apply to a substantial portion of all known phases of matter, including symmetry-breaking phases and symmetry-protected topological phases for any discrete on-site symmetry group in any spatial dimension. To establish this hardness, we extend the study of pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) to quantum systems with symmetries. We prove that symmetric PRUs exist under standard cryptographic conjectures, and can be constructed in extremely low circuit depths. We also establish hardness for systems with translation invariance and purely classical phases of matter. A key technical limitation is that the locality of the parent Hamiltonians of the states we consider is linear in $\xi$; the complexity of phase recognition for Hamiltonians with constant locality remains an important open question.</description>

      <title>Quantum Relative Entropy Decay Composition Yields Shallow, Unstructured k-Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major line of questions in quantum information and computing asks how quickly locally random circuits converge to resemble global randomness. In particular, approximate k-designs are random unitary ensembles that resemble random circuits up to their first k moments. It was recently shown that on n qudits, random circuits with slightly structured architectures converge to k-designs in depth O(log n), even on one-dimensional connectivity. It has however remained open whether the same shallow depth applies more generally among random circuit architectures and connectivities, or if the structure is truly necessary. We recall the study of exponential relative entropy decay, another topic with a long history in quantum information theory. We show that a constant number of layers of a parallel random circuit on a family of architectures including one-dimensional `brickwork' has O(1 / logn) per-layer multiplicative entropy decay. We further show that on general connectivity graphs of bounded degree, randomly placed gates achieve O(1 / nlogn)-decay (consistent with logn depth). Both of these results imply that random circuit ensembles with O(polylog(n)) depth achieve approximate k-designs in diamond norm. Hence our results address the question of whether extra structure is truly necessary for sublinear-depth convergence. Furthermore, the relative entropy recombination techniques might be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On the optimization dynamics of RLVR: Gradient gap and step size thresholds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), which uses simple binary feedback to post-train large language models, has shown significant empirical success. However, a principled understanding of why it works has been lacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its training process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels. Central to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes the direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the response space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the update direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size threshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning converges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts how the critical step size must scale with response length and the success rate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization improve stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success rate can stagnate strictly below $100\%$. We validate these predictions through controlled bandit simulations and LLM experiments, including training Qwen2.5-7B with GRPO.</description>

      <title>Moment Constraints and Phase Recovery for Multireference Alignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multireference alignment (MRA) refers to the problem of recovering a signal from noisy samples subject to random circular shifts. Expectation--maximization (EM) and variational approaches use statistical modeling to achieve high accuracy at the cost of solving computationally expensive optimization problems. The method of moments, instead, achieves fast reconstructions by utilizing the power spectrum and bispectrum to determine the signal up to shift. Our approach combines the two philosophies by viewing the power spectrum as a manifold on which to constrain the signal. We then maximize the data likelihood function on this manifold with a gradient-based approach to estimate the true signal. Algorithmically, our method involves iterating between template alignment and projections onto the manifold. The method offers increased speed compared to EM and demonstrates improved accuracy over bispectrum-based methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective and reliable data retrieval is critical for the feasibility of DNA storage, and the development of random access efficiency plays a key role in its practicality and reliability. In this paper, we study the Random Access Problem, which asks to compute the expected number of samples one needs in order to recover an information strand. Unlike previous work, we took a geometric approach to the problem, aiming to understand which geometric structures lead to codes that perform well in terms of reducing the random access expectation (Balanced Quasi-Arcs). As a consequence, two main results are obtained. The first is a construction for $k=3$ that outperforms previous constructions aiming to reduce the random access expectation. The second, exploiting a result from~\cite{gruica2024reducing}, is the proof of a conjecture from~\cite{bar2023cover} for rate $1/2$ codes in any dimension.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of STAR-RIS-Assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems with Electromagnetic Interference and Phase Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simultaneous Transmitting and Reflecting Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (STAR-RISs) are being explored for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. A promising configuration for their deployment is within cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, despite the advantages that STAR-RISs could bring, challenges such as electromagnetic interference (EMI) and phase errors may lead to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we investigate the impact of EMI and phase errors on STAR-RIS-assisted cell-free massive MIMO systems and propose techniques to mitigate these effects. We introduce a tailored projected gradient descent (GD) algorithm for STAR-RIS coefficient matrix design by minimizing the local channel estimation normalized mean square error (NMSE). We also derive the novel closed-form expressions of the uplink and downlink spectral efficiency (SE) to analyze system performance with EMI and phase errors, in which fractional power control methods are introduced for performance improvement. The results reveal that the projected GD algorithm can effectively tackle EMI and phase errors to improve estimation accuracy and compensate for performance degradation with nearly 30% NMSE improvement and over 10% SE improvement. Moreover, increasing the number of access points (APs), antennas per AP, and STAR-RIS elements can also improve SE performance. However, the advantages of employing STAR-RIS are reduced when EMI and phase errors are severe. Notably, compared to conventional RISs, the incorporation of STAR-RIS in the proposed system yields better performance and presents less performance degradation in highly impaired environments.</description>

      <title>One-Bit Distributed Mean Estimation with Unknown Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18502v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of distributed mean estimation with $1$-bit communication constraints when the variance is unknown. We focus on the specific case where each user has access to one i.i.d. sample drawn from a distribution that belongs to a scale-location family, and is limited to sending just a single bit of information to a central server whose goal is to estimate the mean. We propose simple non-adaptive and adaptive protocols that are shown to be asymptotically normal. We derive bounds on the asymptotic (in the number of users) Mean Squared Error (MSE) achieved by these protocols. For a class of symmetric log-concave distributions, we derive matching lower bounds for the MSE achieved by adaptive protocols, proving the optimality of our scheme. Furthermore, we develop a lower bound on the MSE for non-adaptive protocols that applies to any symmetric strictly log-concave distribution by means of a refined squared Hellinger distance analysis. Through this, we show that for many common distributions including a subclass of the generalized Gaussian family, the asymptotic minimax MSE achieved by the best non-adaptive protocol is higher than that achieved by our simple adaptive protocol. Our simulation results confirm a positive gap between the adaptive and non-adaptive settings, aligning with the theoretical bounds.</description>

      <title>Robustness of Covariance Estimators with Application in Activity Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The first part of this work considers a general class of covariance estimators. Each estimator of that class is generated by a real-valued function $g$ and a set of model covariance matrices $H$. If $\bf{W}$ is a potentially perturbed observation of a searched covariance matrix, then the estimator is the minimizer of the sum of $g$ applied to each eigenvalue of $\bf{W}^\frac{1}{2}\bf{Z}^{-1}\bf{W}^\frac{1}{2}$ under the constraint that $\bf{Z}$ is from $H$. It is shown that under mild conditions on $g$ and $H$ such estimators are robust, meaning the estimation error can be made arbitrarily small if the perturbation of $\bf{W}$ gets small enough. \par In the second part of this work the previous results are applied to activity detection in random access with multiple receive antennas. In activity detection recovering the large scale fading coefficients is a sparse recovery problem which can be reduced to a structured covariance estimation problem. The recovery can be done with a non-negative least squares estimator or with a relaxed maximum likelihood estimator. It is shown that under suitable assumptions on the distributions of the noise and the channel coefficients, the relaxed maximum likelihood estimator is from the general class of covariance estimators considered in the first part of this work. Then, codebooks based upon a signed kernel condition are proposed. It is shown that with the proposed codebooks both estimators can recover the large-scale fading coefficients if the number of receive antennas is high enough and $S\leq\left\lceil\frac{1}{2}M^2\right\rceil-1$ where $S$ is the number of active users and $M$ is number of pilot symbols per user.</description>

Abstract: An m-uniform quantum state on n qubits is an entangled state in which every m-qubit subsystem is maximally mixed. Starting with an m-uniform state realized as the graph state associated with an m-regular graph, and a classical [n,k,d \ge m+1] binary linear code with certain additional properties, we show that pure [[n,k,m+1]]_2 quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) can be constructed within the codeword stabilized (CWS) code framework. As illustrations, we construct pure [[2^{2r}-1,2^{2r}-2r-3,3]]_2 and [[(2^{4r}-1)^2, (2^{4r}-1)^2 - 32r-7, 5]]_2 QECCs. We also give measurement-based protocols for encoding into code states and for recovery of logical qubits from code states.</description>

      <title>WaveMax: Radar Waveform Design via Convex Maximization of FrFT Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14164</link>

Abstract: The ambiguity function (AF) is a critical tool in radar waveform design, representing the two-dimensional correlation between a transmitted signal and its time-delayed, frequency-shifted version. Obtaining a radar signal to match a specified AF magnitude is a bi-variate variant of the well-known phase retrieval problem. Prior approaches to this problem were either limited to a few classes of waveforms or lacked a computable procedure to estimate the signal. Our recent work provided a framework for solving this problem for both band- and time-limited signals using non-convex optimization. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach WaveMax that formulates waveform recovery as a convex optimization problem by relying on the fractional Fourier transform (FrFT)-based AF. We exploit the fact that AF of the FrFT of the original signal is equivalent to a rotation of the original AF. In particular, we reconstruct the radar signal by solving a low-rank minimization problem, which approximates the waveform using the leading eigenvector of a matrix derived from the AF. Our theoretical analysis shows that unique waveform reconstruction is achievable with a sample size no more than three times the signal frequencies or time samples. Numerical experiments validate the efficacy of WaveMax in recovering signals from noiseless and noisy AF, including scenarios with randomly and uniformly sampled sparse data.</description>

      <title>Quantum umlaut information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum umlaut information, a correlation measure defined for bipartite quantum states $\rho_{AB}$ as a reversed variant of the quantum mutual information: $U(A;B)_\rho = \min_{\sigma_B} D(\rho_A\otimes \sigma_B\|\rho_{AB})$ in terms of the quantum relative entropy $D$. As in the classical case [Girardi et al., arXiv:2503.18910], this definition allows for a closed-form expression and has an operational interpretation as the asymptotic error exponent in the hypothesis testing task of deciding whether a given bipartite state is product or not. We generalise the umlaut information to quantum channels, where it also extends the notion of `oveloh information' [Nuradha et al., arXiv:2404.16101]. We prove that channel umlaut information is additive for classical-quantum channels, while we observe additivity violations for fully quantum channels. Inspired by recent results in entanglement theory, we then show as our main result that the regularised umlaut information constitutes a fundamental measure of the quality of classical information transmission over a quantum channel -- as opposed to the capacity, which quantifies the quantity of information that can be sent. This interpretation applies to coding assisted by activated non-signalling correlations, and the channel umlaut information is in general larger than the corresponding expression for unassisted communication as obtained by Dalai for the classical-quantum case [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 59, 8027 (2013)]. Combined with prior works on non-signalling--assisted zero-error channel capacities, our findings imply a dichotomy between the settings of zero-rate error exponents and zero-error communication. While our results are single-letter only for classical-quantum channels, we also give a single-letter bound for fully quantum channels in terms of the `geometric' version of umlaut information.</description>

      <title>Condense to Conduct and Conduct to Condense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the first explicit examples of low-conductance permutations. The notion of conductance of permutations was introduced by Dodis et al. in "Indifferentiability of Confusion-Diffusion Networks", where the search for low-conductance permutations was first initiated and motivated. As part of our contribution, we not only provide these examples, but also offer a general characterization of the problem: we show that low-conductance permutations are equivalent to permutations possessing the information-theoretic properties of Multi-Source-Somewhere-Condensers, a specific variant of somewhere condensers.</description>
