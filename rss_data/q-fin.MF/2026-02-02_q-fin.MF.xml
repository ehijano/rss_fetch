      <title>A unified theory of order flow, market impact, and volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.23172v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a microstructural model for the order flow in financial markets that distinguishes between {\it core orders} and {\it reaction flow}, both modeled as Hawkes processes. This model has a natural scaling limit that reconciles a number of salient empirical properties: persistent signed order flow, rough trading volume and volatility, and power-law market impact. In our framework, all these quantities are pinned down by a single statistic $H_0$, which measures the persistence of the core flow. Specifically, the signed flow converges to the sum of a fractional process with Hurst index $H_0$ and a martingale, while the limiting traded volume is a rough process with Hurst index $H_0-1/2$. No-arbitrage constraints imply that volatility is rough, with Hurst parameter $2H_0-3/2$, and that the price impact of trades follows a power law with exponent $2-2H_0$. The analysis of signed order flow data yields an estimate $H_0 \approx 3/4$. This is not only consistent with the square-root law of market impact, but also turns out to match estimates for the roughness of traded volumes and volatilities remarkably well.</description>

      <title>Analytical Formula for Fractional-Order Conditional Moments of Nonlinear Drift CEV Process with Regime Switching: Hybrid Approach with Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an analytical formula for the fractional-order conditional moments of nonlinear drift constant elasticity of variance (NLD-CEV) processes under regime switching, governed by continuous-time finite-state irreducible Markov chains. By employing a hybrid system approach, we derive exact closed-form expressions for these moments across arbitrary fractional orders and regime states, thereby enhancing the analytical tractability of NLD-CEV models under stochastic regimes. Our methodology hinges on formulating and solving a complex system of interconnected partial differential equations derived from the Feynman-Kac formula for switching diffusions. To illustrate the practical relevance of our approach, Monte Carlo simulations for process with Markovian switching are applied to validate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the analytical formulas. Furthermore, we apply our findings for the valuation of financial derivatives within a dynamic nonlinear mean-reverting regime-switching framework, which demonstrates significant improvements over traditional methods. This work offers substantial contributions to financial modeling and derivative pricing by providing a robust tool for practitioners and researchers who are dealing with complex stochastic environments.</description>

      <title>Optimal Capital Structure for Life Insurance Companies Offering Surplus Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12851v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We adapt Leland's dynamic capital structure model to the context of an insurance company selling participating life insurance contracts explaining the existence of life insurance contracts which provide both a guaranteed payment and surplus participation to the policyholders. Our derivation of the optimal participation rate reveals its pronounced sensitivity to the contract duration and the associated tax rate. Moreover, the asset substitution effect, which describes the tendency of equity holders to increase the riskiness of a company's investment decisions, decreases when adding surplus participation.</description>

      <title>An Ambit Field Framework for the Full Panel of Day-ahead Electricity Prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the often overlooked fact that electricity spot prices in individual European generation zones evolve as a high dimensional panel structure. A general continuous time framework is developed by formulating the panel as an ambit field indexed by a cylinder surface, where the cross sectional dimension is represented by a circle. This requires a treatment of ambit fields on manifolds, but the departure from Euclidean space allows for embedding intrinsic dependence structures into the index set in a flexible and parameter-free way, where the daily delivery periods have a canonical mapping onto the circle. The model is a natural space-time extension of volatility modulated L\'evy-driven Volterra processes, which have previously been studied in the context of energy markets, and the pricing of electricity derivatives turns out to be essentially as analytically tractable as in the null-spatial setting. The space-time framework extends the scope of possible derivatives to products written on individual delivery periods, where spreads between these constitute an interesting example. We establish useful formulas for the pricing of various derivatives along with a simulation scheme, and study specifications of the dependence structure in detail.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium Investment with Random Risk Aversion: (Non-)uniqueness, Optimality, and Comparative Statics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a continuous-time portfolio selection problem under a general distribution of random risk aversion (RRA). We provide a complete characterization of all deterministic equilibrium strategies in closed form. Our results show that the structure of the solution depends crucially on the distribution of RRA: the equilibrium is unique (if exits) when the expectation of RRA is finite, whereas an infinite expectation leads either to infinitely many equilibria or to a unique trivial one (i.e. risk-free investment). To resolve this multiplicity of equilibria, we select, among all deterministic equilibria, the one that maximizes the objective functional at the initial time. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of such an optimal equilibrium, which is then shown to be unique and uniformly optimal. Finally, we conduct a comparative statics. Using counterexamples based on two-point distributed RRA, we demonstrate that a larger risk aversion in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance does not necessarily lead to less risky investment. Within the two-point distribution framework, we further examine the single-crossing property of equilibrium strategies and the monotonicity of the crossing time. We show that a larger risk aversion under a stronger stochastic order -- the reverse hazard rate order -- always leads to less risky investment. In addition, we analyze how the convex combination of independent and identically distributed RRAs influences investment.</description>
