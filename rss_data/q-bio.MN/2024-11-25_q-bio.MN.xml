      <title>Enlightening the blind spot of the Michaelis-Menten rate law: The role of relaxation dynamics in molecular complex formation</title>

Abstract: The century-long Michaelis-Menten rate law and its modifications in the modeling of biochemical rate processes stand on the assumption that the concentration of the complex of interacting molecules, at each moment, rapidly approaches an equilibrium (quasi-steady state) compared to the pace of molecular concentration changes. Yet, in the case of actively time-varying molecular concentrations with transient or oscillatory dynamics, the deviation of the complex profile from the quasi-steady state becomes relevant. A recent theoretical approach, known as the effective time-delay scheme (ETS), suggests that the delay by the relaxation time of molecular complex formation contributes to the substantial breakdown of the quasi-steady state assumption. Here, we systematically expand this ETS and inquire into the comprehensive roles of relaxation dynamics in complex formation. Through the modeling of rhythmic protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions and the mammalian circadian clock, our analysis reveals the effect of the relaxation dynamics beyond the time delay, which extends to the dampening of changes in the complex concentration with a reduction in the oscillation amplitude compared to the quasi-steady state. Interestingly, the combined effect of the time delay and amplitude reduction shapes both qualitative and quantitative oscillatory patterns such as the emergence and variability of the mammalian circadian rhythms. These findings highlight the downside of the routine assumption of quasi-steady states and enhance the mechanistic understanding of rich time-varying biomolecular processes.</description>

      <title>Complex balanced distributions for chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04091v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reaction networks have become a major modelling framework in the biological sciences from epidemiology and population biology to genetics and cellular biology. In recent years, much progress has been made on stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) that in particular are applicable when copy numbers are low (as in cellular systems) or when noise and drift are ubiquitous (as in population genetic models). Often a main interest is the long term behaviour of a system: does the system settle towards stochastic equilibrium in some sense? In that context, we are concerned with SRNs, modelled as continuous time Markov chains (CTMCs) and their stationary distributions. In particular, we are interested in complex balanced stationary distributions, where the probability flow out of a complex equals the flow into the complex. We characterise the existence and the form of complex balanced distributions of SRNs with arbitrary transition functions through conditions on the cycles of a corresponding reaction graph (a digraph). Furthermore, we give a sufficient condition for the existence of a complex balanced distribution and give precise conditions for when it is also necessary. The sufficient condition is also necessary for mass-action kinetics (and certain generalisations of that) or if the connected components of the digraph are cycles. Moreover, we state a deficiency theorem, a generalisation of the deficiency theorem for stochastic mass-action kinetics to arbitrary stochastic genetics. The theorem gives the co-dimension of the parameter space for which a complex balanced distribution exists.</description>
