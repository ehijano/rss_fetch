      <title>On the Melnikov method for fractional-order systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to clarifying and introducing the correct application of Melnikov method in fractional dynamics. Attention to the complex dynamics of hyperbolic orbits and to fractional calculus can be, respectively, traced back to Poincar\'es attack on the three-body problem a century ago and to the early days of calculus three centuries ago. Nowadays, fractional calculus has been widely applied in modeling dynamic problems across various fields due to its advantages in describing problems with non-locality. Some of these models have also been confirmed to exhibit hyperbolic orbit dynamics, and recently, they have been extensively studied based on Melnikov method, an analytical approach for homoclinic and heteroclinic orbit dynamics. Despite its decade-long application in fractional dynamics, there is a universal problem in these applications that remains to be clarified, i.e., defining fractional-order systems within finite memory boundaries leads to the neglect of perturbation calculation for parts of the stable and unstable manifolds in Melnikov analysis. After clarifying and redefining the problem, a rigorous analytical case is provided for reference. Unlike existing results, the Melnikov criterion here is derived in a globally closed form, which was previously considered unobtainable due to difficulties in the analysis of fractional-order perturbations characterized by convolution integrals with power-law type singular kernels. Finally, numerical methods are employed to verify the derived Melnikov criterion. Overall, the clarification for the problem and the presented case are expected to provide insights for future research in this topic.</description>

      <title>Chaotic dynamics of granules-beam coupled vibration: Route and threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although granular materials are the second most processed in industry after water, the theoretical study of granules-structure interactions is not as advanced as that of fluid-structure interactions due to the lack of a unified view of the constitutive relation of granular materials. In the previous work, the theoretical model of granules-beam coupled vibration was developed and verified by experiments. However, it was also found that the system exhibits significant stiffness-softening Duffing characteristics even under micro-vibration, which implies that chaotic responses may be reached under certain conditions. To reveal the route and critical conditions for the system to enter chaos, in the present work, the chaotic dynamics of the system are studied. In qualitative analysis, Melnikov method is applied to analyze the instability behavior of the perturbed heteroclinic orbit of the system, thus the critical condition for the system to enter Smale horseshoe chaos, i.e., the Melnikov criterion, is obtained. The validity of the criterion is verified numerically. In experimental studies, the existence of chaotic responses and the route to chaos for granules-beam coupled vibrations is revealed. The experimental results suggest that the system response first experiences symmetry-breaking then undergoes a complete period-doubling cascade, and finally enters single-scroll chaos. In addition, although the Additional Dynamic Load (ADL) generated by granular media is highly complicated, a general and simple evolution pattern of the chaos threshold is found by parametric experiments, which is also supported by the Melnikov criterion. In short, the chaotic dynamics of granules-beam coupled vibration is revealed, which is a contribution to the engineering vibration aspect. On the theoretical side, an impressive result lies in that for the first time, the Melnikov criterion of such fractional-order...</description>

      <title>Vibrational resonance in the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model under state-dependent time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a nonlinear one-dimensional FitzHugh--Nagumo neuronal model with an asymmetric potential driven by both a high-frequency and a low-frequency signal. Our numerical analysis focuses on the influence of a state-dependent time delay on vibrational resonance and delay-induced resonance phenomena. The response amplitude at the low-frequency is explored to characterize the vibrational resonance and delay-induced resonance. By this effort, we realize that for smaller values of the amplitude of the state-dependent time-delay velocity component, vibrational resonance and multi-resonance occur in the neuronal model. For large values of the high-frequency excitation amplitude, vibrational resonance appears with one peak. We observe a decrease in the response when the amplitude of the state-dependent time-delay velocity component increases. Also, we analyze how the state-dependent time-delay position and velocity components can give birth to delay-induced resonance for separate and together. The main results of this work are that the state-dependent time-delay velocity component can play a major role in both phenomena. In fact the parameter of the delay can control the triggering of the two resonances.</description>

      <title>What is the graph of a dynamical system?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some of the basic properties of any dynamical system can be summarized by a graph. The dynamical systems in our theory run from maps like the logistic map to ordinary differential equations to dissipative partial differential equations.
  We define two types of graphs: what we call a ``trajectory graph'' and a ``Morse graph'', which adds subtleties. Each node of a trajectory graph is a limit set of a trajectory, and there is an edge between two nodes if, for every $\eps&gt;0$, there is a trajectory passing within $\eps$ from both nodes. In particular, there is an edge between two nodes if there is a trajectory whose forward limit set is in one node and its backward limit set is in the other. Morse graphs are more varied, and the literature has several definitions of graphs of this type. We show the various standard definitions of Morse graphs produce the same graphs provided there are at most countably many nodes and other mild hypotheses.
  Our initial goal was to prove that, under mild hypotheses, every graph is a connected graph, and we prove that.</description>

      <title>Quantum Enhancement of Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relaxation to equilibrium in Bose-Hubbard rings is numerically investigated in the time domain. We show that for small mean site populations in the Mott insulator regime, characterized by strong onsite interaction as compared to hopping, equipartition starting from nonequilibrium initial states is significantly faster in these bosonic quantum many-body systems than in their classical counterparts, given by discrete Gross-Pitaevskii lattices. We attribute this phenomenon of thermalization enhancement to a genuine quantum transport mechanism akin to tunneling, allowing for pathways that are more efficient than chaotic diffusion across the ergodic domain of the classical systems.</description>

      <title>Quasiclassical theory of out-of-time-ordered correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), defined via the squared commutator of a time-evolving and a stationary operator, represent observables that provide useful indicators for chaos and the scrambling of information in complex quantum systems. Here we present a quasiclassical formalism of OTOCs, which is obtained from the semiclassical van Vleck-Gutzwiller propagator through the application of the diagonal approximation. For short evolution times, this quasiclassical approach yields the same result as the Wigner-Moyal formalism, i.e., OTOCs are classically described via the square of the Poisson bracket between the two involved observables, thus giving rise to an exponential growth in a chaotic regime. For long times, for which the semiclassical framework is, in principle, still valid, the diagonal approximation yields an asymptotic saturation value for the quasiclassical OTOC under the assumption of fully developed classical chaos. However, numerical simulations, carried out within chaotic few-site Bose-Hubbard systems in the absence and presence of periodic driving, demonstrate that this saturation value strongly underestimates the actual threshold value of the quantum OTOC, which is normally attained after the Ehrenfest time. This indicates that nondiagonal and hence genuinely quantum contributions, thus exceeding the framework of the quasiclassical description, are primarily responsible for describing OTOCs beyond the short-time regime.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of chaotic dynamics in random modular networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of randomly connected neural populations and study its dynamics by means of the dynamical mean-field theory and simulations. Our analysis uncovers a rich phase diagram, featuring high- and low-dimensional chaotic phases, separated by a crossover region characterized by low values of the maximal Lyapunov exponent and participation ratio dimension, but with high and rapidly changing values of the Lyapunov dimension. Counterintuitively, chaos can be attenuated by either adding noise to strongly modular connectivity or by introducing modularity into random connectivity. Extending the model to include a multilevel, hierarchical connectivity reveals that a loose balance between activities across levels drives the system towards the edge of chaos.</description>

      <title>Integrability is generic in homogeneous U(1)-invariant nearest-neighbor qubit circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrability is an exceptional property believed to hold only for systems with fine-tuned parameters. Contrary, we explicitly show that in homogeneous nearest-neighbor qubit circuits with a U(1) symmetry, i.e., circuits that repeatedly apply the same magnetization-conserving two-qubit gate, this is not the case. There, integrability is generic: all such brickwall qubit circuits are integrable, even with a randomly selected gate. We identify two phases with different conservation laws, transport properties, and strong zero edge modes. Experimentally important is the fact that varying any one of the parameters in the generic U(1) gate, one will typically cross the critical manifold that separates the two phases. Finally, we report on an unconventional time-reversal symmetry causing the system with open boundary conditions to be in the orthogonal class, while the one with periodic boundary conditions is in the unitary class.</description>
