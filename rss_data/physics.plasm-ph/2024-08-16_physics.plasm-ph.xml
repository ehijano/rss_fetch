      <title>A Terahertz nanoscale vacuum field emission transistor with an embedded gate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale vacuum field emission transistors (nvFET) have the potential for high-power terahertz operations. In this paper, a field emission transistor with a vacuum channel and an embedded gate working in terahertz frequency range is presented. The fabrication of the device was compatible with existing CMOS and MEMS processes, and its structure was designed to have a low gate leakage current and easy parallelisation for improved carry-load capability. Full on-chip measurements of input capacitance and I-V characteristics of the transistor were carried out, and from measured data a conductance of 66.9 uS was calculated, and hence a cut-off frequency of 1.69 THz was calculated from the fabricated nvFET .</description>

      <title>Global Stellarator Coil Optimization with Quadratic Constraints and Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most present stellarator designs are produced by costly two-stage optimization: the first for an optimized equilibrium, and the second for a coil design reproducing its magnetic configuration. Few proxies for coil complexity and forces exist at the equilibrium stage. Rapid initial state finding for both stages is a topic of active research. Most present convex coil optimization codes use the least square winding surface method by Merkel (NESCOIL), with recent improvement in conditioning, regularization , sparsity and physics objectives. While elegant, the method is limited to modeling the norms of linear functions in coil current. We present QUADCOIL, a fast, global coil optimization method that targets combinations of linear and quadratic functions of the current. It can directly constrain and/or minimize a wide range of physics objectives unavailable in NESCOIL and REGCOIL, including the Lorentz force, magnetic energy, curvature, field-current alignment, and the maximum density of a dipole array. QUADCOIL requires no initial guess and runs nearly $10^2\times$ faster than filament optimization. Integrating it in the equilibrium optimization stage can potentially exclude equilibria with difficult-to-design coils, without significantly increasing the computation time per iteration. QUADCOIL finds the exact, global minimum in a large parameter space when possible, and otherwise finds a well-performing approximate global minimum. It supports most regularization techniques developed for NESCOIL and REGCOIL. We demonstrate QUADCOIL's effectiveness in coil topology control, minimizing non-convex penalties, and predicting filament coil complexity with three numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Using Symmetries to Investigate the Complete Integrability, Solitary Wave Solutions and Solitons of the Gardner Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a scaling symmetry, it is shown how to compute polynomial conservation laws, generalized symmetries, recursion operators, Lax pairs, and bilinear forms of polynomial nonlinear partial differential equations thereby establishing their complete integrability. The Gardner equation is chosen as the key example for it comprises both the Korteweg-de Vries and modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equations. The Gardner and Miura transformations which connect these equations are also computed using the concept of scaling homogeneity. Exact solitary wave solutions and solitons of the Gardner equation are derived using Hirota's method and other direct methods. The nature of these solutions depends on the sign of the cubic term in the Gardner equation and the underlying mKdV equation. It is shown that flat (table-top) waves of large amplitude only occur when the sign of the cubic nonlinearity is negative (defocusing case) whereas the focusing Gardner equation has the standard elastically colliding solitons. The paper's aim is to provide a review of integrability properties and solutions of the Gardner equation and illustrate the applicability of the scaling symmetry approach. The methods and algorithms used in this paper have been implemented in Mathematica but can be adapted for major computer algebra systems.</description>

      <title>On the Formation of Super-Alfv\'enic Flows Downstream of Collisionless Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-Alfv\'enic jets, with kinetic energy densities significantly exceeding that of the solar wind, are commonly generated downstream of Earth's bow shock under both high and low beta plasma conditions. In this study, we present theoretical evidence that these enhanced kinetic energy flows are driven by firehose-unstable fluctuations and compressive heating within collisionless plasma environments. Using a fluid formalism that incorporates pressure anisotropy, we estimate that the downstream flow of a collisionless plasma shock can be accelerated by a factor of 2 to 4 following the compression and saturation of firehose instability. By analyzing quasi-parallel magnetosheath jets observed in situ by the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, we find that approximately 11\% of plasma measurements within these jets exhibit firehose-unstable fluctuations. Our findings offer an explanation for the distinctive generation of fast downstream flows in both low ($\beta&lt;1$) and high ($\beta&gt;1$) beta plasmas, and provide new evidence that kinetic processes are crucial for accurately describing the formation and evolution of magnetosheath jets.</description>

      <title>Radiative plasma simulations of black hole accretion flow coronae in the hard and soft states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass black holes in x-ray binary systems are powered by mass transfer from a companion star. The accreted gas forms an accretion disk around the black hole and emits x-ray radiation in two distinct modes: hard and soft state. The origin of the states is unknown. We perform radiative plasma simulations of the electron-positron-photon corona around the inner accretion flow. Our simulations extend previous efforts by self-consistently including all the prevalent quantum electrodynamic processes. We demonstrate that when the plasma is turbulent, it naturally generates the observed hard-state emission. In addition, we show that when soft x-ray photons irradiate the system -- mimicking radiation from an accretion disk -- the turbulent plasma transitions into a new equilibrium state that generates the observed soft-state emission. Our findings demonstrate that turbulent motions of magnetized plasma can power black-hole accretion flow coronae and that quantum electrodynamic processes control the underlying state of the plasma.</description>
