      <title>Separate surface and bulk topological Anderson localization transitions in disordered axion insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In topological phases of matter for which the bulk and boundary support distinct electronic gaps, there exists the possibility of decoupled mobility gaps in the presence of disorder. This is in analogy with the well-studied problem of realizing separate or concomitant bulk-boundary criticality in conventional Landau theory. Using a three-dimensional axion insulator having clean, gapped surfaces with $e^2/2h$ quantized Hall conductance, we show the bulk and surface mobility gap evolve differently in the presence of disorder. The decoupling of the bulk and surface topology yields a regime that realizes a two-dimensional, unquantized anomalous Hall metal in the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE), which shares some spectral and response properties akin to the surface states of a conventional three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator. The generality of these results as well as extensions to other insulators and superconductors is discussed.</description>

      <title>Networks of neural networks: more is different</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The common thread behind the recent Nobel Prize in Physics to John Hopfield and those conferred to Giorgio Parisi in 2021 and Philip Anderson in 1977 is disorder. Quoting Philip Anderson: "more is different". This principle has been extensively demonstrated in magnetic systems and spin glasses, and, in this work, we test its validity on Hopfield neural networks to show how an assembly of these models displays emergent capabilities that are not present at a single network level. Such an assembly is designed as a layered associative Hebbian network that, beyond accomplishing standard pattern recognition, spontaneously performs also pattern disentanglement. Namely, when inputted with a composite signal -- e.g., a musical chord -- it can return the single constituting elements -- e.g., the notes making up the chord. Here, restricting to notes coded as Rademacher vectors and chords that are their mixtures (i.e., spurious states), we use tools borrowed from statistical mechanics of disordered systems to investigate this task, obtaining the conditions over the model control-parameters such that pattern disentanglement is successfully executed.</description>

      <title>Reentrant localization transition in a dimerized quasiperiodic dipolar chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reentrant localization transitions, that is, the transitions of a portion of the eigenspectrum from localized to critical and then again to localized as the disorder strength is increased, have been recently unveiled in various quasiperiodic models. However, how these transitions may extend to systems with long-range coupling and dissipation remains elusive. Here we investigate the fate of such a phenomenon in a dimerized quasiperiodic chain of dipolar emitters with all-to-all coupling. Through an extensive study of the spectral properties of our model, we demonstrate that such anomalous transitions survive to all-to-all couplings when considering a staggered quasiperiodic modulation of the spacings between the emitters. Transport simulations through a driven-dissipative open quantum system approach complete our study and reveal the effects of emitter losses on the reentrant localization transition.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuations can enhance or reduce positional uncertainty at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle guarantees a non-zero value for the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle &gt; 0$, even without thermal fluctuations. This implies that quantum fluctuations inherently enhance positional uncertainty at zero temperature. A natural question then arises: what happens at finite temperatures, where the interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations may give rise to complex and intriguing behaviors? To address this question, we systematically investigate the positional uncertainty, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$, of a particle in equilibrium confined within a nonlinear potential of the form $V(x) \propto x^a$, where $a = 2, 4, 6, \dots$ represents an even exponent. Using path integral Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ in equilibrium as a function of the thermal de Broglie wavelength $\Lambda$. Interestingly, for large values of $a$, $\left\langle\Delta x^2\right\rangle$ exhibits a non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$: it initially decreases with increasing $\Lambda$ at small $\Lambda$ but increases at larger $\Lambda$. To further understand this behavior, we employ a semiclassical approximation, which reveals that quantum fluctuations can reduce positional uncertainty for small $\Lambda$ when the nonlinearity of the potential is sufficiently strong. Finally, we discuss the potential implications of this result for many-body phenomena driven by strong nonlinear interactions, such as glass transitions, where the transition densities exhibit a similar non-monotonic dependence on $\Lambda$.</description>

      <title>Unconventional resistive switching in dense Ag-based nanowire networks with brain-inspired perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an unconventional resistive switching effect on high-density self-assembled Ag-nanowire networks tailored by a fuse-like operation. We propose a mechanism to rationalize the observed phenomenology by analyzing the electrical signatures before and after such a fusing. The explanation allows reconciling the results obtained in similar systems early adopted as transparent electrodes and the more recent attempts to use this type of substrate for in-materia computational operations. In addition to the usual analog nature of the available resistance states and the ability to tune internal weights, we show that these networks' sparsity and non-linear behavior are also attributes. Thus, the formerly exhibited nanowires' abilities to code synaptic behavior are complemented by neuronal features upon properly tuning the network density and the applied electrical protocol.</description>

      <title>CASK: A Gauge Covariant Transformer for Lattice Gauge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Transformer neural network architecture specifically designed for lattice QCD, focusing on preserving the fundamental symmetries required in lattice gauge theory. The proposed architecture is gauge covariant/equivariant, ensuring it respects gauge symmetry on the lattice, and is also equivariant under spacetime symmetries such as rotations and translations on the lattice. A key feature of our approach lies in the attention matrix, which forms the core of the Transformer architecture. To preserve symmetries, we define the attention matrix using a Frobenius inner product between link variables and extended staples. This construction ensures that the attention matrix remains invariant under gauge transformations, thereby making the entire Transformer architecture covariant. We evaluated the performance of the gauge covariant Transformer in the context of self-learning HMC. Numerical experiments show that the proposed architecture achieves higher performance compared to the gauge covariant neural networks, demonstrating its potential to improve lattice QCD calculations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of network communities driven by local rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural systems are modeled by networks where nodes represent the system units and links their interactions. The networks nodes are often segregated into communities with different connectivity patterns. Node heterogeneity such as political affiliation in social networks or biological function in gene networks are highlighted as key factors driving the segregation of nodes into communities. Here I demonstrate that node heterogeneity is not a necessary requirement. Network communities are bound to emerge as a consequence of the local nature of the network evolution. To this end I introduce the Ramsey community number, $r_C$, the minimum graph size that warranties the emergence of network communities with almost certainty. I show that the Watts-Strogatz, local search and duplication-split network models all have finite $r_C$ values. In contrast, random graphs do not have emergent communities property and the Barab\'asi-Albert model does not reach certainty for the emergence of communities. I conclude that network communities are an emergent property rooted on the local nature of the network evolution.</description>

      <title>Effects of clustering heterogeneity on the spectral density of sparse networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive exact equations for the spectral density of sparse networks with an arbitrary distribution of the number of single edges and triangles per node. These equations enable a systematic investigation of the effect of clustering on the spectral properties of the network adjacency matrix. In the case of heterogeneous networks, we demonstrate that the spectral density becomes more symmetric as the fluctuations in the triangle-degree sequence increase. This phenomenon is explained by the small clustering coefficient of networks with a large variance of the triangle-degree distribution. In the homogeneous case of regular clustered networks, we find that both perturbative and non-perturbative approximations fail to predict the spectral density in the high-connectivity limit. This suggests that traditional large-degree approximations may be ineffective in studying the spectral properties of networks with more complex motifs. Our theoretical results are fully confirmed by numerical diagonalizations of finite adjacency matrices.</description>

      <title>Variational Neural and Tensor Network Approximations of Thermal States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a variational Monte Carlo algorithm for approximating finite-temperature quantum many-body systems, based on the minimization of a modified free energy. This approach directly approximates the state at a fixed temperature, allowing for systematic improvement of the ansatz expressiveness without accumulating errors from iterative imaginary time evolution. We employ a variety of trial states -- both tensor networks as well as neural networks -- as variational Ans\"atze for our numerical optimization. We benchmark and compare different constructions in the above classes, both for one- and two-dimensional problems, with systems made of up to $N=100$ spins. Our results demonstrate that while restricted Boltzmann machines show limitations, string bond tensor network states exhibit systematic improvements with increasing bond dimensions and the number of strings.</description>

      <title>Low-dimensional model for adaptive networks of spiking neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a large ensemble of Quadratic Integrate-and-Fire (QIF) neurons with heterogeneous input currents and adaptation variables. Our analysis reveals that for a specific class of adaptation, termed quadratic spike-frequency adaptation (QSFA), the high-dimensional system can be exactly reduced to a low-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations, which describes the dynamics of three mean-field variables: the population's firing rate, the mean membrane potential, and a mean adaptation variable. The resulting low-dimensional firing rate equations (FRE) uncover a key generic feature of heterogeneous networks with spike frequency adaptation: Both the center and the width of the distribution of the neurons' firing frequencies are reduced, and this largely promotes the emergence of collective synchronization in the network. Our findings are further supported by the bifurcation analysis of the FRE, which accurately captures the collective dynamics of the spiking neuron network, including phenomena such as collective oscillations, bursting, and macroscopic chaos.</description>

      <title>On the shape of Gaussian scale-free polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the model of complex hyperbranched polymer structures formed on the basis of scale-free graphs, where functionalities (degrees) $k$ of nodes obey a power law decaying probability $p(k)\sim{k^{-\alpha}}$. Such polymer topologies can be considered as generalization of regular hierarchical dendrimer structures with fixed functionalities. The conformational size and shape characteristics, such as averaged asphericity $\langle A_3 \rangle$ and size ratio $g$ of such polymer networks are obtained numerically by application of Wei's method, which defines the configurations of any complex Gaussian network in terms of eigenvalue spectra of corresponding Kirchhoff matrix. Our quantitative results indicate, in particular, an increase of compactness and symmetry of network structures with the decrease of parameter $\alpha$.</description>
