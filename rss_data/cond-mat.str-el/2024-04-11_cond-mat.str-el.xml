      <title>Solvable models of two-level systems coupled to itinerant electrons: Robust non-Fermi liquid and quantum critical pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strange metal behavior is traditionally associated with an underlying putative quantum critical point at zero temperature. However, in many correlated metals, e.g., high-Tc cuprate superconductors, strange metallicity persists at low temperatures over an extended range of microscopic parameters, suggesting the existence of an underlying quantum critical phase, whose possible physical origins remain poorly understood. Systematic investigations of physical scenarios giving rise to such a critical, non-Fermi liquid (NFL) phase are therefore crucial to better understand this puzzling behavior. In a previous work [Bashan et al. arXiv:2310.07768], we considered a solvable large-N model consisting of itinerant electrons coupled to local two-level systems (TLSs) via spatially random interactions, inspired by the possibility of emergent metallic glassiness due to frustrated competing orders, and found that the system hosts an NFL phase with tunable exponents at intermediate couplings. In this work, we expand our investigation to the following: (i) We study the extent to which this NFL phase is generic by considering various deformations of our theory, including coupling of electrons to multiple operators of the TLSs and arbitrarily directed TLS-fields. We find that the physical picture obtained in Bashan et al. qualitatively persist in a wide region of parameter space, showcasing the robustness of the NFL phase; (ii) We analyze the superconducting instability due to coupling of TLSs to electrons, and find a rich structure, including quantum critical pairing associated with the NFL phase and conventional BCS pairing in the weak and strong coupling limits; (iii) We elaborate on the analysis of Bashan et al., including single-particle, transport and thermodynamic properties.</description>

      <title>Direct transition from a fractional quantum anomalous Hall state to a smectic state with the same Hall conductance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent developments in twisted MoTe_2 and rhombohedral multilayer graphene have generated widespread attention to the general features of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, including their possible coexistence with and transition to various symmetry breaking charge ordered states. These attentions are pushing forward our knowledge of the relation between the topological order in FQAH states and the Landau-type of symmetry breaking order such as the 1D smectic electronic liquid crystal and 2D charge-density-wave (CDW) solid. Although the transitions from topological states to symmetry breaking states with trivial topology have been discussed, the road from one topological ordered state to another with the same Hall conductance coexisting with Landau order has not been found. Here we show the intriguing evidence that the FQAH to FQAH Smectic (FQAHS) transition is robustly realizable in the archetypal correlated flat Chern-band model at filling {\nu} = 2/3. This transition is novel in that: i) the FQAHS acquires the same fractional Hall conductance as FQAH, which cannot be explained by mean-field band folding. The formation of smectic order can be viewed as perturbation around the transition point, and thus, do not destroy or change the original topology; ii) the charge excitation remains gapped across the transition although the neutral gap is closed at transition point; and iii) the transition is triggered by the softening of roton mode with the same wave vector as the smectic order. Our discovery opens countless new possibilities, both theoretical and experimental, in the fast-growing field of robust fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Quantum spin state stabilized by coupling with classical spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a model compound featuring a spin-1/2 frustrated square lattice partially coupled by spin-5/2. A significant magnetization plateau exceeding 60 T could be observed, indicating a quantum state formed by $S$ = 1/2 spins in the square lattice. The remaining $S$ = 5/2 spins exhibited paramagnetic behavior in the low-field regions. The numerical analysis confirmed that the observed quantum state is a many-body entangled state based on the dominant AF interactions and is strongly stabilized by coupling with spin-5/2. The stabilization of this quantum state can be attributed to a compensation effect similar to magnetic field-induced superconductivity, which serves as a strategy to control the stability of quantum spin states in magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Geometric frustration and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions in a quantum star lattice hybrid copper sulfate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the magnetism of a layered, spin-$\frac12$ organic-inorganic copper sulfate, which is a close realization of the star lattice antiferromagnet, one of the playgrounds of geometric frustration and resonating valence bond physics in two spatial dimensions. Our thermodynamic measurements show no ordering down to 0.1 K and a characteristic field-induced entropic shift, revealing the presence of an infinite number of competing states down to very low energy scales. The response to external magnetic fields shows, in addition, a peculiar anisotropy, reflected in the formation of a 1/3 magnetization plateau (stable up to full saturation around 105 T) and a paramagnetic, Curie-like susceptibility for one direction of the field (${\bf H}\parallel{\bf c}$), and a completely different response in other field directions. Our first-principles density functional theory calculations and exact diagonalizations show that these experimental puzzles are distinctive signatures of a strong interplay between geometric frustration and sizable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, and the emergence of a continuous U(1) symmetry at low energy scales.</description>

      <title>Field-induced Peierls phase in $S=1$ Heisenberg spins coupled to quantum phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-Peierls transition occurs in a one-dimensional $S=1$ Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model with single-ion anisotropy, coupled to finite frequency bond phonons, in a magnetic field. Our results indicate that for the pure Heisenberg model, any Peierls transition is suppressed by quantum fluctuations of the phonon field. However, a novel magnetic field-induced Spin-Peierls phase is realized in the presence of strong single-ion anisotropy. Contrary to the standard Peierls state, the periodicity of bond strength modulation in this field-induced Spin-Peierls state is variable and depends on the strength of the applied field. The nature of the ground state in this new phase and the associated field-driven transitions to and out of this phase are explored using extensive numerical simulations. In particular, we explore the spin and bond correlations and the evolution of bond order modulation with varying magnetic field.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the magnetic properties of a cobalt oxalate metal-organic-framework featuring the hyperoctagon lattice. Our thermodynamic measurements reveal the $J_{\rm{eff}}$ = 1/2 state of the high-spin Co$^{2+}$ (3$\textit{d}^{7}$) ion and the two successive magnetic transitions at zero field with two-stage entropy release. $^{13}$C-NMR measurements reveal the absence of an internal magnetic field in the intermediate temperature phase. Multiple field-induced phases are observed before full saturation at around 40 T. We argue the unique cobalt oxalate network gives rise to the Kitaev interaction and/or a bond frustration effect, providing an unconventional platform for frustrated magnetism on the hyperoctagon lattice.</description>

      <title>Local probe of bulk and edge states in a fractional Chern insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) is a prime example of topological quantum many-body phenomena, arising from the interplay between strong electron correlation, topological order, and time reversal symmetry breaking. Recently, a lattice analog of FQHE at zero magnetic field has been observed, confirming the existence of a zero-field fractional Chern insulator (FCI). Despite this, the bulk-edge correspondence -- a hallmark of FCI featuring an insulating bulk with conductive edges -- has not been directly observed. In fact, this correspondence has not been visualized in any system for fractional states due to experimental challenges. Here we report the imaging of FCI edge states in twisted MoTe2 by employing a newly developed modality of microwave-impedance microscopy. By tuning the carrier density, we observe the system evolving between metallic and FCI states, the latter of which exhibits insulating bulk and conductive edges as expected from bulk-boundary correspondence. We also observe the evolution of edge states across the topological phase transition from an incompressible Chern insulator state to a metal and finally to a putative charge ordered insulating state as a function of interlayer electric field. The local measurement further reveals tantalizing prospects of neighboring domains with different fractional orders. These findings pave the way for research into topologically protected 1D interfaces between various anyonic states at zero magnetic field, such as topological entanglement entropy, Halperin-Laughlin interfaces, and the creation of non-abelian anyons.</description>

      <title>Pressure-tuned many-body phases through $\Gamma$-K valleytronics in moir\'e bilayer WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments in twisted bilayer transition-metal dichalcogenides have revealed a variety of strongly correlated phenomena. To theoretically explore their origin, we combine here ab initio calculations with correlated model approaches to describe and study many-body effects in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ under pressure. We find that the interlayer distance is a key factor for the electronic structure, as it tunes the relative energetic positions between the K and the $\Gamma$ valleys of the valence band maximum of the untwisted bilayer. As a result, applying uniaxial pressure to a twisted bilayer induces a charge-transfer from the K valley to the flat bands in the $\Gamma$ valley. Upon Wannierizing moir\'e bands from both valleys, we establish the relevant tight-binding model parameters and calculate the effective interaction strengths using the constrained random phase approximation. With this, we approximate the interacting pressure-doping phase diagram of WSe$_2$ moir\'e bilayers using self-consistent mean field theory. Our results establish twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ as a platform that allows the direct pressure-tuning of different correlated phases, ranging from Mott insulators, charge-valley-transfer insulators to Kondo lattice-like systems.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping conformal defect operators on a line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a conformal field theory with cubic anisotropic symmetry in presence of a line defect. We compute the correlators of the low lying defect operators using Feynman diagrams and derive explicit expressions for the two, three and four point defect correlators at the cubic fixed point in $4-\epsilon$ dimensions to $O(\epsilon)$. We also compute the defect $g$-function for this setup and demonstrate that this is in agreement with the $g$-theorem, which states that the $g$-function is monotonic under the renormalisation group flow along the defect. Next, we focus on conformal bootstrap techniques to determine the CFT data associated with the defect operators, which is the main objective of the paper. We utilize the framework of crossing symmetric Polyakov bootstrap and compute the averaged CFT data to $O(\epsilon)$ up to a finite number of ambiguities. We unmix the CFT data for the double trace operators at $O(\epsilon)$ and use this to compute the $O(\epsilon^2)$ data. Finally, we study these defect correlators non-perturbatively using numerical methods and isolate them near the free theory limit close to four dimensions.</description>

Abstract: Feynman's diagrammatic series is a common language for a formally exact theoretical description of systems of infinitely-many interacting quantum particles, as well as a foundation for precision computational techniques. Here we introduce a universal framework for efficient summation of connected or skeleton Feynman diagrams for generic quantum many-body systems. It is based on an explicit combinatorial construction of the sum of the integrands by dynamic programming, at a computational cost that can be made only exponential in the diagram order on a classical computer and potentially polynomial on a quantum computer. We illustrate the technique by an unbiased diagrammatic Monte Carlo calculation of the equation of state of the $2D$ $SU(N)$ Hubbard model in an experimentally relevant regime, which has remained challenging for state-of-the-art numerical methods.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17211v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an implementation of the recursion method that addresses quantum many-body dynamics in the nonperturbative regime. The method essentially amounts to constructing a Lanczos basis in the space of operators and solving coupled Heisenberg equations in this basis. The reported implementation has two key ingredients: a computer-algebraic routine for symbolic calculation of nested commutators and a procedure to extrapolate the sequence of Lanczos coefficients according to the universal operator growth hypothesis. We apply the method to calculate infinite-temperature correlation functions for spin-$1/2$ systems on one- and two-dimensional lattices. In two dimensions the accessible timescale is large enough to essentially embrace the relaxation to equilibrium. The method allows one to accurately calculate transport coefficients. As an illustration, we compute the diffusion constant for the transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a refinement of the usual Hartree-Fock method applied the 2D Hubbard model, in Nambu spinor formulation. The new element is the addition of a ''condensate inducing'' term proportional to a variational parameter h to the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian, which generates an s- or d-wave condensate. This modified Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian is used only to generate variational trial states; energy expectation values are computed in the full two-dimensional Hubbard Hamiltonian with no modification. It is found that there exist trial states with non-vanishing condensates that are significantly lower in energy than the standard Hartree-Fock ground states, in some range of the U/t-density plane.</description>

      <title>Ubiquitous light real-space pairing from long-range hopping and interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.06498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically examine how long-range hopping and its synergy with extended interactions leads to light bound pairs. Pair properties are determined for a dilute extended Hubbard model with large on-site repulsion ($U$) and both near- and next-nearest neighbour hopping ($t$ and $t'$) and attraction ($V$ and $V'$), for cubic and tetragonal lattices. The presence of $t'$ and $V'$ promotes light pairs. For tetragonal lattices, $t'&lt;0$ pairs can be lighter than non-interacting particles, and $d$-symmetric pairs form. Close packing transition temperatures, $T^{\ast}$ are estimated for the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of pairs to be $k_{B}T^{\ast}\sim\overline{t} 0.1$, where $\overline{t}$ is the geometric mean of the hoppings on the Cartesian axes. When pairs have $d$-symmetry, the condensate has $d$-wave character. Thus, the presence of both $t'$ and $V'$ leads ubiquitously to small strongly bound pairs with an inverse mass that is linear in hopping, which could lead to high temperature BECs.</description>

      <title>Lower Bounding Ground-State Energies of Local Hamiltonians Through the Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03014v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a renormalization scheme, we show how to formulate a tractable convex relaxation of the set of feasible local density matrices of a many-body quantum system. The relaxation is obtained by introducing a hierarchy of constraints between the reduced states of ever-growing sets of lattice sites. The coarse-graining maps of the underlying renormalization procedure serve to eliminate a vast number of those constraints, such that the remaining ones can be enforced with reasonable computational means. This can be used to obtain rigorous lower bounds on the ground state energy of arbitrary local Hamiltonians, by performing a linear optimization over the resulting convex relaxation of reduced quantum states. The quality of the bounds crucially depends on the particular renormalization scheme, which must be tailored to the target Hamiltonian. We apply our method to 1D translation-invariant spin models, obtaining energy bounds comparable to those attained by optimizing over locally translation-invariant states of $n\gtrsim 100$ spins. Beyond this demonstration, the general method can be applied to a wide range of other problems, such as spin systems in higher spatial dimensions, electronic structure problems, and various other many-body optimization problems, such as entanglement and nonlocality detection.</description>

      <title>Hybrid quantum gap estimation algorithm using a filtered time series</title>

Abstract: Quantum simulation advantage over classical memory limitations would allow compact quantum circuits to yield insight into intractable quantum many-body problems, but the interrelated obstacles of large circuit depth in quantum time evolution and noise seem to rule out unbiased quantum simulation in the near term. We prove that classical post-processing, i.e., long-time filtering of an offline time series, exponentially improves the circuit depth needed for quantum time evolution. We apply the filtering method to the construction of a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm to estimate energy gap, an important observable not governed by the variational theorem. We demonstrate, within an operating range of filtering, the success of the algorithm in proof-of-concept simulation for finite-size scaling of a minimal spin model. Our findings set the stage for unbiased quantum simulation to offer memory advantage in the near term.</description>

      <title>Separability transitions in topological states induced by local decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study states with intrinsic topological order subjected to local decoherence from the perspective of separability, i.e., whether a decohered mixed state can be expressed as an ensemble of short-range entangled (SRE) pure states. We focus on toric codes and the X-cube fracton state and provide evidence for the existence of decoherence-induced separability transitions that precisely coincide with the threshold for the feasibility of active error correction. A key insight is that local decoherence acting on the 'parent' cluster states of these models results in a Gibbs state. As an example, for the 2d (3d) toric code subjected to bit-flip errors, we show that the decohered density matrix can be written as a convex sum of SRE states for $p &gt; p_c$, where $p_c$ is related to the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic transition in the 2d (3d) random-field bond Ising model along the Nishimori line.</description>

      <title>Absence of barren plateaus in finite local-depth circuits with long-range entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01393v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ground state preparation is classically intractable for general Hamiltonians. On quantum devices, shallow parameterized circuits can be effectively trained to obtain short-range entangled states under the paradigm of variational quantum eigensolver, while deep circuits are generally untrainable due to the barren plateau phenomenon. In this Letter, we give a general lower bound on the variance of circuit gradients for arbitrary quantum circuits composed of local 2-designs. Based on our unified framework, we prove the absence of barren plateaus in training finite local-depth circuits (FLDC) for the ground states of local Hamiltonians. FLDCs are allowed to be deep in the conventional circuit depth to generate long-range entangled ground states, such as topologically ordered states, but their local depths are finite, i.e., there is only a finite number of gates acting on individual qubits. This characteristic sets FLDC apart from shallow circuits: FLDC in general cannot be classically simulated to estimate local observables efficiently by existing tensor network methods in two and higher dimensions. We validate our analytical results with extensive numerical simulations and demonstrate the effectiveness of variational training using the generalized toric code model.</description>

      <title>Flows in the Space of Interacting Chiral Boson Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study interacting theories of $N$ left-moving and $\overline{N}$ right-moving Floreanini-Jackiw bosons in two dimensions. A parameterized family of such theories is shown to enjoy (non-manifest) Lorentz invariance if and only if its Lagrangian obeys a flow equation driven by a function of the energy-momentum tensor. We discuss the canonical quantization of such theories along classical stress tensor flows, focusing on the case of the root-$T \overline{T}$ deformation, where we obtain perturbative results for the deformed spectrum in a certain large-momentum limit. In the special case $N = \overline{N}$, we consider the quantum effective action for the root-$T \overline{T}$-deformed theory by expanding around a general classical background, and we find that the one-loop contribution vanishes for backgrounds with constant scalar gradients. Our analysis can also be interpreted via dual $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theories in three dimensions, which might be used to describe deformations of charged $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ black holes or quantum Hall systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum computing topological invariants of two-dimensional quantum matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms provide a potential strategy for solving computational problems that are intractable by classical means. Computing the topological invariants of topological matter is one central problem in research on quantum materials, and a variety of numerical approaches for this purpose have been developed. However, the complexity of quantum many-body Hamiltonians makes calculations of topological invariants challenging for interacting systems. Here, we present two quantum circuits for calculating Chern numbers of two-dimensional quantum matter on quantum computers. Both circuits combine a gate-based adiabatic time-evolution over the discretized Brillouin zone with particular phase estimation techniques. The first algorithm uses many qubits, and we analyze it using a tensor-network simulator of quantum circuits. The second circuit uses fewer qubits, and we implement it experimentally on a quantum computer based on superconducting qubits. Our results establish a method for computing topological invariants with quantum circuits, taking a step towards characterizing interacting topological quantum matter using quantum computers.</description>
