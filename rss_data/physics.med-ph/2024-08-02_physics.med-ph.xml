      <title>CT-based Anomaly Detection of Liver Tumors Using Generative Diffusion Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CT is a main modality for imaging liver diseases, valuable in detecting and localizing liver tumors. Traditional anomaly detection methods analyze reconstructed images to identify pathological structures. However, these methods may produce suboptimal results, overlooking subtle differences among various tissue types. To address this challenge, here we employ generative diffusion prior to inpaint the liver as the reference facilitating anomaly detection. Specifically, we use an adaptive threshold to extract a mask of abnormal regions, which are then inpainted using a diffusion prior to calculating an anomaly score based on the discrepancy between the original CT image and the inpainted counterpart. Our methodology has been tested on two liver CT datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement in detection accuracy, with a 7.9% boost in the area under the curve (AUC) compared to the state-of-the-art. This performance gain underscores the potential of our approach to refine the radiological assessment of liver diseases.</description>

      <title>Prognosis of COVID-19 using Artificial Intelligence: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been extensively utilized for diagnosing and prognosis of several diseases in recent years. This study identifies, appraises and synthesizes published studies on the use of AI for the prognosis of COVID-19. Method: Electronic search was performed using Medline, Google Scholar, Scopus, Embase, Cochrane and ProQuest. Studies that examined machine learning or deep learning methods to determine the prognosis of COVID-19 using CT or chest X-ray images were included. Polled sensitivity, specificity area under the curve and diagnostic odds ratio were calculated. Result: A total of 36 articles were included; various prognosis-related issues, including disease severity, mechanical ventilation or admission to the intensive care unit and mortality, were investigated. Several AI models and architectures were employed, such as the Siamense model, support vector machine, Random Forest , eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and convolutional neural networks. The models achieved 71%, 88% and 67% sensitivity for mortality, severity assessment and need for ventilation, respectively. The specificity of 69%, 89% and 89% were reported for the aforementioned variables. Conclusion: Based on the included articles, machine learning and deep learning methods used for the prognosis of COVID-19 patients using radiomic features from CT or CXR images can help clinicians manage patients and allocate resources more effectively. These studies also demonstrate that combining patient demographic, clinical data, laboratory tests and radiomic features improves model performances.</description>

      <title>Centimeter-sized Objects at Micrometer Resolution: Extending Field-of-View in Wavefront Marker X-ray Phase-Contrast Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in propagation-based phase-contrast imaging, such as hierarchical imaging, have enabled the visualization of internal structures in large biological specimens and material samples. However, wavefront marker-based techniques, which provide quantitative electron density information, face challenges when imaging larger objects due to stringent beam stability requirements and potential structural changes in objects during longer measurements. Extending the fields-of-view of these methods is crucial for obtaining comparable quantitative results across beamlines and adapting to the smaller beam profiles of fourth-generation synchrotron sources. We introduce a novel technique combining an adapted eigenflat optimization with deformable image registration to address the challenges and enable quantitative high-resolution scans of centimeter-sized objects with micrometre resolution. We demonstrate the potential of the method by obtaining an electron density map of a rat brain sample 15 mm in diameter using speckle-based imaging, despite the limited horizontal field-of-view of 6 mm of the beamline (PETRA III, P05, operated by Hereon at DESY). This showcases the ability of the technique to significantly widen the range of application of wavefront marker-based techniques in both biological and materials science research.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Novel Preclinical Total Body PET Designed With J-PET Technology:A Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing interest in human-grade total body positron emission tomography (PET) systems has also application in small animal research. Due to the existing limitations in human-based studies involving drug development and novel treatment monitoring, animal-based research became a necessary step for testing and protocol preparation. In this simulation-based study two unconventional, cost-effective small animal total body PET scanners (for mouse and rat studies) have been investigated in order to inspect their feasibility for preclinical research. They were designed with the novel technology explored by the Jagiellonian-PET (J-PET) Collaboration. Two main PET characteristics: sensitivity and spatial resolution were mainly inspected to evaluate their performance. Moreover, the impact of the scintillator dimension and time-of-flight on the latter parameter was examined in order to design the most efficient tomographs. The presented results show that for mouse TB J-PET the achievable system sensitivity is equal to 2.35% and volumetric spatial resolution to 9.46 +- 0.54 mm3, while for rat TB J-PET they are equal to 2.6% and 14.11 +- 0.80 mm3, respectively. Furthermore, it was shown that the designed tomographs are almost parallax-free systems, hence, they resolve the problem of the acceptance criterion tradeoff between enhancing spatial resolution and reducing sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Point-supervised Brain Tumor Segmentation with Box-prompted MedSAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Delineating lesions and anatomical structure is important for image-guided interventions. Point-supervised medical image segmentation (PSS) has great potential to alleviate costly expert delineation labeling. However, due to the lack of precise size and boundary guidance, the effectiveness of PSS often falls short of expectations. Although recent vision foundational models, such as the medical segment anything model (MedSAM), have made significant advancements in bounding-box-prompted segmentation, it is not straightforward to utilize point annotation, and is prone to semantic ambiguity. In this preliminary study, we introduce an iterative framework to facilitate semantic-aware point-supervised MedSAM. Specifically, the semantic box-prompt generator (SBPG) module has the capacity to convert the point input into potential pseudo bounding box suggestions, which are explicitly refined by the prototype-based semantic similarity. This is then succeeded by a prompt-guided spatial refinement (PGSR) module that harnesses the exceptional generalizability of MedSAM to infer the segmentation mask, which also updates the box proposal seed in SBPG. Performance can be progressively improved with adequate iterations. We conducted an evaluation on BraTS2018 for the segmentation of whole brain tumors and demonstrated its superior performance compared to traditional PSS methods and on par with box-supervised methods.</description>

      <title>EXACT-Net:EHR-guided lung tumor auto-segmentation for non-small cell lung cancer radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14099v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lung cancer is a devastating disease with the highest mortality rate among cancer types. Over 60% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, which accounts for 87% of diagnoses, require radiation therapy. Rapid treatment initiation significantly increases the patient's survival rate and reduces the mortality rate. Accurate tumor segmentation is a critical step in the diagnosis and treatment of NSCLC. Manual segmentation is time and labor-consuming and causes delays in treatment initiation. Although many lung nodule detection methods, including deep learning-based models, have been proposed, there is still a long-standing problem of high false positives (FPs) with most of these methods. Here, we developed an electronic health record (EHR) guided lung tumor auto-segmentation called EXACT-Net (EHR-enhanced eXACtitude in Tumor segmentation), where the extracted information from EHRs using a pre-trained large language model (LLM), was used to remove the FPs and keep the TP nodules only. The auto-segmentation model was trained on NSCLC patients' computed tomography (CT), and the pre-trained LLM was used with the zero-shot learning approach. Our approach resulted in a 250% boost in successful nodule detection using the data from ten NSCLC patients treated in our institution.</description>

      <title>Material Properties of Popular Radiation Detection Scintillator Crystals for Optical Physics Transport Modelling in Geant4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiation detection is vital for space, medical imaging, homeland security, and environmental monitoring applications. In the past, the Monte Carlo radiation transport toolkit, Geant4, has been employed to enable the effective development of emerging technologies in these fields. Radiation detectors utilising scintillator crystals have benefited from Geant4; however, Geant4 optical physics parameters for scintillator crystal modelling are sparse. This work outlines scintillator properties for GAGG:Ce, CLLBC:Ce, BGO, NaI:Tl, and CsI:Tl. These properties were implemented in a detailed SiPM-based single-volume scintillation detector simulation platform developed in this work. It was validated by its comparison to experimental measurements. For all five scintillation materials, the platform successfully predicted the spectral features for selected gamma ray emitting isotopes with energies between 30 keV to 2 MeV. The full width half maximum (FWHM) and normalised cross-correlation coefficient (NCCC) between simulated and experimental energy spectra were also compared. The majority of simulated FWHM values reproduced the experimental results within a 2% difference, and the majority of NCCC values demonstrated agreement between the simulated and experimental energy spectra. Discrepancies in these figures of merit were attributed to detector signal processing electronics modelling and geometry approximations within the detector and surrounding experimental environment.</description>
