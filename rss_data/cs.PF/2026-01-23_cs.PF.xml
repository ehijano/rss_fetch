      <title>Sawtooth Wavefront Reordering: Enhanced CuTile FlashAttention on NVIDIA GB10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-performance attention kernels are essential for Large Language Models. This paper presents analysis of CuTile-based Flash Attention memory behavior and a technique to improve its cache performance. In particular, our analysis on the NVIDIA GB10 (Grace Blackwell) identifies the main cause of L2 cache miss. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a new programming technique called Sawtooth Wavefront Reordering that reduces L2 misses. We validate it in both CUDA and CuTile, observing 50\% or greater reduction in L2 misses and up to 60\% increase in throughput on GB10.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of LoRa for IoT Applications in Non-Terrestrial Networks via ns-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) and Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) has emerged as a key paradigm to provide connectivity for sensors and actuators via satellite gateways in remote areas where terrestrial infrastructure is limited or unavailable. Among other Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies for IoT, Long Range (LoRa) holds great potential given its long range, energy efficiency, and flexibility. In this paper, we explore the feasibility and performance of LoRa to support large-scale IoT connectivity through Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite gateways. To do so, we developed a new ns3-LoRa-NTN simulation module, which integrates and extends the ns3-LoRa and ns3-NTN modules, to enable full-stack end-to-end simulation of satellite communication in LoRa networks. Our results, given in terms of average data rate and Packet Reception Ratio (PRR), confirm that LoRa can effectively support direct communication from the ground to LEO satellites, but network optimization is required to mitigate collision probability when end nodes use the same Spreading Factors (SFs) over long distances.</description>

      <title>Embedding Retrofitting: Data Engineering for better RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embedding retrofitting adjusts pre-trained word vectors using knowledge graph constraints to improve domain-specific retrieval. However, the effectiveness of retrofitting depends critically on knowledge graph quality, which in turn depends on text preprocessing. This paper presents a data engineering framework that addresses data quality degradation from annotation artifacts in real-world corpora.
  The analysis shows that hashtag annotations inflate knowledge graph density, leading to creating spurious edges that corrupt the retrofitting objective. On noisy graphs, all retrofitting techniques produce statistically significant degradation ($-3.5\%$ to $-5.2\%$, $p&lt;0.05$). After preprocessing, \acrshort{ewma} retrofitting achieves $+6.2\%$ improvement ($p=0.0348$) with benefits concentrated in quantitative synthesis questions ($+33.8\%$ average). The gap between clean and noisy preprocessing (10\%+ swing) exceeds the gap between algorithms (3\%), establishing preprocessing quality as the primary determinant of retrofitting success.</description>

      <title>Reliability by design: quantifying and eliminating fabrication risk in LLMs. From generative to consultative AI: a comparative analysis in the legal domain and lessons for high-stakes knowledge bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines how to make large language models reliable for high-stakes legal work by reducing hallucinations. It distinguishes three AI paradigms: (1) standalone generative models ("creative oracle"), (2) basic retrieval-augmented systems ("expert archivist"), and (3) an advanced, end-to-end optimized RAG system ("rigorous archivist"). The authors introduce two reliability metrics -False Citation Rate (FCR) and Fabricated Fact Rate (FFR)- and evaluate 2,700 judicial-style answers from 12 LLMs across 75 legal tasks using expert, double-blind review. Results show that standalone models are unsuitable for professional use (FCR above 30%), while basic RAG greatly reduces errors but still leaves notable misgrounding. Advanced RAG, using techniques such as embedding fine-tuning, re-ranking, and self-correction, reduces fabrication to negligible levels (below 0.2%). The study concludes that trustworthy legal AI requires rigor-focused, retrieval-based architectures emphasizing verification and traceability, and provides an evaluation framework applicable to other high-risk domains.</description>

      <title>Class Confidence Aware Reweighting for Long Tailed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep neural network models degrade significantly in the long-tailed data distribution, with the overall training data dominated by a small set of classes in the head, and the tail classes obtaining less training examples. Addressing the imbalance in the classes, attention in the related literature was given mainly to the adjustments carried out in the decision space in terms of either corrections performed at the logit level in order to compensate class-prior bias, with the least attention to the optimization process resulting from the adjustments introduced through the differences in the confidences among the samples. In the current study, we present the design of a class and confidence-aware re-weighting scheme for long-tailed learning. This scheme is purely based upon the loss level and has a complementary nature to the existing methods performing the adjustment of the logits. In the practical implementation stage of the proposed scheme, we use an {\Omega}(p_t, f_c) function. This function enables the modulation of the contribution towards the training task based upon the confidence value of the prediction, as well as the relative frequency of the corresponding class. Our observations in the experiments are corroborated by significant experimental results performed on the CIFAR-100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist2018 datasets under various values of imbalance factors that clearly authenticate the theoretical discussions above.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Compiler Optimization Impacts on zkVM Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are the cornerstone of programmable cryptography. They enable (1) privacy-preserving and verifiable computation across blockchains, and (2) an expanding range of off-chain applications such as credential schemes. Zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs) lower the barrier by turning ZKPs into a drop-in backend for standard compilation pipelines. This lets developers write proof-generating programs in conventional languages (e.g., Rust or C++) instead of hand-crafting arithmetic circuits. However, these VMs inherit compiler infrastructures tuned for traditional architectures rather than for proof systems. In particular, standard compiler optimizations assume features that are absent in zkVMs, including cache locality, branch prediction, or instruction-level parallelism. Therefore, their impact on proof generation is questionable.
  We present the first systematic study of the impact of compiler optimizations on zkVMs. We evaluate 64 LLVM passes, six standard optimization levels, and an unoptimized baseline across 58 benchmarks on two RISC-V-based zkVMs (RISC Zero and SP1). While standard LLVM optimization levels do improve zkVM performance (over 40\%), their impact is far smaller than on traditional CPUs, since their decisions rely on hardware features rather than proof constraints. Guided by a fine-grained pass-level analysis, we~\emph{slightly} refine a small set of LLVM passes to be zkVM-aware, improving zkVM execution time by up to 45\% (average +4.6\% on RISC Zero, +1\% on SP1) and achieving consistent proving-time gains. Our work highlights the potential of compiler-level optimizations for zkVM performance and opens new direction for zkVM-specific passes, backends, and superoptimizers.</description>
