      <title>Scale-invariant dynamics in a purely deterministic Game of Life model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07189v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scale invariance is a key feature that characterizes criticality in complex dynamical systems, which often organize into structures exhibiting no typical size and/or lifespan. While random external inputs or tunable stochastic interactions are typically required for showcasing such criticality, the question of whether scale-invariant dynamics can emerge from purely deterministic interactions remains unclear. In this work, we discover highly affirmative signatures of critical dynamics in equal-state clusters that emerge in the \textit{logistic} Game of life (GOL): an extension of Conway's GOL into a Cantor set state space that is nevertheless deterministic. We uncover at least three types of asymptotic behavior, i.e. phases, that are separated by two fundamentally distinct critical points. The first critical point -- associated with a peculiar form of self-organized criticality -- defines the non-analytic boundary between a sparse-static and a sparse-dynamic asymptotic phase. Meanwhile, the second point marks an enigmatic deterministic percolation transition between the sparse-dynamic and a third, dense-dynamic phase. Moreover, we identify distinct power-law distributions of cluster sizes with unconventional critical exponents that challenge the current paradigms for critical behavior. Overall, our work concretely paves the way for studying emergent scale invariance in purely deterministic systems.</description>

      <title>Followstopper Revisited: Phase-space Lagrangian Controller for Traffic Decongestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper revisits Followerstopper, a phase-space-based control system that had demonstrated its ability to mitigate emergent traffic jams due to stop-and-go traffic during rush hour in the mixed-autonomy setting. Followerstopper was deployed on an autonomous vehicle. The controller attenuates the emanant traffic waves by regulating its velocity according to the relative distance and velocity of the leader car. While regulating the velocity, the controller also prevents the collision of the ego vehicle with the lead vehicle within the range specified by the controller's design parameter. The controller design is based on a configurable quadratic curve on relative distance-relative velocity phase-space that allows the transition of the regulated velocity from (i) no modification of input, (ii) decelerating to match the leader's velocity (iii) braking to avoid any imminent collision. In this paper, we explore the phase-space properties of Followerstopper and provide a detailed description of a nonlinear control law that regulates the reference input to Followerstopper within the physics-informed boundaries. We also provide a new discussion on the nominal control law that regulates the reference speed to Followerstopper to avoid unrealistic and unsafe acceleration.</description>

      <title>Trotter transition in BCS pairing dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We Trotterize the mean-field dynamics of the integrable BCS model using symplectic integrators. The resulting chaotic dynamics is characterized by its Lyapunov spectrum and rescaled Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. The chaos quantifiers depend on the Trotterization time step $\tau$. We observe a Trotter transition at a finite step value $\tau_c \approx \sqrt{N}$. While the dynamics is weakly chaotic for time steps $\tau \ll \tau_c$, the regime of large Trotterization steps is characterized by short temporal correlations. We derive two different scaling laws for the two different regimes by numerically fitting the maximum Lyapunov exponent data. The scaling law of the large $\tau$ limit agrees well with the one derived from the kicked top map. Beyond its relevance to current quantum computers, our work opens new directions -- such as probing observables like the Loschmidt echo, which lie beyond standard mean-field description -- across the Trotter transition we uncover.</description>

      <title>Network Dynamics-Based Framework for Understanding Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in artificial intelligence call for a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying deep learning. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to analyze learning dynamics through the lens of dynamical systems theory. We redefine the notions of linearity and nonlinearity in neural networks by introducing two fundamental transformation units at the neuron level: order-preserving transformations and non-order-preserving transformations. Different transformation modes lead to distinct collective behaviors in weight vector organization, different modes of information extraction, and the emergence of qualitatively different learning phases. Transitions between these phases may occur during training, accounting for key phenomena such as grokking. To further characterize generalization and structural stability, we introduce the concept of attraction basins in both sample and weight spaces. The distribution of neurons with different transformation modes across layers, along with the structural characteristics of the two types of attraction basins, forms a set of core metrics for analyzing the performance of learning models. Hyperparameters such as depth, width, learning rate, and batch size act as control variables for fine-tuning these metrics. Our framework not only sheds light on the intrinsic advantages of deep learning, but also provides a novel perspective for optimizing network architectures and training strategies.</description>

      <title>Mamba time series forecasting with uncertainty quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: State space models, such as Mamba, have recently garnered attention in time series forecasting due to their ability to capture sequence patterns. However, in electricity consumption benchmarks, Mamba forecasts exhibit a mean error of approximately 8\%. Similarly, in traffic occupancy benchmarks, the mean error reaches 18\%. This discrepancy leaves us to wonder whether the prediction is simply inaccurate or falls within error given spread in historical data. To address this limitation, we propose a method to quantify the predictive uncertainty of Mamba forecasts. Here, we propose a dual-network framework based on the Mamba architecture for probabilistic forecasting, where one network generates point forecasts while the other estimates predictive uncertainty by modeling variance. We abbreviate our tool, Mamba with probabilistic time series forecasting, as Mamba-ProbTSF and the code for its implementation is available on GitHub (https://github.com/PessoaP/Mamba-ProbTSF). Evaluating this approach on synthetic and real-world benchmark datasets, we find Kullback-Leibler divergence between the learned distributions and the data--which, in the limit of infinite data, should converge to zero if the model correctly captures the underlying probability distribution--reduced to the order of $10^{-3}$ for synthetic data and $10^{-1}$ for real-world benchmark, demonstrating its effectiveness. We find that in both the electricity consumption and traffic occupancy benchmark, the true trajectory stays within the predicted uncertainty interval at the two-sigma level about 95\% of the time. We end with a consideration of potential limitations, adjustments to improve performance, and considerations for applying this framework to processes for purely or largely stochastic dynamics where the stochastic changes accumulate, as observed for example in pure Brownian motion or molecular dynamics trajectories.</description>

      <title>Dynamical thermalization, Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, vortexes and wave collapse in quantum chaos fibers and fluid of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the time evolution of a nonlinear field described by the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in a chaotic $D$-shape billiard. In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of quantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a multimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of atomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos leads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution and the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground state accumulating in it about 80-90\% of total probability. Certain similarities of this phenomenon with the Fr\"ohlich condensate are discussed. Below the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. The evolution to the thermal state is characterized by an unusual entropy time dependence with an increase on short times and later significant decrease when approaching to the steady-state. This behavior is opposite to the Boltzmann H-theorem and is attributed to the formation of Rayleigh-Jeans condensate and presence of two integrals of motion, energy and norm. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave collapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very different from the open space case. Finally for the defocusing case we establish the superfluid regime for vortex dynamics at strong nonlinearity.
  System parameters for optical fiber experimental studies of these effects are also discussed.</description>
