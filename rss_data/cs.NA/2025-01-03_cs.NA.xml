      <title>Error estimation for quasi-Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasi-Monte Carlo sampling can attain far better accuracy than plain Monte Carlo sampling. However, with plain Monte Carlo sampling it is much easier to estimate the attained accuracy. This article describes methods old and new to quantify the error in quasi-Monte Carlo estimates. An important challenge in this setting is that the goal of getting accuracy conflicts with that of estimating the attained accuracy. A related challenge is that rigorous uncertainty quantifications can be extremely conservative. A recent surprise is that some RQMC estimates have nearly symmetric distributions and that has the potential to allow confidence intervals that do not require either a central limit theorem or a consistent variance estimate.</description>

      <title>Localized Estimation of Condition Numbers for MILU Preconditioners on a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a theoretical framework for analyzing Modified Incomplete LU (MILU) preconditioners. Considering a generalized MILU preconditioner on a weighted undirected graph with self-loops, we extend its applicability beyond matrices derived by Poisson equation solvers on uniform grids with compact stencils. A major contribution is, a novel measure, the \textit{Localized Estimator of Condition Number (LECN)}, which quantifies the condition number locally at each vertex of the graph. We prove that the maximum value of the LECN provides an upper bound for the condition number of the MILU preconditioned system, offering estimation of the condition number using only local measurements. This localized approach significantly simplifies the condition number estimation and provides a powerful tool or analyzing the MILU preconditioner applied to previously unexplored matrix structures. To demonstrate the usability of LECN analysis, we present three cases: (1) revisit to existing results of MILU preconditioners on uniform grids, (2) analysis of high-order implicit finite difference schemes on wide stencils, and (3) analysis of variable coefficient Poisson equations on hierarchical adaptive grids such as quadtree and octree. For the third case, we also validate LECN analysis numerically on a quadtree.</description>

      <title>A structure-preserving collisional particle method for the Landau kinetic equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and implement a structure-preserving stochastic particle method for the Landau equation. The method is based on a particle system for the Landau equation, where pairwise grazing collisions are modeled as diffusion processes. By exploiting the unique structure of the particle system and a spherical Brownian motion sampling, the method avoids additional temporal discretization of the particle system, ensuring that the discrete-time particle distributions exactly match their continuous-time counterparts. The method achieves $O(N)$ complexity per time step and preserves fundamental physical properties, including the conservation of mass, momentum and energy, as well as entropy dissipation. It demonstrates strong long-time accuracy and stability in numerical experiments. Furthermore, we also apply the method to the spatially non-homogeneous equations through a case study of the Vlasov--Poisson--Landau equation.</description>

      <title>Solving Partial Differential Equations with Random Feature Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning based partial differential equations (PDEs) solvers have received great attention in recent years. Most progress in this area has been driven by deep neural networks such as physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and kernel method. In this paper, we introduce a random feature based framework toward efficiently solving PDEs. Random feature method was originally proposed to approximate large-scale kernel machines and can be viewed as a shallow neural network as well. We provide an error analysis for our proposed method along with comprehensive numerical results on several PDE benchmarks. In contrast to the state-of-the-art solvers that face challenges with a large number of collocation points, our proposed method reduces the computational complexity. Moreover, the implementation of our method is simple and does not require additional computational resources. Due to the theoretical guarantee and advantages in computation, our approach is proven to be efficient for solving PDEs.</description>

      <title>The discrete inverse conductivity problem solved by the weights of an interpretable neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel neural network (NN) approach to solve the discrete inverse conductivity problem of recovering the conductivity profile on network edges from the discrete Dirichlet-to-Neumann map on a square lattice. The novelty of the approach lies in the fact that the sought-after conductivity is not provided directly as the output of the NN but is instead encoded in the weights of the post-trainig NN in the second layer. Hence the weights of the trained NN acquire a clear physical meaning, which contrasts with most existing neural network approaches, where the weights are typically not interpretable. This work represents a step toward designing NNs with interpretable post-training weights. Numerically, we observe that the method outperforms the conventional Curtis-Morrow algorithm for both noisy full and partial data.</description>

      <title>Solving McKean-Vlasov Equation by deep learning particle method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel meshless simulation method for the McKean-Vlasov Stochastic Differential Equation (MV-SDE) utilizing deep learning, applicable to both self-interaction and interaction scenarios. Traditionally, numerical methods for this equation rely on the interacting particle method combined with techniques based on the It\^o-Taylor expansion. The convergence rate of this approach is determined by two parameters: the number of particles $N$ and the time step size $h$ for each Euler iteration. However, for extended time horizons or equations with larger Lipschitz coefficients, this method is often limited, as it requires a significant increase in Euler iterations to achieve the desired precision $\epsilon$. To overcome the challenges posed by the difficulty of parallelizing the simulation of continuous interacting particle systems, which involve solving high-dimensional coupled SDEs, we propose a meshless MV-SDE solver grounded in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) that does not rely on the propagation of chaos result. Our method constructs a pseudo MV-SDE using It\^o calculus, then quantifies the discrepancy between this equation and the original MV-SDE, with the error minimized through a loss function. This loss is controlled via an optimization algorithm, independent of the time step size, and we provide an error estimate for the loss function. The advantages of our approach are demonstrated through corresponding simulations.</description>

      <title>Solid-state dewetting of axisymmetric thin film on axisymmetric curved-surface substrates: modeling and simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work,we consider the solid-state dewetting of an axisymmetric thin film on a curved-surface substrate,with the assumption that the substrate morphology is also axisymmetric.Under the assumptions of axisymmetry,the surface evolution problem on a curved-surface substrate can be reduced to a curve evolution problem on a static curved substrate.Based on the thermodynamic variation of the anisotropic surface energy,we thoroughly derive a sharp-interface model that is governed by anisotropic surface diffusion,along with appropriate boundary conditions.The continuum system satisfies the laws of energy decay and volume conservation,which motivates the design of a structure-preserving numerical algorithm for simulating the mathematical model.By introducing a symmetrized surface energy matrix, we derive a novel symmetrized variational formulation. Then, by carefully discretizing the boundary terms of the variational formulation, we establish an unconditionally energy-stable parametric finite element approximation of the axisymmetric system. By applying an ingenious correction method, we further develop another structure-preserving method that can preserve both the energy stability and volume conservation properties. Finally, we present extensive numerical examples to demonstrate the convergence and structure-preserving properties of our proposed numerical scheme. Additionally, several interesting phenomena are explored, including the migration of 'small' particles on a curved-surface substrate generated by curves with positive or negative curvature, pinch-off events, and edge retraction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a fully-discrete finite element approximation of the unsteady $p(\cdot,\cdot)$-Stokes equations ($i.e.$, $p(\cdot,\cdot)$ is time- and space-dependent), employing a backward Euler step in time and conforming, discretely inf-sup stable finite elements in space. More precisely, we derive error decay rates for the vector-valued velocity field imposing fractional regularity assumptions on the velocity and the kinematic pressure. In addition, we carry out numerical experiments that confirm the optimality of the derived error decay rates in the case $p(\cdot,\cdot)\ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Integral equations for flexural-gravity waves: analysis and numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a fast and accurate method for the scattering of flexural-gravity waves by a thin plate of varying thickness overlying a fluid of infinite depth. This problem commonly arises in the study of sea ice and ice shelves, which can have complicated heterogeneities that include ridges and rolls. With certain natural assumptions on the thickness, we present an integral equation formulation for solving this class of problems and analyze its mathematical properties. The integral equation is then discretized and solved using a high-order-accurate, FFT-accelerated algorithm. The speed, accuracy, and scalability of this approach are demonstrated through a variety of illustrative examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytic function can be continued across an analytic arc $\Gamma$ with the help of the Schwarz function $S(z)$, the analytic function satisfying $S(z) = \bar z$ for $z\in \Gamma$. We show how $S(z)$ can be computed with the AAA algorithm of rational approximation, an operation that is the basis of the AAALS method for solution of Laplace and related PDE problems in the plane. We discuss the challenge of computing $S(z)$ further away from from $\Gamma$, where it becomes multi-valued.</description>

      <title>Overlapping Schwarz methods are not anisotropy-robust multigrid smoothers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze overlapping multiplicative Schwarz methods as smoothers in the geometric multigrid solution of two-dimensional anisotropic diffusion problems. For diffusion equations, it is well known that the smoothing properties of point-wise smoothers, such as Gauss--Seidel, rapidly deteriorate as the strength of anisotropy increases. On the other hand, global smoothers based on line smoothing are known to generally provide good smoothing for diffusion problems, independent of the anisotropy strength. A natural question is whether global methods are really necessary to achieve good smoothing in such problems, or whether it can be obtained with locally overlapping block smoothers using sufficiently large blocks and overlap. Through local Fourier analysis and careful numerical experimentation, we show that global methods are indeed necessary to achieve anisotropy-robust smoothing. Specifically, for any fixed block size bounded sufficiently far away from the global domain size, we find that the smoothing properties of overlapping multiplicative Schwarz rapidly deteriorate with increasing anisotropy, irrespective of the amount of overlap between blocks. Moreover, our results indicate that anisotropy-robust smoothing requires blocks of diameter ${\cal O}(\epsilon^{-1/2})$ for anisotropy ratio $\epsilon \in (0,1]$.</description>

      <title>Weighted approximate sampling recovery and integration based on B-spline interpolation and quasi-interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose novel methods for approximate sampling recovery and integration of functions in the Freud-weighted Sobolev space $W^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R})$ with the approximation error measured in the norm of the Freud-weighted Lebesgue space $L_{q,w}(\mathbb{R})$. Namely, we construct equidistant compact-supported B-spline quasi-interpolation and interpolation sampling algorithms $Q_{\rho,m}$ and $P_{\rho,m}$ which are asymptotically optimal in terms of the sampling $n$-widths $\varrho_n(\boldsymbol{W}^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R}), L_{q,w}(\mathbb{R}))$ for every pair $p,q \in [1,\infty]$, and prove the right convergence rate of these sampling $n$-widths, where $\boldsymbol{W}^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R})$ denotes the unit ball in $W^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R})$. The algorithms $Q_{\rho,m}$ and $P_{\rho,m}$ are based on truncated scaled B-spline quasi-interpolation and interpolation, respectively. We also prove the asymptotical optimality and right convergence rate of the equidistant quadratures generated from $Q_{\rho,m}$ and $P_{\rho,m}$, for Freud-weighted numerical integration of functions in $W^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R})$.</description>

      <title>On the deterioration of convergence rate of spectral differentiations for functions with singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral differentiations are basic ingredients of spectral methods. In this work, we analyze the pointwise rate of convergence of spectral differentiations for functions containing singularities and show that the deteriorations of the convergence rate at the endpoints, singularities and other points in the smooth region exhibit different patterns. As the order of differentiation increases by one, we show for functions with an algebraic singularity that the convergence rate of spectral differentiation by Jacobi projection deteriorates two orders at both endpoints and only one order at each point in the smooth region. The situation at the singularity is more complicated and the convergence rate either deteriorates two orders or does not deteriorate, depending on the parity of the order of differentiation, when the singularity locates in the interior of the interval and deteriorates two orders when the singularity locates at the endpoint. Extensions to some related problems, such as the spectral differentiation using Chebyshev interpolation, are also discussed. Our findings justify the error localization property of Jacobi approximation and differentiation and provide some new insight into the convergence behavior of Jacobi spectral methods.</description>

      <title>Model Reduction for Transport-Dominated Problems via Cross-Correlation Based Snapshot Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional linear approximation methods, such as proper orthogonal decomposition and the reduced basis method, are ineffective for transport-dominated problems due to the slow decay of the Kolmogorov $n$-width. This results in reduced-order models that are both inefficient and inaccurate. In this work, we present an approach for the model reduction of transport-dominated problems by employing cross-correlation based snapshot registration, accelerating the Kolmogorov $n$-width decay, and enabling the construction of efficient reduced-order models using linear methods. We propose a complete framework comprising offline-online stages for the development of reduced-order models using the cross-correlation based snapshots registration. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated using two test cases: 1D travelling waves and the higher-order methods benchmark test case, 2D isentropic convective vortex.</description>

      <title>Effects of Turbulence Modeling and Parcel Approach on Dispersed Two-Phase Swirling Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several numerical simulations of a co-axial particle-laden swirling air flow in a vertical circular pipe were performed. The air flow was modeled using the unsteady Favre-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. A Lagrangian model was used for the particle motion. The gas and particles are coupled through two-way momentum exchange. The results of the simulations using three versions of the k-epsilon turbulence model (standard, re-normalization group (RNG), and realizable) are compared with experimental mean velocity profiles. The standard model achieved the best overall performance. The realizable model was unable to satisfactorily predict the radial velocity; it is also the most computationally-expensive model. The simulations using the RNG model predicted additional recirculation zones. We also compared the particle and parcel approaches in solving the particle motion. In the latter, multiple similar particles are grouped in a single parcel, thereby reducing the amount of computation.</description>

      <title>Octree-Based Shifted Boundary Method for Multiphysics Simulations Using Linearized Navier-Stokes in Complex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the application of the Shifted Boundary Method (SBM) to thermal flow simulations, utilizing incomplete octree meshes (Octree-SBM) to perform multiphysics simulations that couple flow and heat transfer. By employing a linearized form of the Navier-Stokes equations, we accelerate the simulations while maintaining accuracy. SBM enables precise enforcement of field and derivative boundary conditions on intercepted elements, allowing for accurate flux calculations near complex geometries, when using non-boundary fitted meshes. Both Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are implemented within the SBM framework, with results demonstrating that SBM ensures precise enforcement of Neumann boundary conditions on octree-based meshes. We illustrate this approach by simulating flows across different regimes, benchmarking results over several orders of magnitude variation in Rayleigh numbers ($Ra \sim 10^3$ to $10^9$) and Reynolds numbers ($Re \sim 10^0$ to $10^4$), covering laminar, transitional, and turbulent regimes. Coupled thermal-flow phenomena as well as summary statistics across all these regimes are accurately captured without any additional numerical treatments, beyond a Residual-based Variational Multiscale formulation (RB-VMS). This approach offers a reliable and efficient solution for complex geometries, boundary conditions and flow regimes in computational multiphysics simulations.</description>

      <title>Momentum-based minimization of the Ginzburg-Landau functional on Euclidean spaces and graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the momentum-based minimization of a diffuse perimeter functional on Euclidean spaces and on graphs with applications to semi-supervised classification tasks in machine learning. While the gradient flow in the task at hand is a parabolic partial differential equation, the momentum-method corresponds to a damped hyperbolic PDE, leading to qualitatively and quantitatively different trajectories. Using a convex-concave splitting-based FISTA-type time discretization, we demonstrate empirically that momentum can lead to faster convergence if the time step size is large but not too large. With large time steps, the PDE analysis offers only limited insight into the geometric behavior of solutions and typical hyperbolic phenomena like loss of regularity are not be observed in sample simulations.</description>

      <title>An OpenFOAM face-centred solver for incompressible flows robust to mesh distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents an overview of mesh-induced errors commonly experienced by cell-centred finite volumes (CCFV), for which the face-centred finite volume (FCFV) paradigm offers competitive solutions. In particular, a robust FCFV solver for incompressible laminar flows is integrated in OpenFOAM and tested on a set of steady-state and transient benchmarks. The method outperforms standard simpleFoam and pimpleFoam algorithms in terms of optimal convergence, accuracy, stability, and robustness. Special attention is devoted to motivate and numerically demonstrate the ability of the FCFV method to treat non-orthogonal, stretched, and skewed meshes, where CCFV schemes exhibit shortcomings.</description>

      <title>Deeply Learned Robust Matrix Completion for Large-scale Low-rank Data Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust matrix completion (RMC) is a widely used machine learning tool that simultaneously tackles two critical issues in low-rank data analysis: missing data entries and extreme outliers. This paper proposes a novel scalable and learnable non-convex approach, coined Learned Robust Matrix Completion (LRMC), for large-scale RMC problems. LRMC enjoys low computational complexity with linear convergence. Motivated by the proposed theorem, the free parameters of LRMC can be effectively learned via deep unfolding to achieve optimum performance. Furthermore, this paper proposes a flexible feedforward-recurrent-mixed neural network framework that extends deep unfolding from fix-number iterations to infinite iterations. The superior empirical performance of LRMC is verified with extensive experiments against state-of-the-art on synthetic datasets and real applications, including video background subtraction, ultrasound imaging, face modeling, and cloud removal from satellite imagery.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary iterative schemes for the discrete operators on de Rham complex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.02065v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main difficulty in solving the discrete source or eigenvalue problems of the operator $ d^*d $ with iterative methods is to deal with its huge kernel, for example, the $ \nabla \times \nabla \times $ and $- \nabla ( \nabla \cdot ) $ operator. In this paper, we construct a kind of auxiliary schemes for their discrete systems based on Hodge Laplacian on de Rham complex. The spectra of the new schemes are Laplace-like. Then many efficient iterative methods and preconditioning techniques can be applied to them. After getting the solutions of the auxiliary schemes, the desired solutions of the original systems can be recovered or recognized through some simple operations. We sum these up as a new framework to compute the discrete source and eigenvalue problems of the operator $ d^*d $ using iterative method. We also investigate two preconditioners for the auxiliary schemes, ILU-type method and Multigrid method. Finally, we present plenty of numerical experiments to verify the efficiency of the auxiliary schemes.</description>

      <title>Construction of Hierarchically Semi-Separable matrix Representation using Adaptive Johnson-Lindenstrauss Sketching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an extension of an adaptive, partially matrix-free, Hierarchically Semi-Separable (HSS) matrix construction algorithm by Gorman et al. [SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 41(5), 2019] which uses Gaussian sketching operators to a broader class of Johnson--Lindenstrauss (JL) sketching operators. We develop theoretical work which justifies this extension. In particular, we extend the earlier concentration bounds to all JL sketching operators and examine this bound for specific classes of such operators including the original Gaussian sketching operators, subsampled randomized Hadamard transform (SRHT) and the sparse Johnson--Lindenstrauss transform (SJLT). We discuss the implementation details of applying SJLT and SRHT efficiently. Then we demonstrate experimentally that using SJLT or SRHT instead of Gaussian sketching operators leads to up to 2.5x speedups of the serial HSS construction implementation in the STRUMPACK C++ library. Additionally, we discuss the implementation of a parallel distributed HSS construction that leverages Gaussian or SJLT sketching operators. We observe a performance improvement of up to 35x when using SJLT sketching operators over Gaussian sketching operators. The generalized algorithm allows users to select their own JL sketching operators with theoretical lower bounds on the size of the operators which may lead to faster run time with similar HSS construction accuracy.</description>

      <title>A reduced-order model for advection-dominated problems based on Radon Cumulative Distribution Transform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.14883v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Problems with dominant advection, discontinuities, travelling features, or shape variations are widespread in computational mechanics. However, classical linear model reduction and interpolation methods typically fail to reproduce even relatively small parameter variations, making the reduced models inefficient and inaccurate. This work proposes a model order reduction approach based on the Radon-Cumulative-Distribution transform (RCDT). We demonstrate numerically that this non-linear transformation can overcome some limitations of standard proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) reconstructions and is capable of interpolating accurately some advection-dominated phenomena, although it may introduce artefacts due to the discrete forward and inverse transform. The method is tested on various test cases coming from both manufactured examples and fluid dynamics problems.</description>

      <title>A note on generalized tensor CUR approximation for tensor pairs and tensor triplets based on the tubal product</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00754v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we briefly present a generalized tensor CUR (GTCUR) approximation for tensor pairs (X,Y) and tensor triplets (X,Y,Z) based on the tubal product (t-product). We use the tensor Discrete Empirical Interpolation Method (TDEIM) to do these extensions. We show how the TDEIM can be utilized to generalize the classical tensor CUR (TCUR) approximation, which acts only on a single tensor, to jointly compute the TCUR of two and three tensors. This approach can be used to sample relevant lateral/horizontal slices of one data tensor relative to one or two other data tensors. For some special cases, the Generalized TCUR (GTCUR) approximation is reduced to the classical TCUR for both tensor pairs and tensor triplets in a similar fashion as shown for the matrices.</description>

      <title>A polytopal discrete de Rham complex on manifolds, with application to the Maxwell equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design in this work a discrete de Rham complex on manifolds. This complex, written in the framework of exterior calculus, has the same cohomology as the continuous de Rham complex, is of arbitrary order of accuracy and, in principle, can be designed on meshes made of generic elements (that is, elements whose boundary is the union of an arbitrary number of curved edges/faces). Notions of local (full and trimmed) polynomial spaces are developed, with compatibility requirements between polynomials on mesh entities of various dimensions. We give explicit constructions of such polynomials in 2D, for some meshes made of curved triangles or quadrangles (such meshes are easy to design in many cases, starting from a few charts describing the manifold). The discrete de Rham complex is then used to set up a scheme for the Maxwell equations on a 2D manifold without boundary, and we show that a natural discrete version of the constraint linking the electric field and the electric charge density is satisfied. Numerical examples are provided on the sphere and the torus, based on bespoke analytical solutions and meshes on each of these manifolds.</description>

      <title>Weighted hyperbolic cross polynomial approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study linear polynomial approximation of functions in weighted Sobolev spaces $W^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ of mixed smoothness $r \in \mathbb{N}$, and their optimality in terms of Kolmogorov and linear $n$-widths of the unit ball $\boldsymbol{W}^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ in these spaces. The approximation error is measured by the norm of the weighted Lebesgue space $L_{q,w}(\mathbb{R}^d)$. The weight $w$ is a tensor-product Freud weight. For $1\le p,q \le \infty$ and $d=1$, we prove that the polynomial approximation by de la Vall\'ee Poussin sums of the orthonormal polynomial expansion of functions with respect to the weight $w^2$, is asymptotically optimal in terms of relevant linear $n$-widths $\lambda_n\big(\boldsymbol{W}^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R}, L_{q,w}(\mathbb{R})\big)$ and Kolmogorov $n$-widths $d_n\big(\boldsymbol{W}^r_{p,w}(\mathbb{R}), L_{q,w}(\mathbb{R})\big)$ for $1\le q \le p &lt;\infty$. For $1\le p,q \le \infty$ and $d\ge 2$, we construct linear methods of hyperbolic cross polynomial approximation based on tensor product of successive differences of dyadic-scaled de la Vall\'ee Poussin sums, which are counterparts of hyperbolic cross trigonometric linear polynomial approximation, and give some upper bounds of the error of these approximations for various pair $p,q$ with $1 \le p, q \le \infty$. For some particular weights $w$ and $d \ge 2$, we prove the right convergence rate of $\lambda_n\big(\boldsymbol{W}^r_{2,w}(\mathbb{R}^d), L_{2,w}(\mathbb{R}^d)\big)$ and $d_n\big(\boldsymbol{W}^r_{2,w}(\mathbb{R}^d), L_{2,w}(\mathbb{R}^d)\big)$ which is performed by a constructive hyperbolic cross polynomial approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel collaborative neurodynamic model for computing nonnegative Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD). The model relies on a system of recurrent neural networks to solve the underlying nonconvex optimization problem associated with nonnegative CPD. Additionally, a discrete-time version of the continuous neural network is developed. To enhance the chances of reaching a potential global minimum, the recurrent neural networks are allowed to communicate and exchange information through particle swarm optimization (PSO). Convergence and stability analyses of both the continuous and discrete neurodynamic models are thoroughly examined. Experimental evaluations are conducted on random and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

Abstract: A centrality measure of the cut-edges of an undirected graph, given in [Altafini et al.~SIMAX 2023] and based on Kemeny's constant, is revisited. A numerically more stable expression is given to compute this measure, and an explicit expression is provided for some classes of graphs, including one-path graphs and trees formed by three or more branches. These results theoretically confirm the good physical behaviour of this centrality measure, experimentally observed in [Altafini et al.~SIMAX 2023]. Numerical tests are reported to check the stability and to confirm the good physical behaviour.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops an hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) finite element method of arbitrary order for the steady thermally coupled incompressible Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) flow. The HDG scheme uses piecewise polynomials of degrees $k(k\geq 1),k,k-1,k-1$, and $k$ respectively for the approximations of the velocity, the magnetic field, the pressure, the magnetic pseudo-pressure, and the temperature in the interior of elements, and uses piecewise polynomials of degree $k$ for their numerical traces on the interfaces of elements. The method is shown to yield globally divergence-free approximations of the velocity and magnetic fields. Existence and uniqueness results for the discrete scheme are given and optimal a priori error estimates are derived. Numerical experiments are provided to verify the obtained theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.13475v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For many applications the presence of a quantum advantage crucially depends on the availability of resourceful states. Although the resource typically depends on the particular task, in the context of multipartite systems entangled quantum states are often regarded as resourceful. We propose an algorithmic method to find maximally resourceful states of several particles for various applications and quantifiers. We discuss in detail the case of the geometric measure, identifying physically interesting states and delivering insights to the problem of absolutely maximally entangled states. Moreover, we demonstrate the universality of our approach by applying it to maximally entangled subspaces, the Schmidt-rank, the stabilizer rank as well as the preparability in triangle networks.</description>

Abstract: In 1987, Mazur and Tate stated conjectures which, in some cases, resemble the classical Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and its $p$-adic analog. We study experimentally three conjectures stated by Mazur and Tate using SageMath. Our findings indicate discrepancies in some of the original statements of some of the conjectures presented by Mazur and Tate. However, a slight modification on the statement of these conjectures does appear to hold.</description>
