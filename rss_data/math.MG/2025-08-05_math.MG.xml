      <title>Modified Distance Ratio Metrics via Domain Diameter and their geometric implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D\subsetneq\mathbb{R}^n,~n\ge 2$, be a domain. In this manuscript, a new version of the Vuorinen's distance ratio metric $j_D$ [{\tt J. Analyse Math.} {\bf 45} (1985), 69--115], denoted by $\zeta_D$, and a version of Gehring-Osgood's distance ratio metric $j_D'$ [{\tt J. Analyse Math.} {\bf 36} (1979), 50--74], denoted by $\zeta_D'$, are introduced to better understand how quasihyperbolic geometry interacts with bounded uniform domains in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We show that the metric $m_D$, introduced in [{\tt arXiv:2505.10964v2}], is the inner metric of $\zeta_D$ and explore their relations to several well-known hyperbolic-type metrics. The paper includes ball inclusion properties of these metrics associated with the metric $m_D$ and other hyperbolic-type metrics. The distortion properties of them are also considered under several important classes of mappings. Furthermore, as an application, we demonstrate that uniform domains can be characterized in terms of metrics $\zeta_D$ and $m_D$.</description>

      <title>Warped products, solid hyperbolic fillings, and the identity $D^{1,p} = N^{1,p} + \mathbb{R}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a large class of metric measure spaces $Z$ which satisfy the identity $D^{1,p}(Z) = N^{1,p}(Z) + \mathbb{R}$, i.e.\ any measurable function $u \colon Z \to \mathbb{R}$ with an $L^p$-integrable upper gradient is a constant term away from being $L^p$-integrable. To do so, we construct a family of hyperbolic fillings $\mathbb{H}_{\alpha, \beta}(Y)$, $\alpha, \beta \in (0, \infty)$, of a metric measure space $Y$, via a warped product of $Y$ with an exponentially weighted positive real line. We then show that for certain classes of $Y$, the above identity is satisfied for $Z=\mathbb{H}_{\alpha,\beta}(Y)$ when $1\le p\le \beta/\alpha$. We also show that under mild assumptions on $Y$, the warped product $\mathbb{H}_{\alpha, \beta}(Y)$ is Gromov hyperbolic as a metric space and the Gromov boundary of $\mathbb{H}_{\alpha, \beta}(Y)$ is quasisymmetric to $Y$.</description>

      <title>Poncelet triangles: two harmonious loci and two attractive envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that over a Poncelet triangle family interscribed between two nested ellipses $\E,\E_c$, (i) the locus of the orthocenter is not only a conic, but it is axis-aligned and homothetic to a $90^o$-rotated copy of $\E$, and (ii) the locus of the isogonal conjugate of a fixed point $P$ is also a conic (the expected degree was four); a parabola (resp. line) if $P$ is on the (degree-four) envelope of the circumcircle (resp. on $\E$). We also show that the envelope of both the circumcircle and radical axis of incircle and circumcircle contain a conic component if and only if $\E_c$ is a circle. The former case is the union of two circles!</description>

      <title>Steffen's flexible polyhedron is embedded. A proof via symbolic computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A polyhedron is flexible if it can be continuously deformed preserving the shape and dimensions of every its face. In the late 1970's Klaus Steffen constructed a sphere-homeomorphic embedded flexible polyhedron with triangular faces and with 9 vertices only, which is well-known in the theory of flexible polyhedra. At about the same time, a hypothesis was formulated that the Steffen polyhedron has the least possible number of vertices among all embedded flexible polyhedra without boundary. A counterexample to this hypothesis was constructed by Matteo Gallet, Georg Grasegger, Jan Legersk{\'y}, and Josef Schicho in 2024 only. Surprisingly, until now, no proof has been published in the mathematical literature that the Steffen polyhedron is embedded. Probably, this fact was considered obvious to everyone who made a cardboard model of this polyhedron. In this article, we prove this fact using computer symbolic calculations.</description>

      <title>Cyclic orders and actions of Leary--Minasyan groups on coarse $\mathrm{PD}(n)$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for $n \geq 3$, there are torsion-free CAT(0) groups with visual boundaries that embed into $S^n$ but which are not virtually the fundamental group of a compact aspherical $n+1$-manifold. The groups are the CAT(0) and not bi-automatic groups constructed previously by Leary and Minasyan. The obstruction comes from analyzing certain cyclic orders on the boundary of the Bass-Serre tree, in the same manner as Kapovich-Kleiner ruled out actions of Baumslag-Solitar groups on coarse $\mathrm{PD}(3)$ spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the thesis of K. Reinhardt in 1918, it is well known that there are exactly three types of convex hexagons that can tile the plane. However, the proof of the fact is far from being complete. We prove this fact, under an assumption much weaker than the convexity.</description>

      <title>Irreducible finite-index representations of automorphism groups of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a locally finite tree T where every vertex has degree &gt;= 3, and a closed noncompact subgroup G of the automorphism group Aut(T), with Tits' independence property (P) and with transitive action on the boundary of the tree. We show that G does not have continuous irreducible representations to a locally convex topological vector space over R, C or H that preserve a continuous nondegenerate sesquilinear form of index p &gt; 1. As the representations of index 1 are already classified, this gives a complete classification of continuous irreducible representations of G that preserve a continuous nondegenerate sesquilinear form of finite index.</description>

      <title>Generalized Variance Inequalities for Barycenters in CAT(0) and CAT(1) Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove generalized versions of the Variance Inequality known for barycenters in CAT(0) spaces, inspired by an analogous result for $p$-uniformly convex Banach spaces. Our generalizations apply to balls of sufficiently small radius in complete CAT(1) spaces and to exponents $p \geq 2$ in the $\operatorname{CAT}(0)$ setting. Building on a result of Eskenazis, Mendel, and Naor, we establish sharp metric cotype for all $p \geq 2$ in $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ spaces, extending the previously known case $p=2$. In addition, based on their work, we derive martingale inequalities for nonlinear martingales taking values in complete $\mathrm{CAT}(0)$ space and balls of sufficiently small radius in complete CAT(1) spaces.</description>

      <title>Some inequalities of isoperimetric type for the c-affine surface area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the c-affine surface area $\Omega^c$, recently introduced by Sch\"utt, Werner and Yalikun. We show that on the class of ball-bodies, $\Omega^c$ is maximized by a ball of radius $\frac{n}{n+1}$, and that a Santal\'o-type inequality holds: $\Omega^c(K) \Omega^c(K^c) \leq \Omega^c(\frac{1}{2} B_2^n)^2$. We also produce some more intricate inequalities involving the surface area.</description>

      <title>John Ellipsoids of Revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finding a largest Euclidean ball in a given convex body $K \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and finding a largest volume ellipsoid in $K$ are two problems of fundamentally different nature. The first is a purely Euclidean problem, where we consider scaled copies of the origin-centered closed unit ball, whereas in the second problem, we search among all affine copies of the unit ball.
  In this paper, we interpolate between these two classical problems by considering ellipsoids of revolution. More generally, we study pairs of convex bodies $K$ and $L$, and seek a largest-volume affine image of $K$ contained within $L$, subject to certain restrictions on the allowed affine transformations. We derive first-order necessary conditions for optimality, generalizing known conditions from the unrestricted affine setting.
  Using these conditions, we show that an extremal ellipsoid of revolution exhibits properties analogous to those of either the largest-volume ellipsoid or the largest Euclidean ball, depending on whether the ellipsoid is considered along its axis of revolution or along the orthogonal complement of that axis.</description>

      <title>Maps of bounded variation from PI spaces to metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00768v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study maps of bounded variation defined on a metric measure space and valued into a metric space. Assuming the source space to satisfy a doubling and Poincar\'e property, we produce a well-behaved relaxation theory via approximation by simple maps. Moreover, several equivalent characterizations are given, including a notion in weak duality with test plans.</description>
