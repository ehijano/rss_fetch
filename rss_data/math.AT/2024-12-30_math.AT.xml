      <title>Infinitary combinatorics in condensed math and strong homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in our understanding of higher derived limits carry multiple implications in the fields of condensed and pyknotic mathematics, as well as for the study of strong homology. These implications are thematically diverse, pertaining, for example, to the sheaf theory of extremally disconnected spaces, to Banach--Smith duality, to the productivity of compact projective condensed anima, and to the structure of the derived category of condensed abelian groups. Underlying each of these implications are the combinatorics of multidimensionally coherent families of functions of small infinite cardinal height, and it is for this reason that we convene accounts of them together herein.</description>

      <title>Homotopy types of Hom complexes of graph homomorphisms whose codomains are square-free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given finite simple graphs $G$ and $H$, the Hom complex $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ is a polyhedral complex having the graph homomorphisms $G\to H$ as the vertices. We determine the homotopy type of each connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ when $H$ is square-free, meaning that it does not contain the $4$-cycle graph $C_4$ as a subgraph. Specifically, for a connected $G$ and a square-free $H$, we show that each connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ is homotopy equivalent to a wedge sum of circles. We further show that, given any graph homomorphism $f\colon G\to H$ to a square-free $H$, one can determine the homotopy type of the connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ containing $f$ algorithmically.</description>

      <title>Hom complexes of graphs whose codomains are square-free</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hom complex $\mathrm{Hom}(G, H)$ of graphs is a simplicial complex associated to a pair of graphs $G$ and $H$, and its homotopy type is of interest in the graph coloring problem and the homomorphism reconfiguration problem. Recently, Soichiro Fujii, Yuni Iwamasa, Kei Kimura, Yuta Nozaki and Akira Suzuki showed that if $G$ is connected and $H$ is a cycle graph then every connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G, H)$ is contractible or homotopy equivalent to a circle. In this paper, we show that if $G$ is a connected graph and $H$ is a square-free connected graph, then every connected component of $\mathrm{Hom}(G, H)$ is homotopy equivalent to a point, a circle, $H$ or a connected double cover over $H$. We also obtain a certain relation between the fundamental group of $\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ and realizable walks studied in the homomorphism reconfiguration problem.</description>

      <title>Cartesian subgroups in graph products of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The kernel of the natural projection of a graph product of groups onto their direct product is called the Cartesian subgroup. This construction generalises commutator subgroups of right-angled Coxeter and Artin groups. Using theory of polyhedral products, we give a lower and an upper bound on the number of relations in presentations of Cartesian groups and on their deficiency. The bounds are related to the fundamental groups of full subcomplexes in the clique complex, and the lower bound coincide with the upper bound if these fundamental groups are free or free abelian.
  Following Li Cai's approach, we also describe an algorithm that computes "small" presentations of Cartesian subgroups.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Persistent Homology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.15170v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce harmonic persistent homology spaces for filtrations of finite simplicial complexes. As a result we can associate concrete subspaces of cycles to each bar of the barcode of the filtration. We prove stability of the harmonic persistent homology subspaces under small perturbations of functions defining them. We relate the notion of "essential simplices" introduced in an earlier work to identify simplices which play a significant role in the birth of a bar, with that of harmonic persistent homology. We prove that the harmonic representatives of simple bars maximizes the "relative essential content" amongst all representatives of the bar, where the relative essential content is the weight a particular cycle puts on the set of essential simplices.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Topology for Data Scientists</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This book gives a thorough introduction to topological data analysis (TDA), the application of algebraic topology to data science. Algebraic topology is traditionally a very specialized field of math, and most mathematicians have never been exposed to it, let alone data scientists, computer scientists, and analysts. I have three goals in writing this book. The first is to bring people up to speed who are missing a lot of the necessary background. I will describe the topics in point-set topology, abstract algebra, and homology theory needed for a good understanding of TDA. The second is to explain TDA and some current applications and techniques. Finally, I would like to answer some questions about more advanced topics such as cohomology, homotopy, obstruction theory, and Steenrod squares, and what they can tell us about data. It is hoped that readers will acquire the tools to start to think about these topics and where they might fit in.</description>

      <title>On the homotopy links of stratified cell complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homotopy links have proven to be one of the most powerful tools of stratified homotopy theory. In previous work, we described combinatorial models for the generalized homotopy links of a stratified simplicial set. For many purposes, in particular to investigate the stratified homotopy hypothesis, a more general version of this result pertaining to stratified cell complexes is needed. Here we prove that, given a stratified cell complex $X$, the generalized homotopy links can be computed in terms of certain subcomplexes of a subdivision of $X$. As a consequence, it follows that homotopy links map certain pushout diagrams of stratified cell complexes into homotopy pushout diagrams. This result is crucial to the development of (semi-)model structures for stratified homotopy theory in which geometric examples of stratified spaces, such as Whitney stratified spaces, are bifibrant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is part of a series of three articles with the objective of investigating a stratified version of the homotopy hypothesis in terms of semi-model structures that interact well with classical examples of stratified spaces, such as Whitney stratified spaces. To this end, we prove the existence of several combinatorial simplicial model structures in the combinatorial setting of stratified simplicial sets. One of these we show to be Quillen equivalent to the left Bousfield localization of the Joyal model structure that presents the $(\infty,1)$-category of layered $(\infty,1)$-categories, i.e., such $(\infty,1)$-categories in which every endomorphism is an isomorphism.</description>

      <title>Presenting the topological stratified homotopy hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is concerned with three different homotopy theories of stratified spaces: The one defined by Douteau and Henriques, the one defined by Haine, and the one defined by Nand-Lal. One of the central questions concerning these theories has been how precisely they connect with geometric and topological examples of stratified spaces, such as piecewise linear pseudomanifolds, Whitney stratified spaces, or more recently Ayala, Francis and Tanaka's conically smooth stratified spaces. More precisely, so far, it has been an open question whether there exist (semi-)model structures on stratified topological spaces that present these theories, in which such relevant examples of stratified spaces are bifibrant. Here, we prove an affirmative answer to this question. As a consequence, we obtain a model categorical interpretation of a stratified homotopy hypothesis. Specifically, we show that Lurie's stratified singular simplicial set functor induces a Quillen equivalence between the semimodel category of stratified topological spaces presenting Nand-Lal's homotopy theory of stratified spaces and the left Bousfield localization of the Joyal model structure that corresponds to such $\infty$-categories in which every endomorphism is an isomorphism. We then perform a detailed investigation of bifibrant objects in these model structures of stratified spaces, proving a series of detection criteria and illuminating the relationship to Quinn's homotopically stratified spaces.</description>

Abstract: We compute the real and complex Buchstaber numbers of an arbitrary Bier sphere. In dimension two, we identify all the 13 different combinatorial types of Bier spheres and show that 12 of them are nerve complexes of nestohedra, while the remaining one is a nerve complex of a generalized permutohedron. As an application of our results, we construct a regular normal fan for each of those 13 Delzant polytopes, compute the cohomology rings of the corresponding nonsingular projective toric varieties, and examine the orientability of the corresponding small covers.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting: Leveraging Persistent Homology for Optimized Structural Integrity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Splatting (GS) has emerged as a crucial technique for representing discrete volumetric radiance fields. It leverages unique parametrization to mitigate computational demands in scene optimization. This work introduces Topology-Aware 3D Gaussian Splatting (Topology-GS), which addresses two key limitations in current approaches: compromised pixel-level structural integrity due to incomplete initial geometric coverage, and inadequate feature-level integrity from insufficient topological constraints during optimization. To overcome these limitations, Topology-GS incorporates a novel interpolation strategy, Local Persistent Voronoi Interpolation (LPVI), and a topology-focused regularization term based on persistent barcodes, named PersLoss. LPVI utilizes persistent homology to guide adaptive interpolation, enhancing point coverage in low-curvature areas while preserving topological structure. PersLoss aligns the visual perceptual similarity of rendered images with ground truth by constraining distances between their topological features. Comprehensive experiments on three novel-view synthesis benchmarks demonstrate that Topology-GS outperforms existing methods in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics, while maintaining efficient memory usage. This study pioneers the integration of topology with 3D-GS, laying the groundwork for future research in this area.</description>
