      <title>Room-temperature decomposition of the ethaline deep eutectic solvent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Environmentally-benign, non-toxic electrolytes with combinatorial design spaces are excellent candidates for green solvents, green leaching agents, and carbon capture sources. Here, we examine one particular green solvent, ethaline, a 2:1 molar ratio of ethylene glycol and choline chloride. Despite its touted green credentials, we find partial decomposition of ethaline into toxic chloromethane and dimethylaminoethanol at room temperature, limiting its sustainable advantage. We experimentally characterize these decomposition products and computationally develop a general, quantum chemically-accurate workflow to understand decomposition. We find that fluctuations of the hydrogen bonds bind chloride near reaction sites, initiating the reaction between choline cations and chloride anions. In summary, in the design of green solvents, we do not recommend the use of choline chloride due to its susceptibility to undergo decomposition in strongly hydrogen-bound mixtures.</description>

      <title>Multi-Criteria Decision Making in Chemical and Process Engineering: Methods, Progress and Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) is necessary for choosing one from the available alternatives (or from the obtained Pareto-optimal solutions for multi-objective optimization), where the performance of each alternative is quantified against several criteria (or objectives). This paper presents a comprehensive review of the application of MCDM methods in chemical and process engineering. It systematically outlines the essential steps in MCDM, including the various normalization, weighting, and MCDM methods that are critical to the decision-making. The review draws on published papers identified through a search in the SCOPUS database, focusing on works by authors with more contributions to the field. Each selected paper is analyzed based on the MCDM, normalization and weighting methods used. Additionally, this paper introduces two readily available programs for performing MCDM calculations. In short, it provides insights into MCDM steps and methods, highlights their applications in chemical engineering, and discusses the challenges and prospects in this area.</description>

      <title>Balancing chemical equations: form the perspective of Hilbert basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The balancing of chemical equations is a basic problem in chemistry. A commonly employed method is to convert the task to a linear algebra problem, and then solve the null space of the constructed formula matrix. However, in this method, the directly obtained solution may be invalid, and there is no canonical choice of independent basis reactions. Here, we show that these drawbacks originate from the fact that the fundamental structure of solutions here is not a linear space but a positive affine monoid. This new understanding enables a systematic approach and a complete description of all possible reactions by a unique set of independent elementary reactions, called Hilbert-basis reactions. By clarifying its underlying mathematical structure, our work offers a new perspective on this old problem of balancing chemical equations.</description>

      <title>E3STO: Orbital Inspired SE(3)-Equivariant Molecular Representation for Electron Density Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron density prediction stands as a cornerstone challenge in molecular systems, pivotal for various applications such as understanding molecular interactions and conducting precise quantum mechanical calculations. However, the scaling of density functional theory (DFT) calculations is prohibitively expensive. Machine learning methods provide an alternative, offering efficiency and accuracy. We introduce a novel SE(3)-equivariant architecture, drawing inspiration from Slater-Type Orbitals (STO), to learn representations of molecular electronic structures. Our approach offers an alternative functional form for learned orbital-like molecular representation. We showcase the effectiveness of our method by achieving SOTA prediction accuracy of molecular electron density with 30-70\% improvement over other work on Molecular Dynamics data.</description>

      <title>Competing Ionization and Dissociation: Extension of the energy-dependent frame transformation to the gerade symmetry of H$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article solves two major tasks that frequently arise in the theory of electron collisions with a target molecular cation. First, it extends the energy-dependent frame transformation treatment(EDFT), which is needed to map fixed-nuclei electron-molecule scattering matrices into an energy-dependent laboratory frame scattering matrix with vibrational channel indices. The EDFT mapping can now be carried out even when the target molecule possesses multiple low energy potential curves, significantly transcending previous applications. Secondly, it implements a method to extract the rest of the full lab-frame scattering matrix, i.e. the columns and rows describing input and/or output dissociation channels. The treatment is benchmarked in this article against the essentially exact solution of a refined two-dimensional model of the singlet gerade $\Sigma$ symmetry of H$_2$. Our tests demonstrate that the theory accurately maps fixed-nuclei scattering information, of the type provided by existing electron-molecule computer codes, into a laboratory-frame scattering matrix that includes both ionization and dissociation. This treatment can provide a general framework applicable to a broad class of electron collision processes involving diatomic target ions, suitable for an accurate description of challenging processes such as dissociative recombination.</description>

      <title>Low-rank decomposition on the antisymmetric product of geminals for strongly correlated electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated some variational methods to compute a wavefunction based on antisymmetric product of geminals (APG). The Waring decomposition on the APG wavefunction leads a finite sum of antisymmetrized geminal power (AGP) wavefunctions, each for which the variational principle can be applied. We call this as AGP-CI method which provides a variational solution of the APG wavefunction efficiently. However, number of AGP wavefunctions in the exact AGP-CI formalism become exponentially large in case of many-electron systems. Therefore, we also investigate the low-rank APG wavefunction, in which the geminal matrices are factorized by the Schur decomposition. Interestingly, only a few non-zero eigenvalues (up to half number of electrons) were found from the Schur decomposition on the APG wavefunction. We developed some methods to approximate the APG wavefunction by lowering the ranks of geminal matrices, and demonstrate their performance. Our new geminal method based on the low-rank decomposition can drastically reduce the number of variational parameters, although there is no efficient algorithm so far, due to some mathematical complications.</description>

      <title>The manifestations of 'l-Doubling' in gas-phase rotational dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 'l-Doubling' phenomenon emanates from the coupling between molecular rotations and perpendicular vibrations (bending modes) in polyatomic molecules. This elusive phenomenon has been largely discarded in laser-induced molecular alignment. Here we explore and unveil the ramifications of 'l-Doubling' to the coherent rotational dynamics of triatomic molecules at ambient temperatures and above. The observed 'l-Doubling' dynamics may be wrongly considered as collisional decay throughout the first few hundreds of picoseconds past excitation, highlighting the importance of correct assimilation of l-Doubling in current research of dissipative rotational dynamics and in coherent rotational dynamics in general.</description>

      <title>Control of Cu morphology on TaN barrier and combined Ru-TaN barrier/liner substrates for nanoscale interconnects from atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The miniaturization of electronic devices brings severe challenges in the deposition of metal interconnects in back end of line processing due to a continually decreasing volume available for metal deposition in the interconnect via. Cu is currently used as the interconnect metal and requires barrier and liner layers to prevent diffusion into silicon and promote deposition of smooth conducting metal films, respectively. However, these take up a significant volume in the interconnect vias, which are already extremely narrow due to the high aspect ratio required. Designing combined barrier/liner materials provides opportunities to promote deposition of smooth films and avoid islanding and frees up precious volume to deposit the required amount of interconnect metal. We present here the first atomistic kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) investigation of the potential of Ru-modified TaN as a dual-function barrier/line material to promote 2D morphology of deposited Cu enabling optimization of the limited available interconnect volume. The kMC simulations use Density Functional Theory (DFT) activation barriers to predict the role of the combined barrier/liner material on the morphology of deposited Cu and give, for the first time, a tool to predict metal deposition on technologically important substrates. We study Cu deposition at different partial pressures on a series of substrates, including unmodified TaN and TaN with 25% or 50% surface Ru incorporation, at deposition temperatures of 300 K, 500 K and 800 K. The deposition simulations predict Cu film roughness, island size and number, substrate exposure area (as a measure of 2D vs. 3D morphology), layer occupation rate, compactness (as a measure of film quality) and the impact of annealing. As-deposited Cu on unmodified TaN exhibits significantly higher roughness and substrate exposure areas, demonstrating island formation...</description>

      <title>Bridging electronic and classical density-functional theory using universal machine-learned functional approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accuracy of density-functional theory (DFT) is determined by the quality of the approximate functionals, such as exchange-correlation in electronic DFT and the excess functional in the classical DFT formalism of fluids. The exact functional is highly nonlocal for both electrons and fluids, yet most approximate functionals are semi-local or nonlocal in a limited weighted-density form. Machine-learned (ML) nonlocal density-functional approximations are promising in both electronic and classical DFT, but have so far employed disparate approaches with limited generality. Here, we formulate a universal approximation framework and training protocol for nonlocal ML functionals, combining features of equivariant convolutional neural networks and the weighted-density approximation. We prototype this approach for several 1D and quasi-1D problems and demonstrate that a functional with exactly the same hyperparameters achieves excellent accuracy for the hard-rod fluid, the inhomogeneous Ising model, the exact exchange functional for electrons, the electron kinetic energy functional for orbital-free DFT, as well as for liquid water with 1D inhomogeneities. These results lay the foundation for a universal ML approach to exact 3D functionals spanning electronic and classical DFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate solution of dissipative quantum dynamics plays an important role on the simulation of open quantum systems. Here we propose a machine-learning-based universal solver for the hierarchical equations of motion, one of the most widely used approaches which takes into account non-markovian effects and nonperturbative system-environment interactions in a numerically exact manner. We develop a neural quantum propagator model by utilizing the neural network architecture, which avoids time-consuming iterations and can be used to evolve any initial quantum state for arbitrarily long times. To demonstrate the efficacy of our model, we apply it to the simulation of population dynamics and linear and two-dimensional spectra of the Fenna-Matthews-Olson complex.</description>

      <title>Is the protactinium(V) mono-oxo bond weaker than what we thought?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The bond distance is the simplest and most obvious indicator of the nature of a given chemical bond. However, for rare chemistry, it may happen that it is not yet firmly established. In this communication, we will show that the formally-triple protactinium(V) mono-oxo bond is predicted longer than what was previously reported in the solid state and in solution, based on robust quantum mechanical calculations, supported by an extensive methodological study. Furthermore, additional calculations are used to demonstrate that the Pa-Ooxo bond of interest is more sensitive to complexation than the supposedly analogous U-Oyl ones, not only in terms of bond distance but also of finer bond descriptors associated with the effective bond multiplicity.</description>

      <title>Fermi's golden rule rate expression for transitions due to nonadiabatic derivative couplings in the adiabatic basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starting from a general molecular Hamiltonian expressed in the basis of adiabatic electronic and nuclear position states, where a compact and complete expression for nonadiabatic derivative coupling (NDC) Hamiltonian term is obtained, we provide a general analysis of the Fermi's golden rule (FGR) rate expression for nonadiabatic transitions between adiabatic states. We then consider a quasi-adiabatic approximation that uses crude adiabatic states evaluated at the minimum potential energy configuration of the initial adiabatic state as the basis for the zeroth order adiabatic and NDC coupling terms of the Hamiltonian. Although application of this approximation is rather limited, it allows deriving a general FGR rate expression without further approximation and still accounts for non-Condon effect arising from momentum operators of NDC terms and its coupling with vibronic displacements. For a generic and widely used model where all nuclear degrees of freedom and environmental effects are represented as linearly coupled harmonic oscillators, we derive a closed form FGR rate expression that requires only Fourier transform. The resulting rate expression includes quadratic contributions of NDC terms and their couplings to Franck-Condon modes, which require evaluation of two additional bath spectral densities in addition to conventional one that appears in a typical FGR rate theory based on the Condon approximation. Model calculations for the case where nuclear vibrations consist of both a sharp high frequency mode and an Ohmic bath spectral density illustrate new features and implications of the rate expression. We then apply our theoretical expression to the nonradiative decay from the first excited singlet state of azulene, which illustrates the utility and implications of our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>The Steklov problem for exterior domains: asymptotic behavior and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of the Steklov problem for the modified Helmholtz equation $(p-\Delta) u = 0$ in the exterior of a compact set, for which the positive parameter $p$ ensures exponential decay of the Steklov eigenfunctions at infinity. We obtain the small-$p$ asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and discuss their features for different space dimensions. These results find immediate applications to the theory of stochastic processes and unveil the long-time asymptotic behavior of probability densities of various first-passage times in exterior domains. Theoretical results are validated by solving the exterior Steklov problem by a finite-element method with a transparent boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm in systems with large condition numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) algorithm offers an exponential speedup in system size for treating linear equations of the form $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ on quantum computers when compared to their traditional counterparts, it faces a challenge related to the condition number ($\mathcal{\kappa}$) scaling of the $A$ matrix. In this work, we address the issue by introducing the post-selection-improved HHL (Psi-HHL) approach that involves a simple yet effective modification of the HHL algorithm to extract a feature of $|x\rangle$, and which leads to achieving optimal behaviour in $\mathcal{\kappa}$ (linear scaling) for large condition number situations. This has the important practical implication of having to use substantially fewer shots relative to the traditional HHL algorithm. We carry out two sets of simulations, where we go up to 26-qubit calculations, to demonstrate the ability of Psi-HHL to handle situations involving large $\mathcal{\kappa}$ matrices via: (a) a set of toy matrices, for which we go up to size $64 \times 64$ and $\mathcal{\kappa}$ values of up to $\approx$ 1 million, and (b) a deep-dive into quantum chemistry, where we consider matrices up to size $256 \times 256$ that reach $\mathcal{\kappa}$ of about 466. The molecular systems that we consider are Li$_{\mathrm{2}}$, RbH, and CsH. Although the feature of $|x\rangle$ considered in our examples is an overlap between the input and output states of the HHL algorithm, our approach is general and can be applied in principle to any transition matrix element involving $|x\rangle$.</description>

Abstract: A force field is a critical component in molecular dynamics simulations for computational drug discovery. It must achieve high accuracy within the constraints of molecular mechanics' (MM) limited functional forms, which offers high computational efficiency. With the rapid expansion of synthetically accessible chemical space, traditional look-up table approaches face significant challenges. In this study, we address this issue using a modern data-driven approach, developing ByteFF, an Amber-compatible force field for drug-like molecules. To create ByteFF, we generated an expansive and highly diverse molecular dataset at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/DZVP level of theory. This dataset includes 2.4 million optimized molecular fragment geometries with analytical Hessian matrices, along with 3.2 million torsion profiles. We then trained an edge-augmented, symmetry-preserving molecular graph neural network (GNN) on this dataset, employing a carefully optimized training strategy. Our model predicts all bonded and non-bonded MM force field parameters for drug-like molecules simultaneously across a broad chemical space. ByteFF demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets, excelling in predicting relaxed geometries, torsional energy profiles, and conformational energies and forces. Its exceptional accuracy and expansive chemical space coverage make ByteFF a valuable tool for multiple stages of computational drug discovery.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning has been pervasively touching many fields of science. Chemistry and materials science are no exception. While machine learning has been making a great impact, it is still not reaching its full potential or maturity. In this perspective, we first outline current applications across a diversity of problems in chemistry. Then, we discuss how machine learning researchers view and approach problems in the field. Finally, we provide our considerations for maximizing impact when researching machine learning for chemistry.</description>
