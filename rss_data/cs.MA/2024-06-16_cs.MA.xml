      <title>Coralai: Intrinsic Evolution of Embodied Neural Cellular Automata Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents Coralai, a framework for exploring diverse ecosystems of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA). Organisms in Coralai utilize modular, GPU-accelerated Taichi kernels to interact, enact environmental changes, and evolve through local survival, merging, and mutation operations implemented with HyperNEAT and PyTorch. We provide an exploratory experiment implementing physics inspired by slime mold behavior showcasing the emergence of competition between sessile and mobile organisms, cycles of resource depletion and recovery, and symbiosis between diverse organisms. We conclude by outlining future work to discover simulation parameters through measures of multi-scale complexity and diversity. Code for Coralai is available at https://github.com/aidanbx/coralai , video demos are available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NL8IZQY02-8 .</description>

      <title>PixRO: Pixel-Distributed Rotational Odometry with Gaussian Belief Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual sensors are not only becoming better at capturing high-quality images but also they have steadily increased their capabilities in processing data on their own on-chip. Yet the majority of VO pipelines rely on the transmission and processing of full images in a centralized unit (e.g. CPU or GPU), which often contain much redundant and low-quality information for the task. In this paper, we address the task of frame-to-frame rotational estimation but, instead of reasoning about relative motion between frames using the full images, distribute the estimation at pixel-level. In this paradigm, each pixel produces an estimate of the global motion by only relying on local information and local message-passing with neighbouring pixels. The resulting per-pixel estimates can then be communicated to downstream tasks, yielding higher-level, informative cues instead of the original raw pixel-readings. We evaluate the proposed approach on real public datasets, where we offer detailed insights about this novel technique and open-source our implementation for the future benefit of the community.</description>

      <title>A Zeroth-Order Proximal Algorithm for Consensus Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers a consensus optimization problem, where all the nodes in a network, with access to the zeroth-order information of its local objective function only, attempt to cooperatively achieve a common minimizer of the sum of their local objectives. To address this problem, we develop ZoPro, a zeroth-order proximal algorithm, which incorporates a zeroth-order oracle for approximating Hessian and gradient into a recently proposed, high-performance distributed second-order proximal algorithm. We show that the proposed ZoPro algorithm, equipped with a dynamic stepsize, converges linearly to a neighborhood of the optimum in expectation, provided that each local objective function is strongly convex and smooth. Extensive simulations demonstrate that ZoPro converges faster than several state-of-the-art distributed zeroth-order algorithms and outperforms a few distributed second-order algorithms in terms of running time for reaching given accuracy.</description>

      <title>On Implementing Autonomous Supply Chains: a Multi-Agent System Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Trade restrictions, the COVID-19 pandemic, and geopolitical conflicts have significantly exposed vulnerabilities within traditional global supply chains. These events underscore the need for organisations to establish more resilient and flexible supply chains. To address these challenges, the concept of the autonomous supply chain (ASC), characterised by predictive and self-decision-making capabilities, has recently emerged as a promising solution. However, research on ASCs is relatively limited, with no existing studies specifically focusing on their implementations. This paper aims to address this gap by presenting an implementation of ASC using a multi-agent approach. It presents a methodology for the analysis and design of such an agent-based ASC system (A2SC). This paper provides a concrete case study, the autonomous meat supply chain, which showcases the practical implementation of the A2SC system using the proposed methodology. Additionally, a system architecture and a toolkit for developing such A2SC systems are presented. Despite limitations, this work demonstrates a promising approach for implementing an effective ASC system.</description>

      <title>Module checking of pushdown multi-agent systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.04728v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the module-checking problem of pushdown multi-agent systems (PMS) against ATL and ATL* specifications. We establish that for ATL, module checking of PMS is 2EXPTIME-complete, which is the same complexity as pushdown module-checking for CTL. On the other hand, we show that ATL* module-checking of PMS turns out to be 4EXPTIME-complete, hence exponentially harder than both CTL* pushdown module-checking and ATL* model-checking of PMS. Our result for ATL* provides a rare example of a natural decision problem that is elementary yet but with a complexity that is higher than triply exponential-time.</description>

      <title>NoiseNCA: Noisy Seed Improves Spatio-Temporal Continuity of Neural Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06279v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) is a class of Cellular Automata where the update rule is parameterized by a neural network that can be trained using gradient descent. In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-temporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical system's perspective.</description>
