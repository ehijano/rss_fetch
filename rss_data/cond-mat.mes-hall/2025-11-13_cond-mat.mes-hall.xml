      <title>High-quality nanostructured diamond membranes for nanoscale quantum sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deploying nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as nanoscale quantum sensors for condensed matter and materials physics requires placing the NV centers close to the sensing target. One solution is to fabricate diamond nanostructures and integrate them with materials and devices. However, diamond etching and ion milling can introduce subsurface damage and surface defects that degrade the charge stability and spin coherence of NV centers near the surface. Here we report a procedure for fabricating low-damage nanostructured diamond membranes, and we show that this fabrication scheme preserves the optical and spin properties of state-of-the-art shallow NV center quantum sensors, within nanometers of the diamond surface, while providing significant photonic enhancement. Furthermore, we demonstrate a pick-and-place transfer method, which enables integration with diverse sensing targets.</description>

      <title>Dephasing-induced Quantum Hall Criticality in the Quantum Anomalous Hall system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional wisdom holds that static disorder is indispensable to the integer quantum Hall effect, underpinning both quantized plateaus and the plateau-plateau transition. We show that pure dephasing, without elastic disorder, is sufficient to generate the same $\theta$ driven criticality. Starting from a Keldysh formulation, we derive an open system nonlinear $\sigma$ model (NL$\sigma$M) for class A with a topological $\theta$ term but no Cooperon sector, and we demonstrate that nonperturbative instantons still govern a two parameter flow of $(\sigma_{xx},\sigma_{xy})$. Evaluating $\theta$ in a dephasing quantum anomalous Hall setting, we predict a quantum Hall critical point at $\sigma_{xy}=1/2$ with finite $\sigma_{xx}$ the hallmark of the integer quantum Hall universality class realized without Anderson localization. Boundary driven simulations of the Qi_Wu_Zhang model with local dephasing confirm this prediction and provide an experimentally aligned protocol to extract $(\sigma_{xx},\sigma_{xy})$ from Hall potential maps. By establishing dephasing as a self contained route to Hall criticality, our framework reframes plateau physics in open solid state and cold atom platforms and offers practical diagnostics for topological transport in nonunitary matter.</description>

      <title>Mechanical and electrical properties of a nano-gap or how to play the nano-accordion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has become an important technique to study dynamic processes at highest spatial resolution and one branch is the investigation of phenomena related with electrical currents. Here, we present experimental results obtained from a peculiar in-situ TEM device, which was prepared with the aim to analyze the relationship between (thermo)electric properties and specific crystal orientations of a misfit layered compound. The formation of a nano-sized gap at a grain boundary facilitated a precisely controllable mechanical bending of the device by application of differential heating currents. The devices' electrical properties were found to be substantially influenced by the gap, leading to a high intrinsic voltage. This voltage additionally depends on the vacuum environment and on the history of applied heating currents. These findings are largely attributed to the presence of adsorbed molecules within the gap region. The electrical in-situ TEM studies of this work illustrate that interior surfaces can strongly influence electrical properties even under high vacuum conditions.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Orbital Angular Momentum Induced by Chiral Phonons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of electrons is dynamically induced by chiral phonons. The induced OAM originates from the adiabatic evolution in which electrons dynamically acquire Berry phase. By introducing a tight-binding model with p orbitals on a honeycomb lattice, we show a microscopic picture that chiral phonons modulate orbital overlaps of electrons, and calculate the generated OAM, whose sign depends on phonon chirality. We then construct an effective model for valley phonons with different phonon pseudoangular momenta (PAM) and identity their distinct intervalley-scattering channels. Our model obeys the selection rule between phonons and electrons with the orbital degree of freedom. Extending this framework to d-orbital electrons, our model is applied to describe the induced OAM in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides. Our results reveal a direct lattice-OAM transfer mechanism that emerges even in materials with weak spin-orbital coupling, opening a new promising way for orbitronics applications.</description>

      <title>Interface tuned Enhanced and Low Temperature Quenching of Orbital Hall Currents Induce Torque and magnetoresistance in Light Metal/Nickel Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate orbital current induced effects arising from the orbital Hall effect in light-metal/ferromagnet bilayers. Thin films of Ti in ohmic contact with Ni were studied using second-harmonic longitudinal and transverse voltage measurements under an applied a.c. current. From these signals, we extract the orbital Hall torque (OHT) efficiency and the unidirectional orbital magnetoresistance (UOMR). Insertion of a Cu interlayer between the Ni/Ti interface leads to an enhancement of both OHT efficiency and UOMR compared to both Ni/Ti and Ni/Cu bilayers. Furthermore, systematic variation of Ti thickness reveals that both OHT efficiency and UOMR increase with increasing Ti thickness, indicating that the observed phenomena predominantly originate from the bulk orbital Hall effect rather than purely from interfacial mechanisms and Lowering the temperature leads to a clear reduction in both the orbital Hall torque (OHT) efficiency and the unidirectional orbital magnetoresistance (UOMR). The nearly linear and correlated temperature dependence of both parameters suggests a common underlying mechanism, namely, the orbital Hall effect in the light-metal layer, which governs both the generation of orbital current and its subsequent influence on the ferromagnet through orbital torque and orbital magnetoresistance.</description>

      <title>Spin and orbital-to-charge conversion in noncentrosymmetric materials: Hall versus Rashba-Edelstein effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spin- and orbital-to-charge conversion phenomena in nonmagnetic materials with broken inversion symmetry, treating the contributions from the Hall effect and the Rashba-Edelstein effect on an equal footing. We develop a general formalism for this interconversion based solely on macroscopic observables. The theory is validated through a case study of ferroelectric GeTe, where we find that the effective Rashba parameter obtained is smaller than previously reported values for the same material. Incorporating these parameters into a drift-diffusion model, we show that the generated charge current is primarily governed by the Rashba-Edelstein effect, rather than by the spin or orbital Hall effects. Our work redefines the spin- and orbit-to-charge interconversion coefficients in terms of directly measurable observables, encouraging the community to revisit these processes in other quantum materials lacking inversion symmetry.</description>

      <title>Probing the features of electron dispersion by tunneling between slightly twisted bilayer graphene sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tunneling conductance between two bilayer graphene (BLG) sheets separated by 2 nm-thick insulating barrier was measured in two devices with the twist angles between BLGs less than 1{\deg}. At small bias voltages, the tunneling occurs with conservation of energy and momentum at the points of intersection between two relatively shifted Fermi circles. Here, we experimentally found and theoretically described signatures of electron-hole asymmetric band structure of BLG: since holes are heavier, the tunneling conductance is enhanced at the hole doping due to the higher density of states. Another key feature of BLG that we explore is gap opening in a vertical electric field with a strong polarization of electron wave function at van Hove singularities near the gap edges. This polarization, by shifting electron wave function in one BLG closer to or father from the other BLG, gives rise to asymmetric tunneling resonances in the conductance around charge neutrality points, which result in strong sensitivity of the tunneling current to minor changes of the gate voltages. The observed phenomena are reproduced by our theoretical model taking into account electrostatics of the dual-gated structure, quantum capacitance effects, and self-consistent gap openings in both BLGs.</description>

      <title>AC magnetometry of van der Waals magnets using ultrasensitive Graphene Hall sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probing the dynamical magnetic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials requires sensitive techniques capable of detecting small magnetic fields from nanoscale samples. We demonstrate quantitative AC and DC magnetometry of a ferromagnetic Fe3-xGeTe2 nanoflakes using ultrasensitive graphene Hall sensors. These devices achieve record-low magnetic field detection noise at both cryogenic and room temperature, enabled by hBN encapsulation, low-resistance fluorographene contacts, and a novel fabrication process. We perform quantitative AC susceptibility measurements up to 1 kHz, resolving both real and imaginary components with nanotesla-scale sensitivity and milliradian phase accuracy, the first such measurement in a van der Waals magnet. Our results establish graphene Hall sensors as a powerful and broadly applicable platform for studying magnetic and superconducting phases near the 2D limit.</description>

      <title>Infinite-component $BF$ field theory: Nexus of fracton order, Toeplitz braiding, and non-Hermitian amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the recent study of Toeplitz braiding by Li et al. [Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we introduce \textit{infinite-component} $BF$ (i$BF$) theories by stacking topological $BF$ theories along a fourth ($w$) spatial direction and coupling them in a translationally invariant manner. The i$BF$ framework captures the low-energy physics of 4D fracton topological orders in which both particle and loop excitations exhibit restricted mobility along the stacking direction, and their particle-loop braiding statistics are encoded in asymmetric, integer-valued Toeplitz $K$ matrices. We identify a novel form of particle-loop braiding, termed \textit{Toeplitz braiding}, originating from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of the $K$ matrix. In the thermodynamic limit, nontrivial braiding phases persist even when the particle and loop reside on opposite 3D boundaries, as the boundary ZSMs dominate the nonvanishing off-diagonal elements of $K^{-1}$ and govern boundary-driven braiding behavior. Analytical and numerical studies of i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-type Toeplitz $K$ matrices confirm the correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz braiding. The i$BF$ construction thus forges a bridge between strongly correlated topological field theory and noninteracting non-Hermitian physics, where ZSMs underlie the non-Hermitian amplification effect. Possible extensions include 3-loop and Borromean-rings Toeplitz braiding induced by twisted topological terms, generalized entanglement renormalization, and foliation structures within i$BF$ theories. An intriguing analogy to the scenario of parallel universes is also briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>A scalable kinetic Monte Carlo platform enabling comprehensive simulations of charge transport dynamics in polymer-based memristive systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymer-assisted ion transport underpins both energy storage technologies and emerging neuromorphic computing devices. Efficient modeling of ion migration is essential for understanding the performance of batteries and memristors, but it remains challenging because of the interplay of drift, diffusion, and electrostatic interactions, as well as the limitations of continuum and molecular dynamics approaches. Addressing these challenges is particularly relevant in the context of the climate and energy crisis, where high-performance, low-carbon technologies require optimized ion-conducting materials and devices. Here, we introduce a scalable and flexible stochastic simulation platform that uses Markov chain Monte Carlo methodology to model ion migration in solid-state systems. The platform employs a vectorized, rail-based representation of device geometry, enabling rapid simulation of lateral ion transport and space-charge effects while preserving the stochastic nature of hopping events. It accommodates a wide range of material systems and can integrate experimental input parameters without code modification. We also provide an implementation of the model that takes advantage of highly energy-efficient GPUs, improving the performance and reducing the carbon footprint of the simulations. Validation using polymer-based memristive devices demonstrates the simulator's ability to capture key behaviors, including relaxation decay, current-voltage hysteresis, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, and learning/forgetting rates. By balancing computational efficiency with mesoscale physical considerations, the platform provides a versatile tool for exploring ion-driven phenomena in energy storage and neuromorphic devices, supporting exploratory research.</description>

      <title>Interferometric Braiding of Anyons in Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent control and braiding of anyons remain central challenges in realizing topologically protected quantum operations. We propose a Ramsey interferometry protocol to directly access the geometric phases associated with anyons in fractional Chern insulators. Our approach employs impurities with individually addressable internal states that bind to the anyons, allowing their adiabatic motion and exchange under full spatial control. By combining Ramsey and spin-echo sequences, the protocol isolates the Aharonov-Bohm and exchange contributions to the total geometric phase, providing an unambiguous probe of anyonic statistics. Our scheme can potentially be implemented in cold-atom quantum simulators as well as in van der Waals heterostructures. Complementary finite-size simulations in non-interacting Chern insulators quantify the system sizes required to faithfully extract geometric phases, highlighting the role of edge effects. Our results establish impurity-based interferometry as a feasible route toward direct anyon braiding experiments in quantum simulators and lay the groundwork for future explorations of non-Abelian braiding and topological quantum control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realization of electron-spin resonance at the single-atom level using scanning tunneling microscopy has opened new avenues for coherent quantum sensing and quantum state manipulation at the ultimate size limit. This allows to build many-body Hamiltonians and the study of their complex physical behavior. Recently, a novel qubit platform has emerged from this field, raising questions about the driving mechanism from single-atom magnets. In this work, we demonstrate how single-atom magnets can be used to drive a nearby single spin qubit efficiently. We show that the modulation of exchange coupling is the primary driving force, which successfully reproduces Rabi rates in the tens of MHz range, consistent with experimental data, while also addressing critical aspects related to the optimization of experimental parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01077v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large power consumption of silicon CMOS electronics is a challenge in very-large-scale integrated circuits and a major roadblock to fault-tolerant quantum computation. Matching the power dissipation of Si-MOSFETs to the thermal budget at deep cryogenic temperatures, below 1 K, requires switching performance beyond levels facilitated by currently available CMOS technologies. We have manufactured fully depleted silicon-on-insulator MOSFETs tailored for overcoming the power dissipation barrier towards sub-1 K applications. With these cryo-optimized transistors we achieve a major milestone of reaching subthreshold swing of 0.3 mV/dec at 420 mK, thereby enabling very-large-scale integration of cryo-CMOS electronics for ultra-low temperature applications.</description>

Abstract: It has been understood in the past a decade or two that the dynamics of spin or magnetization in ultrafast regime necessarily involves inertial term that reflects the reluctance to follow abrupt or sudden change in the spin or magnetization orientation. The role of inertial spin dynamics in governing the motion of Skyrmion, a topological spin texture, is elucidated. Using nonequilibrium Green's function Keldysh formalism, an equation of motion is derived in terms of collective coordinates for a Skyrmion coupled via a ``minimal coupling'' to a bath of harmonic oscillators of frequency $\omega$, modeling an optical phonon-like bosonic bath with its nearly-flat energy spectrum, and a coupling to the phonon energy density that dominates under resonance condition at the optical phonon frequency. A deterministic and non-dissipative dynamics equation of motion is obtained with an explicit mass term for the Skyrmion emerging due to the coupling, even within rigid Skyrmion picture. This results in a cyclotronic motion of Skyrmion, with a frequency that can go ultrafast, depending on that of the oscillator. Controlling the oscillator frequency can therefore guide the Skyrmion dynamics. Our theory bridges inertial dynamics and topology in magnetism and opens a pathway to ultrafast control of topological spin textures.</description>

      <title>Deep-lying semi-Dirac fermions in hexagonal close-packed cadmium</title>

Abstract: Semi-Dirac fermions are massless in one direction and massive in the perpendicular directions. Such quasiparticles have been proposed in various contexts in condensed matter. Using first principles calculations, we identify a pair of semi-Dirac bands anti-crossing at $-3$ eV below the Fermi level in the electronic structure of hexagonal close-packed cadmium. The linear out-of-plane dispersion is kept up to the Fermi level. We demonstrate that the dichotomy between the linear and quadratic dispersions is driven by an orientation-sensitive hybridization between the $s$ and $p_z$ orbitals. The upper semi-Dirac band produces a lens-shaped nonellipsoidal Fermi sheet whose cross-section area has a $k$-dependence that is in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured period of Sondheimer oscillations.</description>

      <title>Scattering States in One-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Baths</title>

Abstract: A single quantum emitter coupled to a structured non-Hermitian environment shows anomalous bound states and real-time dynamics without Hermitian counterparts, as shown in [Gong et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 223601 (2022)]. In this work, we establish a general approach for studying the scattering states of a single quantum emitter coupled to one-dimensional non-Hermitian single-band baths. We formally solve the exact eigenvalue equation for all the scattering states defined on finite periodic lattices. In the thermodynamic limit, the formal solution reduces to the celebrated Lippmann-Schwinger equation for generic baths. In this case, we find that the scattering states are no longer linear superpositions of plane waves in general, unlike those in Hermitian systems; Instead, the wave functions exhibit a large, yet finite localization length proportional to the lattice size. Furthermore, we show and discuss the cases where the Lippmann-Schwinger equation breaks down. We find the analytical solutions for the Hatano-Nelson and unidirectional next-to-nearest-neighbor baths in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>Halogen-Terminated Carbon Atomic Wires by Laser Ablation in Halogenated Organic Solvents: Synthesis and Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first synthesis of halogenated organic molecules via pulsed laser ablation in liquid, specifically halopolyynes, i.e., carbon atomic wires terminated by halogen atoms, and the first Raman characterization of long halogenated wires. Using dichloromethane and a dibromomethane-containing solution, we produced a polydisperse mixtures of monohalogeanted (HC$_n$X) and dihalogenated (XC$_n$X) polyynes (X=Cl, Br; n=6-20). High-performance liquid chromatography enabled us to separate and analyze these compounds, while chemical derivatization and mass spectroscopy confirmed their molecular structures. Their formation mechanism involves carbon chain polymerization and termination by halogen atoms from atomized solvent molecules during the plasma phase. UV-Vis absorption and synchrotron-based UV Resonance Raman spectroscopy revealed that halogen terminations act as weak electron donors, slightly affecting conjugation, bond length alternation, and moderately redshifting vibronic absorption and vibrational modes. Resonance Raman spectra show selective overtone enhancement, an emerging signature behavior of carbyne-like systems. Vibrational anharmonicity measurements confirm that halopolyynes follow the universal anharmonicity law previously proposed for carbyne-like materials, solidifying their classification within this family. These findings not only expand the synthetic toolbox for carbon atomic wires but also establish halopolyynes as a versatile platform for tailoring wire terminations and developing novel materials with tunable electronic and optical properties.</description>

      <title>Initial-State Typicality in Quantum Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relaxation in open quantum systems is fundamental to quantum science and technologies. Yet, the influence of the initial state on relaxation remains a central, largely unanswered question. Here, by systematically characterizing the relaxation behavior of generic initial states, we uncover a typicality phenomenon in high-dimensional open quantum systems: relaxation becomes nearly initial-state-independent as system size increases under verifiable conditions. Crucially, we prove this typicality for thermalization processes above a size-independent temperature. Our findings extend the typicality to open quantum dynamics, in turn identifying a class of systems where two widely used quantities -- the Liouvillian gap and the maximal relaxation time -- merit re-examination. We formalize this with two new concepts: the 'typical strong Mpemba effect' and the 'typical relaxation time'. Beyond these conceptual advances, our results provide practical implications: a scalable route to accelerating relaxation and a typical mixing-time benchmark that complements conventional worst-case metrics for quantum simulations and state preparation.</description>
