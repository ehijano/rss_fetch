      <title>A Class of Freely Complemented von Neumann Subalgebras of $L\mathbb{F}_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$ are tracial abelian von Neumann algebras for $2\leq n \leq \infty$ and $M = A_1 * \cdots * A_n$ is their free product, then any subalgebra $A \subset M$ of the form $A = \sum_{i=1}^n u_i A_i p_i u_i^*$, for some projections $p_i \in A_i$ and unitaries $u_i \in U(M)$, for $1 \leq i \leq n$, such that $\sum_i u_i p_i u_i^* = 1$, is freely complemented (FC) in $M$. Moreover, if $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$ are purely non-separable abelian, and $M = A_1 * \cdots * A_n$, then any purely non-separable singular MASA in $M$ is FC. We also show that any of the known maximal amenable MASAs $A\subset L\mathbb{F}_n$ (notably the radial MASA), satisfies Popa's weak FC conjecture, i.e., there exist Haar unitaries $u\in L\mathbb{F}_n$ that are free independent to $A$.</description>

      <title>$C^*$-simplicity and boundary actions of discrete quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate several quantum group dynamical notions for the purpose of studying $C^*$-simplicity of discrete quantum groups via the theory of boundary actions. In particular we define a quantum analogue of Powers' Averaging Property (PAP) and a quantum analogue of strongly faithful actions. We show that our quantum PAP implies $C^*$-simplicity and the uniqueness of $\sigma$-KMS states, and that the existence of a strongly $C^*$-faithful quantum boundary action also implies $C^*$-simplicity and, in the unimodular case, the quantum PAP. We illustrate these results in the case of the unitary free quantum groups $\mathbb{F} U_F$ by showing that they satisfy the quantum PAP and that they act strongly $C^*$-faithfully on their quantum Gromov boundary. Moreover we prove that this particular action of $\mathbb{F} U_F$ is a quantum boundary action.</description>

      <title>Shift equivalence relations through the lens of C*-correspondences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the study of shift equivalence relations from the perspective of C*-bimodule theory. We study emerging shift equivalence relations following work of the second-named author with Carlsen and Eilers, both in terms of adjacency matrices and in terms of their C*-correspondences, and orient them when possible. In particular, we show that if two regular C*-correspondences are strong shift equivalent, then the intermediary C*-correspondences realizing the equivalence may be chosen to be regular. This result provides the final missing piece in answering a question of Muhly, Pask and Tomforde, and is used to confirm a conjecture of Kakariadis and Katsoulis on shift equivalence of C*-correspondences.</description>

      <title>Divided Differences and Multivariate Holomorphic Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the multivariate holomorphic functional calculus for tuples in a commutative Banach algebra and establish a simple "na\"ive" extension to commuting tuples in a general Banach algebra. The approach is na\"ive in the sense that the na\"ively defined joint spectrum maybe too big. The advantage of the approach is that the functional calculus then is given by a simple concrete formula from which all its continuity properties can easily be derived.
  We apply this framework to multivariate functions arising as divided differences of a univariate function. This provides a rich set of examples to which our na\"ive calculus applies. Foremost, we offer a natural and straightforward proof of the Connes-Moscovici Rearrangement Lemma in the context of the multivariate holomorphic functional calculus. Secondly, we show that the Daletski-Krein type noncommutative Taylor expansion is a natural consequence of our calculus. Also Magnus' Theorem which gives a nonlinear differential equation for the $\log$ of the solutions to a linear matrix ODE follows naturally and easily from our calculus. Finally, we collect various combinatorial related formulas.</description>

      <title>Spectrum occupies pseudospectrum for random matrices with diagonal deformation and variance profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17573v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $n\times n$ non-Hermitian random matrices with independent entries and a variance profile, as well as an additive deterministic diagonal deformation. We show that their empirical eigenvalue distribution converges to a limiting density as $n$ tends to infinity and that the support of this density in the complex plane exactly coincides with the $\varepsilon$-pseudospectrum in the consecutive limits $n \to \infty$ and $\varepsilon \to 0$. The limiting spectral measure is identified as the Brown measure of a deformed operator-valued circular element with the help of [arXiv:2409.15405].</description>

      <title>Brown measures of deformed $L^\infty$-valued circular elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Brown measure of $a+\mathfrak{c}$, where $a$ lies in a commutative tracial von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{B}$ and $\mathfrak{c}$ is a $\cal{B}$-valued circular element. Under certain regularity conditions on $a$ and the covariance of $\mathfrak{c}$ this Brown measure has a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure on the complex plane which is real analytic apart from jump discontinuities at the boundary of its support. With the exception of finitely many singularities this one-dimensional spectral edge is real analytic. We provide a full description of all possible edge singularities as well as all points in the interior, where the density vanishes. The edge singularities are classified in terms of their local edge shape while internal zeros of the density are classified in terms of the shape of the density locally around these points. We also show that each of these countably infinitely many singularity types occurs for an appropriate choice of $a$ when $\mathfrak{c}$ is a standard circular element. The Brown measure of $a+\mathfrak{c}$ arises as the empirical spectral distribution of a diagonally deformed non-Hermitian random matrix with independent entries when its dimension tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Invariant subspaces for finite index shifts in Hardy spaces and the invariant subspace problem for finite defect operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb H$ be the finite direct sums of $H^2(\mathbb D)$. In this paper, we give a characterization of the closed subspaces of $\mathbb H$ which are invariant under the shift, thus obtaining a concrete Beurling-type theorem for the finite index shift. This characterization presents any such a subspace as the finite intersection, up to an inner function, of pre-images of a closed shift-invariant subspace of $H^2(\mathbb D)$ under ``determinantal operators'' from $\mathbb H$ to $H^2(\mathbb D)$, that is, continuous linear operators which intertwine the shifts and appear as determinants of matrices with entries given by bounded holomorphic functions. With simple algebraic manipulations we provide a direct proof that every invariant closed subspace of codimension at least two sits into a non-trivial closed invariant subspace. As a consequence every bounded linear operator with finite defect has a nontrivial closed invariant subspace.</description>
