      <title>Study on the efficiency droop in high-quality GaN material under high photoexcitation intensity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: III-V nitride semiconductors, represented by GaN, have attracted significant research attention. Driven by the growing interest in smart micro-displays, there is a strong desire to achieve enhanced light output from even smaller light-emitting diode (LED) chips. However, the most perplexing phenomenon and the most significant challenge in the study of emission properties under high-injection conditions in GaN has always been efficiency droop for decades, where LEDs exhibit a substantial loss in efficiency at high driving currents. In this paper, we present our study on the intrinsic emission properties of high-quality GaN material based on the density of states and the principles of momentum conservation. Our theoretical calculations reveal a momentum distribution mismatch between the non-equilibrium excess electrons and holes, which becomes more significant as the carrier concentration increases. Our excitation-dependent photoluminescence measurements conducted at 6 K exhibited a clear droop for all exciton recombinations, but droop-free for phonon-assisted recombination due to phonons compensating for the momentum mismatch. These findings indicate that the momentum distribution mismatch between the non-equilibrium excess electrons and holes is one of the intrinsic causes of the efficiency droop, which originates from the intrinsic band properties of GaN. These results suggest that proper active region design aimed at reducing this mismatch will contribute to the development of ultra-highly efficient lighting devices in the future.</description>

      <title>Architecture for coherent dual-comb spectroscopy and low-noise photonic microwave generation using mechanically actuated soliton microcombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative Kerr soliton microcombs have inspired various intriguing applications such as spectroscopy, ranging, telecommunication, and high purity microwave generation. Mechanically actuated soliton microcombs provide enhanced controllability and flexibility for Kerr solitons, thus enabling technological progress to be made on such practical applications. Here, we present architectures for coherent dual-comb techniques and ultralow-noise microwave generation by exploiting the mechanical actuation of ultrahigh-Q crystalline microresonators. By unifying a pump laser, we demonstrate highly coherent dual-soliton combs using distinct resonators with slightly different repetition rates. We also report significant phase noise reduction achieved by directly generating Kerr solitons from a sub-Hz linewidth ultrastable laser. This study paves the way for further advancements in a wide variety of applications based on Kerr soliton microcombs.</description>

      <title>Analytical model of metasurfaces comprising meta-atoms with anisotropic polarizabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general analytical approach to the study of electromagnetic resonances of metasurfaces consisting of meta-atoms with anisotropic electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities and irradiated with obliquely incident light is developed in the direct dipole-moment representation. The presented approach allows us to clearly trace and explain the features of the electromagnetic coupling between electric and magnetic dipole moments in the metasurface and to identify its role in the formation of optical resonances. For these purposes, the dependence of the dipole lattice sums on the angle of illumination is also presented. Expressions for the transmittance and reflectivity corresponding to the specular reflectance are presented with explicit inclusion of the dipole moments of particles in the array, which allows using these expressions for multipole analysis of purely numerical results concerning the optical response of metasurfaces. The developed analytical method is tested to characterize the spectral resonances of dielectric metasurfaces composed of rectangular silicon nanoprisms. In addition, we discuss the relationship and similarity between the results of coupled dipole and coupled dipole-quadrupole methods. Our analytical representation of electromagnetic dipole coupling is an insightful and fast method for the characterization of collective resonances in metasurfaces under illumination at oblique incidence. It could be especially useful for designing planar nanophotonic devices consisting of arbitrary-shaped building blocks and operating under special irradiation conditions.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected Q-switching for a pair of the Exceptional points in an optical microcavity laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of topologically protected systems is crucial for achieving robustness against noise, with significant applications in fields such as topological quantum matter and quantum computation. Exceptional points (\textsf{EP}s) in an optical microcavity laser, inherent to non-Hermitian systems, are pivotal in realizing these systems due to their nontrivial topological structures. Encircling \textsf{EP}s enables unique phenomena, including asymmetric mode switching and braid. Here, we demonstrate that topologically protected mode switching can be achieved in a two-level system without requiring non-adiabatic transitions and chiral behavior, leveraging braid isotopy. Moreover, a pair of \textsf{EP}s exhibiting super-radiance and sub-radiance enables both topologically protected mode switching and Q-switching. These results deepen our understanding of \textsf{EP} physics and present new opportunities for advanced applications in laser Q-switching.</description>

      <title>Enhanced optical performance of GaN Micro-light-emitting diodes with a single porous layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-efficiency micro-light-emitting diodes (Micro-LEDs) are key devices for next-generation display technology. However, when the mesa size is reduced to around tens of micrometers or less, the luminous efficiency is constrained by the "efficiency-on-size effect". This work details the fabrication of gallium nitride (GaN) based Micro-LEDs with various mesa shapes and a single porous layer under the active region. A modified green LED epitaxial structure with different doped n-GaN layers combined with electrochemical etching created the porous layer. The strong light confinement achieved by the porous layer and the polygonal mesa greatly enhances spontaneous emission. The luminous intensity of the Micro-LEDs with the porous layer is approximately 22 times greater than those Micro-LEDs without the porous layer. A significant reduction in minimum full width at half maximum (FWHM) was observed in polygonal devices, suggesting a change in the luminescence mechanism. The influence of varying device geometry on emission performance was investigated. Experimental results reveal that, unlike circular porous Micro-LEDs, square and hexagonal porous Micro-LEDs exhibit more pronounced resonant emission, which provides a new technological approach for the further development of high-performance Micro-LEDs and lasers.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic photonic link using an extended-InGaAs photodiode and short pulse illumination towards high-fidelity drive of superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate short pulse illumination of a high-speed extended-InGaAs photodiode at cryogenic temperatures towards its use in control and readout of superconducting qubits. First, we demonstrate high detector responsivity at 1550 nm illumination at 20 mK, a wavelength band unavailable to cryogenic standard InGaAs detectors due to the temperature-dependent bandgap shift. Second, we demonstrate an improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the shot noise limit for cryogenic short optical pulse detection when compared to conventional modulated continuous-wave laser detection. At 40 uA of photocurrent and a detector temperature of 4 K, short pulse detection yields an SNR improvement of 20 dB and 3 dB for phase and amplitude quadratures, respectively. Lastly, we discuss how short pulse detection offers a path for signal multiplexing, with a demonstration of simultaneous production of microwave pulses at two different carrier frequencies. Together, these advancements establish a path towards low noise and power efficient multiplexed photonic links for quantum computing with a large number of superconducting qubits.</description>

      <title>Discovery of ST2 centers in natural and CVD diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ST2 center is an optically addressable point defect in diamond that facilitates spin initialization and readout. However, while this study presents the discovery of ST2 centers first observed in a natural diamond and provides a reliable technique for artificially creating them, its chemical structure remains unknown. To assess the potential of ST2, we map out its basic optical characteristics, reveal its electronic level structure, and quantify the intrinsic transition rates. Furthermore, we investigate its response to microwaves, static magnetic fields, and the polarization of excitation laser light, revealing twelve inequivalent orientations of the ST2 center. Simultaneous exposure to microwaves and static magnetic fields also reveals an exceptionally wide acceptance angle for sensing strong magnetic fields, unlike the well-established NV center, which is sensitive only within a narrow cone aligned with its symmetry axis. This finding establishes the ST2 center as a highly promising candidate for nanoscale quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Doped and structured silica optical fibres for fibre laser sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Specialty optical fibres, usually the silica-based ones doped with rare-earth ions, have been heart of fibre amplifiers and lasers spread thanks to work of team of Sir David N. Payne started in 1980-ies of 20th century. Wavelength of their emission depends on used rare earth, on glass matrix in which the rare earths are incorporated, on fibre structure in macro, micro and nano scale, and fibre laser arrangement. Usually, fibre lasers are operated at single wavelength. A typical example is an erbium fibre laser (erbium ions in modified silica glass) operating around 1550 nm or ytterbium fibre laser (ytterbium ions in modified silica glass) operating around 1060 nm. When erbium and ytterbium ions together are randomly distributed in a silica glass matrix and pumped at absorption band of ytterbium, laser emission is typically obtained only at 1550 nm (emission of erbium) thanks to energy transfer from ytterbium to erbium ions, supported by modification of silica glass matrix with phosphorous pentoxide. However, when erbium and ytterbium ions are specifically structured in micro or nano scale in the fibre core it is possible to obtain dual-wavelength laser operation with controlled output parameters. Such dual-wavelength operation with controlled output at 1042 nm and simultaneously at 1550 nm was demonstrated with structured core Er3+ and Yb3+-doped fibre. The proposed approach makes fabrication of active fibres emitting with controlled characteristics at more wavelengths possible.</description>

      <title>Optical analogues of Bloch-Zener oscillations in binary waveguide arrays: wavenumber evolution perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optical analogues of Bloch oscillations and Zener tunneling in binary waveguide arrays (BWAs) with the help of the wavenumber-based approach. We analytically find two very simple laws describing the evolution of the central wavenumbers of beams in BWAs. From these simple laws, we can easily obtain the propagation distances in the analytical form where the beams operate at the Dirac points, and therefore, the Zener tunneling takes place due to the interband transition. We can also easily calculate the distances where beams reach the turning points in their motion. These distances just depend on the strength of the linear potential and the initial wavenumber of input beams. We also show that the nonlinearity of the Kerr type has a detrimental influence on the Bloch-Zener oscillations.</description>

      <title>Talbot effect in binary waveguide arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Talbot effect in binary waveguide arrays (BWAs). Like in conventional waveguide arrays, the Talbot effect can only occur if the input signal has the period equal to $N$ = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 in the transverse direction. However, unlike in conventional waveguide arrays, for observation of the Talbot effect with $N$ = 3, 4, and 6 in BWAs, parameter $\sigma$ representing half of the propagation constant mismatch between two adjacent waveguides must have some specific values. Meanwhile, for observation of the Talbot effect with $N$ = 1 and 2 in BWAs, $\sigma$ can get any real values. We also analytically derive the Talbot distance along the longitudinal axis of BWAs where the recurrence of the input signal happens both in phase and intensity. Moreover, we also analytically find the intensity period where the field intensity is repeated during propagation. In some cases, the intensity period is equal to half of the Talbot distance, whereas in other cases, these two periods are just equal to each other. All these new analytical results are perfectly confirmed by beam propagation simulations in BWAs.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous tantala photonic integrated circuits for sub-micron wavelength applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic and trapped-ion systems are the backbone of a new generation of quantum-based positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) technologies. The miniaturization of such quantum systems offers tremendous technological advantages, especially the reduction of system size, weight, and power consumption. Yet, this has been limited by the absence of compact, standalone photonic integrated circuits (PICs) at the wavelengths suitable for these instruments. Mobilizing such photonic systems requires development of fully integrated, on-chip, active components at sub-micrometer wavelengths. We demonstrate heterogeneous photonic integrated circuits operating at 980 nm based on wafer-scale bonding of InGaAs quantum well active regions to tantalum pentoxide passive components. This high-yield process provides &gt; 95 % surface area yield and enables integration of &gt; 1300 active components on a 76.2 mm (3 inch) silicon wafer. We present a diverse set of functions, including semiconductor optical amplifiers, Fabry-Perot lasers, and distributed feedback lasers with 43 dB side-mode suppression ratio and &gt; 250 GHz single-mode tuning range. We test the precise wavelength control and system level functionality of the on-chip lasers by pumping optical parametric oscillation processes in microring resonators fabricated on the same platform, generating short-wavelength signals at 778 nm and 752 nm. These results provide a pathway to realize fully functional integrated photonic engines for operation of compact quantum sensors based on atomic and trapped-ion systems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Opto-Electrical Excitation of Spin-Transfer Torque Nano-Oscillators for Advanced Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, inspired by the brain's parallel and energy-efficient processing, offers a transformative approach to artificial intelligence. In this study, we fabricated optimized spin-transfer torque nano-oscillators (STNOs) and investigated their dynamic behaviors using a hybrid excitation scheme combining AC laser illumination and DC bias currents. Laser-induced thermal gradients generate pulsed thermoelectric voltages ($V_{\text{AC}}$) via the Tunnel Magneto-Seebeck (TMS) effect, while the addition of bias currents enhances this response, producing both $V_{\text{AC}}$ and a DC component ($V_{\text{DC}}$). Magnetic field sweeps reveal distinct switching between parallel (P) and antiparallel (AP) magnetization states in both voltage components, supporting multistate memory applications. Millivolt-range thermovoltage signals in open-circuit conditions demonstrate CMOS compatibility, enabling simplified, scalable neuromorphic systems. Under biased conditions, enhanced thermovoltage outputs exhibit intriguing phenomena, including spikes correlated with Barkhausen jumps and double-switching behavior, offering insights into magnetization dynamics and vortex transitions. These features resemble neural spiking behavior, suggesting applications in spiking neural networks, reservoir computing, multistate logic, analog computing, and high-resolution sensing. By bridging spintronic phenomena with practical applications, this work provides a versatile platform for next-generation AI technologies and adaptive computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Realization of chiral whispering gallery mode cavities enabled by photonic Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, whispering gallery modes (WGMs) have attracted considerable attention due to their extensive applications in the development of on-chip microcavities, high-sensitivity sensors, and high-performance lasers. Conventional WGMs are achiral under the time-reversal symmetry, and show high sensitivity to defects in optical devices. Here, we introduce topological physics into photonic cavities and demonstrate the realization of chiral WGMs enabled by photonic Chern insulators.

      <title>Non-dispersive graded impedance acoustic lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lenses are typically based on refractive index profiles derived from the geometric approximation of high-frequency waves, yet the critical issue of impedance mismatch is often neglected. Mismatched devices suffer from unwanted reflections and dispersion, which can significantly degrade performance in practical applications. In this work, we propose impedance profiles for lenses to achieve efficient wave transmission while maintaining the desired refractive index and minimizing dispersion effects. A family of impedance profiles is derived from the acoustic wave equation such that the phase velocity is preserved. First, the 1D setting is considered to explain how dispersion occurs inside a lens and at its interfaces. Then, the method is applied to 2D axisymmetric configurations where the impedance mismatch is radially redistributed. These profiles are demonstrated in the acoustic setting of a Luneburg lens, but can be easily extended to more general scenarios such as imaging or cloaking in air and water, where matching the impedance of the background poses significant challenges.</description>

      <title>Non-linear bistability in pulsed optical traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical trapping, also known as optical tweezing or optical levitation, is a technique that uses highly focused laser beams to manipulate micro- and nanoscopic particles. In optical traps driven by high-energy pulses, material non-linearity can result in unusual opto-mechanical effects, such as displaced equilibrium points. However, existing theoretical models of non-linear optical force on small particles consider smooth material dependence on the incident field strength alone, and not the feedback between the particle permittivity and internal field strength, which is, in turn, a function of the permittivity. The hysteresis effects of optical bistability in pulsed optical traps therefore elude existing optical force models. Here, we investigate a bistable optical trap, set up by counter-propagating ultrashort pulses, in which the optical force exerted on a particle depends not only on the field at the particle's current location, but on the particle's historic trajectory in the trap. The developed formalism will be important for designing optical traps and nanoparticle manipulation in pulsed field for various applications, including potentially time crystal demonstrations.</description>

      <title>Gradient polaritonic surface with space-variant switchable light-matter interactions in 2D moire superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polaritons in two-dimensional (2D) materials provide unique opportunities for controlling light at nanoscales. Tailoring these polaritons via gradient polaritonic surfaces with space-variant response can enable versatile light-matter interaction platforms with advanced functionalities. However, experimental progress has been hampered by the optical losses and poor light confinement of conventionally used artificial nanostructures. Here, we demonstrate natural gradient polaritonic surfaces based on superlattices of solitons-localized structural deformations-in a prototypical moire system, twisted bilayer graphene on boron nitride. We demonstrate on-off switching and continuous modulation of local polariton-soliton interactions, which results from marked modifications of topological and conventional soliton states through variation of local strain direction. Furthermore, we reveal the capability of these structures to spatially modify the near-field profile, phase, and propagation direction of polaritons in record-small footprints, enabling generation and electrical switching of directional polaritons. Our findings open up new avenues toward nanoscale manipulation of light-matter interactions and spatial polariton engineering through gradient moire superlattices.</description>

      <title>Oblique rotational axis detection using elliptical optical vortex based on rotational Doppler effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotational Doppler effect (RDE) of structured light carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) has attracted widespread attention for applications in optical sensors and OAM spectrum detection. These studies, however, based on RDE, are mostly focused on the motion parameters of rotating objects; other equally important attitude characteristics, e.g., the tilt angle of the axis of rotation, have rarely been considered. We observed an interesting phenomenon in the experiments: the rotational Doppler spectral distribution varies with the ellipticity of the elliptical optical vortex (EOV) and the tilt angle between the rotational axis and optical axis, which inspired us to wonder if it is possible to detect oblique rotational axis or compensate the rotational Doppler broadening effect induced by oblique incidence by utilizing the EOV. Here, we reveal the RDE quantitative relationship with tilt angle and ellipticity for the first time and report a novel approach for tilt angle measurement. By employing a series of EOV with periodically varying ellipticity to illuminate a rotating object and analyze the time-frequency spectral distribution of scattered light associated with ellipticity and tilt angle, the tilt angle can be acquired accurately based on the specific relationship between the tilt angle and ellipticity of the EOV. Furthermore, the spectrum broadening effect arising from oblique incidence in the actual scenario may be addressed through our scheme. The method may find applications in industrial manufacturing and target attitude measurement, and our results provide new insights for obtaining more information about objects.</description>

      <title>Angular-Controlled GST Phase-Change Double Micro-Ring Resonator for High-Speed Activation Functions in Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the drive toward efficient neuromorphic computing, photonic technologies offer promising solutions for implementing neural functionalities. Here we demonstrate the first all-optical double micro-ring resonator incorporating Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) as a phase-change material to realize precise nonlinear activation functions (NLAF). Our device architecture achieves switching speeds of 0.5 ns through a novel approach to GST integration, where angular positioning of GST segments within the rings enables unprecedented control over optical transmission characteristics. Through systematic investigation of sixteen distinct phase configurations, we identify optimal GST positioning (180 degrees in the first ring, 90 degrees in the second) that achieves ultra-narrow band transmission with 0.47 nm full width at half maximum. Operating at significantly lower temperatures (100 degrees centigrade) than conventional GST implementations, our device maintains high contrast ratios with transmission coefficient modulation from near-zero to 0.85 across a 4 nm spectral window. The dual-ring architecture enables independent optimization of spectral selectivity and switching contrast a capability previously unattainable in single ring designs. These results demonstrate a viable pathway toward efficient neuromorphic photonic systems that can operate at speeds relevant for practical computing applications while maintaining the precision required for neural processing.</description>

      <title>High-Sensitivity Imaging and Modeling of Ultra-Weak Photon Emission in Plants Under Stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-weak photon emission (UPE) is a noninvasive diagnostic tool that effectively reflects the function and health status of plant cells. However, current UPE measurement techniques are limited by resolution and sensitivity, particularly when monitoring different plant species and stress types. This study analyzes the delayed luminescence (DL) properties of Hydrocotyle vulgaris, Arabidopsis leaves, and Ginkgo leaves under both stress and control conditions using an independently developed UPE imaging system. The results showed a significant increase in initial DL intensity and an accelerated oxidative metabolic rate under mechanical injury and oxidative stress. DL decay characteristics were significantly correlated with the plant's physiological state, with stress conditions exhibiting decay curves that closely matched theoretical models. These findings confirm the established correlation between DL and plant stress responses. The high-resolution, low-noise imaging system significantly improves the accuracy of plant physiological state monitoring and provides new insights into the potential of optical signals for non-chemical communication research and agricultural applications. This technology has great potential for monitoring plant growth, assessing environmental stress, and supporting precision agriculture.</description>

      <title>Ytterbium-laser-driven THz generation in thin lithium niobate at 1.9 kW average power in a passive enhancement cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-cycle, high-power, high-repetition-rate THz pulse sources are becoming the cornerstone of several scientific and industrial applications. A promising and versatile method for high-power THz generation is optical rectification in nonlinear crystals pumped by powerful near-infrared ultrafast laser systems. In this context, ytterbium-based laser sources are particularly advantageous in terms of power scalability and technology establishment. However, as the repetition rate increases toward hundreds of MHz, the conversion efficiency typically decreases, as most laser systems do not reach sufficiently high average power to correspondingly enhance the peak power to drive the nonlinear conversion process efficiently. An alternative approach to achieving sufficiently high average power at high repetition rate is based on passive enhancement cavities, which boost the pulse energy of standard watt-level ytterbium lasers by orders of magnitude. We present the first demonstration of optical rectification in a passive enhancement cavity at multi-kW levels, achieved by a 240-fold power enhancement. By irradiating a 50-$\mu$m thin lithium niobate plate with 1.9-kW average power inside the enhancement cavity, we generate milliwatt-level THz pulses with 2-THz bandwidth and 93-MHz repetition rate, mostly limited by the driving pulse duration. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the highest driving average power used for OR. This methodology represents a promising new step towards high-repetition-rate and high average power single-cycle THz sources using widely available multi-watt level Yb lasers.</description>

      <title>Impact of Nitrogen-Vacancy Color Centers on the Optical Kerr Effect in Diamond: A Femtosecond Z-Scan Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores nonlinear optical effects in diamond crystals doped with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, focusing on the optical Kerr effect in the infrared spectral region. By employing the Z-scan technique with 230 fs laser pulses at a wavelength of 1032~nm, we investigate the nonlinear refractive index of high-purity and NV-containing diamond crystals at NV concentrations of 0.3 ppm and 4.5 ppm. The results demonstrate a pronounced anisotropy in the nonlinear refractive index, which exhibits a four-fold rotational symmetry, with its amplitude reduced by the NV concentration. The reduction in non-linear susceptibility is linked to the negative contribution of NV centers, modeled as two-level systems upon a strong, laser field, red-detuned relative to their resonance frequency. These findings provide new insights into the interplay between NV centers and nonlinear optical properties of diamond, offering potential pathways for tunable nonlinear optics applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phonon polaritons are hybrid modes combining lattice dynamics and electromagnetic waves. Their behavior at long wavelengths is effectively described by Huang's equations. Here, we investigate phonon polaritons within 2D materials featuring twisted moir\'{e} structures. The interaction between electromagnetic waves and phonons of varying wavelengths gives rise to rich polaritons with moir\'{e} characteristics. We observe the polariton dividing into multiple branches, akin to coupled oscillators. Through numerical simulations based on realistic lattice models, we confirm the existence of these intriguing modes. A distinctive trait of moir\'{e} polar crystals is their spatially varying near-field response, offering robust signals for the experimental confirmation.</description>

      <title>Observation of nonreciprocal transverse localization of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic-free nonreciprocal optical devices that can prevent backscattering of signals are essential for integrated optical information processing. The achieved nonreciprocal behaviors mostly rely on various dispersive effects in optical media, which give rise to dispersive modulations of the transverse beam profile, such as spatial broadening and discretization, of the incident signals. Such deformation inevitably reduces the matching with subsequent components for information processing. Here we experimentally demonstrate the nonreciprocal transverse localization of light in a moir\'e photonic lattice induced in atomic vapors. When the probe field is set to co- or counter-propagate with the coupling field formed by superposing two identical honeycomb beams in a certain rotation angle, the output pattern can exhibit localized or dispersive behavior. The localization in the forward case is derived from the moir\'e structure, and the nonreciprocal behaviors (in both beam size and transmitted intensity) are introduced by the thermal motion of atoms. The thermal-motion-induced Doppler effect can destroy the coherent condition for electromagnetically induced transparency in the backward case, because of which the probe beam becomes immune to the modulation of the coupling field. The current work provides an approach to control the transverse beam profile in one-way transmission.</description>

      <title>Mie scattering due to tissue structures in the terahertz regime: Experimental and Monte Carlo verification using diffused polarimetric imaging in highly attenuating tissue phantoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Significance: Changes in the structure of tissue occur in many disease processes, such as the boundaries of cancerous tumors and burn injuries. Spectroscopic and polarimetric alterations of terahertz light caused by Mie scattering patterns has the potential to be a diagnostic marker.
  Aim: We present an analysis of Monte Carlo simulation of Mie scattering of polarized terahertz light from cancerous tumor budding, compare the simulation to experimental results obtained in phantom models, and present an analysis of a polarization-sensitive terahertz scan of an ex vivo porcine burn injury.
  Approach: Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we modeled the changes in diffuse intensity and degree of polarization of broadband off-specular terahertz light due to scattering particles in highly attenuating tissue. We extracted the Mueller matrix of the tissue using this model and analyzed the Lu-Chipman product decomposition matrices. We compared this model to experimental data from four phantoms consisting of polypropylene particles of varying sizes embedded in gelatin. Finally, we induced a full-thickness burn injury in ex vivo porcine skin samples and compared experimental data from burned and healthy regions of the tissue.
  Results: Simulation revealed contrast in the Stokes vectors and Mueller Matrix elements for varying scattering particle sizes. Experimental phantom results showed contrast between different sizes of scattering particles in degree of polarization and diffuse intensity in agreement with Monte Carlo simulation results. Finally, we demonstrated a similar diffused imaging signal contrast between burned and healthy regions of ex vivo porcine skin.
  Conclusion: Polarimetric terahertz imaging has the potential to detect structural changes due to biological disease processes.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous evolution of a dense ensemble of optically pumped excitons to the excitonic insulator state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transformations induced by short optical pulses is a mainstream in studies of of dynamics of cooperative electronic states. We present a semi-phenomenological modeling of spacio-temporal effects expected when optical excitons are intricate with the order parameter as it happens e.g. in organic compounds with neutral-ionic ferroelectric phase transitions. A conceptual complication appears here, where both the excitation and the ground syate ordering are built from the intermolecular electronic transfer. To describe both thermodynamic and dynamic effects on the same root, we adopt for the phase transition a view of the Excitonic Insulator - a hypothetical phase of a semiconductor which appears if the exciton energy becomes negative. After the initial pumping pulse, a quasi-condensate of excitons can appear as a macroscopic quantum state which then evolves interacting with other degrees of freedom prone to an instability. The self-trapping of excitons enhances their density which can locally surpass a critical value to trigger the phase transformation. The system is stratified in domains which evolve through dynamical phase transitions and may persist even after the initiating excitons have recombined.</description>

      <title>A metamaterial telescope at millimetre wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a novel telescope composed exclusively of thin, flat optical elements, each being a hot-pressed multi-layered structure combining the properties of a lens, its anti-reflection coating and frequency selection or filtering. We discuss the design process, from fundamental physical metamaterial properties of the single periodic cell structure to the lens concept, which constitutes the building block of the telescope design, and the iterative process that is part of the lens optimization. We provide the results of a laboratory test campaign for different telescope designs based on three-lens arrangements. Beam cuts and focus measurements both on- and off-axis are compared with models showing good agreement. We conclude that a broad-band mm-wave complete telescope system consisting entirely of metamaterial flat lenses has been built and tested, showing comparable performance with conventional state-of-the-art refractive telescopes in the same wavelength region. This new broadband design, highly efficient at frequencies between 90 and 190 GHz, offers multiple advantages. These include a $&gt; 80\%$ weight reduction, reduced issues tied to coating-survivability at cryogenic temperatures caused by differential contraction exacerbated by non-flat surfaces, as well as a reduction in the overall number of components and mechanical mounts.</description>

Abstract: We study optical manifestations of multigap band topology in multiband superconductors with a non-trivial topological Euler class. We introduce a set of lattice models for non-Abelian superconductors with the Euler invariant signified by a non-trivial quantum geometry. We then demonstrate that the topological Bogoliubov excitations realized in these models provide for a characteristic first-order optical response distinct from those of the other known topological superconductors. We find that the spectral distribution of the optical conductivity universally admits a topologically quantized jump and naturally differs from the features induced by the quantum geometry in the non-interacting bands without pairing terms. Further to uncovering observable signatures in first-order optical conductivities, we showcase that the higher-order nonlinear optical responses of the non-Abelian Euler superconductor can result in enhanced steady dc currents that fingerprint the exotic topological invariant. Finally, by employing a diagrammatic approach, we generalize our findings beyond the specific models of Euler superconductors.</description>

      <title>Experimental emulator of pulse dynamics in fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a nonlinear optical platform to emulate a nonlinear \textit{L\'{e}vy waveguide} that supports the pulse propagation governed by a generalized fractional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation (FNLSE). Our approach distinguishes between intra-cavity and extra-cavity regimes, exploring the interplay between the effective fractional group-velocity dispersion (FGVD) and Kerr nonlinearity. In the intra-cavity configuration, we observe stable \textit{fractional solitons} enabled by an engineered combination of the fractional and regular dispersions in the fiber cavity. The soliton pulses exhibit their specific characteristics, \textit{viz.}, "heavy tails" and a "spectral valley" in the temporal and frequency domain, respectively, highlighting the effective nonlocality introduced by FGVD. Further investigation in the extra-cavity regime reveals the generation of spectral valleys with multiple lobes, offering potential applications to the design of high-dimensional data encoding. To elucidate the spectral valleys arising from the interplay of FGVD and nonlinearity, we have developed an innovative "force" model supported by comprehensive numerical analysis. These findings open new avenues for experimental studies of spectral-temporal dynamics in fractional nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Analogue of collectively induced transparency in metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most recently, a brand new optical phenomenon, collectively induced transparency (CIT) has already been proposed in the cavity quantum electrodynamics system, which comes from the coupling between the cavity and ions and the quantum interference of collective ions. In this paper, we propose the CIT in terahertz (THz) metamaterial device by employing the coupling between bright mode and interference of dark modes for the first time. We give the theoretical analysis, analytical calculations and simulations to present the transmission spectrum of CIT metamaterials. Furthermore, we can observe the tendency of CIT's transmission spectrum by experiments which well verify our idea. Ideal CIT metamaterial device can produce a very high Q peak in the middle of transmission spectrum of Electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT), which can be useful for highly sensitive metamaterial sensors, optical switches and photo-memory.</description>

      <title>Effects of resonances and surface texturing on light emission in emerging thin-film devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent developments in thin-film fabrication and processing open up interesting possibilities for both established and emerging optics technologies. There, one of the key questions requiring more complete understanding is by how much one can improve the performance of thin-film devices by utilizing resonance effects and surface texturation. In this work, we report on our recent theoretical investigations around two aspects of this question: (1) how much the overall (=angle and energy-integrated) emission of extremely thin ($\sim10$ nm) layers can be enhanced through cavity effects, and (2) how much resonances affect the emission of moderately thin ($&gt;100$ nm) layers in a typical device interacting with free space (in this case an ultra-thin solar cell). Beginning with topic (1), we find that the total emission of active layers with thicknesses $&lt;50$ nm in particular can be boosted through resonant effects by placing them in a cavity. For topic (2), the results indicate that a radiative transfer approach (i.e., one not accounting for resonant effects) can give very accurate predictions of the total emission of moderately thin layers in a thin-film device, as long as the reflectances of the device's outer boundaries are known, and the emitting layer is not very close to optical elements supporting direct evanescent coupling (such as metal mirrors). Finally, we demonstrate that extending the self-consistent radiative transfer--drift-diffusion approach for diffusive scattering presents an interesting tool to optimize thin-film devices even with textured surfaces.</description>

      <title>Broadband localization of light at the termination of a topological photonic waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localized optical field enhancement enables strong light-matter interactions necessary for efficient manipulation and sensing of light. Specifically, tunable broadband energy localization in nanoscale hotspots offers a wide range of applications in nanophotonics and quantum optics. We experimentally demonstrate a novel principle for the local enhancement of electromagnetic fields, based on strong suppression of backscattering. This is achieved at a designed termination of a topologically non-trivial waveguide that nearly preserves the valley degree of freedom. The symmetry origin of the valley degree of freedom prevents edge states to undergo intervalley scattering at waveguide discontinuities that obey the symmetry of the crystal. Using near-field microscopy, we reveal that this can lead to strong confinement of light at the termination of a topological photonic waveguide, even without breaking time-reversal symmetry. We emphasize the importance of symmetry conservation by comparing different waveguide termination geometries, confirming that the origin of suppressed backscattering lies with the near-conservation of the valley degree of freedom, and show the broad bandwidth of the effect.</description>

      <title>Photoacoustic Iterative Optimization Algorithm with Shape Prior Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00705v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoacoustic imaging (PAI) suffers from inherent limitations that can degrade the quality of reconstructed results, such as noise, artifacts and incomplete data acquisition caused by sparse sampling or partial array detection. In this study, we proposed a new optimization method for both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) PAI reconstruction results, called the regularized iteration method with shape prior. The shape prior is a probability matrix derived from the reconstruction results of multiple sets of random partial array signals in a computational imaging system using any reconstruction algorithm, such as Delay-and-Sum (DAS) and Back-Projection (BP). In the probability matrix, high-probability locations indicate high consistency among multiple reconstruction results at those positions, suggesting a high likelihood of representing the true imaging results. In contrast, low-probability locations indicate higher randomness, leaning more towards noise or artifacts. As a shape prior, this probability matrix guides the iteration and regularization of the entire array signal reconstruction results using the original reconstruction algorithm (the same algorithm for processing random partial array signals). The method takes advantage of the property that the similarity of the object to be imitated is higher than that of noise or artifact in the results reconstructed by multiple sets of random partial array signals of the entire imaging system. The probability matrix is taken as a prerequisite for improving the original reconstruction results, and the optimizer is used to further iterate the imaging results to remove noise and artifacts and improve the imaging fidelity. Especially in the case involving sparse view which brings more artifacts, the effect is remarkable. Simulation and real experiments have both demonstrated the superiority of this method.</description>

Abstract: Reflective ptychography is a promising lensless imaging technique with a wide field of view, offering significant potential for applications in semiconductor manufacturing and detection. However, many semiconductor materials are coated with different layers during processing, which leads to the reflected diffraction light being a coherent superposition of multiple light beams. Traditional phase recovery methods often overlook the multi-layered nature of these materials, resulting in artificial errors and, in some cases, failures in image reconstruction. This limitation has hindered the broader application and adoption of reflection ptychography. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate an innovative interface and spectrum multiplexing ptychographic reflection microscopy. By employing multi-wavelength light as the illumination source, our approach enables the accurate extraction of the wavelength-dependent surface structure imaging and topography mapping of materials in a single experiment. This advancement offers a reliable technique for element-specific detection of semiconductor materials, utilizing tabletop extreme ultraviolet light sources in the future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a systematic approach that enables two robust methods for performing terahertz time-domain spectroscopy in reflection geometry. Using the Kramers-Kronig relations in connection to accurate experimental measurements of the amplitude of the terahertz electric field, we show how the correct phase of the same field can be retrieved, even in the case of partly misaligned measurements. Our technique allows to accurately estimate the optical properties of in principle any material that reflects terahertz radiation. We demonstrate the accuracy of our approach by extracting the complex refractive index of InSb, a material with a strong plasma resonance in the low-terahertz range. Our technique applies to arbitrary incidence angles and polarization states.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit interactions of the twisted random light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The twist phase of random light represents a nontrivial two-point phase, endowing the field with orbital angular momentum. Although the mutual transition of the spin and orbit angular momenta of coherent light has been revealed, the relationship between spin-orbital angular momentum interaction (SOI) and the twist phase has remained unexplored. This is because of the stochastic nature of random light, making it challenging to explore the properties of angular momenta that rely on well-defined spatial and polarization structures. This study addresses this gap from the view of the asymmetry coherent-mode decomposition for twisted random light to gain insight into the intricate interplay between the twist phase and the SOI within a tight focusing system. Our findings reveal that spin and orbit angular momentum transitions occur in the tightly focused twisted random light beam, yielding the transverse spin density controlled by the twist phase. This effect becomes more pronounced when the spin of random light and the chirality of the twist phase are the same. Our work may find significant applications in optical sensing, metrology, and quantum optics.</description>

      <title>Tutorial of Fourier Transform for ultrafast optics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This tutorial is designed for individuals who are new to the field of ultrafast optics. It was written in response to the apparent lack of comprehensive introductions to the basic Fourier Transform, extending beyond the flat-phase description. Additionally, there is a need for complete derivations of several relations involving the Fourier Transform, maintaining its most general formulation. This approach avoids the arbitrary selection of Fourier-Transform constants and ensures a complete understanding. It shows the importance of having Fourier-Transform constants as parameters, which I would like to advocate people to do. Most important of all, I've seen misuse of Fourier Transform over my years of discussion in the lab and from others' questions since I shared my code publicly on Github. Surprisingly, since people check the correctness of numerical implementation only by seeing if the simulation result is smooth and if it duplicates the ``overall physics,'' this seems to be a widespread problem from my perspective, which can be solved by a simple tutorial. This is why I hope that this tutorial can help people understand more about the Fourier Transform, especially in the context of ultrafast optics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04550v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement is fundamental to quantum information science and technology, yet controlling and manipulating entanglement -- so-called entanglement engineering -- for arbitrary quantum systems remains a formidable challenge. There are two difficulties: the fragility of quantum entanglement and its experimental characterization. We develop a model-free deep reinforcement-learning (RL) approach to entanglement engineering, in which feedback control together with weak continuous measurement and partial state observation is exploited to generate and maintain desired entanglement. We employ quantum optomechanical systems with linear or nonlinear photon-phonon interactions to demonstrate the workings of our machine-learning-based entanglement engineering protocol. In particular, the RL agent sequentially interacts with one or multiple parallel quantum optomechanical environments, collects trajectories, and updates the policy to maximize the accumulated reward to create and stabilize quantum entanglement over an arbitrary amount of time. The machine-learning-based model-free control principle is applicable to the entanglement engineering of experimental quantum systems in general.</description>

      <title>Design, Construction, and Test of Compact, Distributed-Charge, X-Band Accelerator Systems that Enable Image-Guided, VHEE FLASH Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The design and optimization of laser-Compton x-ray systems based on compact distributed charge accelerator structures can enable micron-scale imaging of disease and the concomitant production of beams of Very High Energy Electrons (VHEEs) capable of producing FLASH-relevant dose rates. The physics of laser-Compton x-ray scattering ensures that the scattered x-rays follow exactly the trajectory of the incident electrons, thus providing a route to image-guided, VHEE FLASH radiotherapy. The keys to a compact architecture capable of producing both laser-Compton x-rays and VHEEs are the use of X-band RF accelerator structures which have been demonstrated to operate with over 100 MeV/m acceleration gradients. The operation of these structures in a distributed charge mode in which each radiofrequency (RF) cycle of the drive RF pulse is filled with a low-charge, high-brightness electron bunch is enabled by the illumination of a high-brightness photogun with a train of UV laser pulses synchronized to the frequency of the underlying accelerator system. The UV pulse trains are created by a patented pulse synthesis approach which utilizes the RF clock of the accelerator to phase and amplitude modulate a narrow band continuous wave (CW) seed laser. In this way it is possible to produce up to 10 $\mu$A of average beam current from the accelerator. Such high current from a compact accelerator enables production of sufficient x-rays via laser-Compton scattering for clinical imaging and does so from a machine of "clinical" footprint. At the same time, the production of 1000 or greater individual micro-bunches per RF pulse enables &gt; 10 nC of charge to be produced in a macrobunch of &lt; 100 ns. The design, construction, and test of the 100-MeV class prototype system in Irvine, CA is also presented.</description>
