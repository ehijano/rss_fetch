      <title>Linking Dispersion and Stirring in Randomly Braiding Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many random flows, including 2D unsteady and stagnation-free 3D steady flows, exhibit non-trivial braiding of pathlines as they evolve in time or space. We show that these random flows belong to a pathline braiding \emph{universality class} that quantitatively links dispersion and chaotic stirring, meaning that the Lyapunov exponent can be estimated from the purely advective transverse dispersivity. We verify this quantitative link for both unsteady 2D and steady 3D random flows. This result uncovers a deep connection between transport and mixing over a broad class of random flows.</description>

      <title>Is Chaotic Advection Inherent to Heterogeneous Darcy Flow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At all scales, porous materials stir interstitial fluids as they are advected, leading to complex distributions of matter and energy. Of particular interest is whether porous media naturally induce chaotic advection at the Darcy scale, as these stirring kinematics profoundly impact basic processes such as solute transport and mixing, colloid transport and deposition and chemical, geochemical and biological reactivity. While many studies report complex transport phenomena characteristic of chaotic advection in heterogeneous Darcy flow, it has also been shown that chaotic dynamics are prohibited in a large class of Darcy flows. In this study we rigorously establish that chaotic advection is inherent to steady 3D Darcy flow in all realistic models of heterogeneous porous media. Anisotropic and heterogenous 3D hydraulic conductivity fields generate non-trivial braiding of stream-lines, leading to both chaotic advection and (purely advective) transverse dispersion. We establish that steady 3D Darcy flow has the same topology as unsteady 2D flow, and so use braid theory to establish a quantitative link between transverse dispersivity and Lyapunov exponent in heterogeneous Darcy flow. We show that chaotic advection and transverse dispersion occur in both anisotropic weakly heterogeneous and in heterogeneous weakly anisotropic conductivity fields, and that the quantitative link between these phenomena persists across a broad range of conductivity anisotropy and heterogeneity. The ubiquity of macroscopic chaotic advection has profound implications for the myriad of processes hosted in heterogeneous porous media and calls for a re-evaluation of transport and reaction methods in these systems.</description>

      <title>A Unified Theory for Chaotic Mixing in Porous Media: from Pore Networks to Granular Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed the central role of chaotic stretching and folding at the pore scale in controlling mixing within porous media, whether the solid phase is discrete (as in granular and packed media) or continuous (as in vascular networks and open porous structures). Despite its widespread occurrence, a unified theory of chaotic mixing across these diverse systems remains to be developed. Furthermore, previous studies have focused on fluid stretching mechanisms but the folding mechanisms are largely unknown. We address these shortcomings by presenting a unified theory of mixing in porous media. We thus show that fluid stretching and folding (SF) arise through the same fundamental kinematics driven by the topological complexity of the medium. We find that mixing in continuous porous media manifests as discontinuous mixing through a combination of SF and cutting and shuffling (CS) actions, but the rate of mixing is governed by SF only. Conversely, discrete porous media involves SF motions only. We unify these diverse systems and mechanisms by showing that continuous media represents an analog of discrete media with finite-sized grain contacts. This unified theory provides insights into the generation of pore-scale chaotic mixing and points to design of novel porous architectures with tuneable mixing and transport properties.</description>

      <title>Dual Euler--Poincar\'e/Lie--Poisson formulation of subinertial stratified thermal ocean flow with identification of Casimirs as Noether quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the geometric structure of a quasigeostrophic approximation to a recently introduced reduced-gravity thermal rotating shallow-water model that accounts for stratification. Specifically, it considers a low-frequency approximation of a model for flow above the ocean thermocline, governed by primitive equations with buoyancy variations in both horizontal and vertical directions. Like the thermal model, the stratified variant generates circulation patterns reminiscent of submesoscale instabilities visible in satellite images. An improvement is its ability to model mixed-layer restratification due to baroclinic instability.
  The primary contribution of this paper is to demonstrate that the model is derived from an Euler--Poincar\'e variational principle, culminating in a Kelvin--Noether theorem, previously established solely for the primitive-equation parent model. The model's Lie--Poisson Hamiltonian structure, earlier obtained through direct calculation, is shown to result from a Legendre transform with the associated geometry elucidated by identifying the relevant momentum map.
  Another significant contribution of this paper is the identification of the Casimirs of the Lie--Poisson system, including a newly found weaker Casimir family forming the kernel of the Lie--Poisson bracket, which results in potential vorticity evolution independent of buoyancy details as it advects under the flow. These conservation laws related to particle relabeling symmetry are explicitly linked to Noether quantities from the Euler--Poincar\'e principle when variations are not constrained to vanish at integration endpoints.
  The dual Euler--Poincar\'e/Lie--Poisson formalism provides a unified framework for describing quasigeostrophic reduced-gravity stratified thermal flow, mirroring the approach used in the primitive-equation setting.</description>

      <title>GLONET: Mercator's End-to-End Neural Forecasting System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate ocean forecasting is crucial in different areas ranging from science to decision making. Recent advancements in data-driven models have shown significant promise, particularly in weather forecasting community, but yet no data-driven approaches have matched the accuracy and the scalability of traditional global ocean forecasting systems that rely on physics-driven numerical models and can be very computationally expensive, depending on their spatial resolution or complexity. Here, we introduce GLONET, a global ocean neural network-based forecasting system, developed by Mercator Ocean International. GLONET is trained on the global Mercator Ocean physical reanalysis GLORYS12 to integrate physics-based principles through neural operators and networks, which dynamically capture local-global interactions within a unified, scalable framework, ensuring high small-scale accuracy and efficient dynamics. GLONET's performance is assessed and benchmarked against two other forecasting systems: the global Mercator Ocean analysis and forecasting 1/12 high-resolution physical system GLO12 and a recent neural-based system also trained from GLORYS12. A series of comprehensive validation metrics is proposed, specifically tailored for neural network-based ocean forecasting systems, which extend beyond traditional point-wise error assessments that can introduce bias towards neural networks optimized primarily to minimize such metrics. The preliminary evaluation of GLONET shows promising results, for temperature, sea surface height, salinity and ocean currents. GLONET's experimental daily forecast are accessible through the European Digital Twin Ocean platform EDITO.</description>

      <title>Bubble dynamics in a cavitating venturi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryogenic fluids have extensive applications as fuel for launch vehicles in space applications and research. The physics of cryogenic flows are highly complex due to the sensitive nature of phase transformation from liquid to bubbly liquid and vapor, eventually resulting in cavitating flows at the ambient temperature owing to the very low boiling point of cryogenic fluids, which asserts us to classify such flows under multi-phase flow physics regime. This work elucidates the modeling of bubbly flow for cryogenic fluids such as liquid nitrogen in a converging-diverging venturi-like flow device known as cavitating venturi, a passive flow control metering device. The numerical works in literature are usually limited to modeling iso-thermal bubbly flows such as water devoid of involving energy equations because there is no occurrence of interface heat transfer as latent heat of vaporization of water is higher, unlike cryogenic fluids which are sensitive to phase change at ambient conditions. So, to realize an appropriate model for modeling cryogenic bubbly flows such as liquid nitrogen flow, the effect of heat transfer at the interface and convective heat transfer from the surrounding liquid to the traversing bubble needs to be included. Numerical modeling using an in-house code involving a finite-difference method The numerical results showed the importance of including the heat transport equation due to convection and at the interface of bubble-fluid as a significant source term for the bubble dynamics. The work is supported by computational simulation using a commercial CFD package for 2-dimensional simulations to predict a characterizing parameter, namely cavitation length. A limited flow visualization experiment using a high-speed camera is performed to study the cavitating zone length.</description>

      <title>A Variational Computational-based Framework for Unsteady Incompressible Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in computational fluid mechanics have largely relied on Newtonian frameworks, particularly through the direct simulation of Navier-Stokes equations. In this work, we propose an alternative computational framework that employs variational methods, specifically by leveraging the principle of minimum pressure gradient, which turns the fluid mechanics problem into a minimization problem whose solution can be used to predict the flow field in unsteady incompressible viscous flows.
  This method exhibits two particulary intriguing properties. First, it circumvents the chronic issues of pressure-velocity coupling in incompressible flows, which often dominates the computational cost in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Second, this method eliminates the reliance on unphysical assumptions at the outflow boundary, addressing another longstanding challenge in CFD.
  We apply this framework to three benchmark examples across a range of Reynolds numbers: (i) unsteady flow field in a lid-driven cavity, (ii) Poiseuille flow, and (iii) flow past a circular cylinder. The minimization framework is carried out using a physics-informed neural network (PINN), which integrates the underlying physical principles directly into the training of the model. The results from the proposed method are validated against high-fidelity CFD simulations, showing an excellent agreement. Comparison of the proposed variational method to the conventional method, wherein PINNs is directly applied to solve Navier-Stokes Equations, reveals that the proposed method outperforms conventional PINNs in terms of both convergence rate and time, demonstrating its potential for solving complex fluid mechanics problems.</description>

      <title>Temporal modulation on mixed convection in turbulent channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied flow organization and heat transfer properties in mixed turbulent convection within Poiseuille-Rayleigh-B\'enard channels subjected to temporally modulated sinusoidal wall temperatures. Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations were performed for Rayleigh numbers ranging from $10^6 \leq Ra \leq 10^8$, a Prandtl number $Pr = 0.71$, and a bulk Reynolds number $Re_b \approx 5623$. We found that high-frequency wall temperature oscillations had minimal impact on flow structures, while low-frequency oscillations induced adaptive changes, forming stable stratified layers during cooling. Proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) analysis revealed a dominant streamwise unidirectional shear flow mode. Large-scale rolls oriented in the streamwise direction appeared as higher POD modes and were significantly influenced by lower-frequency wall temperature variations. Long-time averaged statistics showed that the Nusselt number increased with decreasing frequency by up to 96\%, while the friction coefficient varied by less than 15\%. High-frequency modulation predominantly influenced near-wall regions, enhancing convective effects, whereas low frequencies reduced these effects via stable stratified layer formation. Phase-averaged statistics showed that high-frequency modulation resulted in phase-stable streamwise velocity and temperature profiles, while low-frequency modulation caused significant variations due to weakened turbulence. Turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) profiles remained high near the wall during both heating and cooling at high frequency, but decreased during cooling at low frequencies. TKE budget analysis revealed that during heating, TKE production was dominated by shear near the wall and by buoyancy in the bulk region; while during cooling, the production, distribution, and dissipation of TKE were all nearly zero.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic density-functional theory for the moving contact-line problem reveals fluid structure and emergence of a spatially distinct pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the nanoscale effects controlling the dynamics of a contact line -- defined as the line formed at the junction of two fluid phases and a solid -- has been a longstanding problem in fluid mechanics pushing experimental and numerical methods to their limits. A major challenge is the multiscale nature of the problem, whereby nanoscale phenomena manifest themselves at the macroscale. To probe the nanoscale, not easily accessible to other methods, we propose a reductionist model that employs elements from statistical mechanics, namely dynamic-density-functional theory (DDFT), in a Navier-Stokes-like equation -- an approach we name hydrodynamic DDFT. The model is applied to an isothermal Lennard-Jones-fluid with no slip on a flat solid substrate. Our computations reveal fluid stratification with an oscillatory density structure close to the wall and the emergence of two distinct regions as the temperature increases: a region of compression on the vapor side of the liquid-vapour interface and an effective slip region of large shear on the liquid side. The compressive region spreads along the fluid interface at a lengthscale that increases faster than the width of the fluid interface with temperature, while the width of the slip region is bound by the oscillatory fluid density structure and is constrained to a few particle diameters from the wall. Both compressive and shear effects may offset contact line friction, while compression in particular has a disproportionately high effect on the speed of advancing contact lines at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Concerning the Use of Turbulent Flow Data for Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article describes some common issues encountered in the use of Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) turbulent flow data for machine learning. We focus on two specific issues; 1) the requirements for a fair validation set, and 2) the pitfalls in downsampling DNS data before training. We attempt to shed light on the impact these issues can have on machine learning and computer vision for turbulence. Further, we include statistical and spectral analysis for the homogenous isotropic turbulence from the John Hopkins Turbulence Database, a Kolmogorov flow, and a Rayleigh-B\'enard Convection Cell using data generated by the authors, to concretely demonstrate these issues.</description>

      <title>Suspension Dynamics of Droplets in Acoustic and Gravitational Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of acoustic suspension or levitation of droplets against gravity, the application of Gorkov's acoustic radiation force for small particles (within the Rayleigh limit) or its extensions to larger ones (beyond the Rayleigh limit) is limited to predicting the suspension position of the droplet. Since this approach treats the droplet as a rigid particle, it fails to capture the fluid dynamics of the droplet and is also unsuitable for studying interfacial phenomena such as droplet deformation, splitting, or coalescence. In this work, we employ our recently developed acoustic body force in Eulerian form, which models the droplet as a fluid, to theoretically investigate the suspension dynamics of droplet subjected to standing waves through the interaction between acoustic, interfacial, and gravitational forces. Our theory predicts that when interfacial forces are dominant, the presence of positive and negative acoustic force regions within droplets exceeding the Rayleigh limit reduces the net acoustic force counteracting gravity. As a result, the suspension dynamics become highly dependent on droplet size, in contrast to droplets within the Rayleigh limit, where the dynamics remain size-independent. Thus, beyond the Rayleigh limit, as the droplet size to wavelength ratio increases, the critical acoustic energy density ($E_{cr}$) required to suspend the droplet initially rises sharply, which agrees with recent experimental results. After $E_{cr}$ reaches a local maximum at $d/\lambda \approx 0.65$, it exhibits a pattern of alternating decreases and increases, with each successive peak surpassing the previous one. Remarkably, our study reveals a size-dependent shifting of the suspension position between nodes and antinodes for droplets beyond the Rayleigh limit, whereas droplets within this limit maintain a consistent suspension position regardless of size.</description>

      <title>On the influence of the heat transfer at the free surface of a thermally-driven rotating annulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments on rotating annuli that are differentially heated in the radial direction have been largely contributing to a better understanding of baroclinic instabilities. This configuration creates waves at a laboratory scale that are related to atmospheric circulations. Pioneer studies in baroclinic tanks have shown that experiments with low aspect ratios are more suitable to reproduce small-scale inertia gravity waves, but these tanks have a larger free surface, which leads to higher interactions with its surrounding environment. Considering the heat transferred through the free surface, the present work investigates its impacts on the baroclinic instability using direct numerical simulations (DNS).</description>

      <title>STONet: A novel neural operator for modeling solute transport in micro-cracked reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel neural operator, the Solute Transport Operator Network (STONet), to efficiently model contaminant transport in micro-cracked reservoirs. The model combines different networks to encode heterogeneous properties effectively. By predicting the concentration rate, we are able to accurately model the transport process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our neural operator approach achieves accuracy comparable to that of the finite element method. The previously introduced Enriched DeepONet architecture has been revised, motivated by the architecture of the popular multi-head attention of transformers, to improve its performance without increasing the compute cost. The computational efficiency of the proposed model enables rapid and accurate predictions of solute transport, facilitating the optimization of reservoir management strategies and the assessment of environmental impacts. The data and code for the paper will be published at https://github.com/ehsanhaghighat/STONet.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Spatio-Temporal Auto-Regressive Prediction: Adams-Bashforth Time Integration with Adaptive Multi-Step Rollout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the critical challenge of error accumulation in spatio-temporal auto-regressive predictions within scientific machine learning models by introducing innovative temporal integration schemes and adaptive multi-step rollout strategies. We present a comprehensive analysis of time integration methods, highlighting the adaptation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth scheme to enhance long-term prediction robustness in auto-regressive models. Additionally, we improve temporal prediction accuracy through a multi-step rollout strategy that incorporates multiple future time steps during training, supported by three newly proposed approaches that dynamically adjust the importance of each future step. By integrating the Adams-Bashforth scheme with adaptive multi-step strategies, our graph neural network-based auto-regressive model accurately predicts 350 future time steps, even under practical constraints such as limited training data and minimal model capacity -- achieving an error of only 1.6% compared to the vanilla auto-regressive approach. Moreover, our framework demonstrates an 83% improvement in rollout performance over the standard noise injection method, a standard technique for enhancing long-term rollout performance. Its effectiveness is further validated in more challenging scenarios with truncated meshes, showcasing its adaptability and robustness in practical applications. This work introduces a versatile framework for robust long-term spatio-temporal auto-regressive predictions, effectively mitigating error accumulation across various model types and engineering discipline.</description>

      <title>The local similarity theory, including the "spectral" Prandtl mixing length. Dissipation of energies and structural parameters in the atmospheric CBL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper discusses a variant of the local similarity theory, employing the second moment of vertical velocity and the "spectral" Prandtl mixing length as basic parameters. This approach allows expressing the turbulent exchange coefficient, dissipations of kinetic energy and buoyancy square, mixed moments of the buoyancy and vertical velocity, as well as structural parameters solely through two independent basic parameters of local similarity. Comparison of local similarity approximations with experimental data convincingly confirms the correctness of the proposed relationships and demonstrates the high efficiency of the considered theory. It is established that the approximations of the turbulent exchange coefficient and dissipations of local similarity are fully consistent with the semi-empirical theories of Prandtl, Hanna, Richardson-Onsager and the Kolmogorov-Obukhov spectral theory with the law -5/3 for the atmospheric CBL. Thus, the new theory of local similarity significantly extends the scope of applications of well-known turbulence theories and substantially complements our understanding of turbulent convection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ocean turbulence parameterization has principally been based on processed-based approaches, seeking to embed physical principles so that coarser resolution calculations can capture the net influence of smaller scale unresolved processes. More recently there has been an increasing focus on the application of data-driven approaches to this problem. Here we consider the application of online learning to data-driven eddy parameterization, constructing an end-to-end differentiable dynamical solver forced by a neural network, and training the neural network based on the dynamics of the combined hybrid system. This approach is applied to the classic barotropic Stommel-Munk gyre problem -- a highly idealized configuration which nevertheless includes multiple flow regimes, boundary dynamics, and a separating jet, and therefore presents a challenging test case for the online learning approach. It is found that a suitable network architecture which is suitably trained can lead to a coarse resolution neural network parameterized model which is stable, and has both a reasonable mean state and intrinsic variability. This suggests that online learning is a powerful tool for studying the problem of ocean turbulence parameterization.</description>

Abstract: Vortex dynamics, which encompass the motion, evolution, and propagation of vortices, elicit both fascination and challenges across various domains such as fluid dynamics, atmospheric science, and physics. This study focuses on fundamental dynamics of vortex-pair fields, specifically known as vortex-pair beams (VPBs) in optics. VPBs have gained increasing attention due to their unique properties, including vortex attraction and repulsion. Here, we explore the dynamics of pure-phase VPBs (PPVPBs) and observe intriguing helical and intertwined behaviors of vortices, resembling a vortex-pair dance. We uncover the oscillation property of the intervortex distance for PPVPBs in free space. The observed dancing and oscillation phenomena are intricately tied to the initial intervortex distance and can be explained well in the hydrodynamic picture. Notably, the vortex dancing and oscillation alter the process of vortex-pair annihilation, extending the survival range for opposite vortices. This discovery enhances our understanding of vortex interactions and sheds light on the intricate dynamics of both vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.04528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Rayleigh-Benard convection and Taylor-Couette flow cellular patterns emerge at the onset of instability and persist as large-scale coherent structures in the turbulent regime. Their long-term dynamics has been thoroughly characterised and modelled for the case of turbulent convection, whereas turbulent Taylor rolls have received much less attention. Here we present direct numerical simulations of axisymmetric Taylor-Couette flow and show a discontinuous phase-transition to spatio-temporal chaos as the system size increases. Beyond this transition, Taylor rolls suddenly undergo erratic drifts evolving on a very slow time scale. We estimate an effective diffusion coefficient for the drift and compare the dynamics to analogous motions in Rayleigh-Benard convection and Poiseuille flow, suggesting that this spontaneous diffusive displacement of large coherent structures is common among different types of wall-bounded turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Challenges of learning multi-scale dynamics with AI weather models: Implications for stability and one solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-term stability and physical consistency are critical properties for AI-based weather models if they are going to be used for subseasonal-to-seasonal forecasts or beyond, e.g., climate change projection. However, current AI-based weather models can only provide short-term forecasts accurately since they become unstable or physically inconsistent when time-integrated beyond a few weeks or a few months. Either they exhibit numerical blow-up or hallucinate unrealistic dynamics of the atmospheric variables, akin to the current class of autoregressive large language models. The cause of the instabilities is unknown, and the methods that are used to improve their stability horizons are ad-hoc and lack rigorous theory. In this paper, we reveal that the universal causal mechanism for these instabilities in any turbulent flow is due to \textit{spectral bias} wherein, \textit{any} deep learning architecture is biased to learn only the large-scale dynamics and ignores the small scales completely. We further elucidate how turbulence physics and the absence of convergence in deep learning-based time-integrators amplify this bias, leading to unstable error propagation. Finally, using the quasi-geostrophic flow and European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) Reanalysis data as test cases, we bridge the gap between deep learning theory and numerical analysis to propose one mitigative solution to such unphysical behavior. We develop long-term physically-consistent data-driven models for the climate system and demonstrate accurate short-term forecasts, and hundreds of years of time-integration with accurate mean and variability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chaotic flow of elastic fluids at low Reynolds number (Re) is typically distinguished into elasto-inertial and elastic turbulence (EIT/ET). However, the clear separation among these two turbulent regimes in parallel flows with a gradual Re decrease remains elusive. Here, spanning Re over four orders of magnitude, we investigate the statistical and structural nature of the flows computed by fully resolved 3D numerical simulations, revealing that as inertia becomes sub-dominant all flows share similar dynamical properties. Supported by the results, we thus propose a unified view of fully developed ET and EIT in parallel flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inertia-gravity waves are scattered by background flows as a result of Doppler shift by a non-uniform velocity. In the WKB regime, the scattering process reduces to a diffusion in spectral space. Other inhomogeneities the waves encounter, such as density variations, also cause scattering and spectral diffusion. We generalise the spectral diffusion equation to account for these inhomogeneities. We apply the result to the rotating shallow water system, for which height inhomogeneities arise from velocity inhomogeneities through geostrophy, and to the Boussinesq system for which buoyancy inhomogeneities arise similarly. We compare the contributions that height and buoyancy variations make to the spectral diffusion with the contribution of the Doppler shift. In both systems, we find regimes where all contributions are significant. We support our findings with exact solutions of the diffusion equation and with ray tracing simulations in the shallow water case.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic relationship between synchronisation thresholds and Lyapunov vectors: evidence from large eddy simulations and shell models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important parameter characterising the synchronisation of turbulent flows is the threshold coupling wavenumber. This study investigates the relationship between the threshold coupling wavenumber and the leading Lyapunov vector using large eddy simulations and the SABRA model. Various subgrid-scale stress models, Reynolds numbers, and different coupling methods are examined. A new scaling relation is identified for the leading Lyapunov exponents in large eddy simulations, showing that they approximate those of filtered direct numerical simulations. This interpretation provides a physical basis for results related to the Lyapunov exponents of large eddy simulations, including those related to synchronisation. Synchronization experiments show that the peak wavenumber of the energy spectrum of the leading Lyapunov vector coincides with the threshold coupling wavenumber, in large eddy simulations of box turbulence with standard Smagorinsky or dynamic mixed models as well as in the SABRA model, replicating results from direct numerical simulations of box turbulence. Although the dynamic Smagorinsky model exhibit different behaviour, the totality of the results suggests that the relationship is an intrinsic property of a certain class of chaotic systems. We also confirm that conditional Lyapunov exponents characterize the synchronization process in indirectly coupled systems as they do in directly coupled ones, with their values insensitive to the nature of the master flow. These findings advance the understanding of the role of the Lyapunov vector in the synchronization of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Correlations for aerodynamic force coefficients of non-spherical particles in compressible flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13884v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents particle-resolved direct numerical simulations using three-dimensional body-fitted hexahedral meshes to investigate the aerodynamic force and torque coefficients of non-spherical particles in compressible flows. The simulations focus on three particle shapes: a prolate spheroid, an oblate spheroid, and a rod-like particle, across a range of Mach numbers (0.3 to 2.0), angles of attack (0 degrees to 90 degrees), and particle Reynolds numbers (100 to 300). Results indicate that the particle shape significantly impacts the aerodynamic forces on a particle in a compressible flow, with oblate spheroids exhibiting the highest drag, lift, and torque values. Correlations for these aerodynamic coefficients of the particles in a compressible flow are developed and validated. These correlations advance multiphase flow modeling by improving the accuracy of point-particle simulations for non-spherical particles in compressible flows.</description>

      <title>Event-based reconstruction of time-resolved centreline deformation of flapping flags</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08939v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-speed imaging is central to the experimental investigation of fast phenomena, like flapping flags. Event-based cameras use new types of sensors that address typical challenges such as low illumination conditions, large data transfer, and the trade-off between increasing repetition rate and measurement duration more efficiently and at reduced costs compared to classical frame-based fast cameras. Event-based cameras output unstructured data that frame-based algorithms can not process. This paper proposes a general method to reconstruct the motion of a slender object similar to the centreline of a flapping flag from raw streams of event data. The method takes advantage of continuous illumination, and the reconstruction update rate is set after and independent of the data collection. Our algorithm relies on a coarse chain-like structure that encodes the current state of the line and is updated by the occurrence of new events. The algorithm is applied to synthetic data, generated from known motions, to demonstrate that the method is accurate up to one percent of error for tip-based, shape-based, and modal decomposition metrics. Degradation of the reconstruction accuracy due to simulated defects only occurs when the severity of the defects is more than two orders of magnitude larger than what we typically encounter in experiments. The algorithm is then applied to experimental data of flapping flags, and we obtain relative errors below one percent when comparing the results with the data from laser distance sensors. The reconstruction of line deformation from event-based data is accurate and robust, and unlocks the ability to perform autonomous measurements in experimental mechanics.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient flow control via optimized synthetic jet placement using deep reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study leverages deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to train synthetic jet-based flow control strategies for circular and square cylinders. The central aim is to ascertain the optimal jet placements that strike an ideal balance between energy efficiency and control effectiveness, by formulating a cohesive strategy based on a comprehensive analysis of flow control performance and energy consumption across a range of configurations. First, the results from single-action training indicate that for circle cylinder, positioning the synthetic jet approximately 105{\deg} from the stagnation point achieves the most energy-efficient and effective control strategy. For square cylinder, placing the jet near the rear corner addresses the dual objectives of minimizing energy consumption and maximizing control performance. Second, compared to single-action control, multi-action control exhibits reduced convergence speed and stability. However, simultaneously activating synthetic jets at multiple locations significantly decreases initial energy consumption and enhances energy efficiency. The findings underscore the critical importance of accurately positioning the synthetic jet at the primary flow separation point, as this alignment not only enhances flow control performance but also establishes an optimal balance between energy efficiency and control effectiveness within the flow system. Furthermore, the interaction between synthetic jets and the flow system alters surface streamline patterns and local flow structures, resulting in effects that are considerably larger in scale than the jets themselves. This study crystallizes the potential of DRL algorithms to intelligently optimize intricate flow control strategies, effectively balancing energy efficiency with enhanced flow control performance through strategically optimized jet placement.</description>

      <title>Stokes flow of incompressible liquid through a conical diffuser with partial slip boundary condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An alternative form of the general solution of the linearized stationary Navier-Stokes equations for an incompressible fluid in spherical coordinates is obtained by the vector potential method. A previously published solution to this problem, dating back to the paper by Sampson, is given in terms of a stream function, which leads to formulas that are difficult to apply in practice. The presented form of solution is applied to the problem of liquid flowing through a conical diffuser under a partial slip boundary condition for a certain slip length lambda. Recurrent relations are obtained that allow us to determine the velocity, pressure and stream function. The solution is analyzed in the first order of decomposition with respect to a small dimensionless parameter (lambda divided by r). It is shown that the sliding of the liquid over the surface of the cone leads to a vorticity of the flow. At zero slip length, we obtain the well-known solution to the problem of a diffuser with no-slip boundary condition corresponding to strictly radial streamlines.</description>

      <title>Path of a pair of deformable bubbles rising initially in line and close to a vertical wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that in an unbounded fluid, the inline configuration of a freely rising bubble pair is often unstable with respect to lateral disturbances. This work numerically examines the stability of this configuration in the presence of a nearby vertical wall. The focus is on moderately inertial regimes, where two bubbles rising initially in line typically separate laterally from each other under unbounded conditions. In the presence of the wall, our results indicate that while the path of the bubble pair predominantly separates laterally, the plane of separation largely depends on the wall bubble interaction. This interaction involves a competition between two distinct effects, with the dominance determined by the ratios of buoyancy to viscous and buoyancy to capillary forces, which define the Galilei (Ga) and Bond (Bo) numbers, respectively. When Bo is below a critical Ga-dependent threshold, irrotational effects dominate, initially stabilizing both bubbles near the wall until horizontal separation among them occurs in the wall parallel plane. Conversely, at higher Bo, vortical effects dominate such that both bubbles migrate away from the wall. During the departure, asymmetric interactions cause the wall normal velocities of the two bubbles to differ, leading to horizontal separation in the wall-normal plane. These two separation motions, both newly identified in the present study, are found to result from two distinct mechanisms: one associated with the shear flow generated in the gap separating the wall and the leading bubble, which attracts the trailing bubble toward the wall, and the other linked to vortex shedding from the leading bubble, which promotes the trailing bubble's faster escape from the wall.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In ferrofluids, the vorticity is balanced by the rate of particle rotation, which is known here as critical balance. The universal energy cascade is investigated for a stationary and non-stationary incompressible ferrofluid turbulent system using exact relations. The findings reveal that under moderate magnetic fields, kinetic and total energy cascades occur at identical rates. As the external magnetic field strength increases, the total energy cascade becomes non-stationary and differs from the kinetic one. However, the cascade's universal, scale-independent nature remains unaffected. The suppression of turbulence in ferrofluids is observable at strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by explosive releases of energy in fusion, space and astrophysical plasmas, we consider the nonlinear stability of stratified magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibria against two-dimensional interchanges of straight magnetic-flux tubes. We demonstrate that, even within this restricted class of dynamics, the linear stability of an equilibrium does not guarantee its nonlinear stability: equilibria can be metastable. We show that the minimum-energy state accessible to a metastable equilibrium under non-diffusive 2D dynamics can be found by solving a combinatorial optimisation problem. These minimum-energy states are, to good approximation, the final states reached by our simulations of destabilised metastable equilibria for which turbulent mixing is suppressed by viscosity. To predict the result of fully turbulent relaxation, we construct a statistical mechanical theory based on the maximisation of Boltzmann's mixing entropy. This theory is analogous to the Lynden-Bell statistical mechanics of collisionless stellar systems and plasma, and to the Robert-Sommeria-Miller (RSM) theory of 2D vortex turbulence. Our theory reproduces well the results of our numerical simulations for sufficiently large perturbations to the metastable equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: Steady blood flow, or Poiseuille flow, through compressed or defective blood vessels presents critical challenges in hemodynamics, particularly in cardiovascular research. This study investigates a tube with a bipolar cylindrical cross section, a geometry relevant to unique hemodynamic issues such as blood flow through a bicuspid aortic valve during its oval systolic opening. A bipolar cross sectional analysis provides a more precise geometric approximation for modeling flow through such atypical vessel structures. In this paper, we derived an exact solution for the governing equations of Poiseuille flow within a bipolar cross sectional tube. The results encompass the velocity field, flow rate, and wall shear stress (WSS). The velocity profiles for blood flow in the bipolar cylindrical geometry demonstrate remarkable agreement with findings from previous studies utilizing coherent multi-scale simulations.</description>

      <title>Introducing a Harmonic Balance Navier-Stokes Finite Element Solver to Accelerate Cardiovascular Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adoption of cardiovascular simulations for diagnosis and surgical planning on a patient-specific basis requires the development of faster methods than the existing state-of-the-art techniques. To address this need, we leverage the periodic nature of these flows to accurately capture their time-dependence using spectral discretization. Owing to the reduced size of the discrete problem, the resulting approach, known as the harmonic balance method, significantly lowers the solution cost when compared against the conventional time marching methods. This study describes a stabilized finite element implementation of the harmonic balanced method that targets the simulation of physically-stable time-periodic flows. That stabilized method is based on the Galerkin/least-squares formulation that permits stable solution in convection-dominant flows and convenient use of the same interpolation functions for velocity and pressure. We test this solver against its equivalent time marching method using three common physiological cases where blood flow is modeled in a Glenn operation, a cerebral artery, and a left main coronary artery. Using the conventional time marching solver, simulating these cases takes more than ten hours. That cost is reduced by up to two orders of magnitude when the proposed harmonic balance solver is utilized, where a solution is produced in approximately 30 minutes. We show that that solution is in excellent agreement with the conventional solvers when the number of modes is sufficiently large to accurately represent the imposed boundary conditions.</description>
