      <title>Forecasting time series with constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting presents unique challenges that limit the effectiveness of traditional machine learning algorithms. To address these limitations, various approaches have incorporated linear constraints into learning algorithms, such as generalized additive models and hierarchical forecasting. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for integrating and combining linear constraints in time series forecasting. Within this framework, we show that the exact minimizer of the constrained empirical risk can be computed efficiently using linear algebra alone. This approach allows for highly scalable implementations optimized for GPUs. We validate the proposed methodology through extensive benchmarking on real-world tasks, including electricity demand forecasting and tourism forecasting, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</description>

      <title>Weighted quantization using MMD: From mean field to mean shift via gradient flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Approximating a probability distribution using a set of particles is a fundamental problem in machine learning and statistics, with applications including clustering and quantization. Formally, we seek a finite weighted mixture of Dirac measures that best approximates the target distribution. While much existing work relies on the Wasserstein distance to quantify approximation errors, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) has received comparatively less attention, especially when allowing for variable particle weights. We study the quantization problem from the perspective of minimizing MMD via gradient flow in the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao (WFR) geometry. This gradient flow yields an ODE system from which we further derive a fixed-point algorithm called mean shift interacting particles (MSIP). We show that MSIP extends the (non-interacting) mean shift algorithm, widely used for identifying modes in kernel density estimates. Moreover, we show that MSIP can be interpreted as preconditioned gradient descent, and that it acts as a relaxation of Lloyd's algorithm for clustering. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that MSIP and the WFR ODEs outperform other algorithms for quantization of multi-modal and high-dimensional targets.</description>

      <title>Batch-Adaptive Annotations for Causal Inference with Complex-Embedded Outcomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the causal effects of an intervention on outcomes is crucial. But often in domains such as healthcare and social services, this critical information about outcomes is documented by unstructured text, e.g. clinical notes in healthcare or case notes in social services. For example, street outreach to homeless populations is a common social services intervention, with ambiguous and hard-to-measure outcomes. Outreach workers compile case note records which are informative of outcomes. Although experts can succinctly extract relevant information from such unstructured case notes, it is costly or infeasible to do so for an entire corpus, which can span millions of notes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable scalable but potentially inaccurate annotation of unstructured text data. We leverage the decision of which datapoints should receive expert annotation vs. noisy imputation under budget constraints in a "design-based" estimator combining limited expert and plentiful noisy imputation data via \textit{causal inference with missing outcomes}. We develop a two-stage adaptive algorithm that optimizes the expert annotation probabilities, estimating the ATE with optimal asymptotic variance. We demonstrate how expert labels and LLM annotations can be combined strategically, efficiently and responsibly in a causal estimator. We run experiments on simulated data and two real-world datasets, including one on street outreach, to show the versatility of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Generative Adversarial Networks for High-Dimensional Item Factor Analysis: A Deep Adversarial Learning Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in deep learning and representation learning have transformed item factor analysis (IFA) in the item response theory (IRT) literature by enabling more efficient and accurate parameter estimation. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have been one of the most impactful techniques in modeling high-dimensional latent variables in this context. However, the limited expressiveness of the inference model based on traditional VAEs can still hinder the estimation performance. This study introduces Adversarial Variational Bayes (AVB) algorithms as an improvement to VAEs for IFA with improved flexibility and accuracy. By bridging the strengths of VAEs and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), AVB incorporates an auxiliary discriminator network to reframe the estimation process as a two-player adversarial game and removes the restrictive assumption of standard normal distributions in the inference model. Theoretically, AVB can achieve similar or higher likelihood compared to VAEs. A further enhanced algorithm, Importance-weighted Adversarial Variational Bayes (IWAVB) is proposed and compared with Importance-weighted Autoencoders (IWAE). In an exploratory analysis of real empirical data, IWAVB demonstrated superior expressiveness by achieving a higher likelihood compared to IWAE. In confirmatory studies with simulated data, IWAVB achieved similar mean-square error results to IWAE while consistently achieving higher likelihoods. Moreover, in simulations where latent variables followed a multimodal distribution, IWAVB outperformed IWAE by providing more accurate parameter estimates. With its innovative use of GANs, IWAVB is shown to have the potential to extend IFA to handle large-scale data, facilitating the potential integration of psychometrics and multimodal data analysis.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Influence Tracker: Measuring Time-Varying Sample Influence During Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing methods for measuring training sample influence on models only provide static, overall measurements, overlooking how sample influence changes during training. We propose Dynamic Influence Tracker (DIT), which captures the time-varying sample influence across arbitrary time windows during training.
  DIT offers three key insights: 1) Samples show different time-varying influence patterns, with some samples important in the early training stage while others become important later. 2) Sample influences show a weak correlation between early and late stages, demonstrating that the model undergoes distinct learning phases with shifting priorities. 3) Analyzing influence during the convergence period provides more efficient and accurate detection of corrupted samples than full-training analysis. Supported by theoretical guarantees without assuming loss convexity or model convergence, DIT significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving up to 0.99 correlation with ground truth and above 98\% accuracy in detecting corrupted samples in complex architectures.</description>

      <title>Generalized Factor Neural Network Model for High-dimensional Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We tackle the challenges of modeling high-dimensional data sets, particularly those with latent low-dimensional structures hidden within complex, non-linear, and noisy relationships. Our approach enables a seamless integration of concepts from non-parametric regression, factor models, and neural networks for high-dimensional regression. Our approach introduces PCA and Soft PCA layers, which can be embedded at any stage of a neural network architecture, allowing the model to alternate between factor modeling and non-linear transformations. This flexibility makes our method especially effective for processing hierarchical compositional data. We explore ours and other techniques for imposing low-rank structures on neural networks and examine how architectural design impacts model performance. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through simulation studies, as well as applications to forecasting future price movements of equity ETF indices and nowcasting with macroeconomic data.</description>

      <title>Robust High-Dimensional Mean Estimation With Low Data Size, an Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust statistics aims to compute quantities to represent data where a fraction of it may be arbitrarily corrupted. The most essential statistic is the mean, and in recent years, there has been a flurry of theoretical advancement for efficiently estimating the mean in high dimensions on corrupted data. While several algorithms have been proposed that achieve near-optimal error, they all rely on large data size requirements as a function of dimension. In this paper, we perform an extensive experimentation over various mean estimation techniques where data size might not meet this requirement due to the high-dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>All Models Are Miscalibrated, But Some Less So: Comparing Calibration with Conditional Mean Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When working in a high-risk setting, having well calibrated probabilistic predictive models is a crucial requirement. However, estimators for calibration error are not always able to correctly distinguish which model is better calibrated. We propose the \emph{conditional kernel calibration error} (CKCE) which is based on the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of the difference between conditional mean operators. By working directly with the definition of strong calibration as the distance between conditional distributions, which we represent by their embeddings in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, the CKCE is less sensitive to the marginal distribution of predictive models. This makes it more effective for relative comparisons than previously proposed calibration metrics. Our experiments, using both synthetic and real data, show that CKCE provides a more consistent ranking of models by their calibration error and is more robust against distribution shift.</description>

      <title>Distributional autoencoders know the score</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents novel and desirable properties of a recently introduced class of autoencoders -- the Distributional Principal Autoencoder (DPA) -- that combines distributionally correct reconstruction with principal components-like interpretability of the encodings.
  First, we show that the level sets of the encoder orient themselves exactly with regard to the score of the data distribution. This both explains the method's often remarkable performance in disentangling the the factors of variation of the data, as well as opens up possibilities of recovering its distribution while having access to samples only. In settings where the score itself has physical meaning -- such as when the data obey the Boltzmann distribution -- we demonstrate that the method can recover scientifically important quantities such as the \textit{minimum free energy path}.
  Second, we show that if the data lie on a manifold that can be approximated by the encoder, the optimal encoder's components beyond the dimension of the manifold will carry absolutely no additional information about the data distribution. This promises new ways of determining the number of relevant dimensions of the data beyond common heuristics such as the scree plot.
  Finally, the fact that the method is learning the score means that it could have promise as a generative model, potentially rivaling approaches such as diffusion, which similarly attempts to approximate the score of the data distribution.</description>

      <title>On the kernel learning problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical kernel ridge regression problem aims to find the best fit for the output $Y$ as a function of the input data $X\in \mathbb{R}^d$, with a fixed choice of regularization term imposed by a given choice of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, such as a Sobolev space. Here we consider a generalization of the kernel ridge regression problem, by introducing an extra matrix parameter $U$, which aims to detect the scale parameters and the feature variables in the data, and thereby improve the efficiency of kernel ridge regression. This naturally leads to a nonlinear variational problem to optimize the choice of $U$. We study various foundational mathematical aspects of this variational problem, and in particular how this behaves in the presence of multiscale structures in the data.</description>

      <title>Deep Subspace Learning for Surface Anomaly Classification Based on 3D Point Cloud Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface anomaly classification is critical for manufacturing system fault diagnosis and quality control. However, the following challenges always hinder accurate anomaly classification in practice: (i) Anomaly patterns exhibit intra-class variation and inter-class similarity, presenting challenges in the accurate classification of each sample. (ii) Despite the predefined classes, new types of anomalies can occur during production that require to be detected accurately. (iii) Anomalous data is rare in manufacturing processes, leading to limited data for model learning. To tackle the above challenges simultaneously, this paper proposes a novel deep subspace learning-based 3D anomaly classification model. Specifically, starting from a lightweight encoder to extract the latent representations, we model each class as a subspace to account for the intra-class variation, while promoting distinct subspaces of different classes to tackle the inter-class similarity. Moreover, the explicit modeling of subspaces offers the capability to detect out-of-distribution samples, i.e., new types of anomalies, and the regularization effect with much fewer learnable parameters of our proposed subspace classifier, compared to the popular Multi-Layer Perceptions (MLPs). Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate our method achieves better anomaly classification results than benchmark methods, and can effectively identify the new types of anomalies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networks are popular for representing complex data. In particular, differentially private synthetic networks are much in demand for method and algorithm development. The network generator should be easy to implement and should come with theoretical guarantees. Here we start with complex data as input and jointly provide a network representation as well as a synthetic network generator. Using a random connection model, we devise an effective algorithmic approach for generating attributed synthetic graphs which is $\epsilon$-differentially private at the vertex level, while preserving utility under an appropriate notion of distance which we develop. We provide theoretical guarantees for the accuracy of the private synthetic graphs using the fused Gromov-Wasserstein distance, which extends the Wasserstein metric to structured data. Our method draws inspiration from the PSMM method of \citet{he2023}.</description>

      <title>JoLT: Joint Probabilistic Predictions on Tabular Data Using LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple method for probabilistic predictions on tabular data based on Large Language Models (LLMs) called JoLT (Joint LLM Process for Tabular data). JoLT uses the in-context learning capabilities of LLMs to define joint distributions over tabular data conditioned on user-specified side information about the problem, exploiting the vast repository of latent problem-relevant knowledge encoded in LLMs. JoLT defines joint distributions for multiple target variables with potentially heterogeneous data types without any data conversion, data preprocessing, special handling of missing data, or model training, making it accessible and efficient for practitioners. Our experiments show that JoLT outperforms competitive methods on low-shot single-target and multi-target tabular classification and regression tasks. Furthermore, we show that JoLT can automatically handle missing data and perform data imputation by leveraging textual side information. We argue that due to its simplicity and generality, JoLT is an effective approach for a wide variety of real prediction problems.</description>

      <title>Neural Guided Diffusion Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for simulating conditioned diffusion processes (diffusion bridges) in Euclidean spaces. By training a neural network to approximate bridge dynamics, our approach eliminates the need for computationally intensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods or reverse-process modeling. Compared to existing methods, it offers greater robustness across various diffusion specifications and conditioning scenarios. This applies in particular to rare events and multimodal distributions, which pose challenges for score-learning- and MCMC-based approaches. We propose a flexible variational family for approximating the diffusion bridge path measure which is partially specified by a neural network. Once trained, it enables efficient independent sampling at a cost comparable to sampling the unconditioned (forward) process.</description>

      <title>Refined PAC-Bayes Bounds for Offline Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present refined probabilistic bounds on empirical reward estimates for off-policy learning in bandit problems. We build on the PAC-Bayesian bounds from Seldin et al. (2010) and improve on their results using a new parameter optimization approach introduced by Rodr\'iguez et al. (2024). This technique is based on a discretization of the space of possible events to optimize the "in probability" parameter. We provide two parameter-free PAC-Bayes bounds, one based on Hoeffding-Azuma's inequality and the other based on Bernstein's inequality. We prove that our bounds are almost optimal as they recover the same rate as would be obtained by setting the "in probability" parameter after the realization of the data.</description>

      <title>Low-Rank Thinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal in thinning is to summarize a dataset using a small set of representative points. Remarkably, sub-Gaussian thinning algorithms like Kernel Halving and Compress can match the quality of uniform subsampling while substantially reducing the number of summary points. However, existing guarantees cover only a restricted range of distributions and kernel-based quality measures and suffer from pessimistic dimension dependence. To address these deficiencies, we introduce a new low-rank analysis of sub-Gaussian thinning that applies to any distribution and any kernel, guaranteeing high-quality compression whenever the kernel or data matrix is approximately low-rank. To demonstrate the broad applicability of the techniques, we design practical sub-Gaussian thinning approaches that improve upon the best known guarantees for approximating attention in transformers, accelerating stochastic gradient training through reordering, and distinguishing distributions in near-linear time.</description>

      <title>How compositional generalization and creativity improve as diffusion models are trained</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural data is often organized as a hierarchical composition of features. How many samples do generative models need to learn the composition rules, so as to produce a combinatorial number of novel data? What signal in the data is exploited to learn? We investigate these questions both theoretically and empirically. Theoretically, we consider diffusion models trained on simple probabilistic context-free grammars - tree-like graphical models used to represent the structure of data such as language and images. We demonstrate that diffusion models learn compositional rules with the sample complexity required for clustering features with statistically similar context, a process similar to the word2vec algorithm. However, this clustering emerges hierarchically: higher-level, more abstract features associated with longer contexts require more data to be identified. This mechanism leads to a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the said context size. As a result, diffusion models trained on intermediate dataset size generate data coherent up to a certain scale, but that lacks global coherence. We test these predictions in different domains, and find remarkable agreement: both generated texts and images achieve progressively larger coherence lengths as the training time or dataset size grows. We discuss connections between the hierarchical clustering mechanism we introduce here and the renormalization group in physics.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Overparameterization in Continual Learning under a Linear Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous machine learning systems that learn many tasks in sequence are prone to the catastrophic forgetting problem. Mathematical theory is needed in order to understand the extent of forgetting during continual learning. As a foundational step towards this goal, we study continual learning and catastrophic forgetting from a theoretical perspective in the simple setting of gradient descent with no explicit algorithmic mechanism to prevent forgetting. In this setting, we analytically demonstrate that overparameterization alone can mitigate forgetting in the context of a linear regression model. We consider a two-task setting motivated by permutation tasks, and show that as the overparameterization ratio becomes sufficiently high, a model trained on both tasks in sequence results in a low-risk estimator for the first task. As part of this work, we establish a non-asymptotic bound of the risk of a single linear regression task, which may be of independent interest to the field of double descent theory.</description>

      <title>SinSim: Sinkhorn-Regularized SimCLR</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning has revolutionized representation learning by eliminating the need for labeled data. Contrastive learning methods, such as SimCLR, maximize the agreement between augmented views of an image but lack explicit regularization to enforce a globally structured latent space. This limitation often leads to suboptimal generalization. We propose SinSim, a novel extension of SimCLR that integrates Sinkhorn regularization from optimal transport theory to enhance representation structure. The Sinkhorn loss, an entropy-regularized Wasserstein distance, encourages a well-dispersed and geometry-aware feature space, preserving discriminative power. Empirical evaluations on various datasets demonstrate that SinSim outperforms SimCLR and achieves competitive performance against prominent self-supervised methods such as VICReg and Barlow Twins. UMAP visualizations further reveal improved class separability and structured feature distributions. These results indicate that integrating optimal transport regularization into contrastive learning provides a principled and effective mechanism for learning robust, well-structured representations. Our findings open new directions for applying transport-based constraints in self-supervised learning frameworks.</description>

      <title>Preference learning made easy: Everything should be understood through win rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preference learning, or the task of aligning generative models to preference comparison data, has yet to reach the conceptual maturity of classification, density estimation, etc. To close this gap, this work presents a framework to understand preference learning starting from the sampling distribution of pairwise preference data. First, we prove that the only evaluation of a generative model that respects both preferences and prevalences in the data distribution is a form of win rate, justifying win rate as the focal point to understand preference learning. We then analyze preference learning methods as win rate optimization (WRO) or non-WRO. We present novel instances of WRO beyond existing examples (RLHF, NLHF) and identify two key theoretical benefits of all such methods. We prove that common non-WRO methods like DPO and SFT on preferred samples lack these properties and suggest ways to mitigate such theoretical limitations. We also show that WRO underperforms in practice due optimization difficulties and that optimization success predicts performance better than choices which affect the objective's solution. Our analysis highlights best practices for existing methods and provides recommendations for future research, guided by the principle that one should either align non-WRO methods more closely with WRO or improve the optimization of WRO objectives.</description>

      <title>MixMin: Finding Data Mixtures via Convex Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern machine learning pipelines are increasingly combining and mixing data from diverse and disparate sources, e.g., pre-training large language models. Yet, finding the optimal data mixture is a challenging and open problem. We formalize this data mixing problem as a bi-level objective: the best mixture is the one that would lead to the best model for a downstream objective. Unfortunately, this objective is generally intractable. In this paper, we make the observation that the bi-level data mixing objective becomes convex as our model class becomes larger. We develop and study a gradient-based approach for optimizing this convex objective, which we call MixMin, and test it on language modeling and chemistry tasks. MixMin was the only method that uniformly improved the data mixture in all our experiments. With MixMin, we improved the data mixture using less than 0.2% additional compute for a pythia-410M model trained on 8.2B tokens, resulting between 1-5% relative improvement to negative log likelihood on PIQA, ARC Easy, SciQ, and OpenWebMath. Crucially, we found that MixMin mixtures for smaller models improved training of larger models, suggesting that MixMin mixtures may be scale-invariant. When mixing bioassay data to train an XGBoost model, we saw improvements to average precision scores of 0.03-0.15.</description>

      <title>Variational empirical Bayes variable selection in high-dimensional logistic regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Logistic regression involving high-dimensional covariates is a practically important problem. Often the goal is variable selection, i.e., determining which few of the many covariates are associated with the binary response. Unfortunately, the usual Bayesian computations can be quite challenging and expensive. Here we start with a recently proposed empirical Bayes solution, with strong theoretical convergence properties, and develop a novel and computationally efficient variational approximation thereof. One such novelty is that we develop this approximation directly for the marginal distribution on the model space, rather than on the regression coefficients themselves. We demonstrate the method's strong performance in simulations, and prove that our variational approximation inherits the strong selection consistency property satisfied by the posterior distribution that it is approximating.</description>

      <title>From Deep Additive Kernel Learning to Last-Layer Bayesian Neural Networks via Induced Prior Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the strengths of both deep learning and kernel methods like Gaussian Processes (GPs), Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) has gained considerable attention in recent years. From the computational perspective, however, DKL becomes challenging when the input dimension of the GP layer is high. To address this challenge, we propose the Deep Additive Kernel (DAK) model, which incorporates i) an additive structure for the last-layer GP; and ii) induced prior approximation for each GP unit. This naturally leads to a last-layer Bayesian neural network (BNN) architecture. The proposed method enjoys the interpretability of DKL as well as the computational advantages of BNN. Empirical results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art DKL methods in both regression and classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Do We Need to Verify Step by Step? Rethinking Process Supervision from a Theoretical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As large language models have evolved, it has become crucial to distinguish between process supervision and outcome supervision -- two key reinforcement learning approaches to complex reasoning tasks. While process supervision offers intuitive advantages for long-term credit assignment, the precise relationship between these paradigms has remained an open question. Conventional wisdom suggests that outcome supervision is fundamentally more challenging due to the trajectory-level coverage problem, leading to significant investment in collecting fine-grained process supervision data.
  In this paper, we take steps towards resolving this debate. Our main theorem shows that, under standard data coverage assumptions, reinforcement learning through outcome supervision is no more statistically difficult than through process supervision, up to polynomial factors in horizon. At the core of this result lies the novel Change of Trajectory Measure Lemma -- a technical tool that bridges return-based trajectory measure and step-level distribution shift. Furthermore, for settings with access to a verifier or a rollout capability, we prove that any policy's advantage function can serve as an optimal process reward model, providing a direct connection between outcome and process supervision. These findings suggest that the empirically observed performance gap -- if any -- between outcome and process supervision likely stems from algorithmic limitations rather than inherent statistical difficulties, potentially transforming how we approach data collection and algorithm design for reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Towards Self-Supervised Covariance Estimation in Deep Heteroscedastic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep heteroscedastic regression models the mean and covariance of the target distribution through neural networks. The challenge arises from heteroscedasticity, which implies that the covariance is sample dependent and is often unknown. Consequently, recent methods learn the covariance through unsupervised frameworks, which unfortunately yield a trade-off between computational complexity and accuracy. While this trade-off could be alleviated through supervision, obtaining labels for the covariance is non-trivial. Here, we study self-supervised covariance estimation in deep heteroscedastic regression. We address two questions: (1) How should we supervise the covariance assuming ground truth is available? (2) How can we obtain pseudo labels in the absence of the ground-truth? We address (1) by analysing two popular measures: the KL Divergence and the 2-Wasserstein distance. Subsequently, we derive an upper bound on the 2-Wasserstein distance between normal distributions with non-commutative covariances that is stable to optimize. We address (2) through a simple neighborhood based heuristic algorithm which results in surprisingly effective pseudo labels for the covariance. Our experiments over a wide range of synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that the proposed 2-Wasserstein bound coupled with pseudo label annotations results in a computationally cheaper yet accurate deep heteroscedastic regression.</description>

These transforms are primarily used for normalizing and standardizing datasets, effectively by raising values to a power.

      <title>LLM-Lasso: A Robust Framework for Domain-Informed Feature Selection and Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce LLM-Lasso, a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to guide feature selection in Lasso $\ell_1$ regression. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on numerical data, LLM-Lasso incorporates domain-specific knowledge extracted from natural language, enhanced through a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline, to seamlessly integrate data-driven modeling with contextual insights. Specifically, the LLM generates penalty factors for each feature, which are converted into weights for the Lasso penalty using a simple, tunable model. Features identified as more relevant by the LLM receive lower penalties, increasing their likelihood of being retained in the final model, while less relevant features are assigned higher penalties, reducing their influence. Importantly, LLM-Lasso has an internal validation step that determines how much to trust the contextual knowledge in our prediction pipeline. Hence it addresses key challenges in robustness, making it suitable for mitigating potential inaccuracies or hallucinations from the LLM. In various biomedical case studies, LLM-Lasso outperforms standard Lasso and existing feature selection baselines, all while ensuring the LLM operates without prior access to the datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first approach to effectively integrate conventional feature selection techniques directly with LLM-based domain-specific reasoning.</description>

      <title>Why Domain Generalization Fail? A View of Necessity and Sufficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite a strong theoretical foundation, empirical experiments reveal that existing domain generalization (DG) algorithms often fail to consistently outperform the ERM baseline. We argue that this issue arises because most DG studies focus on establishing theoretical guarantees for generalization under unrealistic assumptions, such as the availability of sufficient, diverse (or even infinite) domains or access to target domain knowledge. As a result, the extent to which domain generalization is achievable in scenarios with limited domains remains largely unexplored. This paper seeks to address this gap by examining generalization through the lens of the conditions necessary for its existence and learnability. Specifically, we systematically establish a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for generalization. Our analysis highlights that existing DG methods primarily act as regularization mechanisms focused on satisfying sufficient conditions, while often neglecting necessary ones. However, sufficient conditions cannot be verified in settings with limited training domains. In such cases, regularization targeting sufficient conditions aims to maximize the likelihood of generalization, whereas regularization targeting necessary conditions ensures its existence. Using this analysis, we reveal the shortcomings of existing DG algorithms by showing that, while they promote sufficient conditions, they inadvertently violate necessary conditions. To validate our theoretical insights, we propose a practical method that promotes the sufficient condition while maintaining the necessary conditions through a novel subspace representation alignment strategy. This approach highlights the advantages of preserving the necessary conditions on well-established DG benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can be prompted to do many tasks, but finding good prompts is not always easy, nor is understanding some performant prompts. We explore these issues by viewing prompting as conditioning a near-optimal sequence predictor (LLM) pretrained on diverse data sources. Through numerous prompt search experiments, we show that the unintuitive patterns in optimal prompts can be better understood given the pretraining distribution, which is often unavailable in practice. Moreover, even using exhaustive search, reliably identifying optimal prompts from practical neural predictors can be difficult. Further, we demonstrate that common prompting methods, such as using intuitive prompts or samples from the targeted task, are in fact suboptimal. Thus, this work takes an initial step towards understanding the difficulties in finding and understanding optimal prompts from a statistical and empirical perspective.</description>

      <title>Epidemic-guided deep learning for spatiotemporal forecasting of Tuberculosis outbreak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a formidable global health challenge, driven by complex spatiotemporal transmission dynamics and influenced by factors such as population mobility and behavioral changes. We propose an Epidemic-Guided Deep Learning (EGDL) approach that fuses mechanistic epidemiological principles with advanced deep learning techniques to enhance early warning systems and intervention strategies for TB outbreaks. Our framework is built upon a networked Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model augmented with a saturated incidence rate and graph Laplacian diffusion, capturing both long-term transmission dynamics and region-specific population mobility patterns. Compartmental model parameters are rigorously estimated using Bayesian inference via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach. Theoretical analysis leveraging the comparison principle and Green's formula establishes global stability properties of the disease-free and endemic equilibria. Building on these epidemiological insights, we design two forecasting architectures, EGDL-Parallel and EGDL-Series, that integrate the mechanistic outputs of the networked SIR model within deep neural networks. This integration mitigates the overfitting risks commonly encountered in data-driven methods and filters out noise inherent in surveillance data, resulting in reliable forecasts of real-world epidemic trends. Experiments conducted on TB incidence data from 47 prefectures in Japan demonstrate that our approach delivers robust and accurate predictions across multiple time horizons (short to medium-term forecasts). Additionally, incorporating uncertainty quantification through conformal prediction enhances the model's practical utility for guiding targeted public health interventions.</description>

      <title>Which Features are Best for Successor Features?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning, universal successor features (SFs) are a way to provide zero-shot adaptation to new tasks at test time: they provide optimal policies for all downstream reward functions lying in the linear span of a set of base features. But it is unclear what constitutes a good set of base features, that could be useful for a wide set of downstream tasks beyond their linear span. Laplacian eigenfunctions (the eigenfunctions of $\Delta+\Delta^\ast$ with $\Delta$ the Laplacian operator of some reference policy and $\Delta^\ast$ that of the time-reversed dynamics) have been argued to play a role, and offer good empirical performance.
  Here, for the first time, we identify the optimal base features based on an objective criterion of downstream performance, in a non-tautological way without assuming the downstream tasks are linear in the features. We do this for three generic classes of downstream tasks: reaching a random goal state, dense random Gaussian rewards, and random ``scattered'' sparse rewards. The features yielding optimal expected downstream performance turn out to be the \emph{same} for these three task families. They do not coincide with Laplacian eigenfunctions in general, though they can be expressed from $\Delta$: in the simplest case (deterministic environment and decay factor $\gamma$ close to $1$), they are the eigenfunctions of $\Delta^{-1}+(\Delta^{-1})^\ast$.
  We obtain these results under an assumption of large behavior cloning regularization with respect to a reference policy, a setting often used for offline RL. Along the way, we get new insights into KL-regularized\option{natural} policy gradient, and into the lack of SF information in the norm of Bellman gaps.</description>

      <title>Improved Offline Contextual Bandits with Second-Order Bounds: Betting and Freezing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the off-policy selection and learning in contextual bandits where the learner aims to select or train a reward-maximizing policy using data collected by a fixed behavior policy. Our contribution is two-fold. First, we propose a novel off-policy selection method that leverages a new betting-based confidence bound applied to an inverse propensity weight sequence. Our theoretical analysis reveals that our method achieves a significantly better, variance-adaptive guarantee upon prior art. Second, we propose a novel and generic condition on the optimization objective for off-policy learning that strikes a difference balance in bias and variance. One special case that we call freezing tends to induce small variance, which is preferred in small-data regimes. Our analysis shows that they match the best existing guarantee. In our empirical study, our selection method outperforms existing methods, and freezing exhibits improved performance in small-sample regimes.</description>

      <title>LEAPS: A discrete neural sampler via locally equivariant networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose LEAPS, an algorithm to sample from discrete distributions known up to normalization by learning a rate matrix of a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). LEAPS can be seen as a continuous-time formulation of annealed importance sampling and sequential Monte Carlo methods, extended so that the variance of the importance weights is offset by the inclusion of the CTMC. To derive these importance weights, we introduce a set of Radon-Nikodym derivatives of CTMCs over their path measures. Because the computation of these weights is intractable with standard neural network parameterizations of rate matrices, we devise a new compact representation for rate matrices via what we call locally equivariant functions. To parameterize them, we introduce a family of locally equivariant multilayer perceptrons, attention layers, and convolutional networks, and provide an approach to make deep networks that preserve the local equivariance. This property allows us to propose a scalable training algorithm for the rate matrix such that the variance of the importance weights associated to the CTMC are minimal. We demonstrate the efficacy of LEAPS on problems in statistical physics.</description>

      <title>The Relationship between No-Regret Learning and Online Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing algorithms for online conformal prediction -- guaranteeing marginal coverage in adversarial settings -- are variants of online gradient descent (OGD), but their analyses of worst-case coverage do not follow from the regret guarantee of OGD. What is the relationship between no-regret learning and online conformal prediction? We observe that although standard regret guarantees imply marginal coverage in i.i.d. settings, this connection fails as soon as we either move to adversarial environments or ask for group conditional coverage. On the other hand, we show a tight connection between threshold calibrated coverage and swap-regret in adversarial settings, which extends to group-conditional (multi-valid) coverage. We also show that algorithms in the follow the perturbed leader family of no regret learning algorithms (which includes online gradient descent) can be used to give group-conditional coverage guarantees in adversarial settings for arbitrary grouping functions. Via this connection we analyze and conduct experiments using a multi-group generalization of the ACI algorithm of Gibbs &amp; Candes [2021] (arXiv:2106.00170).</description>

      <title>Is Elo Rating Reliable? A Study Under Model Misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elo rating, widely used for skill assessment across diverse domains ranging from competitive games to large language models, is often understood as an incremental update algorithm for estimating a stationary Bradley-Terry (BT) model. However, our empirical analysis of practical matching datasets reveals two surprising findings: (1) Most games deviate significantly from the assumptions of the BT model and stationarity, raising questions on the reliability of Elo. (2) Despite these deviations, Elo frequently outperforms more complex rating systems, such as mElo and pairwise models, which are specifically designed to account for non-BT components in the data, particularly in terms of win rate prediction. This paper explains this unexpected phenomenon through three key perspectives: (a) We reinterpret Elo as an instance of online gradient descent, which provides no-regret guarantees even in misspecified and non-stationary settings. (b) Through extensive synthetic experiments on data generated from transitive but non-BT models, such as strongly or weakly stochastic transitive models, we show that the ''sparsity'' of practical matching data is a critical factor behind Elo's superior performance in prediction compared to more complex rating systems. (c) We observe a strong correlation between Elo's predictive accuracy and its ranking performance, further supporting its effectiveness in ranking.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Policy Mirror Descent Beyond Compatible Function Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern policy optimization methods roughly follow the policy mirror descent (PMD) algorithmic template, for which there are by now numerous theoretical convergence results. However, most of these either target tabular environments, or can be applied effectively only when the class of policies being optimized over satisfies strong closure conditions, which is typically not the case when working with parametric policy classes in large-scale environments. In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for PMD for general policy classes where we replace the closure conditions with a strictly weaker variational gradient dominance assumption, and obtain upper bounds on the rate of convergence to the best-in-class policy. Our main result leverages a novel notion of smoothness with respect to a local norm induced by the occupancy measure of the current policy, and casts PMD as a particular instance of smooth non-convex optimization in non-Euclidean space.</description>

      <title>Generalization of the Gibbs algorithm with high probability at low temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper gives a bound on the generalization error of the Gibbs algorithm, which recovers known data-independent bounds for the high temperature range and extends to the low-temperature range, where generalization depends critically on the data-dependent loss-landscape. It is shown, that with high probability the generalization error of a single hypothesis drawn from the Gibbs posterior decreases with the total prior volume of all hypotheses with similar or smaller empirical error. This gives theoretical support to the belief in the benefit of flat minima. The zero temperature limit is discussed and the bound is extended to a class of similar stochastic algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The memorization capacity of neural networks with a given architecture has been thoroughly studied in many works. Specifically, it is well-known that memorizing $N$ samples can be done using a network of constant width, independent of $N$. However, the required constructions are often quite delicate. In this paper, we consider the natural question of how well feedforward ReLU neural networks can memorize robustly, namely while being able to withstand adversarial perturbations of a given radius. We establish both upper and lower bounds on the possible radius for general $l_p$ norms, implying (among other things) that width logarithmic in the number of input samples is necessary and sufficient to achieve robust memorization (with robustness radius independent of $N$).</description>

      <title>Span-Agnostic Optimal Sample Complexity and Oracle Inequalities for Average-Reward RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of finding an $\varepsilon$-optimal policy in average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with a generative model. The minimax optimal span-based complexity of $\widetilde{O}(SAH/\varepsilon^2)$, where $H$ is the span of the optimal bias function, has only been achievable with prior knowledge of the value of $H$. Prior-knowledge-free algorithms have been the objective of intensive research, but several natural approaches provably fail to achieve this goal. We resolve this problem, developing the first algorithms matching the optimal span-based complexity without $H$ knowledge, both when the dataset size is fixed and when the suboptimality level $\varepsilon$ is fixed. Our main technique combines the discounted reduction approach with a method for automatically tuning the effective horizon based on empirical confidence intervals or lower bounds on performance, which we term horizon calibration. We also develop an empirical span penalization approach, inspired by sample variance penalization, which satisfies an oracle inequality performance guarantee. In particular this algorithm can outperform the minimax complexity in benign settings such as when there exist near-optimal policies with span much smaller than $H$.</description>

      <title>A statistical theory of overfitting for imbalanced classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classification with imbalanced data is a common challenge in data analysis, where certain classes (minority classes) account for a small fraction of the training data compared with other classes (majority classes). Classical statistical theory based on large-sample asymptotics and finite-sample corrections is often ineffective for high-dimensional data, leaving many overfitting phenomena in empirical machine learning unexplained.
  In this paper, we develop a statistical theory for high-dimensional imbalanced classification by investigating support vector machines and logistic regression. We find that dimensionality induces truncation or skewing effects on the logit distribution, which we characterize via a variational problem under high-dimensional asymptotics. In particular, for linearly separable data generated from a two-component Gaussian mixture model, the logits from each class follow a normal distribution $\mathsf{N}(0,1)$ on the testing set, but asymptotically follow a rectified normal distribution $\max\{\kappa, \mathsf{N}(0,1)\}$ on the training set -- which is a pervasive phenomenon we verified on tabular data, image data, and text data. This phenomenon explains why the minority class is more severely affected by overfitting. Further, we show that margin rebalancing, which incorporates class sizes into the loss function, is crucial for mitigating the accuracy drop for the minority class. Our theory also provides insights into the effects of overfitting on calibration and other uncertain quantification measures.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning of CATE with Kernel Ridge Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of data has sparked significant interest in leveraging findings from one study to estimate treatment effects in a different target population without direct outcome observations. However, the transfer learning process is frequently hindered by substantial covariate shift and limited overlap between (i) the source and target populations, as well as (ii) the treatment and control groups within the source. We propose a novel method for overlap-adaptive transfer learning of conditional average treatment effect (CATE) using kernel ridge regression (KRR). Our approach involves partitioning the labeled source data into two subsets. The first one is used to train candidate CATE models based on regression adjustment and pseudo-outcomes. An optimal model is then selected using the second subset and unlabeled target data, employing another pseudo-outcome-based strategy. We provide a theoretical justification for our method through sharp non-asymptotic MSE bounds, highlighting its adaptivity to both weak overlaps and the complexity of CATE function. Extensive numerical studies confirm that our method achieves superior finite-sample efficiency and adaptability. We conclude by demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach using a 401(k) eligibility dataset.</description>

      <title>Biases in Edge Language Models: Detection, Analysis, and Mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) on low-power edge devices such as Raspberry Pi, known as edge language models (ELMs), has introduced opportunities for more personalized, secure, and low-latency language intelligence that is accessible to all. However, the resource constraints inherent in edge devices and the lack of robust ethical safeguards in language models raise significant concerns about fairness, accountability, and transparency in model output generation. This paper conducts a comparative analysis of text-based bias across language model deployments on edge, cloud, and desktop environments, aiming to evaluate how deployment settings influence model fairness. Specifically, we examined an optimized Llama-2 model running on a Raspberry Pi 4; GPT 4o-mini, Gemini-1.5-flash, and Grok-beta models running on cloud servers; and Gemma2 and Mistral models running on a MacOS desktop machine. Our results demonstrate that Llama-2 running on Raspberry Pi 4 is 43.23% and 21.89% more prone to showing bias over time compared to models running on the desktop and cloud-based environments. We also propose the implementation of a feedback loop, a mechanism that iteratively adjusts model behavior based on previous outputs, where predefined constraint weights are applied layer-by-layer during inference, allowing the model to correct bias patterns, resulting in 79.28% reduction in model bias.</description>

      <title>Statistical Query Hardness of Multiclass Linear Classification with Random Classification Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the task of Multiclass Linear Classification (MLC) in the distribution-free PAC model with Random Classification Noise (RCN). Specifically, the learner is given a set of labeled examples $(x, y)$, where $x$ is drawn from an unknown distribution on $R^d$ and the labels are generated by a multiclass linear classifier corrupted with RCN. That is, the label $y$ is flipped from $i$ to $j$ with probability $H_{ij}$ according to a known noise matrix $H$ with non-negative separation $\sigma: = \min_{i \neq j} H_{ii}-H_{ij}$. The goal is to compute a hypothesis with small 0-1 error. For the special case of two labels, prior work has given polynomial-time algorithms achieving the optimal error. Surprisingly, little is known about the complexity of this task even for three labels. As our main contribution, we show that the complexity of MLC with RCN becomes drastically different in the presence of three or more labels. Specifically, we prove super-polynomial Statistical Query (SQ) lower bounds for this problem. In more detail, even for three labels and constant separation, we give a super-polynomial lower bound on the complexity of any SQ algorithm achieving optimal error. For a larger number of labels and smaller separation, we show a super-polynomial SQ lower bound even for the weaker goal of achieving any constant factor approximation to the optimal loss or even beating the trivial hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Offline Model-Based RL via Active Model Selection: A Bayesian Optimization Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offline model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) serves as a competitive framework that can learn well-performing policies solely from pre-collected data with the help of learned dynamics models. To fully unleash the power of offline MBRL, model selection plays a pivotal role in determining the dynamics model utilized for downstream policy learning. However, offline MBRL conventionally relies on validation or off-policy evaluation, which are rather inaccurate due to the inherent distribution shift in offline RL. To tackle this, we propose BOMS, an active model selection framework that enhances model selection in offline MBRL with only a small online interaction budget, through the lens of Bayesian optimization (BO). Specifically, we recast model selection as BO and enable probabilistic inference in BOMS by proposing a novel model-induced kernel, which is theoretically grounded and computationally efficient. Through extensive experiments, we show that BOMS improves over the baseline methods with a small amount of online interaction comparable to only $1\%$-$2.5\%$ of offline training data on various RL tasks.</description>

Abstract: We study an online forecasting setting in which, over $T$ rounds, $N$ strategic experts each report a forecast to a mechanism, the mechanism selects one forecast, and then the outcome is revealed. In any given round, each expert has a belief about the outcome, but the expert wishes to select its report so as to maximize the total number of times it is selected. The goal of the mechanism is to obtain low belief regret: the difference between its cumulative loss (based on its selected forecasts) and the cumulative loss of the best expert in hindsight (as measured by the experts' beliefs). We consider exactly truthful mechanisms for non-myopic experts, meaning that truthfully reporting its belief strictly maximizes the expert's subjective probability of being selected in any future round. Even in the full-information setting, it is an open problem to obtain the first no-regret exactly truthful mechanism in this setting. We develop the first no-regret mechanism for this setting via an online extension of the Independent-Event Lotteries Forecasting Competition Mechanism (I-ELF). By viewing this online I-ELF as a novel instance of Follow the Perturbed Leader (FPL) with noise based on random walks with loss-dependent perturbations, we obtain $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T N})$ regret. Our results are fueled by new tail bounds for Poisson binomial random variables that we develop. We extend our results to the bandit setting, where we give an exactly truthful mechanism obtaining $\tilde{O}(T^{2/3} N^{1/3})$ regret; this is the first no-regret result even among approximately truthful mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Learning Surrogate Potential Mean Field Games via Gaussian Processes: A Data-Driven Approach to Ill-Posed Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean field games (MFGs) describe the collective behavior of large populations of interacting agents. In this work, we tackle ill-posed inverse problems in potential MFGs, aiming to recover the agents' population, momentum, and environmental setup from limited, noisy measurements and partial observations. These problems are ill-posed because multiple MFG configurations can explain the same data, or different parameters can yield nearly identical observations. Nonetheless, they remain crucial in practice for real-world scenarios where data are inherently sparse or noisy, or where the MFG structure is not fully determined. Our focus is on finding surrogate MFGs that accurately reproduce the observed data despite these challenges. We propose two Gaussian process (GP)-based frameworks: an inf-sup formulation and a bilevel approach. The choice between them depends on whether the unknown parameters introduce concavity in the objective. In the inf-sup framework, we use the linearity of GPs and their parameterization structure to maintain convex-concave properties, allowing us to apply standard convex optimization algorithms. In the bilevel framework, we employ a gradient-descent-based algorithm and introduce two methods for computing the outer gradient. The first method leverages an existing solver for the inner potential MFG and applies automatic differentiation, while the second adopts an adjoint-based strategy that computes the outer gradient independently of the inner solver. Our numerical experiments show that when sufficient prior information is available, the unknown parameters can be accurately recovered. Otherwise, if prior information is limited, the inverse problem is ill-posed, but our frameworks can still produce surrogate MFG models that closely match observed data.</description>

      <title>An Actor-Critic Algorithm with Function Approximation for Risk Sensitive Cost Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the risk-sensitive cost criterion with exponentiated costs for Markov decision processes and develop a model-free policy gradient algorithm in this setting. Unlike additive cost criteria such as average or discounted cost, the risk-sensitive cost criterion is less studied due to the complexity resulting from the multiplicative structure of the resulting Bellman equation. We develop an actor-critic algorithm with function approximation in this setting and provide its asymptotic convergence analysis. We also show the results of numerical experiments that demonstrate the superiority in performance of our algorithm over other recent algorithms in the literature.</description>

      <title>In-Context Parametric Inference: Point or Distribution Estimators?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian and frequentist inference are two fundamental paradigms in statistical estimation. Bayesian methods treat hypotheses as random variables, incorporating priors and updating beliefs via Bayes' theorem, whereas frequentist methods assume fixed but unknown hypotheses, relying on estimators like maximum likelihood. While extensive research has compared these approaches, the frequentist paradigm of obtaining point estimates has become predominant in deep learning, as Bayesian inference is challenging due to the computational complexity and the approximation gap of posterior estimation methods. However, a good understanding of trade-offs between the two approaches is lacking in the regime of amortized estimators, where in-context learners are trained to estimate either point values via maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori estimation, or full posteriors using normalizing flows, score-based diffusion samplers, or diagonal Gaussian approximations, conditioned on observations. To help resolve this, we conduct a rigorous comparative analysis spanning diverse problem settings, from linear models to shallow neural networks, with a robust evaluation framework assessing both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization on tractable tasks. Our experiments indicate that amortized point estimators generally outperform posterior inference, though the latter remain competitive in some low-dimensional problems, and we further discuss why this might be the case.</description>

      <title>Exact Upper and Lower Bounds for the Output Distribution of Neural Networks with Random Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive exact upper and lower bounds for the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the output of a neural network over its entire support subject to noisy (stochastic) inputs. The upper and lower bounds converge to the true cdf over its domain as the resolution increases. Our method applies to any feedforward NN using continuous monotonic piecewise differentiable activation functions (e.g., ReLU, tanh and softmax) and convolutional NNs, which were beyond the scope of competing approaches. The novelty and an instrumental tool of our approach is to bound general NNs with ReLU NNs. The ReLU NN based bounds are then used to derive upper and lower bounds of the cdf of the NN output. Experiments demonstrate that our method delivers guaranteed bounds of the predictive output distribution over its support, thus providing exact error guarantees, in contrast to competing approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the existence of online learning algorithms with bandit feedback that simultaneously guarantee $O(1)$ regret compared to a given comparator strategy, and $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret compared to the best strategy in hindsight, where $T$ is the number of rounds. We provide the first affirmative answer to this question. In the context of symmetric zero-sum games, both in normal- and extensive form, we show that our results allow us to guarantee to risk at most $O(1)$ loss while being able to gain $\Omega(T)$ from exploitable opponents, thereby combining the benefits of both no-regret algorithms and minimax play.</description>

      <title>Double Momentum and Error Feedback for Clipping with Fast Rates and Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong Differential Privacy (DP) and Optimization guarantees are two desirable properties for a method in Federated Learning (FL). However, existing algorithms do not achieve both properties at once: they either have optimal DP guarantees but rely on restrictive assumptions such as bounded gradients/bounded data heterogeneity, or they ensure strong optimization performance but lack DP guarantees. To address this gap in the literature, we propose and analyze a new method called Clip21-SGD2M based on a novel combination of clipping, heavy-ball momentum, and Error Feedback. In particular, for non-convex smooth distributed problems with clients having arbitrarily heterogeneous data, we prove that Clip21-SGD2M has optimal convergence rate and also near optimal (local-)DP neighborhood. Our numerical experiments on non-convex logistic regression and training of neural networks highlight the superiority of Clip21-SGD2M over baselines in terms of the optimization performance for a given DP-budget.</description>

      <title>Robust Partial-Label Learning by Leveraging Class Activation Values</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-world training data is often noisy; for example, human annotators assign conflicting class labels to the same instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) is a weakly supervised learning paradigm that allows training classifiers in this context without manual data cleaning. While state-of-the-art methods have good predictive performance, their predictions are sensitive to high noise levels, out-of-distribution data, and adversarial perturbations. We propose a novel PLL method based on subjective logic, which explicitly represents uncertainty by leveraging the magnitudes of the underlying neural network's class activation values. Thereby, we effectively incorporate prior knowledge about the class labels by using a novel label weight re-distribution strategy that we prove to be optimal. We empirically show that our method yields more robust predictions in terms of predictive performance under high PLL noise levels, handling out-of-distribution examples, and handling adversarial perturbations on the test instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most popular methods for continual learning with deep neural networks is Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC), which involves computing the Fisher Information. The exact way in which the Fisher Information is computed is however rarely described, and multiple different implementations for it can be found online. This blog post discusses and empirically compares several often-used implementations, which highlights that many currently reported results for EWC could likely be improved by changing the way the Fisher Information is computed.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the saliency of neural networks and employ interpretable machine learning models to predict whether the Kronecker coefficients of the symmetric group are zero or not. Our models use triples of partitions as input features, as well as b-loadings derived from the principal component of an embedding that captures the differences between partitions. Across all approaches, we achieve an accuracy of approximately 83% and derive explicit formulas for a decision function in terms of b-loadings. Additionally, we develop transformer-based models for prediction, achieving the highest reported accuracy of over 99%.</description>

      <title>Assessing the impacts of tradable credit schemes through agent-based simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tradable credit schemes (TCS) have been attracting interest from the transportation research community as an appealing alternative to congestion pricing, due to the advantages of revenue neutrality and equity. Nonetheless, existing research has largely employed network and market equilibrium approaches with simplistic characterizations of transportation demand, supply, credit market operations, and market behavior. Agent- and activity-based simulation affords a natural means to comprehensively assess TCS by more realistically modeling demand, supply, and individual market interactions. We propose an integrated simulation framework for modeling a TCS, and implements it within the state-of-the-art open-source urban simulation platform SimMobility, including: (a) a flexible TCS design that considers multiple trips and explicitly accounts for individual trading behaviors; (b) a simulation framework that captures the complex interactions between a TCS regulator, the traveler, and the TCS market itself, with the flexibility to test future TCS designs and relevant mobility models; and (c) a set of simulation experiments on a large mesoscopic multimodal network combined with a Bayesian Optimization approach for TCS optimal design. The experiment results indicate network and market performance to stabilize over the day-to-day process, showing the alignment of our agent-based simulation with the known theoretical properties of TCS. We confirm the efficiency of TCS in reducing congestion under the adopted market behavioral assumptions and open the door for simulating different individual behaviors. We measure how TCS impacts differently the local network, heterogeneous users, the different travel behaviors, and how testing different TCS designs can avoid negative market trading behaviors.</description>

      <title>Bi-invariant Geodesic Regression with Data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many phenomena are naturally characterized by measuring continuous transformations such as shape changes in medicine or articulated systems in robotics. Modeling the variability in such datasets requires performing statistics on Lie groups, that is, manifolds carrying an additional group structure. As the Lie group captures the symmetries in the data, it is essential from a theoretical and practical perspective to ask for statistical methods that respect these symmetries; this way they are insensitive to confounding effects, e.g., due to the choice of reference coordinate systems. In this work, we investigate geodesic regression -- a generalization of linear regression originally derived for Riemannian manifolds. While Lie groups can be endowed with Riemannian metrics, these are generally incompatible with the group structure. We develop a non-metric estimator using an affine connection setting. It captures geodesic relationships respecting the symmetries given by left and right translations. For its computation, we propose an efficient fixed point algorithm requiring simple differential expressions that can be calculated through automatic differentiation. We perform experiments on a synthetic example and evaluate our method on an open-access, clinical dataset studying knee joint configurations under the progression of osteoarthritis.</description>

      <title>Neural Chaos: A Spectral Stochastic Neural Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building surrogate models with uncertainty quantification capabilities is essential for many engineering applications where randomness, such as variability in material properties, is unavoidable. Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) is widely recognized as a to-go method for constructing stochastic solutions in both intrusive and non-intrusive ways. Its application becomes challenging, however, with complex or high-dimensional processes, as achieving accuracy requires higher-order polynomials, which can increase computational demands and or the risk of overfitting. Furthermore, PCE requires specialized treatments to manage random variables that are not independent, and these treatments may be problem-dependent or may fail with increasing complexity. In this work, we adopt the spectral expansion formalism used in PCE; however, we replace the classical polynomial basis functions with neural network (NN) basis functions to leverage their expressivity. To achieve this, we propose an algorithm that identifies NN-parameterized basis functions in a purely data-driven manner, without any prior assumptions about the joint distribution of the random variables involved, whether independent or dependent. The proposed algorithm identifies each NN-parameterized basis function sequentially, ensuring they are orthogonal with respect to the data distribution. The basis functions are constructed directly on the joint stochastic variables without requiring a tensor product structure. This approach may offer greater flexibility for complex stochastic models, while simplifying implementation compared to the tensor product structures typically used in PCE to handle random vectors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme through several numerical examples of varying complexity and provide comparisons with classical PCE.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Benign Overfitting in Two-Layer Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent theoretical studies (Kou et al., 2023; Cao et al., 2022) have revealed a sharp phase transition from benign to harmful overfitting when the noise-to-feature ratio exceeds a threshold-a situation common in long-tailed data distributions where atypical data is prevalent. However, harmful overfitting rarely happens in overparameterized neural networks. Further experimental results suggested that memorization is necessary for achieving near-optimal generalization error in long-tailed data distributions (Feldman &amp; Zhang, 2020). We argue that this discrepancy between theoretical predictions and empirical observations arises because previous feature-noise data models overlook the heterogeneous nature of noise across different data classes. In this paper, we refine the feature-noise data model by incorporating class-dependent heterogeneous noise and re-examine the overfitting phenomenon in neural networks. Through a comprehensive analysis of the training dynamics, we establish test loss bounds for the refined model. Our findings reveal that neural networks can leverage "data noise", previously deemed harmful, to learn implicit features that improve the classification accuracy for long-tailed data. Experimental validation on both synthetic and real-world datasets supports our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Structural-Counterfactual Generation under Domain Shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the burgeoning interest in cross-domain learning, we present a novel generative modeling challenge: generating counterfactual samples in a target domain based on factual observations from a source domain. Our approach operates within an unsupervised paradigm devoid of parallel or joint datasets, relying exclusively on distinct observational samples and causal graphs for each domain. This setting presents challenges that surpass those of conventional counterfactual generation. Central to our methodology is the disambiguation of exogenous causes into effect-intrinsic and domain-intrinsic categories. This differentiation facilitates the integration of domain-specific causal graphs into a unified joint causal graph via shared effect-intrinsic exogenous variables. We propose leveraging Neural Causal models within this joint framework to enable accurate counterfactual generation under standard identifiability assumptions. Furthermore, we introduce a novel loss function that effectively segregates effect-intrinsic from domain-intrinsic variables during model training. Given a factual observation, our framework combines the posterior distribution of effect-intrinsic variables from the source domain with the prior distribution of domain-intrinsic variables from the target domain to synthesize the desired counterfactuals, adhering to Pearl's causal hierarchy. Intriguingly, when domain shifts are restricted to alterations in causal mechanisms without accompanying covariate shifts, our training regimen parallels the resolution of a conditional optimal transport problem. Empirical evaluations on a synthetic dataset show that our framework generates counterfactuals in the target domain that very closely resemble the ground truth.</description>

      <title>Unifying Explainable Anomaly Detection and Root Cause Analysis in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12086</link>

Abstract: Dynamical systems, prevalent in various scientific and engineering domains, are susceptible to anomalies that can significantly impact their performance and reliability. This paper addresses the critical challenges of anomaly detection, root cause localization, and anomaly type classification in dynamical systems governed by ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We define two categories of anomalies: cyber anomalies, which propagate through interconnected variables, and measurement anomalies, which remain localized to individual variables. To address these challenges, we propose the Interpretable Causality Ordinary Differential Equation (ICODE) Networks, a model-intrinsic explainable learning framework. ICODE leverages Neural ODEs for anomaly detection while employing causality inference through an explanation channel to perform root cause analysis (RCA), elucidating why specific time periods are flagged as anomalous. ICODE is designed to simultaneously perform anomaly detection, RCA, and anomaly type classification within a single, interpretable framework. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that anomalies alter the underlying ODEs of the system, manifesting as changes in causal relationships between variables. We provide a theoretical analysis of how perturbations in learned model parameters can be utilized to identify anomalies and their root causes in time series data. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of ICODE across various dynamical systems, showcasing its ability to accurately detect anomalies, classify their types, and pinpoint their origins.</description>

      <title>Using the Path of Least Resistance to Explain Deep Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated Gradients (IG), a widely used axiomatic path-based attribution method, assigns importance scores to input features by integrating model gradients along a straight path from a baseline to the input. While effective in some cases, we show that straight paths can lead to flawed attributions. In this paper, we identify the cause of these misattributions and propose an alternative approach that treats the input space as a Riemannian manifold, computing attributions by integrating gradients along geodesics. We call this method Geodesic Integrated Gradients (GIG). To approximate geodesic paths, we introduce two techniques: a k-Nearest Neighbours-based approach for smaller models and a Stochastic Variational Inference-based method for larger ones. Additionally, we propose a new axiom, Strong Completeness, extending the axioms satisfied by IG. We show that this property is desirable for attribution methods and that GIG is the only method that satisfies it. Through experiments on both synthetic and real-world data, we demonstrate that GIG outperforms existing explainability methods, including IG.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.00201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop theory and methods that use the graph Laplacian to analyze the geometry of the underlying manifold of datasets. Our theory provides theoretical guarantees and explicit bounds on the functional forms of the graph Laplacian when it acts on functions defined close to singularities of the underlying manifold. We use these explicit bounds to develop tests for singularities and propose methods that can be used to estimate geometric properties of singularities in the datasets.</description>

      <title>Manifold Learning with Sparse Regularised Optimal Transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Manifold learning is a central task in modern statistics and data science. Many datasets (cells, documents, images, molecules) can be represented as point clouds embedded in a high dimensional ambient space, however the degrees of freedom intrinsic to the data are usually far fewer than the number of ambient dimensions. The task of detecting a latent manifold along which the data are embedded is a prerequisite for a wide family of downstream analyses. Real-world datasets are subject to noisy observations and sampling, so that distilling information about the underlying manifold is a major challenge. We propose a method for manifold learning that utilises a symmetric version of optimal transport with a quadratic regularisation that constructs a sparse and adaptive affinity matrix, that can be interpreted as a generalisation of the bistochastic kernel normalisation.
  We prove that the resulting kernel is consistent with a Laplace-type operator in the continuous limit, establish robustness to heteroskedastic noise and exhibit these results in numerical experiments. We identify a highly efficient computational scheme for computing this optimal transport for discrete data and demonstrate that it outperforms competing methods in a set of examples.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis for General Probability Flow ODEs of Diffusion Models in Wasserstein Distances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Score-based generative modeling with probability flow ordinary differential equations (ODEs) has achieved remarkable success in a variety of applications. While various fast ODE-based samplers have been proposed in the literature and employed in practice, the theoretical understandings about convergence properties of the probability flow ODE are still quite limited. In this paper, we provide the first non-asymptotic convergence analysis for a general class of probability flow ODE samplers in 2-Wasserstein distance, assuming accurate score estimates and smooth log-concave data distributions. We then consider various examples and establish results on the iteration complexity of the corresponding ODE-based samplers. Our proof technique relies on spelling out explicitly the contraction rate for the continuous-time ODE and analyzing the discretization and score-matching errors using synchronous coupling; the challenge in our analysis mainly arises from the inherent non-autonomy of the probability flow ODE and the specific exponential integrator that we study.</description>

      <title>From Risk to Uncertainty: Generating Predictive Uncertainty Measures via Bayesian Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are various measures of predictive uncertainty in the literature, but their relationships to each other remain unclear. This paper uses a decomposition of statistical pointwise risk into components, associated with different sources of predictive uncertainty, namely aleatoric uncertainty (inherent data variability) and epistemic uncertainty (model-related uncertainty). Together with Bayesian methods, applied as an approximation, we build a framework that allows one to generate different predictive uncertainty measures.
  We validate our method on image datasets by evaluating its performance in detecting out-of-distribution and misclassified instances using the AUROC metric. The experimental results confirm that the measures derived from our framework are useful for the considered downstream tasks.</description>

      <title>Demystifying Spectral Bias on Real-World Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kernel ridge regression (KRR) and Gaussian processes (GPs) are fundamental tools in statistics and machine learning, with recent applications to highly over-parameterized deep neural networks. The ability of these tools to learn a target function is directly related to the eigenvalues of their kernel sampled on the input data distribution. Targets that have support on higher eigenvalues are more learnable. However, solving such eigenvalue problems on real-world data remains a challenge. Here, we consider cross-dataset learnability and show that one may use eigenvalues and eigenfunctions associated with highly idealized data measures to reveal spectral bias on complex datasets and bound learnability on real-world data. This allows us to leverage various symmetries that realistic kernels manifest to unravel their spectral bias.</description>

      <title>Provable Benefit of Annealed Langevin Monte Carlo for Non-log-concave Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the outstanding problem of sampling from an unnormalized density that may be non-log-concave and multimodal. To enhance the performance of simple Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, techniques of annealing type have been widely used. However, quantitative theoretical guarantees of these techniques are under-explored. This study takes a first step toward providing a non-asymptotic analysis of annealed MCMC. Specifically, we establish, for the first time, an oracle complexity of $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{d\beta^2{\cal A}^2}{\varepsilon^6}\right)$ for the simple annealed Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm to achieve $\varepsilon^2$ accuracy in Kullback-Leibler divergence to the target distribution $\pi\propto{\rm e}^{-V}$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $\beta$-smooth potential $V$. Here, ${\cal A}$ represents the action of a curve of probability measures interpolating the target distribution $\pi$ and a readily sampleable distribution.</description>

      <title>Distributed Learning with Discretely Observed Functional Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By selecting different filter functions, spectral algorithms can generate various regularization methods to solve statistical inverse problems within the learning-from-samples framework. This paper combines distributed spectral algorithms with Sobolev kernels to tackle the functional linear regression problem. The design and mathematical analysis of the algorithms require only that the functional covariates are observed at discrete sample points. Furthermore, the hypothesis function spaces of the algorithms are the Sobolev spaces generated by the Sobolev kernels, optimizing both approximation capability and flexibility. Through the establishment of regularity conditions for the target function and functional covariate, we derive matching upper and lower bounds for the convergence of the distributed spectral algorithms in the Sobolev norm. This demonstrates that the proposed regularity conditions are reasonable and that the convergence analysis under these conditions is tight, capturing the essential characteristics of functional linear regression. The analytical techniques and estimates developed in this paper also enhance existing results in the previous literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is the preferred framework for estimating parameters of intractable models in science and engineering. A significant challenge in this context is the large computational cost of simulating data from complex models, and the fact that this cost often depends on parameter values. We therefore propose \textit{cost-aware SBI methods} which can significantly reduce the cost of existing sampling-based SBI methods, such as neural SBI and approximate Bayesian computation. This is achieved through a combination of rejection and self-normalised importance sampling, which significantly reduces the number of expensive simulations needed. Our approach is studied extensively on models from epidemiology to telecommunications engineering, where we obtain significant reductions in the overall cost of inference.</description>

      <title>Spatial Conformal Inference through Localized Quantile Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification at unobserved spatial locations, especially in the presence of complex and heterogeneous datasets, remains a core challenge in spatial statistics. Traditional approaches like Kriging rely heavily on assumptions such as normality, which often break down in large-scale, diverse datasets, leading to unreliable prediction intervals. While machine learning methods have emerged as powerful alternatives, they primarily focus on point predictions and provide limited mechanisms for uncertainty quantification. Conformal prediction, a distribution-free framework, offers valid prediction intervals without relying on parametric assumptions. However, existing conformal prediction methods are either not tailored for spatial settings, or existing ones for spatial data have relied on rather restrictive i.i.d. assumptions. In this paper, we propose Localized Spatial Conformal Prediction (LSCP), a conformal prediction method designed specifically for spatial data. LSCP leverages localized quantile regression to construct prediction intervals. Instead of i.i.d. assumptions, our theoretical analysis builds on weaker conditions of stationarity and spatial mixing, which is natural for spatial data, providing finite-sample bounds on the conditional coverage gap and establishing asymptotic guarantees for conditional coverage. We present experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that LSCP achieves accurate coverage with significantly tighter and more consistent prediction intervals across the spatial domain compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Precise Asymptotics and Refined Regret of Variance-Aware UCB</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the behavior of the Upper Confidence Bound-Variance (UCB-V) algorithm for the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) problems, a variant of the canonical Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm that incorporates variance estimates into its decision-making process. More precisely, we provide an asymptotic characterization of the arm-pulling rates for UCB-V, extending recent results for the canonical UCB in Kalvit and Zeevi (2021) and Khamaru and Zhang (2024). In an interesting contrast to the canonical UCB, our analysis reveals that the behavior of UCB-V can exhibit instability, meaning that the arm-pulling rates may not always be asymptotically deterministic. Besides the asymptotic characterization, we also provide non-asymptotic bounds for the arm-pulling rates in the high probability regime, offering insights into the regret analysis. As an application of this high probability result, we establish that UCB-V can achieve a more refined regret bound, previously unknown even for more complicate and advanced variance-aware online decision-making algorithms.</description>

      <title>Estimating shared subspace with AJIVE: the power and limitation of multiple data matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrative data analysis often requires disentangling joint and individual variations across multiple datasets, a challenge commonly addressed by the Joint and Individual Variation Explained (JIVE) model. While numerous methods have been developed to estimate the shared subspace under JIVE, the theoretical understanding of their performance remains limited, particularly in the context of multiple matrices and varying degrees of subspace misalignment. This paper bridges this gap by providing a systematic analysis of shared subspace estimation in multi-matrix settings.
  We focus on the Angle-based Joint and Individual Variation Explained (AJIVE) method, a two-stage spectral approach, and establish new performance guarantees that uncover its strengths and limitations. Specifically, we show that in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, AJIVE's estimation error decreases with the number of matrices, demonstrating the power of multi-matrix integration. Conversely, in low-SNR settings, AJIVE exhibits a non-diminishing error, highlighting fundamental limitations. To complement these results, we derive minimax lower bounds, showing that AJIVE achieves optimal rates in high-SNR regimes. Furthermore, we analyze an oracle-aided spectral estimator to demonstrate that the non-diminishing error in low-SNR scenarios is a fundamental barrier. Extensive numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings, providing insights into the interplay between SNR, the number of matrices, and subspace misalignment.</description>

      <title>LITE: Efficiently Estimating Gaussian Probability of Maximality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing the probability of maximality (PoM) of a Gaussian random vector, i.e., the probability for each dimension to be maximal. This is a key challenge in applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to reinforcement learning, where the PoM not only helps with finding an optimal action, but yields a fine-grained analysis of the action domain, crucial in tasks such as drug discovery. Existing techniques are costly, scaling polynomially in computation and memory with the vector size. We introduce LITE, the first approach for estimating Gaussian PoM with almost-linear time and memory complexity. LITE achieves SOTA accuracy on a number of tasks, while being in practice several orders of magnitude faster than the baselines. This also translates to a better performance on downstream tasks such as entropy estimation and optimal control of bandits. Theoretically, we cast LITE as entropy-regularized UCB and connect it to prior PoM estimators.</description>

      <title>Improved Online Confidence Bounds for Multinomial Logistic Bandits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an improved online confidence bound for multinomial logistic (MNL) models and apply this result to MNL bandits, achieving variance-dependent optimal regret. Recently, Lee &amp; Oh (2024) established an online confidence bound for MNL models and achieved nearly minimax-optimal regret in MNL bandits. However, their results still depend on the norm-boundedness of the unknown parameter $B$ and the maximum size of possible outcomes $K$. To address this, we first derive an online confidence bound of $O\left(\sqrt{d \log t} + B \right)$, which is a significant improvement over the previous bound of $O (B \sqrt{d} \log t \log K )$ (Lee &amp; Oh, 2024). This is mainly achieved by establishing tighter self-concordant properties of the MNL loss and introducing a novel intermediary term to bound the estimation error. Using this new online confidence bound, we propose a constant-time algorithm, OFU-MNL++, which achieves a variance-dependent regret bound of $O \Big( d \log T \sqrt{ \smash[b]{\sum_{t=1}^T} \sigma_t^2 } \Big) $ for sufficiently large $T$, where $\sigma_t^2$ denotes the variance of the rewards at round $t$, $d$ is the dimension of the contexts, and $T$ is the total number of rounds. Furthermore, we introduce a Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)-based algorithm, OFU-MN$^2$L, which achieves an anytime poly(B)-free regret of $O \Big( d \log (BT) \sqrt{ \smash[b]{\sum_{t=1}^T} \sigma_t^2 } \Big) $.</description>

Abstract: Sensitive datasets are often underutilized in research and industry due to privacy concerns, limiting the potential of valuable data-driven insights. Synthetic data generation presents a promising solution to address this challenge by balancing privacy protection with data utility. This paper introduces a new approach to mitigate privacy risks associated with outlier observations in synthetic datasets: the Local Resampler (LR). The LR leverages the $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm to generate synthetic data while minimizing disclosure risks by underrepresenting outliers, even when they are not detectable in marginal distributions. Theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate that the LR effectively mitigates outlier-driven disclosure risks, and accurately replicates multimodal, skewed, and non-convex support distributions. The semiparametric nature of the LR ensures a low computational burden and works efficiently even with small samples. By parameterizing the balance between privacy risks and data utility, this approach promotes broader access to sensitive datasets for research.</description>

      <title>An Iterative Algorithm for Rescaled Hyperbolic Functions Regression</title>

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have numerous real-life applications across various domains, such as natural language translation, sentiment analysis, language modeling, chatbots and conversational agents, creative writing, text classification, summarization, and generation. LLMs have shown great promise in improving the accuracy and efficiency of these tasks, and have the potential to revolutionize the field of natural language processing (NLP) in the years to come. Exponential function based attention unit is a fundamental element in LLMs. Several previous works have studied the convergence of exponential regression and softmax regression.
  In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm to solve a rescaled version of the slightly different formulation of the softmax regression problem that arises in attention mechanisms of large language models. Specifically, we consider minimizing the squared loss between a certain function, which can be either the exponential function, hyperbolic sine function, or hyperbolic cosine function, and its inner product with a target $n$-dimensional vector $b$, scaled by the normalization term. This ``rescaled softmax regression'' differs from classical softmax regression in the location of the normalization factor.
  The efficiency and generalizability of this framework to multiple hyperbolic functions make it relevant for optimizing attention mechanisms. The analysis also leads to a corollary bounding solution changes under small perturbations for in-context learning. Limitations and societal impact are discussed.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains where erroneous predictions may lead to potentially catastrophic consequences, highlighting the need for learning systems to be aware of how confident they are in their own predictions: in other words, 'to know when they do not know'. In this paper, we propose a novel Random-Set Neural Network (RS-NN) approach to classification which predicts belief functions (rather than classical probability vectors) over the class list using the mathematics of random sets, i.e., distributions over the collection of sets of classes. RS-NN encodes the 'epistemic' uncertainty induced by training sets that are insufficiently representative or limited in size via the size of the convex set of probability vectors associated with a predicted belief function. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art Bayesian and Ensemble methods in terms of accuracy, uncertainty estimation and out-of-distribution (OoD) detection on multiple benchmarks (CIFAR-10 vs SVHN/Intel-Image, MNIST vs FMNIST/KMNIST, ImageNet vs ImageNet-O). RS-NN also scales up effectively to large-scale architectures (e.g. WideResNet-28-10, VGG16, Inception V3, EfficientNetB2 and ViT-Base-16), exhibits remarkable robustness to adversarial attacks and can provide statistical guarantees in a conformal learning setting.</description>

      <title>qPOTS: Efficient batch multiobjective Bayesian optimization via Pareto optimal Thompson sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical evolutionary approaches for multiobjective optimization are quite accurate but incur a lot of queries to the objectives; this can be prohibitive when objectives are expensive oracles. A sample-efficient approach to solving multiobjective optimization is via Gaussian process (GP) surrogates and Bayesian optimization (BO). Multiobjective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) involves the construction of an acquisition function which is optimized to acquire new observation candidates sequentially. This ``inner'' optimization can be hard due to various reasons: acquisition functions being nonconvex, nondifferentiable and/or unavailable in analytical form; batch sampling usually exacerbates these problems and the success of MOBO heavily relies on this inner optimization. This, ultimately, affects their sample efficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Thompson sampling (TS) based approach ($q\texttt{POTS}$). Whereas TS chooses candidates according to the probability that they are optimal, $q\texttt{POTS}$ chooses candidates according to the probability that they are Pareto optimal. Instead of a hard acquisition function optimization, $q\texttt{POTS}~$ solves a cheap multiobjective optimization on the GP posteriors with evolutionary approaches. This way we get the best of both worlds: accuracy of evolutionary approaches and sample-efficiency of MOBO. New candidates are chosen on the posterior GP Pareto frontier according to a maximin distance criterion. $q\texttt{POTS}~$ is endowed with theoretical guarantees, a natural exploration-exploitation trade-off, and superior empirical performance.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Convergence Guarantees for a General Class of Score-Based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) is a recent class of deep generative models with state-of-the-art performance in many applications. In this paper, we establish convergence guarantees for a general class of SGMs in 2-Wasserstein distance, assuming accurate score estimates and smooth log-concave data distribution. We specialize our result to several concrete SGMs with specific choices of forward processes modelled by stochastic differential equations, and obtain an upper bound on the iteration complexity for each model, which demonstrates the impacts of different choices of the forward processes. We also provide a lower bound when the data distribution is Gaussian. Numerically, we experiment SGMs with different forward processes, some of which are newly proposed in this paper, for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10. We find that the experimental results are in good agreement with our theoretical predictions on the iteration complexity, and the models with our newly proposed forward processes can outperform existing models.</description>

      <title>On diffusion-based generative models and their error bounds: The log-concave case with full convergence estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13584v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide full theoretical guarantees for the convergence behaviour of diffusion-based generative models under the assumption of strongly log-concave data distributions while our approximating class of functions used for score estimation is made of Lipschitz continuous functions avoiding any Lipschitzness assumption on the score function. We demonstrate via a motivating example, sampling from a Gaussian distribution with unknown mean, the powerfulness of our approach. In this case, explicit estimates are provided for the associated optimization problem, i.e. score approximation, while these are combined with the corresponding sampling estimates. As a result, we obtain the best known upper bound estimates in terms of key quantities of interest, such as the dimension and rates of convergence, for the Wasserstein-2 distance between the data distribution (Gaussian with unknown mean) and our sampling algorithm.
  Beyond the motivating example and in order to allow for the use of a diverse range of stochastic optimizers, we present our results using an $L^2$-accurate score estimation assumption, which crucially is formed under an expectation with respect to the stochastic optimizer and our novel auxiliary process that uses only known information. This approach yields the best known convergence rate for our sampling algorithm.</description>

      <title>On Temperature Scaling and Conformal Prediction of Deep Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many classification applications, the prediction of a deep neural network (DNN) based classifier needs to be accompanied by some confidence indication. Two popular approaches for that aim are: 1) Calibration: modifies the classifier's softmax values such that the maximal value better estimates the correctness probability; and 2) Conformal Prediction (CP): produces a prediction set of candidate labels that contains the true label with a user-specified probability, guaranteeing marginal coverage but not, e.g., per class coverage. In practice, both types of indications are desirable, yet, so far the interplay between them has not been investigated. Focusing on the ubiquitous Temperature Scaling (TS) calibration, we start this paper with an extensive empirical study of its effect on prominent CP methods. We show that while TS calibration improves the class-conditional coverage of adaptive CP methods, surprisingly, it negatively affects their prediction set sizes. Motivated by this behavior, we explore the effect of TS on CP beyond its calibration application and reveal an intriguing trend under which it allows to trade prediction set size and conditional coverage of adaptive CP methods. Then, we establish a mathematical theory that explains the entire non-monotonic trend. Finally, based on our experiments and theory, we offer simple guidelines for practitioners to effectively combine adaptive CP with calibration.</description>

      <title>How Uniform Random Weights Induce Non-uniform Bias: Typical Interpolating Neural Networks Generalize with Narrow Teachers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06323v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Background. A main theoretical puzzle is why over-parameterized Neural Networks (NNs) generalize well when trained to zero loss (i.e., so they interpolate the data). Usually, the NN is trained with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) or one of its variants. However, recent empirical work examined the generalization of a random NN that interpolates the data: the NN was sampled from a seemingly uniform prior over the parameters, conditioned on that the NN perfectly classifies the training set. Interestingly, such a NN sample typically generalized as well as SGD-trained NNs. Contributions. We prove that such a random NN interpolator typically generalizes well if there exists an underlying narrow ``teacher NN'' that agrees with the labels. Specifically, we show that such a `flat' prior over the NN parameterization induces a rich prior over the NN functions, due to the redundancy in the NN structure. In particular, this creates a bias towards simpler functions, which require less relevant parameters to represent -- enabling learning with a sample complexity approximately proportional to the complexity of the teacher (roughly, the number of non-redundant parameters), rather than the student's.</description>

      <title>Exploration by Optimization with Hybrid Regularizers: Logarithmic Regret with Adversarial Robustness in Partial Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial monitoring is a generic framework of online decision-making problems with limited feedback. To make decisions from such limited feedback, it is necessary to find an appropriate distribution for exploration. Recently, a powerful approach for this purpose, \emph{exploration by optimization} (ExO), was proposed, which achieves optimal bounds in adversarial environments with follow-the-regularized-leader for a wide range of online decision-making problems. However, a naive application of ExO in stochastic environments significantly degrades regret bounds. To resolve this issue in locally observable games, we first establish a new framework and analysis for ExO with a hybrid regularizer. This development allows us to significantly improve existing regret bounds of best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithms, which achieves nearly optimal bounds both in stochastic and adversarial environments. In particular, we derive a stochastic regret bound of $O(\sum_{a \neq a^*} k^2 m^2 \log T / \Delta_a)$, where $k$, $m$, and $T$ are the numbers of actions, observations and rounds, $a^*$ is an optimal action, and $\Delta_a$ is the suboptimality gap for action $a$. This bound is roughly $\Theta(k^2 \log T)$ times smaller than existing BOBW bounds. In addition, for globally observable games, we provide a new BOBW algorithm with the first $O(\log T)$ stochastic bound.</description>

      <title>Combining Evidence Across Filtrations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09698v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In sequential anytime-valid inference, any admissible procedure must be based on e-processes: generalizations of test martingales that quantify the accumulated evidence against a composite null hypothesis at any stopping time. This paper proposes a method for combining e-processes constructed in different filtrations but for the same null. Although e-processes in the same filtration can be combined effortlessly (by averaging), e-processes in different filtrations cannot because their validity in a coarser filtration does not translate to a finer filtration. This issue arises in sequential tests of randomness and independence, as well as in the evaluation of sequential forecasters. We establish that a class of functions called adjusters can lift arbitrary e-processes across filtrations. The result yields a generally applicable "adjust-then-combine" procedure, which we demonstrate on the problem of testing randomness in real-world financial data. Furthermore, we prove a characterization theorem for adjusters that formalizes a sense in which using adjusters is necessary. There are two major implications. First, if we have a powerful e-process in a coarsened filtration, then we readily have a powerful e-process in the original filtration. Second, when we coarsen the filtration to construct an e-process, there is a logarithmic cost to recovering validity in the original filtration.</description>

      <title>Fast Rates in Stochastic Online Convex Optimization by Exploiting the Curvature of Feasible Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore online convex optimization (OCO) and introduce a new condition and analysis that provides fast rates by exploiting the curvature of feasible sets. In online linear optimization, it is known that if the average gradient of loss functions exceeds a certain threshold, the curvature of feasible sets can be exploited by the follow-the-leader (FTL) algorithm to achieve a logarithmic regret. This study reveals that algorithms adaptive to the curvature of loss functions can also leverage the curvature of feasible sets. In particular, we first prove that if an optimal decision is on the boundary of a feasible set and the gradient of an underlying loss function is non-zero, then the algorithm achieves a regret bound of $O(\rho \log T)$ in stochastic environments. Here, $\rho &gt; 0$ is the radius of the smallest sphere that includes the optimal decision and encloses the feasible set. Our approach, unlike existing ones, can work directly with convex loss functions, exploiting the curvature of loss functions simultaneously, and can achieve the logarithmic regret only with a local property of feasible sets. Additionally, the algorithm achieves an $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret even in adversarial environments, in which FTL suffers an $\Omega(T)$ regret, and achieves an $O(\rho \log T + \sqrt{C \rho \log T})$ regret in corrupted stochastic environments with corruption level $C$. Furthermore, by extending our analysis, we establish a matching regret upper bound of $O\Big(T^{\frac{q-2}{2(q-1)}} (\log T)^{\frac{q}{2(q-1)}}\Big)$ for $q$-uniformly convex feasible sets, where uniformly convex sets include strongly convex sets and $\ell_p$-balls for $p \in [2,\infty)$. This bound bridges the gap between the $O(\log T)$ bound for strongly convex sets~($q=2$) and the $O(\sqrt{T})$ bound for non-curved sets~($q\to\infty$).</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotic Mean Square Error Optimality of Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02957v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) as generative priors have recently shown great potential for denoising tasks but lack theoretical understanding with respect to their mean square error (MSE) optimality. This paper proposes a novel denoising strategy inspired by the structure of the MSE-optimal conditional mean estimator (CME). The resulting DM-based denoiser can be conveniently employed using a pre-trained DM, being particularly fast by truncating reverse diffusion steps and not requiring stochastic re-sampling. We present a comprehensive (non-)asymptotic optimality analysis of the proposed diffusion-based denoiser, demonstrating polynomial-time convergence to the CME under mild conditions. Our analysis also derives a novel Lipschitz constant that depends solely on the DM's hyperparameters. Further, we offer a new perspective on DMs, showing that they inherently combine an asymptotically optimal denoiser with a powerful generator, modifiable by switching re-sampling in the reverse process on or off. The theoretical findings are thoroughly validated with experiments based on various benchmark datasets</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16883v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning graph generative models over latent spaces has received less attention compared to models that operate on the original data space and has so far demonstrated lacklustre performance. We present GLAD a latent space graph generative model. Unlike most previous latent space graph generative models, GLAD operates on a discrete latent space that preserves to a significant extent the discrete nature of the graph structures making no unnatural assumptions such as latent space continuity. We learn the prior of our discrete latent space by adapting diffusion bridges to its structure. By operating over an appropriately constructed latent space we avoid relying on decompositions that are often used in models that operate in the original data space. We present experiments on a series of graph benchmark datasets that demonstrates GLAD as the first equivariant latent graph generative method achieves competitive performance with the state of the art baselines.</description>

      <title>PHLP: Sole Persistent Homology for Link Prediction - Interpretable Feature Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Link prediction (LP), inferring the connectivity between nodes, is a significant research area in graph data, where a link represents essential information on relationships between nodes. Although graph neural network (GNN)-based models have achieved high performance in LP, understanding why they perform well is challenging because most comprise complex neural networks. We employ persistent homology (PH), a topological data analysis method that helps analyze the topological information of graphs, to interpret the features used for prediction. We propose a novel method that employs PH for LP (PHLP) focusing on how the presence or absence of target links influences the overall topology. The PHLP utilizes the angle hop subgraph and new node labeling called degree double radius node labeling (Degree DRNL), distinguishing the information of graphs better than DRNL. Using only a classifier, PHLP performs similarly to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on most benchmark datasets. Incorporating the outputs calculated using PHLP into the existing GNN-based SOTA models improves performance across all benchmark datasets. To the best of our knowledge, PHLP is the first method of applying PH to LP without GNNs. The proposed approach, employing PH while not relying on neural networks, enables the identification of crucial factors for improving performance.</description>

      <title>An Information Theoretic Perspective on Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02140v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a distribution-free uncertainty estimation framework that constructs prediction sets guaranteed to contain the true answer with a user-specified probability. Intuitively, the size of the prediction set encodes a general notion of uncertainty, with larger sets associated with higher degrees of uncertainty. In this work, we leverage information theory to connect conformal prediction to other notions of uncertainty. More precisely, we prove three different ways to upper bound the intrinsic uncertainty, as described by the conditional entropy of the target variable given the inputs, by combining CP with information theoretical inequalities. Moreover, we demonstrate two direct and useful applications of such connection between conformal prediction and information theory: (i) more principled and effective conformal training objectives that generalize previous approaches and enable end-to-end training of machine learning models from scratch, and (ii) a natural mechanism to incorporate side information into conformal prediction. We empirically validate both applications in centralized and federated learning settings, showing our theoretical results translate to lower inefficiency (average prediction set size) for popular CP methods.</description>

      <title>CViT: Continuous Vision Transformer for Operator Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Operator learning, which aims to approximate maps between infinite-dimensional function spaces, is an important area in scientific machine learning with applications across various physical domains. Here we introduce the Continuous Vision Transformer (CViT), a novel neural operator architecture that leverages advances in computer vision to address challenges in learning complex physical systems. CViT combines a vision transformer encoder, a novel grid-based coordinate embedding, and a query-wise cross-attention mechanism to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies. This design allows for flexible output representations and consistent evaluation at arbitrary resolutions. We demonstrate CViT's effectiveness across a diverse range of partial differential equation (PDE) systems, including fluid dynamics, climate modeling, and reaction-diffusion processes. Our comprehensive experiments show that CViT achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, often surpassing larger foundation models, even without extensive pretraining and roll-out fine-tuning. Taken together, CViT exhibits robust handling of discontinuous solutions, multi-scale features, and intricate spatio-temporal dynamics. Our contributions can be viewed as a significant step towards adapting advanced computer vision architectures for building more flexible and accurate machine learning models in the physical sciences.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Adaptive Learning Rate for FTRL in Online Learning with Minimax Regret of $\Theta(T^{2/3})$ and its Application to Best-of-Both-Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) is a powerful framework for various online learning problems. By designing its regularizer and learning rate to be adaptive to past observations, FTRL is known to work adaptively to various properties of an underlying environment. However, most existing adaptive learning rates are for online learning problems with a minimax regret of $\Theta(\sqrt{T})$ for the number of rounds $T$, and there are only a few studies on adaptive learning rates for problems with a minimax regret of $\Theta(T^{2/3})$, which include several important problems dealing with indirect feedback. To address this limitation, we establish a new adaptive learning rate framework for problems with a minimax regret of $\Theta(T^{2/3})$. Our learning rate is designed by matching the stability, penalty, and bias terms that naturally appear in regret upper bounds for problems with a minimax regret of $\Theta(T^{2/3})$. As applications of this framework, we consider three major problems with a minimax regret of $\Theta(T^{2/3})$: partial monitoring, graph bandits, and multi-armed bandits with paid observations. We show that FTRL with our learning rate and the Tsallis entropy regularizer improves existing Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) regret upper bounds, which achieve simultaneous optimality in the stochastic and adversarial regimes. The resulting learning rate is surprisingly simple compared to the existing learning rates for BOBW algorithms for problems with a minimax regret of $\Theta(T^{2/3})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models are capable of producing human-expert level content across a variety of topics and domains. As the impact of generative models grows, it is necessary to develop statistical methods to understand collections of available models. These methods are particularly important in settings where the user may not have access to information related to a model's pre-training data, weights, or other relevant model-level covariates. In this paper we extend recent results on representations of black-box generative models to model-level statistical inference tasks. We demonstrate that the model-level representations are effective for multiple inference tasks.</description>

      <title>Efficient PAC Learning of Halfspaces with Constant Malicious Noise Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01186v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding noise tolerance of machine learning algorithms is a central quest in learning theory. In this work, we study the problem of computationally efficient PAC learning of halfspaces in the presence of malicious noise, where an adversary can corrupt both instances and labels of training samples. The best-known noise tolerance either depends on a target error rate under distributional assumptions or on a margin parameter under large-margin conditions. In this work, we show that when both types of conditions are satisfied, it is possible to achieve constant noise tolerance by minimizing a reweighted hinge loss. Our key ingredients include: 1) an efficient algorithm that finds weights to control the gradient deterioration from corrupted samples, and 2) a new analysis on the robustness of the hinge loss equipped with such weights.</description>

      <title>Non-convergence to global minimizers in data driven supervised deep learning: Adam and stochastic gradient descent optimization provably fail to converge to global minimizers in the training of deep neural networks with ReLU activation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods - consisting of a class of deep neural networks (DNNs) trained by a stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization method - are nowadays key tools to solve data driven supervised learning problems. Despite the great success of SGD methods in the training of DNNs, it remains a fundamental open problem of research to explain the success and the limitations of such methods in rigorous theoretical terms. In particular, even in the standard setup of data driven supervised learning problems, it remained an open research problem to prove (or disprove) that SGD methods converge in the training of DNNs with the popular rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function with high probability to global minimizers in the optimization landscape. In this work we answer this question negatively. Specifically, in this work we prove for a large class of SGD methods that the considered optimizer does with high probability not converge to global minimizers of the optimization problem. It turns out that the probability to not converge to a global minimizer converges at least exponentially quickly to one as the width of the first hidden layer of the ANN and the depth of the ANN, respectively, increase. The general non-convergence results of this work do not only apply to the plain vanilla standard SGD method but also to a large class of accelerated and adaptive SGD methods such as the momentum SGD, the Nesterov accelerated SGD, the Adagrad, the RMSProp, the Adam, the Adamax, the AMSGrad, and the Nadam optimizers.</description>

      <title>On the Training Convergence of Transformers for In-Context Classification of Gaussian Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While transformers have demonstrated impressive capacities for in-context learning (ICL) in practice, theoretical understanding of the underlying mechanism enabling transformers to perform ICL is still in its infant stage. This work aims to theoretically study the training dynamics of transformers for in-context classification tasks. We demonstrate that, for in-context classification of Gaussian mixtures under certain assumptions, a single-layer transformer trained via gradient descent converges to a globally optimal model at a linear rate. We further quantify the impact of the training and testing prompt lengths on the ICL inference error of the trained transformer. We show that when the lengths of training and testing prompts are sufficiently large, the prediction of the trained transformer approaches the ground truth distribution of the labels. Experimental results corroborate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Equivalence of Bayesian Neural Networks and Gaussian Processes: On the Importance of Learning Activations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) provide a convenient framework for specifying function-space priors, making them a natural choice for modeling uncertainty. In contrast, Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) offer greater scalability and extendability but lack the advantageous properties of GPs. This motivates the development of BNNs capable of replicating GP-like behavior. However, existing solutions are either limited to specific GP kernels or rely on heuristics.
  We demonstrate that trainable activations are crucial for effective mapping of GP priors to wide BNNs. Specifically, we leverage the closed-form 2-Wasserstein distance for efficient gradient-based optimization of reparameterized priors and activations. Beyond learned activations, we also introduce trainable periodic activations that ensure global stationarity by design, and functional priors conditioned on GP hyperparameters to allow efficient model selection.
  Empirically, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches or matches performance of the heuristic methods, while offering stronger theoretical foundations.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Review of Machine Learning Approaches for Detecting Deceptive Activities on Social Media: Methods, Challenges, and Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram have facilitated the spread of misinformation, necessitating automated detection systems. This systematic review evaluates 36 studies that apply machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to detect fake news, spam, and fake accounts on social media. Using the Prediction model Risk Of Bias ASsessment Tool (PROBAST), the review identified key biases across the ML lifecycle: selection bias due to non-representative sampling, inadequate handling of class imbalance, insufficient linguistic preprocessing (e.g., negations), and inconsistent hyperparameter tuning. Although models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forests, and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks showed strong potential, over-reliance on accuracy as an evaluation metric in imbalanced data settings was a common flaw. The review highlights the need for improved data preprocessing (e.g., resampling techniques), consistent hyperparameter tuning, and the use of appropriate metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and AUROC. Addressing these limitations can lead to more reliable and generalizable ML/DL models for detecting deceptive content, ultimately contributing to the reduction of misinformation on social media.</description>

      <title>Conformation Generation using Transformer Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating three-dimensional conformations of a molecular graph allows insight into the molecule's biological and chemical functions. Fast generation of valid conformations is thus central to molecular modeling. Recent advances in graph-based deep networks have accelerated conformation generation from hours to seconds. However, current network architectures do not scale well to large molecules. Here we present ConfFlow, a flow-based model for conformation generation based on transformer networks. In contrast with existing approaches, ConfFlow directly samples in the coordinate space without enforcing any explicit physical constraints. The generative procedure is highly interpretable and is akin to force field updates in molecular dynamics simulation. When applied to the generation of large molecule conformations, ConfFlow improve accuracy by up to $40\%$ relative to state-of-the-art learning-based methods. The source code is made available at https://github.com/IntelLabs/ConfFlow.</description>

      <title>Categorical Data Clustering via Value Order Estimated Distance Metric Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Categorical data composed of qualitative valued attributes are ubiquitous in machine learning tasks. Due to the lack of well-defined metric space, categorical data distributions are difficult to be intuitively understood. Clustering is a popular data analysis technique suitable for data distribution understanding. However, the success of clustering often relies on reasonable distance metrics, which happens to be what categorical data naturally lack. This paper therefore introduces a new finding that the order relation among attribute values is the decisive factor in clustering accuracy, and is also the key to understanding categorical data clusters, because the essence of clustering is to order the clusters in terms of their admission to samples. To obtain the orders, we propose a new learning paradigm that allows joint learning of clusters and the orders. It alternatively partitions the data into clusters based on the distance metric built upon the orders and estimates the most likely orders according to the clusters. The algorithm achieves superior clustering accuracy with a convergence guarantee, and the learned orders facilitate the understanding of the non-intuitive cluster distribution of categorical data. Extensive experiments with ablation studies, statistical evidence, and case studies have validated the new insight into the importance of value order and the method proposition. The source code is temporarily opened in https://anonymous.4open.science/r/OCL-demo.</description>

      <title>Corrupted Learning Dynamics in Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning in games refers to scenarios where multiple players interact in a shared environment, each aiming to minimize their regret. An equilibrium can be computed at a fast rate of $O(1/T)$ when all players follow the optimistic follow-the-regularized-leader (OFTRL). However, this acceleration is limited to the honest regime, in which all players adhere to a prescribed algorithm -- a situation that may not be realistic in practice. To address this issue, we present corrupted learning dynamics that adaptively find an equilibrium at a rate that depends on the extent to which each player deviates from the strategy suggested by the prescribed algorithm. First, in two-player zero-sum corrupted games, we provide learning dynamics for which the external regret of $x$-player (and similarly for $y$-player) is roughly bounded by $O(\log (m_x m_y) + \sqrt{\hat{C}_y} + \hat{C}_x)$, where $m_x$ and $m_y$ denote the number of actions of $x$- and $y$-players, respectively, and $\hat{C}_x$ and $\hat{C}_y$ represent their cumulative deviations. We then extend our approach to multi-player general-sum corrupted games, providing learning dynamics for which the swap regret of player $i$ is bounded by $O(\log T + \sqrt{\sum_{k} \hat{C}_k \log T} + \hat{C}_i)$ ignoring dependence on the number of players and actions, where $\hat{C}_i$ is the cumulative deviation of player $i$ from the prescribed algorithm. Our learning dynamics are agnostic to the levels of corruption. A key technical contribution is a new analysis that ensures the stability of a Markov chain under a new adaptive learning rate, thereby allowing us to achieve the desired bound in the corrupted regime while matching the best existing bound in the honest regime. Notably, our framework can be extended to address not only corruption in strategies but also corruption in the observed expected utilities, and we provide several matching lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks: A Rank-Based Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Oversmoothing is a fundamental challenge in graph neural networks (GNNs): as the number of layers increases, node embeddings become increasingly similar, and model performance drops sharply. Traditionally, oversmoothing has been quantified using metrics that measure the similarity of neighbouring node features, such as the Dirichlet energy. While these metrics are related to oversmoothing, we argue they have critical limitations and fail to reliably capture oversmoothing in realistic scenarios. For instance, they provide meaningful insights only for very deep networks and under somewhat strict conditions on the norm of network weights and feature representations. As an alternative, we propose measuring oversmoothing by examining the numerical or effective rank of the feature representations. We provide theoretical support for this approach, demonstrating that the numerical rank of feature representations converges to one for a broad family of nonlinear activation functions under the assumption of nonnegative trained weights. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result that proves the occurrence of oversmoothing without assumptions on the boundedness of the weight matrices. Along with the theoretical findings, we provide extensive numerical evaluation across diverse graph architectures. Our results show that rank-based metrics consistently capture oversmoothing, whereas energy-based metrics often fail. Notably, we reveal that a significant drop in the rank aligns closely with performance degradation, even in scenarios where energy metrics remain unchanged.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e Inequality for Local Log-Polyak-Lojasiewicz Measures : Non-asymptotic Analysis in Low-temperature Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06862v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Potential functions in highly pertinent applications, such as deep learning in over-parameterized regime, are empirically observed to admit non-isolated minima. To understand the convergence behavior of stochastic dynamics in such landscapes, we propose to study the class of \logPLmeasure\ measures $\mu_\epsilon \propto \exp(-V/\epsilon)$, where the potential $V$ satisfies a local Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P\L) inequality, and its set of local minima is provably \emph{connected}. Notably, potentials in this class can exhibit local maxima and we characterize its optimal set S to be a compact $\mathcal{C}^2$ \emph{embedding submanifold} of $\mathbb{R}^d$ without boundary. The \emph{non-contractibility} of S distinguishes our function class from the classical convex setting topologically. Moreover, the embedding structure induces a naturally defined Laplacian-Beltrami operator on S, and we show that its first non-trivial eigenvalue provides an \emph{$\epsilon$-independent} lower bound for the \Poincare\ constant in the \Poincare\ inequality of $\mu_\epsilon$. As a direct consequence, Langevin dynamics with such non-convex potential $V$ and diffusion coefficient $\epsilon$ converges to its equilibrium $\mu_\epsilon$ at a rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon)$, provided $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. Here $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$ hides logarithmic terms.</description>

Abstract: Learning to sample from complex unnormalized distributions over discrete domains emerged as a promising research direction with applications in statistical physics, variational inference, and combinatorial optimization. Recent work has demonstrated the potential of diffusion models in this domain. However, existing methods face limitations in memory scaling and thus the number of attainable diffusion steps since they require backpropagation through the entire generative process. To overcome these limitations we introduce two novel training methods for discrete diffusion samplers, one grounded in the policy gradient theorem and the other one leveraging Self-Normalized Neural Importance Sampling (SN-NIS). These methods yield memory-efficient training and achieve state-of-the-art results in unsupervised combinatorial optimization. Numerous scientific applications additionally require the ability of unbiased sampling. We introduce adaptations of SN-NIS and Neural Markov Chain Monte Carlo that enable for the first time the application of discrete diffusion models to this problem. We validate our methods on Ising model benchmarks and find that they outperform popular autoregressive approaches. Our work opens new avenues for applying diffusion models to a wide range of scientific applications in discrete domains that were hitherto restricted to exact likelihood models.</description>
