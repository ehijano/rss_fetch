      <title>Frequency-selective beamforming and single-shot beam training with dynamic metasurface antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) beamform through low-powered components that enable reconfiguration of each radiating element.
  Previous research on a single-user multiple-input-single-output (MISO) system with a dynamic metasurface antenna at the transmitter has focused on maximizing the beamforming gain at a fixed operating frequency.
  The DMA, however, has a frequency-selective response that leads to magnitude degradation for frequencies away from the resonant frequency of each element.
  This causes reduction in beamforming gain if the DMA only operates at a fixed frequency.
  We exploit the frequency reconfigurability of the DMA to dynamically optimize both the operating frequency and the element configuration, maximizing the beamforming gain.
  We leverage this approach to develop a single-shot beam training procedure using a DMA sub-array architecture that estimates the receiver's angular direction with a single OFDM pilot signal.
  We evaluate the beamforming gain performance of the DMA array using the receiver's angular direction estimate obtained from beam training. Our results show that it is sufficient to use a limited number of resonant frequency states to do both beam training and beamforming instead of using an infinite resolution DMA beamformer.</description>

      <title>Spectral Efficiency of Low Earth Orbit Satellite Constellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the maximum downlink spectral efficiency of low earth orbit (LEO) constellations. Spectral efficiency, in this context, refers to the sum rate of the entire network per unit spectrum per unit area on the earth's surface. For practicality all links employ single-user codebooks and treat interference as noise. To estimate the maximum achievable spectral efficiency, we propose and analyze a regular configuration, which deploys satellites and ground terminals in hexagonal lattices. Additionally, for wideband networks with arbitrary satellite configurations, we introduce a subband allocation algorithm aimed at maximizing the overall spectral efficiency. Simulation results indicate that the regular configuration is more efficient than random configurations. As the number of randomly placed satellites increases within an area, the subband allocation algorithm achieves a spectral efficiency that approaches the spectral efficiency achieved by the regular configuration. Further improvements are demonstrated by reconfiguring associations so that nearby transmitters avoid pointing to the same area.</description>

      <title>Efficient Off-Grid Bayesian Parameter Estimation for Kronecker-Structured Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies the problem of jointly estimating unknown parameters from Kronecker-structured multidimensional signals, which arises in applications like intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided channel estimation. Exploiting the Kronecker structure, we decompose the estimation problem into smaller, independent subproblems across each dimension. Each subproblem is posed as a sparse recovery problem using basis expansion and solved using a novel off-grid sparse Bayesian learning (SBL)-based algorithm. Additionally, we derive probabilistic error bounds for the decomposition, quantify its denoising effect, and provide convergence analysis for off-grid SBL. Our simulations show that applying the algorithm to IRS-aided channel estimation improves accuracy and runtime compared to state-of-the-art methods through the low-complexity and denoising benefits of the decomposition step and the high-resolution estimation capabilities of off-grid SBL.</description>

      <title>Joint Coverage and Electromagnetic Field Exposure Analysis in Downlink and Uplink for RIS-assisted Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have shown the potential to improve signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) related coverage, especially at high-frequency communications. However, assessing electromagnetic filed exposure (EMFE) and establishing EMFE regulations in RIS-assisted large-scale networks are still open issues. This paper proposes a framework to characterize SINR and EMFE in such networks for downlink and uplink scenarios. Particularly, we carefully consider the association rule with the presence of RISs, accurate antenna pattern at base stations (BSs), fading model, and power control mechanism at mobile devices in the system model. Under the proposed framework, we derive the marginal and joint distributions of SINR and EMFE in downlink and uplink, respectively. The first moment of EMFE is also provided. Additionally, we design the compliance distance (CD) between a BS/RIS and a user to comply with the EMFE regulations. To facilitate efficient identification, we further provide approximate closed-form expressions for CDs. From numerical results of the marginal distributions, we find that in the downlink scenario, deploying RISs may not always be beneficial, as the improved SINR comes at the cost of increased EMFE. However, in the uplink scenario, RIS deployment is promising to enhance coverage while still maintaining EMFE compliance. By simultaneously evaluating coverage and compliance metrics through joint distributions, we demonstrate the feasibility of RISs in improving uplink and downlink performance. Insights from this framework can contribute to establishing EMFE guidelines and achieving a balance between coverage and compliance when deploying RISs.</description>

      <title>Differentiable High-Order Markov Models for Spectrum Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advent of deep learning and recurrent neural networks revolutionized the field of time-series processing. Therefore, recent research on spectrum prediction has focused on the use of these tools. However, spectrum prediction, which involves forecasting wireless spectrum availability, is an older field where many "classical" tools were considered around the 2010s, such as Markov models. This work revisits high-order Markov models for spectrum prediction in dynamic wireless environments. We introduce a framework to address mismatches between sensing length and model order as well as state-space complexity arising with large order. Furthermore, we extend this Markov framework by enabling fine-tuning of the probability transition matrix through gradient-based supervised learning, offering a hybrid approach that bridges probabilistic modeling and modern machine learning. Simulations on real-world Wi-Fi traffic demonstrate the competitive performance of high-order Markov models compared to deep learning methods, particularly in scenarios with constrained datasets containing outliers.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Communication Enhancement and Location Privacy Protection in RIS-Assisted Underwater Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the demand for underwater communication continues to grow, underwater acoustic RIS (UARIS), as an emerging paradigm in underwater acoustic communication (UAC), can significantly improve the communication rate of underwater acoustic systems. However, in open underwater environments, the location of the source node is highly susceptible to being obtained by eavesdropping nodes through correlation analysis, leading to the issue of location privacy in underwater communication systems, which has been overlooked by many studies. To enhance underwater communication and protect location privacy, we propose a novel UARIS architecture integrated with an artificial noise (AN) module. This architecture not only improves communication quality but also introduces noise to interfere with the eavesdroppers' attempts to locate the source node. We derive the Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) for the localization method deployed by the eavesdroppers and, based on this, model the UARIS-assisted communication scenario as a multi-objective optimization problem. This problem optimizes transmission beamforming, reflective precoding, and noise factors to maximize communication performance and location privacy protection. To efficiently solve this non-convex optimization problem, we develop an iterative algorithm based on fractional programming. Simulation results validate that the proposed system significantly enhances data transmission rates while effectively maintaining the location privacy of the source node in UAC systems.</description>

      <title>IRS Aided Federated Learning: Multiple Access and Fundamental Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided wireless federated learning (FL) system, where an access point (AP) coordinates multiple edge devices to train a machine leaning model without sharing their own raw data. During the training process, we exploit the joint channel reconfiguration via IRS and resource allocation design to reduce the latency of a FL task. Particularly, we propose three transmission protocols for assisting the local model uploading from multiple devices to an AP, namely IRS aided time division multiple access (I-TDMA), IRS aided frequency division multiple access (I-FDMA), and IRS aided non-orthogonal multiple access (INOMA), to investigate the impact of IRS on the multiple access for FL. Under the three protocols, we minimize the per-round latency subject to a given training loss by jointly optimizing the device scheduling, IRS phase-shifts, and communicationcomputation resource allocation. For the associated problem under I-TDMA, an efficient algorithm is proposed to solve it optimally by exploiting its intrinsic structure, whereas the highquality solutions of the problems under I-FDMA and I-NOMA are obtained by invoking a successive convex approximation (SCA) based approach. Then, we further develop a theoretical framework for the performance comparison of the proposed three transmission protocols. Sufficient conditions for ensuring that I-TDMA outperforms I-NOMA and those of its opposite are unveiled, which is fundamentally different from that NOMA always outperforms TDMA in the system without IRS. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings and also demonstrate the usefulness of IRS for enhancing the fundamental tradeoff between the learning latency and learning accuracy.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Blocking in mmWave Cellular Systems: Characterization of the LOS and NLOS Intervals in Urban Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the millimeter waves (mmWave) bands considered for 5G and beyond, the use of very high frequencies results in the interruption of communication whenever there is no line of sight between the transmitter and the receiver. Blockages have been modeled in the literature so far using tools such as stochastic geometry and random shape theory. Using these tools, in this paper, we characterize the lengths of the segments in line-of-sight (LOS) and in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) statistically in an urban scenario where buildings (with random positions, lengths, and heights) are deployed in parallel directions configuring streets.</description>

      <title>Effect of Correlated Building Blockages on the Ergodic Capacity of mmWave Systems in Urban Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mmWave bands, considered to support the forthcoming generation of mobile communications technologies, have a well-known vulnerability to blockages. Recent works in the literature analyze the blockage probability considering independence or correlation among the blocking elements of the different links. In this letter, we characterize the effect of blockages and their correlation on the ergodic capacity. We carry out the analysis for urban scenarios, where the considered blocking elements are buildings that are primarily parallel to the streets. We also present numerical simulations based on actual building features of the city of Chicago to validate the obtained expressions.</description>

      <title>Signal Processing over Time-Varying Graphs: A Systematic Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As irregularly structured data representations, graphs have received a large amount of attention in recent years and have been widely applied to various real-world scenarios such as social, traffic, and energy settings. Compared to non-graph algorithms, numerous graph-based methodologies benefited from the strong power of graphs for representing high-dimensional and non-Euclidean data. In the field of Graph Signal Processing (GSP), analogies of classical signal processing concepts, such as shifting, convolution, filtering, and transformations are developed. However, many GSP techniques usually postulate the graph is static in both signal and typology. This assumption hinders the effectiveness of GSP methodologies as the assumption ignores the time-varying properties in numerous real-world systems. For example, in the traffic network, the signal on each node varies over time and contains underlying temporal correlation and patterns worthy of analysis. To tackle this challenge, more and more work are being done recently to investigate the processing of time-varying graph signals. They cope with time-varying challenges from three main directions: 1) graph time-spectral filtering, 2) multi-variate time-series forecasting, and 3) spatiotemporal graph data mining by neural networks, where non-negligible progress has been achieved. Despite the success of signal processing and learning over time-varying graphs, there is no survey to compare and conclude the current methodology for GSP and graph learning. To compensate for this, in this paper, we aim to review the development and recent progress on signal processing and learning over time-varying graphs, and compare their advantages and disadvantages from both the methodological and experimental side, to outline the challenges and potential research directions for future research.</description>

      <title>MaintAGT:Sim2Real-Guided Multimodal Large Model for Intelligent Maintenance with Chain-of-Thought Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, large language models have made significant advancements in the field of natural language processing, yet there are still inadequacies in specific domain knowledge and applications. This paper Proposes MaintAGT, a professional large model for intelligent operations and maintenance, aimed at addressing this issue. The system comprises three key components: a signal-to-text model, a pure text model, and a multimodal model. Firstly, the signal-to-text model was designed to convert raw signal data into textual descriptions, bridging the gap between signal data and text-based analysis. Secondly, the pure text model was fine-tuned using the GLM4 model with specialized knowledge to enhance its understanding of domain-specific texts. Finally, these two models were integrated to develop a comprehensive multimodal model that effectively processes and analyzes both signal and textual data.The dataset used for training and evaluation was sourced from academic papers, textbooks, international standards, and vibration analyst training materials, undergoing meticulous preprocessing to ensure high-quality data. As a result, the model has demonstrated outstanding performance across multiple intelligent operations and maintenance tasks, providing a low-cost, high-quality method for constructing large-scale monitoring signal-text description-fault pattern datasets. Experimental results indicate that the model holds significant advantages in condition monitoring, signal processing, and fault diagnosis.In the constructed general test set, MaintAGT achieved an accuracy of 70%, surpassing all existing general large language models and reaching the level of an ISO Level III human vibration analyst.This advancement signifies a crucial step forward from traditional maintenance practices toward intelligent and AI-driven maintenance solutions.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS in Cognitive Radio Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of sixth-generation (6G) communication technologies is confronted with the significant challenge of spectrum resource shortage. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) aided multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) cognitive radio (CR) system. Specifically, the underlying secondary network in the proposed CR system reuses the same frequency resources occupied by the primary network with the help of the STAR-RIS. The secondary network sum rate maximization problem is first formulated for the STAR-RIS aided MIMO CR system. The adoption of STAR-RIS necessitates an intricate beamforming design for the considered system due to its large number of coupled coefficients. The block coordinate descent method is employed to address the formulated optimization problem. In each iteration, the beamformers at the secondary base station (SBS) are optimized by solving a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) problem. Concurrently, the STAR-RIS passive beamforming problem is resolved using tailored algorithms designed for the two phase-shift models: 1) For the independent phase-shift model, a successive convex approximation-based algorithm is proposed. 2) For the coupled phase-shift model, a penalty dual decomposition-based algorithm is conceived, in which the phase shifts and amplitudes of the STAR-RIS elements are optimized using closed-form solutions. Simulation results show that: 1) The proposed STAR-RIS aided CR communication framework can significantly enhance the sum rate of the secondary system. 2) The coupled phase-shift model results in limited performance degradation compared to the independent phase-shift model.</description>

      <title>STAR-RIS Aided Integrated Sensing, Computing, and Communication for Internet of Robotic Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) aided integrated sensing, computing, and communication (ISCC) Internet of Robotic Things (IoRT) framework is proposed. Specifically, the full-duplex (FD) base station (BS) simultaneously receives the offloading signals from decision robots (DRs) and carries out target robot (TR) sensing. A computation rate maximization problem is formulated to optimize the sensing and receive beamformers at the BS and the STAR-RIS coefficients under the BS power constraint, the sensing signal-to-noise ratio constraint, and STAR-RIS coefficients constraints. The alternating optimization (AO) method is adopted to solve the proposed optimization problem. With fixed STAR-RIS coefficients, the sub-problem with respect to sensing and receiving beamformer at the BS is tackled with the weighted minimum mean-square error method. Given beamformers at the BS, the sub-problem with respect to STAR-RIS coefficients is tacked with the penalty method and successive convex approximation method. The overall algorithm is guaranteed to converge to at least a stationary point of the computation rate maximization problem. Our simulation results validate that the proposed STAR-RIS aided ISCC IoRT system can enhance the sum computation rate compared with the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Pruned Convolutional Attention Network Based Wideband Spectrum Sensing with Sub-Nyquist Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wideband spectrum sensing (WSS) is critical for orchestrating multitudinous wireless transmissions via spectrum sharing, but may incur excessive costs of hardware, power and computation due to the high sampling rate. In this article, a deep learning based WSS framework embedding the multicoset preprocessing is proposed to enable the low-cost sub-Nyquist sampling. A pruned convolutional attention WSS network (PCA-WSSNet) is designed to organically integrate the multicoset preprocessing and the convolutional attention mechanism as well as to reduce the model complexity remarkably via the selective weight pruning without the performance loss. Furthermore, a transfer learning (TL) strategy benefiting from the model pruning is developed to improve the robustness of PCA-WSSNet with few adaptation samples of new scenarios. Simulation results show the performance superiority of PCA-WSSNet over the state of the art. Compared with direct TL, the pruned TL strategy can simultaneously improve the prediction accuracy in unseen scenarios, reduce the model size, and accelerate the model inference.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Vehicle Localization In Heterogeneous Mobile Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-latency and high-precision vehicle localization plays a significant role in enhancing traffic safety and improving traffic management for intelligent transportation. However, in complex road environments, the low latency and high precision requirements could not always be fulfilled due to the high complexity of localization computation. To tackle this issue, we propose a road-aware localization mechanism in heterogeneous networks (HetNet) of the mobile communication system, which enables real-time acquisition of vehicular position information, including the vehicular current road, segment within the road, and coordinates. By employing this multi-scale localization approach, the computational complexity can be greatly reduced while ensuring accurate positioning. Specifically, to reduce positioning search complexity and ensure positioning precision, roads are partitioned into low-dimensional segments with unequal lengths by the proposed singular point (SP) segmentation method. To reduce feature-matching complexity, distinctive salient features (SFs) are extracted sparsely representing roads and segments, which can eliminate redundant features while maximizing the feature information gain. The Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) of vehicle positioning errors is derived to verify the positioning accuracy improvement brought from the segment partition and SF extraction. Additionally, through SF matching by integrating the inclusion and adjacency position relationships, a multi-scale vehicle localization (MSVL) algorithm is proposed to identify vehicular road signal patterns and determine the real-time segment and coordinates. Simulation results show that the proposed multi-scale localization mechanism can achieve lower latency and high precision compared to the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>CAPA: Continuous-Aperture Arrays for Revolutionizing 6G Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a novel continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based wireless communication architecture is proposed, which relies on an electrically large aperture with a continuous current distribution. First, an existing prototype of CAPA is reviewed, followed by the potential benefits and key motivations for employing CAPAs in wireless communications. Then, three practical hardware implementation approaches for CAPAs are introduced based on electronic, optical, and acoustic materials. Furthermore, several beamforming approaches are proposed to optimize the continuous current distributions of CAPAs, which are fundamentally different from those used for conventional spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs). Numerical results are provided to demonstrate their key features in low complexity and near-optimality. Based on these proposed approaches, the performance gains of CAPAs over SPDAs are revealed in terms of channel capacity as well as diversity-multiplexing gains. Finally, several open research problems in CAPA are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Optimal Power Allocation in Uplink NOMA with Simultaneous Cache-Enabled D2D Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is widely viewed as a potential candidate for providing enhanced multiple access in future mobile networks by eliminating the orthogonal distribution of radio resources amongst the users. Nevertheless, the performance of NOMA can be significantly improved by combining it with other sophisticated technologies such as wireless data caching and device-to-device (D2D) communications. In this letter, we propose a novel cellular system model which integrates uplink NOMA with cache based device-to-device (D2D) communications. The proposed system would enable a cellular user to upload data file to base station while simultaneously exchanging useful cache content with another nearby user. We maximize the system sum rate by deriving closed form solutions for optimal power allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model over other potential combinations of uplink NOMA and D2D communications.</description>

      <title>Mutual Coupling in Dynamic Metasurface Antennas: Foe, but also Friend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs), surfaces patterned with reconfigurable metamaterial elements (meta-atoms) that couple waves from waveguides or cavities to free space, are a promising technology to realize 6G wireless base stations and access points with low cost and power consumption. Mutual coupling between the DMA's meta-atoms results in a non-linear dependence of the radiation pattern on the DMA configuration, significantly complicating modeling and optimization. Therefore, mutual coupling has to date been considered a vexing nuance that is frequently neglected in theoretical studies and deliberately mitigated in experimental prototypes. Here, we demonstrate the overlooked property of mutual coupling to boost the control over the DMA's radiation pattern. Based on a physics-compliant DMA model, we demonstrate that the radiation pattern's sensitivity to the DMA configuration significantly depends on the mutual coupling strength. We further evidence how the enhanced sensitivity under strong mutual coupling translates into a higher fidelity in radiation pattern synthesis, benefiting applications ranging from dynamic beamforming to end-to-end optimized sensing and imaging. Our insights suggest that DMA design should be fundamentally rethought to embrace the benefits of mutual coupling. We also discuss ensuing future research directions related to the frugal characterization of DMAs based on compact physics-compliant models.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Near-Field User Localization with Beam Squint in Wideband XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is gaining attention as a prominent technology for enabling the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. However, the vast antenna array and the huge bandwidth introduce a non-negligible beam squint effect, causing beams of different frequencies to focus at different locations. One approach to cope with this is to employ true-time-delay lines (TTDs)-based beamforming to control the range and trajectory of near-field beam squint, known as the near-field controllable beam squint (CBS) effect. In this paper, we investigate the user localization in near-field wideband XL-MIMO systems under the beam squint effect and spatial non-stationary properties. Firstly, we derive the expressions for Cram\'er-Rao Bounds (CRBs) for characterizing the performance of estimating both angle and distance. This analysis aims to assess the potential of leveraging CBS for precise user localization. Secondly, a user localization scheme combining CBS and beam training is proposed. Specifically, we organize multiple subcarriers into groups, directing beams from different groups to distinct angles or distances through the CBS to obtain the estimates of users' angles and distances. Furthermore, we design a user localization scheme based on a convolutional neural network model, namely ConvNeXt. This scheme utilizes the inputs and outputs of the CBS-based scheme to generate high-precision estimates of angle and distance. More importantly, our proposed ConvNeXt-based user localization scheme achieves centimeter-level accuracy in localization estimates.</description>

      <title>Extension of compressive sampling to binary vector recovery for model-based defect imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common imaging techniques for detecting structural defects typically require sampling at more than twice the spatial frequency to achieve a target resolution. This study introduces a novel framework for imaging structural defects using significantly fewer samples. In this framework, defects are modeled as regions where physical properties shift from their nominal values to resemble those of air, and a linear approximation is formulated to relate these binary shifts in physical properties with corresponding changes in measurements. Recovering a binary vector from linear measurements is generally an NP-hard problem. To address this challenge, this study proposes two algorithmic approaches. The first approach relaxes the binary constraint, using convex optimization to find a solution. The second approach incorporates a binary-inducing prior and employs approximate Bayesian inference to estimate the posterior probability of the binary vector given the measurements. Both algorithmic approaches demonstrate better performance compared to existing compressive sampling methods for binary vector recovery. The framework's effectiveness is illustrated through examples of eddy current sensing to image defects in metal structures.</description>

      <title>Distributionally Robust Power Policies for Wireless Systems under Power Fluctuation Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern wireless communication systems necessitate the development of cost-effective resource allocation strategies, while ensuring maximal system performance. While commonly realizable via efficient waterfilling schemes, ergodic-optimal policies often exhibit instantaneous resource constraint fluctuations as a result of fading variability, violating prescribed specifications possibly within unacceptable margins, inducing further operational challenges and/or costs. On the other extent, short-term-optimal policies -- commonly based on deterministic waterfilling-- while strictly maintaining operational specifications, are not only impractical and computationally demanding, but also suboptimal in a long-term sense. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel distributionally robust version of a classical point-to-point interference-free multi-terminal constrained stochastic resource allocation problem, by leveraging the Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) as a coherent measure of power policy fluctuation risk. We derive closed-form dual-parameterized expressions for the CVaR-optimal resource policy, along with corresponding optimal CVaR quantile levels by capitalizing on (sampling) the underlying fading distribution. We subsequently develop two dual-domain schemes -- one model-based and one model-free -- to iteratively determine a globally-optimal resource policy. Our numerical simulations confirm the remarkable effectiveness of the proposed approach, also revealing an almost-constant character of the CVaR-optimal policy and at rather minimal ergodic rate optimality loss.</description>

      <title>Multi-Functional RIS Integrated Sensing and Communications for 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS) that supports signal reflection, refraction, amplification, and target sensing simultaneously. Our MF-RIS aims to enhance integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) systems, particularly in multi-user and multi-target scenarios. Equipped with reflection and refraction components (i.e., amplifiers and phase shifters), MF-RIS is able to adjust the amplitude and phase shift of both communication and sensing signals on demand. Additionally, with the assistance of sensing elements, MF-RIS is capable of capturing the echo signals from multiple targets, thereby mitigating the signal attenuation typically associated with multi-hop links. We propose a MF-RIS-enabled multi-user and multi-target ISAC system, and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of sensing targets. This problem involves jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and MF-RIS configurations, subject to constraints on the communication rate, total power budget, and MF-RIS coefficients. We decompose the formulated non-convex problem into three sub-problems, and then solve them via an efficient iterative algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) The performance of MF-RIS varies under different operating protocols, and energy splitting (ES) exhibits the best performance in the considered MF-RIS-enabled multi-user multi-target ISAC system; 2) Under the same total power budget, the proposed MF-RIS with ES protocol attains 52.2%, 73.5% and 60.86% sensing SINR gains over active RIS, passive RIS, and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS), respectively; 3) The number of sensing elements will no longer improve sensing performance after exceeding a certain number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel two-stage method for constructing channel knowledge maps (CKMs) specifically for A2G (Aerial-to-Ground) channels in the presence of non-cooperative interfering nodes (INs). We first estimate the interfering signal strength (ISS) at sampling locations based on total received signal strength measurements and the desired communication signal strength (DSS) map constructed with environmental topology. Next, an ISS map construction network (IMNet) is proposed, where a negative value correction module is included to enable precise reconstruction. Subsequently, we further execute signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio map construction and IN localization. Simulation results demonstrate lower construction error of the proposed IMNet compared to baselines in the presence of interference.</description>

      <title>Linear stimulus reconstruction works on the KU Leuven audiovisual, gaze-controlled auditory attention decoding dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent paper, we presented the KU Leuven audiovisual, gaze-controlled auditory attention decoding (AV-GC-AAD) dataset, in which we recorded electroencephalography (EEG) signals of participants attending to one out of two competing speakers under various audiovisual conditions. The main goal of this dataset was to disentangle the direction of gaze from the direction of auditory attention, in order to reveal gaze-related shortcuts in existing spatial AAD algorithms that aim to decode the (direction of) auditory attention directly from the EEG. Various methods based on spatial AAD do not achieve significant above-chance performances on our AV-GC-AAD dataset, indicating that previously reported results were mainly driven by eye gaze confounds in existing datasets. Still, these adverse outcomes are often discarded for reasons that are attributed to the limitations of the AV-GC-AAD dataset, such as the limited amount of data to train a working model, too much data heterogeneity due to different audiovisual conditions, or participants allegedly being unable to focus their auditory attention under the complex instructions. In this paper, we present the results of the linear stimulus reconstruction AAD algorithm and show that high AAD accuracy can be obtained within each individual condition and that the model generalizes across conditions, across new subjects, and even across datasets. Therefore, we eliminate any doubts that the inadequacy of the AV-GC-AAD dataset is the primary reason for the (spatial) AAD algorithms failing to achieve above-chance performance when compared to other datasets. Furthermore, this report provides a simple baseline evaluation procedure (including source code) that can serve as the minimal benchmark for all future AAD algorithms evaluated on this dataset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on identification of the state noise density of a linear time-varying system described by the state-space model with the known measurement noise density. For this purpose, a novel method extending the capabilities of the measurement difference method (MDM) is proposed. The proposed method is based on the enhanced MDM residue calculation being a sum of the state and measurement noise, and on the construction of the residue sample kernel density. The state noise density is then estimated by the density deconvolution algorithm utilising the Fourier transform. The developed method is supplemented with automatic selection of the deconvolution user-defined parameters based on the proposed method of the noise moment equality. The state noise density estimation performance is evaluated in numerical examples and supplemented with the MALAB example implementation.</description>

      <title>Windowed Dictionary Design for Delay-Aware OMP Channel Estimation under Fractional Doppler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delay-Doppler (DD) signal processing has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing multipath and time-varying channel effects. Due to the inherent sparsity of the wireless channel in the DD domain, compressed sensing (CS) based techniques, such as orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), are commonly used for channel estimation. However, many of these methods assume integer Doppler shifts, which can lead to performance degradation in the presence of fractional Doppler. In this paper, we propose a windowed dictionary design technique while we develop a delay-aware orthogonal matching pursuit (DA-OMP) algorithm that mitigates the impact of fractional Doppler shifts on DD domain channel estimation. First, we apply receiver windowing to reduce the correlation between the columns of our proposed dictionary matrix. Second, we introduce a delay-aware interference block to quantify the interference caused by fractional Doppler. This approach removes the need for a pre-determined stopping criterion, which is typically based on the number of propagation paths, in conventional OMP algorithm. Our simulation results confirm the effective performance of our proposed DA-OMP algorithm using the proposed windowed dictionary in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) of the channel estimate. In particular, our proposed DA-OMP algorithm demonstrates substantial gains compared to standard OMP algorithm in terms of channel estimation NMSE with and without windowed dictionary.</description>

Abstract: Developing methods to process irregularly structured data is crucial in applications like gene-regulatory, brain, power, and socioeconomic networks. Graphs have been the go-to algebraic tool for modeling the structure via nodes and edges capturing their interactions, leading to the establishment of the fields of graph signal processing (GSP) and graph machine learning (GML). Key graph-aware methods include Fourier transform, filtering, sampling, as well as topology identification and spatiotemporal processing. Although versatile, graphs can model only pairwise dependencies in the data. To this end, topological structures such as simplicial and cell complexes have emerged as algebraic representations for more intricate structure modeling in data-driven systems, fueling the rapid development of novel topological-based processing and learning methods. This paper first presents the core principles of topological signal processing through the Hodge theory, a framework instrumental in propelling the field forward thanks to principled connections with GSP-GML. It then outlines advances in topological signal representation, filtering, and sampling, as well as inferring topological structures from data, processing spatiotemporal topological signals, and connections with topological machine learning. The impact of topological signal processing and learning is finally highlighted in applications dealing with flow data over networks, geometric processing, statistical ranking, biology, and semantic communication.</description>

      <title>Detection of Performance Interference Among Network Slices in 5G/6G Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies showed that network slices (NSs), which are logical networks supported by shared physical networks, can experience service interference due to sharing of physical and virtual resources. Thus, from the perspective of providing end-to-end (E2E) service quality assurance in 5G/6G systems, it is crucial to discover possible service interference among the NSs in a timely manner and isolate the potential issues before they can lead to violations of service quality agreements. We study the problem of detecting service interference among NSs in 5G/6G systems, only using E2E key performance indicator measurements, and propose a new algorithm. Our numerical studies demonstrate that, even when the service interference among NSs is weak to moderate, provided that a reasonable number of measurements are available, the proposed algorithm can correctly identify most of shared resources that can cause service interference among the NSs that utilize the shared resources.</description>

      <title>Joint Phase Time Array: Opportunities, Challenges and System Design Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to designing millimeter-wave (mmWave) cellular communication systems, based on joint phase time array (JPTA) radio frequency (RF) frontend architecture. JPTA architecture comprises time-delay components appended to conventional phase shifters, which offer extra degrees of freedom to be exploited for designing frequency-selective analog beams. Hence, a mmWave device equipped with JPTA can receive and transmit signals in multiple directions in a single time slot per RF chain, one direction per frequency subband, which alleviates the traditional constraint of one analog beam per transceiver chain per time slot. The utilization of subband-specific analog beams offers a new opportunity in designing mmWave systems, allowing for enhanced cell capacity and reduced pilot overhead. To understand the practical feasibility of JPTA, a few challenges and system design considerations are discussed in relation to the performance and complexity of the JPTA systems. For example, frequency-selective beam gain losses are present for the subband analog beams, e.g., up to 1 dB losses for 2 subband cases, even with the state-of-the-art JPTA delay and phase optimization methods. Despite these side effects, system-level analysis reveals that the JPTA system is capable of improving cell capacity: the 5%-tile throughput by up to 65%.</description>

      <title>Dual Prototyping with Domain and Class Prototypes for Affective Brain-Computer Interface in Unseen Target Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: EEG signals have emerged as a powerful tool in affective brain-computer interfaces, playing a crucial role in emotion recognition. However, current deep transfer learning-based methods for EEG recognition face challenges due to the reliance of both source and target data in model learning, which significantly affect model performance and generalization. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel framework (PL-DCP) and introduce the concepts of feature disentanglement and prototype inference. The dual prototyping mechanism incorporates both domain and class prototypes: domain prototypes capture individual variations across subjects, while class prototypes represent the ideal class distributions within their respective domains. Importantly, the proposed PL-DCP framework operates exclusively with source data during training, meaning that target data remains completely unseen throughout the entire process. To address label noise, we employ a pairwise learning strategy that encodes proximity relationships between sample pairs, effectively reducing the influence of mislabeled data. Experimental validation on the SEED and SEED-IV datasets demonstrates that PL-DCP, despite not utilizing target data during training, achieves performance comparable to deep transfer learning methods that require both source and target data. This highlights the potential of PL-DCP as an effective and robust approach for EEG-based emotion recognition.</description>

      <title>Virtual Sensing to Enable Real-Time Monitoring of Inaccessible Locations \&amp; Unmeasurable Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time monitoring of critical parameters is essential for energy systems' safe and efficient operation. However, traditional sensors often fail and degrade in harsh environments where physical sensors cannot be placed (inaccessible locations). In addition, there are important parameters that cannot be directly measured by sensors. We need machine learning (ML)-based real-time monitoring in those remote locations to ensure system operations. However, traditional ML models struggle to process continuous sensor profile data to fit model requirements, leading to the loss of spatial relationships. Another challenge for real-time monitoring is ``dataset shift" and the need for frequent retraining under varying conditions, where extensive retraining prohibits real-time inference. To resolve these challenges, this study addressed the limitations of real-time monitoring methods by enabling monitoring in locations where physical sensors are impractical to deploy. Our proposed approach, utilizing Multi-Input Operator Network virtual sensors, leverages deep learning to seamlessly integrate diverse data sources and accurately predict key parameters in real-time without the need for additional physical sensors. The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through thermal-hydraulic monitoring in a nuclear reactor subchannel, achieving remarkable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity and Uncertainty Informed Moment-Matching Gaussian Mixture Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many problems in navigation and tracking require increasingly accurate characterizations of the evolution of uncertainty in nonlinear systems. Nonlinear uncertainty propagation approaches based on Gaussian mixture density approximations offer distinct advantages over sampling based methods in their computational cost and continuous representation. State-of-the-art Gaussian mixture approaches are adaptive in that individual Gaussian mixands are selectively split into mixtures to yield better approximations of the true propagated distribution. Despite the importance of the splitting process to accuracy and computational efficiency, relatively little work has been devoted to mixand selection and splitting direction optimization. The first part of this work presents splitting methods that preserve the mean and covariance of the original distribution. Then, we present and compare a number of novel heuristics for selecting the splitting direction. The choice of splitting direction is informed by the initial uncertainty distribution, properties of the nonlinear function through which the original distribution is propagated, and a whitening based natural scaling method to avoid dependence of the splitting direction on the scaling of coordinates. We compare these novel heuristics to existing techniques in three distinct examples involving Cartesian to polar coordinate transformation, Keplerian orbital element propagation, and uncertainty propagation in the circular restricted three-body problem.</description>

      <title>AutoPQ: Automating Quantile estimation from Point forecasts in the context of sustainability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimizing smart grid operations relies on critical decision-making informed by uncertainty quantification, making probabilistic forecasting a vital tool. Designing such forecasting models involves three key challenges: accurate and unbiased uncertainty quantification, workload reduction for data scientists during the design process, and limitation of the environmental impact of model training. In order to address these challenges, we introduce AutoPQ, a novel method designed to automate and optimize probabilistic forecasting for smart grid applications. AutoPQ enhances forecast uncertainty quantification by generating quantile forecasts from an existing point forecast by using a conditional Invertible Neural Network (cINN). AutoPQ also automates the selection of the underlying point forecasting method and the optimization of hyperparameters, ensuring that the best model and configuration is chosen for each application. For flexible adaptation to various performance needs and available computing power, AutoPQ comes with a default and an advanced configuration, making it suitable for a wide range of smart grid applications. Additionally, AutoPQ provides transparency regarding the electricity consumption required for performance improvements. We show that AutoPQ outperforms state-of-the-art probabilistic forecasting methods while effectively limiting computational effort and hence environmental impact. Additionally and in the context of sustainability, we quantify the electricity consumption required for performance improvements.</description>

      <title>On autoregressive deep learning models for day-ahead wind power forecasting with irregular shutdowns due to redispatching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Renewable energies and their operation are becoming increasingly vital for the stability of electrical power grids since conventional power plants are progressively being displaced, and their contribution to redispatch interventions is thereby diminishing. In order to consider renewable energies like Wind Power (WP) for such interventions as a substitute, day-ahead forecasts are necessary to communicate their availability for redispatch planning. In this context, automated and scalable forecasting models are required for the deployment to thousands of locally-distributed onshore WP turbines. Furthermore, the irregular interventions into the WP generation capabilities due to redispatch shutdowns pose challenges in the design and operation of WP forecasting models. Since state-of-the-art forecasting methods consider past WP generation values alongside day-ahead weather forecasts, redispatch shutdowns may impact the forecast. Therefore, the present paper highlights these challenges and analyzes state-of-the-art forecasting methods on data sets with both regular and irregular shutdowns. Specifically, we compare the forecasting accuracy of three autoregressive Deep Learning (DL) methods to methods based on WP curve modeling. Interestingly, the latter achieve lower forecasting errors, have fewer requirements for data cleaning during modeling and operation while being computationally more efficient, suggesting their advantages in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Fine Grained Analysis and Optimization of Large Scale Automotive Radar Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) enabled by automotive radars have significantly enhanced vehicle safety and driver experience. However, the extensive use of radars in dense road conditions introduces mutual interference, which degrades detection accuracy and reliability. Traditional interference models are limited to simple highway scenarios and cannot characterize the performance of automotive radars in dense urban environments. In our prior work, we employed stochastic geometry (SG) to develop two automotive radar network models: the Poisson line Cox process (PLCP) for dense city centers and smaller urban zones and the binomial line Cox process (BLCP) to encompass both urban cores and suburban areas. In this work, we introduce the meta-distribution (MD) framework upon these two models to distinguish the sources of variability in radar detection metrics. Additionally, we optimize the radar beamwidth and transmission probability to maximize the number of successful detections of a radar node in the network. Further, we employ a computationally efficient Chebyshev-Markov (CM) bound method for reconstructing MDs, achieving higher accuracy than the conventional Gil-Pelaez theorem. Using the framework, we analyze the specific impacts of beamwidth, detection range, and interference on radar detection performance and offer practical insights for developing adaptive radar systems tailored to diverse traffic and environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>Automatic Differentiation-based Full Waveform Inversion with Flexible Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full waveform inversion (FWI) is able to construct high-resolution subsurface models by iteratively minimizing discrepancies between observed and simulated seismic data. However, its implementation can be rather involved for complex wave equations, objective functions, or regularization. Recently, automatic differentiation (AD) has proven to be effective in simplifying solutions of various inverse problems, including FWI. In this study, we present an open-source AD-based FWI framework (ADFWI), which is designed to simplify the design, development, and evaluation of novel approaches in FWI with flexibility. The AD-based framework not only includes forword modeling and associated gradient computations for wave equations in various types of media from isotropic acoustic to vertically or horizontally transverse isotropic elastic, but also incorporates a suite of objective functions, regularization techniques, and optimization algorithms. By leveraging state-of-the-art AD, objective functions such as soft dynamic time warping and Wasserstein distance, which are difficult to apply in traditional FWI are also easily integrated into ADFWI. In addition, ADFWI is integrated with deep learning for implicit model reparameterization via neural networks, which not only introduces learned regularization but also allows rapid estimation of uncertainty through dropout. To manage high memory demands in large-scale inversion associated with AD, the proposed framework adopts strategies such as mini-batch and checkpointing. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the novelty, practicality and robustness of ADFWI, which can be used to address challenges in FWI and as a workbench for prompt experiments and the development of new inversion strategies.</description>

      <title>Joint Beam Scheduling and Resource Allocation for Flexible RSMA-aided Near-Field Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supporting immense throughput and ubiquitous connectivity holds paramount importance for future wireless networks. To this end, this letter focuses on how the spatial beams configured for legacy near-field (NF) users can be leveraged to serve extra NF or far-field users while ensuring the rate requirements of legacy NF users. In particular, a flexible rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) scheme is proposed to efficiently manage interference, which carefully selects a subset of legacy users to decode the common stream. Beam scheduling, power allocation, common rate allocation, and user selection are jointly optimized to maximize the sum rate of additional users. To solve the formulated discrete non-convex problem, it is split into three subproblems. The accelerated bisection searching, quadratic transform, and simulated annealing approaches are developed to attack them. Simulation results reveal that the proposed transmit scheme and algorithm achieve significant gains over three competing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>A novel algorithm for the decomposition of non-stationary multidimensional and multivariate signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decomposition of a signal is a fundamental tool in many fields of research, including signal processing, geophysics, astrophysics, engineering, medicine, and many more. By breaking down complex signals into simpler oscillatory components we can enhance the understanding and processing of the data, unveiling hidden information contained in them. Traditional methods, such as Fourier analysis and wavelet transforms, which are effective in handling mono-dimensional stationary signals struggle with non-stationary data sets and they require, this is the case of the wavelet, the selection of predefined basis functions. In contrast, the Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) method and its variants, such as Iterative Filtering (IF), have emerged as effective nonlinear approaches, adapting to signals without any need for a priori assumptions. To accelerate these methods, the Fast Iterative Filtering (FIF) algorithm was developed, and further extensions, such as Multivariate FIF (MvFIF) and Multidimensional FIF (FIF2), have been proposed to handle higher-dimensional data.
  In this work, we introduce the Multidimensional and Multivariate Fast Iterative Filtering (MdMvFIF) technique, an innovative method that extends FIF to handle data that vary simultaneously in space and time. This new algorithm is capable of extracting Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs) from complex signals that vary in both space and time, overcoming limitations found in prior methods. The potentiality of the proposed method is demonstrated through applications to artificial and real-life signals, highlighting its versatility and effectiveness in decomposing multidimensional and multivariate nonstationary signals. The MdMvFIF method offers a powerful tool for advanced signal analysis across many scientific and engineering disciplines.</description>

      <title>Flexible Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter presents a flexible rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) framework for near-field (NF) integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). The spatial beams configured to meet the communication rate requirements of NF users are simultaneously leveraged to sense an additional NF target. A key innovation lies in its flexibility to select a subset of users for decoding the common stream, enhancing interference management and system performance. The system is designed by minimizing the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) for joint distance and angle estimation through optimized power allocation, common rate allocation, and user selection. This leads to a discrete, non-convex optimization problem. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the preconfigured beams are sufficient for target sensing, eliminating the need for additional probing signals. To solve the optimization problem, an iterative algorithm is proposed combining the quadratic transform and simulated annealing. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms conventional RSMA and space division multiple access (SDMA), reducing distance and angle estimation errors by approximately 100\% and 20\%, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remote estimation is a crucial element of real time monitoring of a stochastic process. While most of the existing works have concentrated on obtaining optimal sampling strategies, motivated by malicious attacks on cyber-physical systems, we model sensing under surveillance as a game between an attacker and a defender. This introduces strategic elements to conventional remote estimation problems. Additionally, inspired by increasing detection capabilities, we model an element of information leakage for each player. Parameterizing the game in terms of uncertainty on each side, information leakage, and cost of sampling, we consider the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE) concept where one of the players acts as the leader and the other one as the follower. By focusing our attention on stationary probabilistic sampling policies, we characterize the SE of this game and provide simulations to show the efficacy of our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From 5G onwards, Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) have emerged as a key component of future network architectures. Leveraging Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, NTNs are capable of building a space Internet and present a paradigm shift in delivering mobile services to even the most remote regions on Earth. However, the extensive coverage and rapid movement of LEO satellites pose unique challenges for NTN networking, including user equipment (UE) access and inter-satellite delivery, which directly impact the quality of service (QoS) and data transmission continuity. This paper offers an in-depth review of advanced NTN management technologies in the context of 6G evolution, focusing on radio resource management, mobility management, and dynamic network slicing. Building on this foundation and considering the latest trends in NTN development, we then present some innovative perspectives to emerging challenges in satellite beamforming, handover mechanisms, and inter-satellite transmissions. Lastly, we identify open research issues and propose future directions aimed at advancing satellite Internet deployment and enhancing NTN performance.</description>

      <title>Toward Real-Time Edge AI: Model-Agnostic Task-Oriented Communication with Visual Feature Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task-oriented communication presents a promising approach to improve the communication efficiency of edge inference systems by optimizing learning-based modules to extract and transmit relevant task information. However, real-time applications face practical challenges, such as incomplete coverage and potential malfunctions of edge servers. This situation necessitates cross-model communication between different inference systems, enabling edge devices from one service provider to collaborate effectively with edge servers from another. Independent optimization of diverse edge systems often leads to incoherent feature spaces, which hinders the cross-model inference for existing task-oriented communication. To facilitate and achieve effective cross-model task-oriented communication, this study introduces a novel framework that utilizes shared anchor data across diverse systems. This approach addresses the challenge of feature alignment in both server-based and on-device scenarios. In particular, by leveraging the linear invariance of visual features, we propose efficient server-based feature alignment techniques to estimate linear transformations using encoded anchor data features. For on-device alignment, we exploit the angle-preserving nature of visual features and propose to encode relative representations with anchor data to streamline cross-model communication without additional alignment procedures during the inference. The experimental results on computer vision benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed feature alignment approaches in cross-model task-oriented communications. The runtime and computation overhead analysis further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed feature alignment approaches in real-time applications.</description>

      <title>Personalized Coupled Tensor Decomposition for Multimodal Data Fusion: Uniqueness and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled tensor decompositions (CTDs) perform data fusion by linking factors from different datasets. Although many CTDs have been already proposed, current works do not address important challenges of data fusion, where: 1) the datasets are often heterogeneous, constituting different "views" of a given phenomena (multimodality); and 2) each dataset can contain personalized or dataset-specific information, constituting distinct factors that are not coupled with other datasets. In this work, we introduce a personalized CTD framework tackling these challenges. A flexible model is proposed where each dataset is represented as the sum of two components, one related to a common tensor through a multilinear measurement model, and another specific to each dataset. Both the common and distinct components are assumed to admit a polyadic decomposition. This generalizes several existing CTD models. We provide conditions for specific and generic uniqueness of the decomposition that are easy to interpret. These conditions employ uni-mode uniqueness of different individual datasets and properties of the measurement model. Two algorithms are proposed to compute the common and distinct components: a semi-algebraic one and a coordinate-descent optimization method. Experimental results illustrate the advantage of the proposed framework compared with the state of the art approaches.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full-vectorial finite difference method with perfectly matched layers boundaries is used to identify the single mode operation region of submicron rib waveguides fabricated using sili-con-on-insulator material system. Achieving high mode power confinement factors is emphasized while maintaining the single mode operation. As opposed to the case of large cross-section rib waveguides, theoretical single mode conditions have been demonstrated to hold for sub-micron waveguides with accuracy approaching 100%. Both, the deeply and the shallowly etched rib waveguides have been considered and the single mode condition for entire sub-micrometer range is presented while adhering to design specific mode confinement requirements.</description>

      <title>6DMA-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA)-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system to fully exploit its macro spatial diversity, where a set of distributed access points (APs), each equipped with multiple 6DMA surfaces, cooperatively serve all users in a given area. Connected to a central processing unit (CPU) via fronthaul links, 6DMA-APs can optimize their combining vectors for decoding the users' information based on either local channel state information (CSI) or global CSI shared among them. We aim to maximize the average achievable sum-rate via jointly optimizing the rotation angles of all 6DMA surfaces at all APs, based on the users' spatial distribution. Since the formulated problem is non-convex and highly non-linear, we propose a Bayesian optimization-based algorithm to solve it efficiently. Simulation results show that, by enhancing signal power and mitigating interference through reduced channel cross-correlation among users, 6DMA-APs with optimized rotations can significantly improve the average sum-rate, as compared to the conventional cell-free network with fixed-position antennas and that with only a single centralized AP with optimally rotated 6DMAs, especially when the user distribution is more spatially diverse.</description>

      <title>Full 3D Model of Modulation Efficiency of Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) Compatible, Submicron, Interleaved Junction Optical Phase Shifters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Performance optimization associated with optical modulators requires reasonably accurate predictive models for key figures of merit. Interleaved PN-junction topology offers the maximum mode/junction overlap and is the most efficient modulator in depletion-mode of operation. Due to its structure, the accurate modelling process must be fully three-dimensional, which is a nontrivial computational problem. This paper presents a rigorous 3D model for the modulation efficiency of silicon-on-insulator interleaved junction optical phase modulators with submicron dimensions. Solution of Drift-Diffusion and Poisson equations were carried out on 3D finite-element-mesh and Maxwell equations were solved using Finite-Difference-Time-Domain (FDTD) method on 3D Yee-cells. Whole of the modelling process has been detailed and all the coefficients required in the model are presented. Model validation suggests &lt; 10% RMS error.</description>

      <title>EH from V2X Communications: the Price of Uncertainty and the Impact of Platooning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how radio frequency energy from vehicular communications can be exploited by an energy harvesting device (EHD) placed alongside the road to deliver data packets through wireless connection to a remote Access Point.
  Based on updated local topology knowledge, we propose a cycle-based strategy to balance harvest and transmit phases at the EHD, in order to maximize the average throughput.
  A theoretical derivation is carried out to determine the optimal strategy parameters setting, and used to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over different scenarios, taking into account the road traffic intensity, the EHD battery capacity, the transmit power and the data rate. Results show that regular traffic patterns, as those created by vehicles platooning, can increase the obtained throughput by more than 30% with respect to irregular ones with the same average intensity.
  Black out probability is also derived for the former scenario. The resulting tradeoff between higher average throughput and lower black out probability shows that the proposed approach can be adopted for different applications by properly tuning the strategy parameters.</description>

      <title>Outstanding framework for simulating and generating anchor trajectory in wireless sensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a framework that has the ability to animate and generate different scenarios for the mobility of a movable anchor which can follow various paths in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). When the researchers use NS-2 to simulate a single anchor-assisted localization model, they face the problem of creating the movement file of the movable anchor. The proposed framework solved this problem by allowing them to create the movement scenario regarding different trajectories. The proposed framework lets the researcher set the needed parameters for simulating various static path models, which can be displayed through the graphical user interface. The researcher can also view the mobility of the movable anchor with control of its speed and communication range. The proposed framework has been validated by comparing its results to NS-2 outputs plus comparing it against existing tools. Finally, this framework has been published on the Code Project website and downloaded by many users.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Time Division Duplexing Slot Allocation and Scheduling in Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) and terrestrial networks (TNs) is fundamental for extending connectivity to rural and underserved areas that lack coverage from traditional cellular infrastructure. However, this integration presents several challenges. For instance, TNs mainly operate in Time Division Duplexing (TDD). However, for NTN via satellites, TDD is complicated due to synchronization problems in large cells, and the significant impact of guard periods and long propagation delays. In this paper, we propose a novel slot allocation mechanism to enable TDD in NTN. This approach permits to allocate additional transmissions during the guard period between a downlink slot and the corresponding uplink slot to reduce the overhead, provided that they do not interfere with other concurrent transmissions. Moreover, we propose two scheduling methods to select the users that transmit based on considerations related to the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) or the propagation delay. Simulations demonstrate that our proposal can increase the network capacity compared to a benchmark scheme that does not schedule transmissions in guard periods.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Dimensionality Reduction for Channel Charting with Geodesic Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Channel Charting is a dimensionality reduction technique that learns to reconstruct a low-dimensional, physically interpretable map of the radio environment by taking advantage of similarity relationships found in high-dimensional channel state information. One particular family of Channel Charting methods relies on pseudo-distances between measured CSI datapoints, computed using dissimilarity metrics. We suggest several techniques to improve the performance of dissimilarity metric-based Channel Charting. For one, we address an issue related to a discrepancy between Euclidean distances and geodesic distances that occurs when applying dissimilarity metric-based Channel Charting to datasets with nonconvex low-dimensional structure. Furthermore, we incorporate the uncertainty of dissimilarities into the learning process by modeling dissimilarities not as deterministic quantities, but as probability distributions. Our framework facilitates the combination of multiple dissimilarity metrics in a consistent manner. Additionally, latent space dynamics like constrained acceleration due to physical inertia are easily taken into account thanks to changes in the training procedure. We demonstrate the achieved performance improvements for localization applications on a measured channel dataset</description>

      <title>Structure-Guided Input Graph for GNNs facing Heterophily</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising tool to handle data exhibiting an irregular structure. However, most GNN architectures perform well on homophilic datasets, where the labels of neighboring nodes are likely to be the same. In recent years, an increasing body of work has been devoted to the development of GNN architectures for heterophilic datasets, where labels do not exhibit this low-pass behavior. In this work, we create a new graph in which nodes are connected if they share structural characteristics, meaning a higher chance of sharing their labels, and then use this new graph in the GNN architecture. To do this, we compute the k-nearest neighbors graph according to distances between structural features, which are either (i) role-based, such as degree, or (ii) global, such as centrality measures. Experiments show that the labels are smoother in this newly defined graph and that the performance of GNN architectures improves when using this alternative structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One significant challenge in research is to collect a large amount of data and learn the underlying relationship between the input and the output variables. This paper outlines the process of collecting and validating a dataset designed to determine the angle of arrival (AoA) using Bluetooth low energy (BLE) technology. The data, collected in a laboratory setting, is intended to approximate real-world industrial scenarios. This paper discusses the data collection process, the structure of the dataset, and the methodology adopted for automating sample labeling for supervised learning. The collected samples and the process of generating ground truth (GT) labels were validated using the Texas Instruments (TI) phase difference of arrival (PDoA) implementation on the data, yielding a mean absolute error (MAE) at one of the heights without obstacles of $25.71^\circ$. The distance estimation on BLE was implemented using a Gaussian Process Regression algorithm, yielding an MAE of $0.174$m.</description>

      <title>Efficient Semantic Communication Through Transformer-Aided Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers, known for their attention mechanisms, have proven highly effective in focusing on critical elements within complex data. This feature can effectively be used to address the time-varying channels in wireless communication systems. In this work, we introduce a channel-aware adaptive framework for semantic communication, where different regions of the image are encoded and compressed based on their semantic content. By employing vision transformers, we interpret the attention mask as a measure of the semantic contents of the patches and dynamically categorize the patches to be compressed at various rates as a function of the instantaneous channel bandwidth. Our method enhances communication efficiency by adapting the encoding resolution to the content's relevance, ensuring that even in highly constrained environments, critical information is preserved. We evaluate the proposed adaptive transmission framework using the TinyImageNet dataset, measuring both reconstruction quality and accuracy. The results demonstrate that our approach maintains high semantic fidelity while optimizing bandwidth, providing an effective solution for transmitting multi-resolution data in limited bandwidth conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2002.01733v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the framework of 5G, blockage effects occurring in the mmWave band are critical. Previous works describe the effects of blockages in isolated and multiple links for simple blocking objects, modeled with mathematical tools such as stochastic geometry and random shape theory. Our study uses these tools to characterize a scenario with $N$ links, including the possible correlation among them in terms of blocking for several models of blocking objects. We include numerical evaluations highlighting that assuming independence among the links' blocking elements is a too-brief simplification and does not accurately describe the real scenario. This paper also applies the formulation developed for the case of $N$ links to optimize the relay positioning in mmWave cells for coverage enhancement, that is, to minimize the communication failure probability. We also show that both link budget and blockages affect the optimum positioning of the relays as they are both essential for successful transmission.</description>

      <title>Robust Time-Varying Graph Signal Recovery for Dynamic Physical Sensor Network Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a time-varying graph signal recovery method for estimating the true time-varying graph signal from corrupted observations by leveraging dynamic graphs. Most of the conventional methods for time-varying graph signal recovery have been proposed under the assumption that the underlying graph that houses the signals is static. However, in light of rapid advances in sensor technology, the assumption that sensor networks are time-varying like the signals is becoming a very practical problem setting. In this paper, we focus on such cases and formulate dynamic graph signal recovery as a constrained convex optimization problem that simultaneously estimates both time-varying graph signals and sparsely modeled outliers. In our formulation, we use two types of regularizations, time-varying graph Laplacian-based and temporal differencebased, and also separately modeled missing values with known positions and unknown outliers to achieve robust estimations from highly degraded data. In addition, an algorithm is developed to efficiently solve the optimization problem based on a primaldual splitting method. Extensive experiments on simulated drone remote sensing data and real-world sea surface temperature data demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over existing methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.00168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing demand for optimal and low-power energy consumption paradigms for IOT devices has garnered significant attention due to their cost-effectiveness, simplicity, and intelligibility. In this article, an AI hardware energy-efficient framework to achieve optimal energy savings in heterogeneous computing through appropriate power consumption management is proposed. The deep reinforcement learning framework is employed, utilising the Actor-Critic architecture to provide a simple and precise method for power saving. The results of the study demonstrate the proposed approach's suitability for different hardware configurations, achieving notable energy consumption control while adhering to strict performance requirements. The evaluation of the proposed power-saving framework shows that it is more stable, and has achieved more than 34.6% efficiency improvement, outperforming other methods by more than 16%.</description>

      <title>Kronecker-structured Sparse Vector Recovery with Application to IRS-MIMO Channel Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07869v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of Kronecker-structured sparse vector recovery from an underdetermined linear system with a Kronecker-structured dictionary. Such a problem arises in many real-world applications such as the sparse channel estimation of an intelligent reflecting surface-aided multiple-input multiple-output system. The prior art only exploits the Kronecker structure in the support of the sparse vector and solves the entire linear system together leading to high computational complexity. Instead, we break down the original sparse recovery problem into multiple independent sub-problems and solve them individually. We obtain the sparse vector as the Kronecker product of the individual solutions, retaining its structure in both support and nonzero entries. Our simulations demonstrate the superior performance of our methods in terms of accuracy and run time compared with the existing works, using synthetic data and the channel estimation application. We attribute the low run time to the reduced solution space due to the additional structure and improved accuracy to the denoising effect owing to the decomposition step.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Message-Passing and Zeroth-Order Optimization Based Distributed Learning with a Use-Case in Resource Allocation in Communication Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04604v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distributed learning and adaptation have received significant interest and found wide-ranging applications in machine learning and signal processing. While various approaches, such as shared-memory optimization, multi-task learning, and consensus-based learning (e.g., federated learning and learning over graphs), focus on optimizing either local costs or a global cost, there remains a need for further exploration of their interconnections. This paper specifically focuses on a scenario where agents collaborate towards a common task (i.e., optimizing a global cost equal to aggregated local costs) while effectively having distinct individual tasks (i.e., optimizing individual local parameters in a local cost). Each agent's actions can potentially impact other agents' performance through interactions. Notably, each agent has access to only its local zeroth-order oracle (i.e., cost function value) and shares scalar values, rather than gradient vectors, with other agents, leading to communication bandwidth efficiency and agent privacy. Agents employ zeroth-order optimization to update their parameters, and the asynchronous message-passing between them is subject to bounded but possibly random communication delays. This paper presents theoretical convergence analyses and establishes a convergence rate for nonconvex problems. Furthermore, it addresses the relevant use-case of deep learning-based resource allocation in communication networks and conducts numerical experiments in which agents, acting as transmitters, collaboratively train their individual policies to maximize a global reward, e.g., a sum of data rates.</description>

      <title>DoorINet: Door Heading Prediction through Inertial Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inertial sensors are widely used in a variety of applications. A common task is orientation estimation. To tackle such a task, attitude and heading reference system algorithms are applied. Relying on the gyroscope readings, the accelerometer measurements are used to update the attitude angles, and magnetometer measurements are utilized to update the heading angle. In indoor environments, magnetometers suffer from interference that degrades their performance resulting in poor heading angle estimation. Therefore, applications that estimate the heading angle of moving objects, such as walking pedestrians, closets, and refrigerators, are prone to error. To circumvent such situations, we propose DoorINet, an end-to-end deep-learning framework to calculate the heading angle from door-mounted, low-cost inertial sensors without using magnetometers. To evaluate our approach, we record a unique dataset containing 391 minutes of accelerometer and gyroscope measurements and corresponding ground-truth heading angle. We show that our proposed approach outperforms commonly used, model based approaches and data-driven methods.</description>

Abstract: Electromagnetic degrees of freedom are instrumental in antenna design, wireless communications, imaging, and scattering. Larger number of degrees of freedom enhances control in antenna design, influencing radiation patterns and directivity, while in communication systems, it links to spatial channels for increased data rates and reliability, and resolution in imaging. The correlation between computed degrees of freedom and physical quantities is not fully understood, prompting a comparison between classical estimates, Weyl's law, modal expansions, and optimization techniques. In this paper, it is shown that the number of degrees of freedom for arbitrary shaped radiating structures approaches the shadow area measured in squared wavelengths asymptotically as the wavelength decreases.</description>

      <title>Self-Adaptive Quantum Kernel Principal Components Analysis for Compact Readout of Chemiresistive Sensor Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00115v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices necessitates efficient data compression techniques to handle the vast amounts of data generated by these devices. Chemiresistive sensor arrays (CSAs), a simple-to-fabricate but crucial component in IoT systems, generate large volumes of data due to their simultaneous multi-sensor operations. Classical principal component analysis (cPCA) methods, a common solution to the data compression challenge, face limitations in preserving critical information during dimensionality reduction. In this study, we present self-adaptive quantum kernel (SAQK) PCA as a superior alternative to enhance information retention. Our findings demonstrate that SAQK PCA outperforms cPCA in various back-end machine-learning tasks, especially in low-dimensional scenarios where access to quantum bits is limited. These results highlight the potential of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers to revolutionize data processing in real-world IoT applications by improving the efficiency and reliability of CSA data compression and readout, despite the current constraints on qubit availability.</description>

      <title>Which Channel, Low-rank or Full-rank, more needs RIS?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: RIS, as an efficient tool to improve receive signal-to-noise ratio, extend coverage and create more spatial diversity, is viewed as a most promising technique for the future wireless networks like 6G. As you know, IRS is very suitable for a special wireless scenario with wireless link between BS and users being completely blocked. In this paper, we extend its applications to a general scenario, i.e., rank-deficient-channel, particularly some extremely low-rank ones such as no link, and line-of-sight (LoS). Actually, there are several potential important low-rank applications of like satellite, UAV communications, marine, and deep-space communications. In such a situation, it is found that RIS may make a dramatic DoF enhancement over no RIS. By using a distributed RIS placement, the DoF of channels from BS to users may be even boosted from a low-rank like 0/1 to full-rank. This will achieve an extremely rate improvement via multiple spatial streams transmission per user. In this paper, we present a complete review of make a in-depth discussion on DoF effect of RIS.</description>

Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites, as a prominent technology in the 6G non-terrestrial network, offer both positioning and communication capabilities. While these two applications have each been extensively studied and have achieved substantial progress in recent years, the potential synergistic benefits of integrating them remain an underexplored yet promising avenue. This article comprehensively analyzes the integrated positioning and communication (IPAC) systems on LEO satellites. By leveraging the distinct characteristics of LEO satellites, we examine how communication systems can enhance positioning accuracy and, conversely, how positioning information can be exploited to improve communication efficiency. In particular, we present two case studies to illustrate the potential of such integration. Finally, several key open research challenges in the LEO-based IPAC systems are discussed.</description>

      <title>Recurrences reveal shared causal drivers of complex time series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13516v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unmeasured causal forces influence diverse experimental time series, such as the transcription factors that regulate genes, or the descending neurons that steer motor circuits. Combining the theory of skew-product dynamical systems with topological data analysis, we show that simultaneous recurrence events across multiple time series reveal the structure of their shared unobserved driving signal. We introduce a physics-based unsupervised learning algorithm that reconstructs causal drivers by iteratively building a recurrence graph with glass-like structure. As the amount of data increases, a percolation transition on this graph leads to weak ergodicity breaking for random walks -- revealing the shared driver's dynamics, even from strongly-corrupted measurements. We relate reconstruction accuracy to the rate of information transfer from a chaotic driver to the response systems, and we find that effective reconstruction proceeds through gradual approximation of the driver's dynamical attractor. Through extensive benchmarks against classical signal processing and machine learning techniques, we demonstrate our method's ability to extract causal drivers from diverse experimental datasets spanning ecology, genomics, fluid dynamics, and physiology.</description>

      <title>Estimating Continuous Muscle Fatigue For Multi-Muscle Coordinated Exercise: A Pilot Study on Walking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assessing the progression of muscle fatigue for daily exercises provides vital indicators for precise rehabilitation, personalized training dose, especially under the context of Metaverse. Assessing fatigue of multi-muscle coordination-involved daily exercises requires the neuromuscular features that represent the fatigue-induced characteristics of spatiotemporal adaptions of multiple muscles and the estimator that captures the time-evolving progression of fatigue. In this paper, we propose to depict fatigue by the features of muscle compensation and spinal module activation changes and estimate continuous fatigue by a physiological rationale model. First, we extract muscle synergy fractionation and the variance of spinal module spikings as features inspired by the prior of fatigue-induced neuromuscular adaptations. Second, we treat the features as observations and develop a Bayesian Gaussian process to capture the time-evolving progression. Third, we solve the issue of lacking supervision information by mathematically formulating the time-evolving characteristics of fatigue as the loss function. Finally, we adapt the metrics that follow the physiological principles of fatigue to quantitatively evaluate the performance. Our extensive experiments present a 0.99 similarity between days, a over 0.7 similarity with other views of fatigue and a nearly 1 weak monotonicity, which outperform other methods. This study would aim the objective assessment of muscle fatigue.</description>

      <title>Soundscape Captioning using Sound Affective Quality Network and Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We live in a rich and varied acoustic world, which is experienced by individuals or communities as a soundscape. Computational auditory scene analysis, disentangling acoustic scenes by detecting and classifying events, focuses on objective attributes of sounds, such as their category and temporal characteristics, ignoring their effects on people, such as the emotions they evoke within a context. To fill this gap, we propose the soundscape captioning task, which enables automated soundscape analysis, thus avoiding labour-intensive subjective ratings and surveys in conventional methods. With soundscape captioning, context-aware descriptions are generated for soundscape by capturing the acoustic scene, event information, and the corresponding human affective qualities (AQs). To this end, we propose an automatic soundscape captioner (SoundSCaper) system composed of an acoustic model, i.e. SoundAQnet, and a large language model (LLM). SoundAQnet simultaneously models multi-scale information about acoustic scenes, events, and perceived AQs, while the LLM describes the soundscape with captions by parsing the information captured with SoundAQnet. The soundscape caption's quality is assessed by a jury of 16 audio/soundscape experts. The average score (out of 5) of SoundSCaper-generated captions is lower than the score of captions generated by two soundscape experts by 0.21 and 0.25, respectively, on the evaluation set and the model-unknown mixed external dataset with varying lengths and acoustic properties, but the differences are not statistically significant. Overall, the proposed SoundSCaper shows promising performance, with captions generated being comparable to those annotated by soundscape experts. The code of models, LLM scripts, human assessment data and instructions, and expert evaluation statistics are all publicly available.</description>

      <title>Understanding Generalizability of Diffusion Models Requires Rethinking the Hidden Gaussian Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24060v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the generalizability of diffusion models by looking into the hidden properties of the learned score functions, which are essentially a series of deep denoisers trained on various noise levels. We observe that as diffusion models transition from memorization to generalization, their corresponding nonlinear diffusion denoisers exhibit increasing linearity. This discovery leads us to investigate the linear counterparts of the nonlinear diffusion models, which are a series of linear models trained to match the function mappings of the nonlinear diffusion denoisers. Surprisingly, these linear denoisers are approximately the optimal denoisers for a multivariate Gaussian distribution characterized by the empirical mean and covariance of the training dataset. This finding implies that diffusion models have the inductive bias towards capturing and utilizing the Gaussian structure (covariance information) of the training dataset for data generation. We empirically demonstrate that this inductive bias is a unique property of diffusion models in the generalization regime, which becomes increasingly evident when the model's capacity is relatively small compared to the training dataset size. In the case that the model is highly overparameterized, this inductive bias emerges during the initial training phases before the model fully memorizes its training data. Our study provides crucial insights into understanding the notable strong generalization phenomenon recently observed in real-world diffusion models.</description>

      <title>JC5A: Service Delay Minimization for Aerial MEC-assisted Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the era of the sixth generation (6G) and industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), an industrial cyber-physical system (ICPS) drives the proliferation of sensor devices and computing-intensive tasks. To address the limited resources of IIoT sensor devices, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) has emerged as a promising solution, providing flexible and cost-effective services in close proximity of IIoT sensor devices (ISDs). However, leveraging aerial MEC to meet the delay-sensitive and computation-intensive requirements of the ISDs could face several challenges, including the limited communication, computation and caching (3C) resources, stringent offloading requirements for 3C services, and constrained on-board energy of UAVs. To address these issues, we first present a collaborative aerial MEC-assisted ICPS architecture by incorporating the computing capabilities of the macro base station (MBS) and UAVs. We then formulate a service delay minimization optimization problem (SDMOP). Since the SDMOP is proved to be an NP-hard problem, we propose a joint computation offloading, caching, communication resource allocation, computation resource allocation, and UAV trajectory control approach (JC5A). Specifically, JC5A consists of a block successive upper bound minimization method of multipliers (BSUMM) for computation offloading and service caching, a convex optimization-based method for communication and computation resource allocation, and a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based method for UAV trajectory control. Moreover, we theoretically prove the convergence and polynomial complexity of JC5A. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve superior system performance compared to the benchmark approaches and algorithms.</description>

Abstract: Mobile robots are used in various fields, from deliveries to search and rescue applications. Different types of sensors are mounted on the robot to provide accurate navigation and, thus, allow successful completion of its task. In real-world scenarios, due to environmental constraints, the robot frequently relies only on its inertial sensors. Therefore, due to noises and other error terms associated with the inertial readings, the navigation solution drifts in time. To mitigate the inertial solution drift, we propose the MoRPINet framework consisting of a neural network to regress the robot's travelled distance. To this end, we require the mobile robot to maneuver in a snake-like slithering motion to encourage nonlinear behavior. MoRPINet was evaluated using a dataset of 290 minutes of inertial recordings during field experiments and showed an improvement of 33% in the positioning error over other state-of-the-art methods for pure inertial navigation.</description>
