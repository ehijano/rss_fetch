      <title>Invariants of finite groups acting on (free) skew fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a finitely generated skew field over a ground field $k$, and let $G$ be a finite group of $k$-linear automorphisms of $M$. This paper investigates finite generation of the skew subfield $M^G$ of $G$-invariants in $M$, and relations between the generators. The first main result shows that $M^G$ is finitely generated. Stronger conclusions hold when $M$ is a free skew field, i.e., the universal skew field of fractions of a free algebra. The second main result is the solution of the free Noether problem for non-modular linear group actions: if $G$ acts linearly on the free skew field $M$ on $m$ generators and the characteristic of $k$ does not divide $|G|$, then $M^G$ is the free skew field on $|G|(m-1)+1$ generators. In contrast, a nonlinear action of $Z_2$ on the free skew field $M$ on two generators is presented such that $M^{Z_2}$ is not a free skew field, resolving the free L\"uroth problem. This action also exposes a non-scalar element of $M$ whose centralizer is not a rational field, refuting a conjecture of P. M. Cohn from 1978.</description>

      <title>Isotopes of biracks and Zhang twists of algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of an $\mathbb{N}^p$-graded birack and construct its isotope. Every involutive $\mathbb{N}^p$-graded birack gives rise to an $\mathbb{N}^p$-graded Yang-Baxter algebra. We study the relation between isotopes of involutive $\mathbb{N}^p$-graded biracks and Zhang twists of $\mathbb{N}^p$-graded Yang-Baxter algebras. As an example, Yang-Baxter algebras determined by distributive solutions are proved to be Zhang twists of polynomial algebras.</description>

      <title>A Linear Structure from Magnetic-Dipole Systems and Its Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a class of algebras on $\mathbb{R}^3$ arising and generalized from the algebraic structure of magnetic gradient fields induced by systems of synchronous magnets with identical dipole moments (i.e., $\mathbf{M}_i=\mathbf{M},\,\forall i$). We show that when there is a $2$ dimensional sub-algebra, the linear structure associated to such an algebra admits a certain type of decompositions, which allows the locating of the dipole moment $\bar{\mathbf{M}}$ that yields the strongest translational force(s) on a test magnet $\mathfrak{m}$. Upper bounds to the strength of this magnetic force are then established.</description>

      <title>Pairs of eventually constant maps and nilpotent pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tom Leinster gave a bijective correspondence between the set of operators on a finite-dimensional vector space $V$ and the set of pairs consisting of a nilpotent operator and a vector in $V$. Over a finite field this bijection implies that the probability that an operator be nilpotent is the reciprocal of the number of vectors in $V$. We generalize this correspondence to pairs of operators between pairs of vector spaces and determine the probability that a random pair of operators be nilpotent. We also determine the set-theoretical counterpart of this construction and compute the number of eventually constant pairs of maps between two finite sets, closely related to the number of spanning trees in a complete bipartite graph.</description>

      <title>From n-systems to Lie and Courant algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method for constructing pure algebroids, dull algebroids, and Lie algebroids. The construction relies on what we deffned as n-systems on vector bundles, and we provide explicit computations for all resulting structure maps. Analogously, metric n-systems deffned on metric vector bundles allow us to construct metric algebroids, pre-Courant algebroids, and Courant algebroids.</description>

      <title>New Perspectives on Semiring Applications to Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiring algebras have been shown to provide a suitable language to formalize many noteworthy combinatorial problems. For instance, the Shortest-Path problem can be seen as a special case of the Algebraic-Path problem when applied to the tropical semiring. The application of semirings typically makes it possible to solve extended problems without increasing the computational complexity. In this article we further exploit the idea of using semiring algebras to address and tackle several extensions of classical computational problems by dynamic programming. We consider a general approach which allows us to define a semiring extension of any problem with a reasonable notion of a certificate (e.g., an NP problem). This allows us to consider cost variants of these combinatorial problems, as well as their counting extensions where the goal is to determine how many solutions a given problem admits. The approach makes no particular assumptions (such as idempotence) on the semiring structure. We also propose a new associative algebraic operation on semirings, called $\Delta$-product, which enables our dynamic programming algorithms to count the number of solutions of minimal costs. We illustrate the advantages of our framework on two well-known but computationally very different NP-hard problems, namely, Connected-Dominating-Set problems and finite-domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). In particular, we prove fixed parameter tractability (FPT) with respect to clique-width and tree-width of the input. This also allows us to count solutions of minimal cost, which is an overlooked problem in the literature.</description>

      <title>Identities of relatively free algebras of Lie nilpotent associative algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22664v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the relatively free algebra of rank $n$, $F_n(\mathfrak{N}_p)$, in the variety of Lie nilpotent associative algebras of index $p$, denoted by $\mathfrak{N}_p$, over a field of characteristic zero. We describe an explicit minimal basis for the polynomial identities of $F_n(\mathfrak{N}_p)$ when $p=3$ and $p=4$, for all $n$, except for $F_3(\mathfrak{N}_4)$. In the general case, we exhibit a lower and an upper bound for the minimal $k$ such that $[x_1,x_2]\cdots[x_{2k-1},x_{2k}]$ is an identity for $F_n(\mathfrak{N}_p)$ for all $n$ and for all $p$.</description>

      <title>Enumeration and Asymptotic Formulas for Rectangular Partitions of the Hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00813</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.00813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a two-parameter generalization of the Catalan numbers: $C_{d,p}(n)$ is the number of ways to subdivide the $d$-dimensional hypercube into $n$ rectangular blocks using orthogonal partitions of fixed arity $p$. Bremner \&amp; Dotsenko introduced $C_{d,p}(n)$ in their work on Boardman--Vogt tensor products of operads; they used homological algebra to prove a recursive formula and a functional equation. We express $C_{d,p}(n)$ as simple finite sums, and determine their growth rate and asymptotic behaviour. We give an elementary proof of the functional equation, using a bijection between hypercube decompositions and a family of full $p$-ary trees. Our results generalize the well-known correspondence between Catalan numbers and full binary trees.</description>

      <title>The large scale geometry of inverse semigroups and their maximal group images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The geometry of inverse semigroups is a natural topic of study, motivated both from within semigroup theory and by applications to the theory of non-commutative $C^*$-algebras. We study the relationship between the geometry of an inverse semigroup and that of its maximal group image, and in particular the geometric \textit{distortion} of the natural map from the former to the latter. This turns out to have both implications for semigroup theory and potential relevance for operator algebras associated to inverse semigroups. Along the way, we also answer a question of Lled\'{o} and Mart\'{i}nez by providing a more direct proof that an $E$-unitary inverse semigroup has Yu's Property A if its maximal group image does.</description>

      <title>On the structure and theory of McCarthy algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10816v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a structural analysis for McCarthy algebras, the variety generated by the three-element algebra defining the logic of McCarthy (the non-commutative version of Kleene three-valued logics). Our analysis will be conducted in a very general algebraic setting by introducing McCarthy algebras as a subvariety of unital bands (idempotent monoids) equipped with an involutive (unary) operation $'$ satisfying $x''\approx x$; herein referred to as i-ubands. Prominent (commutative) subvarieties of i-ubands include Boolean algebras, ortholattices, Kleene algebras, and involutive bisemilattices, hence i-ubands provides an algebraic common ground for several non-classical logics. Our main contributions consist in providing for McCarthy algebras: reduced and equivalent axiomatizations; a semilattice decomposition theorem; and representations as certain decorated posets from which the algebraic structure can be uniquely determined.</description>
