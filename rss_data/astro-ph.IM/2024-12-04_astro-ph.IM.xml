      <title>Uranus Study Report: KISS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the internal structure of Uranus is a key objective for planetary science. Knowledge of Uranus's bulk composition and the distribution of elements is crucial to understanding its origin and evolutionary path. In addition, Uranus represents a poorly understood class of intermediate-mass planets (intermediate in size between the relatively well studied terrestrial and gas giant planets), which appear to be very common in the Galaxy. As a result, a better characterization of Uranus will also help us to better understand exoplanets in this mass and size regime. Recognizing the importance of Uranus, a Keck Institute for Space Studies (KISS) workshop was held in September 2023 to investigate how we can improve our knowledge of Uranus's internal structure in the context of a future Uranus mission that includes an orbiter and a probe. The scientific goals and objectives of the recently released Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey were taken as our starting point. We reviewed our current knowledge of Uranus's interior and identified measurement and other mission requirements for a future Uranus spacecraft, providing more detail than was possible in the Decadal Survey's mission study and including new insights into the measurements to be made. We also identified important knowledge gaps to be closed with Earth-based efforts in the near term that will help guide the design of the mission and interpret the data returned.</description>

      <title>Performance of Photometric Template Fitting for Ultra-High Redshift Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has allowed the discovery of a significant population of galaxies at z &gt; 10. Our understanding of the astrophysical properties of these ultra-high redshift galaxies relies on fitting templates, developed using astrophysical models representing our current understanding of high-redshift galaxies. In this work, the highest confidence recent JWST spectroscopic observations are used to evaluate the performance of several high-redshift templates based on two tests: (1) comparing photometric redshifts against spectroscopic redshifts; and (2) comparing the reconstructed spectral energy distributions against observed SEDs. Strict sample selection and error-propagation by bootstrapping is employed to make results robust towards future JWST systematics mitigation. It is shown that some templates perform adequately at high redshift prediction, given a sample selection by observational filters and depth. Other templates work better for SED fitting, but a few objects remain unrepresented in their spectra. We conclude that although templates are usable, models are not yet able to reliably extract astrophysical properties.</description>

      <title>Advancing Black Hole Imaging with Space-Based Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Horizon-scale imaging with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has provided transformative insights into supermassive black holes but its resolution and scope are limited by ground-based constraints such as the size of the Earth, its relatively slow rotation, and atmospheric delays. Space-based very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) offers the capability for studying a larger and more diverse sample of black holes. We identify a number of nearby supermassive black holes as prime candidates for horizon-scale imaging at millimeter wavelengths, and use source characteristics such as angular size, sky distribution, and variability timescales to shape the design of a space-based array. We identify specific metrics that serve as key predictors of image fidelity and scientific potential, providing a quantitative basis for optimizing mission design parameters. Our analysis demonstrates that the optimal configuration requires two space-based elements in high Earth orbits (HEO) that are not coplanar and are apparently counter-rotating. Our results delineate the key requirements for a space-based VLBI mission, enabling detailed studies of black hole shadows, plasma dynamics, and jet formation, advancing black hole astrophysics beyond the current capabilities of the EHT.</description>

      <title>Kernel Methods for Interferometric Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Increasing the angular resolution of an interferometric array requires placing its elements at large separations. This often leads to sparse coverage and introduces challenges to reconstructing images from interferometric data. We introduce a new interferometric imaging algorithm, KRISP, that is based on kernel methods, is statistically robust, and is agnostic to the underlying image. The algorithm reconstructs the complete Fourier map up to the maximum observed baseline length based entirely on the data without tuning by a user or training on prior images and reproduces images with high fidelity. KRISP works efficiently for many sparse array configurations even in the presence of significant image structure as long as the typical baseline separation is comparable to or less than the correlation length of the Fourier map, which is inversely proportional to the size of the target image.</description>

      <title>New insight of time-transformed symplectic integrator I: hybrid methods for hierarchical triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate $N$-body simulations of multiple systems such as binaries and triples are essential for understanding the formation and evolution of interacting binaries and binary mergers, including gravitational wave sources, blue stragglers and X-ray binaries. The logarithmic time-transformed explicit symplectic integrator (LogH), also known as algorithmic regularization, is a state-of-the-art method for this purpose.However, we show that this method is accurate for isolated Kepler orbits because of its ability to trace Keplerian trajectories, but much less accurate for hierarichal triple systems. The method can lead to an unphysical secular evolution of inner eccentricity in Kozal-Lidov triples, despite a small energy error. We demonstrate that hybrid methods, which apply LogH to the inner binary and alternative methods to the outer bodies, are significantly more effective, though not symplectic. Additionally, we introduce a more efficient hybrid method, BlogH, which eliminates the need for time synchronization and is time symmetric. The method is implemented in the few-body code SDAR. We explore suitable criteria for switching between the LogH and BlogH methods for general triple systems. These hybrid methods have the potential to enhance the integration performance of hierarchial triples.</description>

      <title>The classification of real and bogus transients using active learning and semi-supervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep-learning-based methods have been favored in astrophysics owing to their adaptability and remarkable performance and have been applied to the task of the classification of real and bogus transients. Different from most existing approaches which necessitate massive yet expensive annotated data, We aim to leverage training samples with only 1000 labels available to discover real sources that vary in brightness over time in the early stage of the WFST 6-year survey. Methods. We present a novel deep-learning method that combines active learning and semi-supervised learning to construct a competitive real/bogus classifier. Our method incorporates an active learning stage, where we actively select the most informative or uncertain samples for annotation. This stage aims to achieve higher model performance by leveraging fewer labeled samples, thus reducing annotation costs and improving the overall learning process efficiency. Furthermore, our approach involves a semi-supervised learning stage that exploits the unlabeled data to enhance the model's performance and achieve superior results compared to using only the limited labeled data.</description>

      <title>ComPair-2: A Next Generation Medium Energy Gamma-ray Telescope Prototype</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many questions posed in the Astro2020 Decadal survey in both the New Messengers and New Physics and the Cosmic Ecosystems science themes require a gamma-ray mission with capabilities exceeding those of existing (e.g. Fermi, Swift) and planned (e.g. COSI) observatories. ComPair, the Compton Pair telescope, is a prototype of such a next-generation gamma-ray mission. It had its inaugural balloon flight from Ft. Sumner, New Mexico in August 2023. To continue the goals of the ComPair project to develop technologies that will enable a future gamma-ray mission, the next generation of ComPair (ComPair-2) will be upgraded to increase the sensitivity and low-energy transient capabilities of the instrument. These advancements are enabled by AstroPix, a silicon monolithic active pixel sensor, in the tracker and custom dual-gain silicon photomultipliers and front-end electronics in the calorimeter. This effort builds on design work for the All-sky Medium Energy Gamma-ray Observatory eXplorer (AMEGO-X) concept that was submitted the 2021 MIDEX Announcement of Opportunity. Here we describe the ComPair-2 prototype design and integration and testing plans to advance the readiness level of these novel technologies.</description>

      <title>FAST drift scan survey for HI intensity mapping: II. stacking-based primary beam construction for FAST L-band 19 feeds at $1.4$ GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping (IM) presents great promise for future cosmological large-scale structure surveys. However, a major challenge for HIIM cosmological studies is to accurately subtract the foreground contamination. An accurate beam model is crucial for improving foreground subtraction accuracy. In this work, we develop a stacking-based beam reconstruction method utilizing the radio continuum point sources within the drift-scan field. Based on the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we employ two series of drift-scan survey data and merge the measurements to construct the beam patterns of the FAST L-band 19 feeds. To model the beams, we utilize the Zernike polynomial (ZP), which effectively captures % the side lobes and asymmetric features of the side lobes. asymmetric features of the main beam and the different side lobes. Due to the symmetric location of the beams, the main features of the beams are closely related to the distance from the center of the feed array, e.g., as the distance increases, side lobes become more pronounced. This modeling pipeline leverages the stable drift-scan data to extract beam patterns exclude the reflector's changing effects, and provides a more accurate measurement beam and a more precise model beam for FAST HIIM cosmology surveys.</description>

      <title>Transformation relations for UBV photometric system of 1m telescope at the T\"{U}B\.{I}TAK National Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: UBV CCD observations of standard stars selected from Landolt (2009, 2013) were performed using the 1-meter telescope (T100) of the T\"{U}B\.{I}TAK National Observatory equipped with a back-illuminated and UV enhanced CCD camera and Bessell UBV filters. Observations span a long time from the years 2012 to 2024, 50 photometric nights in total. Photometric measurements were used to find the standard transformation relations of the T100 photometric system. The atmospheric extinction coefficients, zero points and transformation coefficients of each night were determined. It could not be found time dependence of the secondary extinction coefficients. However, it was determined that the primary extinction coefficients decreased until the year 2019 and increased after that year. It could not be found a strong seasonal variation of the extinction coefficients. Small differences in seasonal median values of them were used to attempt to find the atmospheric extinction sources. We found calculated minus catalogue values for each standard star, $\Delta(U-B)$, $\Delta(B-V)$ and $\Delta V$. Means and standard deviations of $\Delta(U-B)$, $\Delta(B-V)$ and $\Delta V$ were estimated to be 1.4$\pm$76, 1.9$\pm$18 and 0.0$\pm$36 mmag, respectively. We found that our data well matched Landolt's standards for $V$ and $B-V$, i.e. there are no systematic differences. However, there are systematic differences for $U-B$ between the two photometric systems, which is probably originated from the quantum efficiency differences of the detectors used in the photometric systems, although the median differences are relatively small ($|\Delta(U-B)|$&lt; 50 mmag) for stars with $-0.5&lt;U-B~{(\rm mag)} &lt;1.6$ and $0.2&lt;B-V~{(\rm mag)} &lt;1.8$. As an overall result, we conclude that the transformation relations found in this study can be used for standardized photometry with the T100 photometric system.</description>

      <title>Three Warm Jupiters orbiting TOI-6628, TOI-3837, TOI-5027 and one sub-Saturn orbiting TOI-2328</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery and characterization of three new transiting giant planets orbiting TOI-6628, TOI-3837 and TOI-5027, and one new warm sub-Saturn orbiting TOI-2328, whose transits events were detected in the lightcurves of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite \textbf{(TESS)} space mission. By combining TESS lightcurves with ground-based photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations we confirm the planetary nature of the observed transits and radial velocity variations. TOI-6628~$b$ has a mass of 0.75$\pm$0.06~$M_\mathrm{J}$, a radius of 0.98$\pm$0.05~$R_J$ and is orbiting a metal-rich star with a period of 18.18424$\pm{0.00001}$ days and an eccentricity of 0.667$\pm0.016$, making it one of the most eccentric orbits of all known warm giants. TOI-3837~$b$ has a mass of 0.59$\pm$0.06~$M_\mathrm{J}$, a radius of 0.96$\pm$0.05~$R_J$ and orbits its host star every 11.88865$\pm$0.00003~days, with a moderate eccentricity of 0.198$^{+0.046}_{-0.058}$. With a mass of 2.01$\pm$0.13~$M_\mathrm{J}$ and a radius of 0.99$^{+0.07}_{-0.12}$ $R_J$, TOI-5027~$b$ orbits its host star in an eccentric orbit with $e$~=~0.395$^{+0.032}_{-0.029}$ every 10.24368$\pm{0.00001}$~days. TOI-2328~$b$ is a Saturn-like planet with a mass of 0.16$\pm$0.02~$M_\mathrm{J}$ and a radius of 0.89$\pm$0.04~$R_J$, orbiting its host star in a nearly circular orbit with $e$~=~0.057$^{+0.046}_{-0.029}$ at an orbital period of 17.10197$\pm{0.00001}$ days.
  All four planets have orbital periods above 10 days, and our planet interior structure models are consistsent a rocky-icy core with a H/He envelope, providing evidence supporting the core accretion model of planet formation for this kind of planets.</description>

      <title>Smart Kanata: A Framework for Autonomous Decision Making in Rapid Follow-up Observations of Cataclysmic Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the early stages of transient events provides crucial information about the fundamental physical processes in cataclysmic variables (CVs). However, determining an appropriate observation mode immediately after the discovery of a new transient presents challenges due to significant uncertainties regarding its nature. We developed a framework designed for autonomous decision making in prompt follow-up observations of CVs using the Kanata 1.5-m telescope. The system, named Smart Kanata, first estimates the class probabilities of variable star types using a generative model. It then selects the optimal observation mode from three possible options based on the mutual information calculated from the class probabilities. We have operated the system for ~300 days and obtained 21 samples, among which automated observations were successfully performed for a nova and a microlensing event. In the time-series spectra of the nova V4370 Oph, we detected a rapid deepening of the absorption component of the H_alpha line. These initial results demonstrate the capability of Smart Kanata in facilitating rapid observations and improving our understanding of outbursts and eruptions of CVs and other galactic transients.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Methods for Automated Interstellar Object Classification with LSST</title>

Abstract: The Legacy Survey of Space and Time, to be conducted with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, is poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Solar System by providing an unprecedented wealth of data on various objects, including the elusive interstellar objects (ISOs). Detecting and classifying ISOs is crucial for studying the composition and diversity of materials from other planetary systems. However, the rarity and brief observation windows of ISOs, coupled with the vast quantities of data to be generated by LSST, create significant challenges for their identification and classification. This study aims to address these challenges by exploring the application of machine learning algorithms to the automated classification of ISO tracklets in simulated LSST data. We employed various machine learning algorithms, including random forests (RFs), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), gradient boosting machines (GBMs), and neural networks (NNs), to classify ISO tracklets in simulated LSST data. We demonstrate that GBM and RF algorithms outperform SGD and NN algorithms in accurately distinguishing ISOs from other Solar System objects. RF analysis shows that many derived Digest2 values are more important than direct observables in classifying ISOs from the LSST tracklets. The GBM model achieves the highest precision, recall, and F1 score, with values of 0.9987, 0.9986, and 0.9987, respectively. These findings lay the foundation for the development of an efficient and robust automated system for ISO discovery using LSST data, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the materials and processes that shape planetary systems beyond our own. The integration of our proposed machine learning approach into the LSST data processing pipeline will optimize the survey's potential for identifying these rare and valuable objects, enabling timely follow-up observations and further characterization.</description>

      <title>First Pulsar Polarization Array Limits on Ultralight Axion-like Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct the first-ever Pulsar Polarization Array (PPA) analysis to detect the ultralight Axion-Like Dark Matter (ALDM) using the polarization data of 22 millisecond pulsars from the third data release of Parkes Pulsar Timing Array. As one of the major dark matter candidates, the ultralight ALDM exhibits a pronounced wave nature on astronomical scales and offers a promising solution to small-scale structure issues within local galaxies. While the linearly polarized pulsar light travels through the ALDM galactic halo, its position angle (PA) can be subject to an oscillation induced by the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling with electromagnetic field. The PPA is thus especially suited for detecting the ultralight ALDM by correlating polarization data across the arrayed pulsars. To accomplish this task, we develop an advanced Bayesian analysis framework that allows us to construct pulsar PA residual time series, model noise contributions properly and search for pulsar cross-correlations. We find that for an ALDM density of $\rho_0=0.4\,\textrm{GeV}/\textrm{cm}^3$, the Parkes PPA offers the best global limits on the ALDM Chern-Simons coupling, namely $\lesssim 10^{-13.5}-10^{-12.2}~{\rm GeV}^{-1}$, for the mass range of $10^{-22} - 10^{-21}~{\rm eV}$. The crucial role of pulsar cross-correlation in recognizing the nature of the derived limits is also highlighted.</description>

      <title>A visibility-based angular bispectrum estimator for radio-interferometric data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Considering radio-interferometric observations, we present a fast and efficient estimator to compute the binned angular bispectrum (ABS) from gridded visibility data. The estimator makes use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) techniques to compute the bispectrum covering all possible triangle shapes and sizes. Here, we present the formalism of the estimator and validate it using simulated visibility data for the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) observations at $\nu=154.25$ MHz. We find that our estimator is able to faithfully recover the ABS of the simulated sky signal with $\approx 10-15 \%$ accuracy for a wide variety of triangle shapes and sizes across the range of angular multipoles $46 \le \ell \le 1320$. In future work, we plan to apply this to actual data and also generalize it to estimate the three-dimensional redshifted 21-cm bispectrum.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference has its own Dodelson-Schneider effect (but it knows that it does)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Making inferences about physical properties of the Universe requires knowledge of the data likelihood. A Gaussian distribution is commonly assumed for the uncertainties with a covariance matrix estimated from a set of simulations. The noise in such covariance estimates causes two problems: it distorts the width of the parameter contours, and it adds scatter to the location of those contours which is not captured by the widths themselves. For non-Gaussian likelihoods, an approximation may be derived via Simulation-Based Inference (SBI). It is often implicitly assumed that parameter constraints from SBI analyses, which do not use covariance matrices, are not affected by the same problems as parameter estimation with a covariance matrix estimated from simulations. We investigate whether SBI suffers from effects similar to those of covariance estimation in Gaussian likelihoods. We use Neural Posterior and Likelihood Estimation with continuous and masked autoregressive normalizing flows for density estimation. We fit our approximate posterior models to simulations drawn from a Gaussian linear model, so that the SBI result can be compared to the true posterior. We test linear and neural network based compression, demonstrating that neither methods circumvent the issues of covariance estimation. SBI suffers an inflation of posterior variance that is equal or greater than the analytical result in covariance estimation for Gaussian likelihoods for the same number of simulations. The assumption that SBI requires a smaller number of simulations than covariance estimation for a Gaussian likelihood analysis is inaccurate. The limitations of traditional likelihood analysis with simulation-based covariance remain for SBI with a finite simulation budget. Despite these issues, we show that SBI correctly draws the true posterior contour given enough simulations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian data analysis for sky-averaged 21-cm experiments with contamination from linearly polarised foreground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02552v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise measurement of the sky-averaged HI absorption signal between 50 and 200 MHz is the primary goal of global 21-cm cosmology. This measurement has the potential to unravel the underlying physics of cosmic structure formation and evolution during the Cosmic Dawn. It is, however, hindered by various non-smooth, frequency-dependent effects, whose structures resemble those of the signal. One such effect is the leakage of polarised foregrounds into the measured intensity signal: polarised foreground emission undergoes Faraday rotation as it passes through the magnetic fields of the interstellar medium, imprinting a chromatic structure in the relevant frequency range which complicates the extraction of the cosmological HI absorption feature. We investigate the effect of polarised Galactic foregrounds on extracting the global 21-cm signal from simulated data using REACH's data analysis pipeline; the Radio Experiment for the Analysis of Cosmic Hydrogen (REACH) is an experiment designed to detect the sky-averaged 21-cm HI signal from the early Universe using physically informed models. Using the REACH pipeline, we successfully recover an injected global 21-cm signal with an amplitude of approximately 0.16 K, centred between 80 and 120 MHz, achieving a low root-mean-square error (less than 30\% of the injected signal strength) in all the tested cases. This includes scenarios with simulated polarised Galactic diffuse emissions and polarised point source emissions, provided the overall polarisation fraction is below $\sim 3\%$. The linear mixing of contamination, caused by the superposition of multiple patches with varying strengths of Faraday rotation, produces patterns that are more distinct from the global signal. This distinction makes global signal recovery easier compared to contamination resulting from a single, slow oscillation pattern.</description>

      <title>Costs of Bayesian Parameter Estimation in Third-Generation Gravitational Wave Detectors: a Review of Acceleration Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference with stochastic sampling has been widely used to obtain the properties of gravitational wave (GW) sources. Although computationally intensive, its cost remains manageable for current second-generation GW detectors because of the relatively low event rate and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The third-generation (3G) GW detectors are expected to detect hundreds of thousands of compact binary coalescence events every year with substantially higher SNR and longer signal duration, presenting significant computational challenges. In this study, we systematically evaluate the computational costs of source parameter estimation (PE) in the 3G era by modeling the PE time cost as a function of SNR and signal duration. We examine the standard PE method alongside acceleration methods including relative binning, multibanding, and reduced order quadrature. We predict that PE for a one-month-observation catalog with 3G detectors could require billions to quadrillions of CPU core hours with the standard PE method, whereas acceleration techniques can reduce this demand to millions of core hours. These findings highlight the necessity for more efficient PE methods to enable cost-effective and environmentally sustainable data analysis for 3G detectors. In addition, we assess the accuracy of accelerated PE methods, emphasizing the need for careful treatment in high-SNR scenarios.</description>

      <title>In Search of Extraterrestrial Artificial Intelligence through the Dyson Sphere-like structures around the Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Are we alone? It is a compelling question that human beings have confronted for centuries. The search for extraterrestrial life is a broad range of quests for finding the simple forms of life up to intelligent beings in the Universe. The plausible assumption is that there is a chance that intelligent life will followed by advanced civilization equipped or even dominated by artificial intelligence (AI). In this work, we categorize the advanced civilizations (on an equal footing, an AI-dominated civilization) on the Kardashev scale. We propose a new scale known as space exploration distance to measure civilization advancement. We propose a relation between this length and the Kardashev scale. Then, we suggest the idea that advanced civilizations will use primordial black holes as sources of harvesting energy. We calculate the energy harvested by calculating the space exploration distance. Finally, we propose an observational method to detect the possibility of extraterrestrial AI using Dyson spheres-like structures around primordial black holes in the Milky Way and other galaxies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) utilizing multiple Large Language Model agents with Retrieval Augmented Generation and that can execute code locally may become beneficial in cosmological data analysis. Here, we illustrate a first small step towards AI-assisted analyses and a glimpse of the potential of MAS to automate and optimize scientific workflows in Cosmology. The system architecture of our example package, that builds upon the autogen/ag2 framework, can be applied to MAS in any area of quantitative scientific research. The particular task we apply our methods to is the cosmological parameter analysis of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope lensing power spectrum likelihood using Monte Carlo Markov Chains. Our work-in-progress code is open source and available at https://github.com/CMBAgents/cmbagent.</description>
