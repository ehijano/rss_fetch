      <title>On the Existence of Shimura curves in the Prym locus of abelian covers of projective line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the theory of Higgs bundles and their stabitlity properties associated to fibered surfaces and the Viehweg-Zuo characterization of Shimura curves in the moduli space of abelian varieties in terms of Higgs bundles, we prove that there does not exist any non-compact Shimura curves in the Prym locus of totally ramified $\Z_{2p}$- or $\Z_{2p}\times (\Z_{p})^{m-1}$-covers of the projective line in $A_{g}$ for $g\geq 8$, where $p\geq 5$ is a prime number.</description>

      <title>Classifying Fano 4-folds with a rational fibration onto a 3-fold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study smooth, complex Fano 4-folds X with a rational contraction onto a 3-fold, namely a rational map X--&gt;Y that factors as a sequence of flips X--&gt;X' followed by a surjective morphism X'-&gt;Y with connected fibers, where Y is normal, projective, and dim Y=3. We show that if X has a rational contraction onto a 3-fold and X is not a product of del Pezzo surfaces, then the Picard number rho(X) of X is at most 9; this bound is sharp. As an application, we show that every Fano 4-fold X with rho(X)=12 is isomorphic to a product of surfaces, thus improving the result by the first named author that shows the same for rho(X)&gt;12. We also give a classification result for Fano 4-folds X, not products of surfaces, having a "special" rational contraction X--&gt;Y with dim Y=3, rho(X)-rho(Y)=2, and rho(X)&gt;6; we show that there are only three possible families. Then we prove that the first family exists if rho(X)=7, and that the second family exists if and only if rho(X)=7. This provides the first examples of Fano 4-folds with rho(X)&gt;6 different from products of del Pezzo surfaces and from the Fano models of the blow-up of P^4 in points. We also construct three new families with rho(X)=6. Finally we show that if a Fano 4-fold X has Lefschetz defect delta(X)=2, then rho(X) is at most 6; this bound is again sharp.</description>

      <title>Schwartz $\kappa$-densities on the moduli stack of rank $2$ bundles near stable bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a curve over a non-archimedean local field of characteristic zero. We formulate algebro-geometric statements that imply boundedness of functions on the moduli space of stable bundles of rank $2$ and fixed odd degree determinant over $C$, coming from the Schwartz space of $\kappa$-densities on the corresponding stack of bundles (earlier we proved that these functions are locally constant on the locus of very stable bundles). We prove the relevant algebro-geometric statements for curves of genus $2$ and for non-hyperelliptic curves of genus $3$.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic vector fields and foliations on toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a toric version of the sheaf of logarithmic vector fields along a divisor of a simplicial toric variety. The notion is also relevant for algebraically independent families of polynomials in the Cox ring. We provide a generalisation of the Saito criterion for the freeness of the toric logarithmic sheaf. We explain the relationship between this sheaf and the usual sheaf of logarithmic vector fields and the connection with holomorphic foliations on toric varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a programmable recursive algorithm for the $\mathbb{S}_n$-representations on the cohomology of the moduli spaces $\overline{\mathcal M}_{0,n}$ of $n$-pointed stable curves of genus 0. As an application, we find explicit inductive and asymptotic formulas for the invariant part $H^*(\overline{\mathcal M}_{0,n}/\mathbb{S}_n)$ and prove that its Poincar\'e polynomial is asymptotically log-concave. Based on numerical computations with our algorithm, we further conjecture that the sequence $\{H^{2k}(\overline{\mathcal M}_{0,n})\}$ of $\mathbb{S}_n$-modules is equivariantly log-concave.</description>

      <title>\"{U}lrich bundles on cyclic coverings of projective spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of \"{u}lrich bundles on cyclic coverings of $\mathbb{P}^n$ of arbitrary degree $d$. Given a relative \"{u}lrich bundle on a complete intersection subvariety, we construct a relative \"{u}lrich bundle on the ambient variety. Using this, we prove that there exists a rank $d$ \"{u}lrich bundle on degree $d$ generic cyclic coverings of $\mathbb{P}^2$ with branch divisor of degree $d \cdot k$ such that $d \cdot k$ is even. When $d \cdot k$ is odd, we also give an estimation of the rank of \"{u}lrich bundle on generic cyclic coverings of $\mathbb{P}^2$.</description>

Abstract: For a triple of convex bodies $(A, B, B)$ we solve the so called effective membership problem, i.e. for generic $f_1, f_2\in\mathbb{C}^{B}$ we provide a method to compute $\mathbb{C}^A\cap I$, where $I=(f_1, f_2)$ is an ideal in the ring of Laurent polynomials. We connect this topic to the study of mixed discriminants and multiple solutions of sparse systems of equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show a Springer type theorem for the variety of parabolic subgroups of type $1,2,6$ for all groups of type $E_6$. As far as we know this gives the first example for the validity of the Springer theorem for projective homogeneous varieties of type $^2E_6$ different from varieties of Borel subgroups. The proof combines several topics, notably the Rost invariant, a Tits construction, Cartan's symmetric spaces and indirectly the structure of the Chow motives of projective homogeneous varieties of exceptional type.</description>

      <title>On the Number of Connected Components of T-Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A T-hypersurface is a combinatorial hypersurface of the real locus of a projective toric variety $Y$. It is constructed from a primitive triangulation $K$ of a moment polytope $P$ of $Y$ and a $0$-cochain $\varepsilon$ on $K$ with coefficients in the field with two elements $\mathbb{F}_2$, called a sign distribution. O. Viro showed that when $K$ is convex the T-hypersurface is ambiantly isotopic to a real algebraic hypersurface of $Y$. A. Renaudineau and K. Shaw gave upper bounds on the Betti numbers of T-hypersurfaces in terms of the Hodge numbers of a generic section of the ample line bundle $L$ associated with the moment polytope. In particular, the number of connected components of a T-hypersurface cannot exceed the geometric genus of a generic section of $L$ plus one. In this article we investigate whether this upper bound is attainable. We are able to characterise the couples $(K;\varepsilon)$ leading to T-hypersurfaces realising the Renaudineau-Shaw upper bound on the number of connected components. This theorem generalises B. Haas' theorem for T-curves. In contrast with this results we find that the upper bound is not always attainable on every primitive triangulations. For some of those on which it is not attainable we provide a sharper upper bound. Finally we use our characterisation to show that there always exists a triangulation and a sign distribution on the standard simplex that reach the Renaudineau-Shaw upper bound. We also study the growth of the expected number of connected components of a T-hypersurface as we dilate the moment polytope by $d$ (i.e. we tensorise the line bundle $d$-times with itself) and show that it is always of the order of $d^n$ where $n$ is the dimension of $P$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analogue to Fontaine's computation for $\Omega_{\bar{\mathbb{Z}}_p/\mathbb{Z}_p}$, we compute the structure of $\Omega_{\mathcal{O}_{\bar{K}_0}/\mathcal{O}_{K_0}}$ (here $K_0$ is the completion of $\mathbb{Q}_p(T)$ at place $p$) and prove that $p^{1-1/p^n}\mathrm{d}p^{1/p^n}$, $T^{1-1/p^n}\mathrm{d}T^{1/p^n}$ and $S^{1-1/p^n}\mathrm{d}S^{1/p^n}$ are linearly dependent (Here $S := 1-T$). The main aim of this article is to find the linear equations for these three differential forms. Then we define a map which is called "differential version" of Fontaine's map to express the equations in a computable way. Finally, we prove that the coefficients in the equation can be expressed in some polynomial forms and compute some examples.</description>

Abstract: We study the torus equivariant K-homology ring of the affine Grassmannian $\mathrm{Gr}_G$ where $G$ is a connected reductive linear algebraic group. In type $A$, we introduce equivariantly deformed symmetric functions called the K-theoretic double $k$-Schur functions as the Schubert bases. The functions are constructed by Demazure operators acting on equivariant parameters. As an application, we provide a Ginzburg-Peterson type realization of the torus-equivariant K-homology ring of $\mathrm{Gr}_{{SL}_n}$ as the coordinate ring of a centralizer family for $PGL_n(\mathbb{C})$.</description>

      <title>On the arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay property for sets of points in multiprojective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01199</link>
      <description>arXiv:1702.01199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Published version: We study the arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay (ACM) property for finite sets of points in multiprojective spaces, especially $(\mathbb P^1)^n$. A combinatorial characterization, the $(\star)$-property, is known in $\mathbb P^1 \times \mathbb P^1$. We propose a combinatorial property, $(\star_n)$, that directly generalizes the $(\star)$-property to $(\mathbb P^1)^n$ for larger $n$. We show that $X$ is ACM if and only if it satisfies the $(\star_n)$-property. The main tool for several of our results is an extension to the multiprojective setting of certain liaison methods in projective space.
  Corrigendum: We correct a mistake in the cited paper. It introduced a combinatorial property, the $(\star_n)$-property, for a finite set of points $X$ in $(\mathbb P^1)^n$ and claimed that this property holds if and only if $X$ is ACM. In fact $X$ being ACM is a sufficient condition for the $(\star_n)$-property, but we only prove that it is necessary when $n=3$, and we give a counterexample when $n=4$.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal{F}$ be a holomorphic foliation of degree $2$ on $\mathbb{P}^n$ with dimension $k\geq 2$. We prove that either $\mathcal{F}$ is algebraically integrable, or $\mathcal{F}$ is the linear pull-back of a degree-2 foliation by curves on $\mathbb{P}^{n-k+1}$, or $\mathcal{F}$ is a logarithmic foliation of type $(1^{n-k +1},2)$, or $\mathcal{F}$ is a logarithmic foliation of type $(1^{n-k+3})$, or $\mathcal{F}$ is the linear pull-back of a degree-2 foliation of dimension 2 on $\mathbb{P}^{n-k+2}$ tangent to an action of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{aff}(\mathbb{C})$. As a byproduct, we describe the geometry of Poisson structures on $\mathbb{P}^n$ with generic rank two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of elements of the Iwahori-Weyl group of a reductive group that we call positive Coxeter elements. This class consists of elements which are linked to partial Coxeter elements in the finite Weyl group in a certain canonical way, extending the more restrictive notion of finite Coxeter part previously introduced by He-Nie-Yu. We show that the affine Deligne-Lusztig varieties associated with such elements have a very simple and explicitly described geometric structure. Conversely, we explain how some of these geometric properties can be used to characterize elements of positive Coxeter type.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04429v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical multidimensional resultant can be defined as the, suitably normalized, generator of a projective elimination ideal in the ring of universal coefficients. This is the approach via the so-called inertia forms or Tr\"{a}gheitsformen. Using clever substitutions, Mertens and Hurwitz gave a criterion, for recognizing such inertia forms, which amounts to a linear system for their numerical coefficients. In this article we explicitly solve this linear system. We do so by identifying a subset of the available equations which forms a unitriangular system. The key notion we use is that of transversal, i.e., a selection of a monomial term in each of the homogeneous polynomials at hand. We need two such transversals which are disjoint and extremal, in the sense that they relate to extremizers of a, possibly new, determinantal inequality for differences of two substochastic matrices. Thanks to this notion of extremal pair of transversals, we derive an explicit formula for the coefficients of general multidimensional resultants, as a sum of terms made of a sign times a product of multinomial coefficients, thereby explicitly showing they are integer-valued.</description>

Abstract: We prove D\'{e}vissage theorems for Hermitian $K$ Theory (or $GW$ theory), analogous to Quillen's D\'{e}vissage theorem for $K$-theory. For abelian categories ${\mathscr A}:=({\mathscr A}, ^{\vee}, \varpi)$ with duality, and appropriate abelian subcategories ${\mathscr B}\subseteq {\mathscr A}$, we prove D\'{e}vissage theorems for ${\bf GW}$ spaces, $G{\mathcal W}$-spectra and ${\mathbb G}W$ bispectra. As a consequence, for regular local rings $R$ with $1/2\in R$, we compute the ${\mathbb G}W$ groups ${\mathbb G}W^{[n]}_k(Spec{R})$ forall $k, n\in {\mathbb Z}$, where $n$ represent the translation.</description>
