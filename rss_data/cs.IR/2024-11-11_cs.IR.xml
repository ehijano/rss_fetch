      <title>IntellBot: Retrieval Augmented LLM Chatbot for Cyber Threat Knowledge Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of cyber security, intelligent chatbots are gaining prominence. Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing empower these chatbots to handle user inquiries and deliver threat intelligence. This helps cyber security knowledge readily available to both professionals and the public. Traditional rule-based chatbots often lack flexibility and struggle to adapt to user interactions. In contrast, Large Language Model-based chatbots offer contextually relevant information across multiple domains and adapt to evolving conversational contexts. In this work, we develop IntellBot, an advanced cyber security Chatbot built on top of cutting-edge technologies like Large Language Models and Langchain alongside a Retrieval-Augmented Generation model to deliver superior capabilities. This chatbot gathers information from diverse data sources to create a comprehensive knowledge base covering known vulnerabilities, recent cyber attacks, and emerging threats. It delivers tailored responses, serving as a primary hub for cyber security insights. By providing instant access to relevant information and resources, this IntellBot enhances threat intelligence, incident response, and overall security posture, saving time and empowering users with knowledge of cyber security best practices. Moreover, we analyzed the performance of our copilot using a two-stage evaluation strategy. We achieved BERT score above 0.8 by indirect approach and a cosine similarity score ranging from 0.8 to 1, which affirms the accuracy of our copilot. Additionally, we utilized RAGAS to evaluate the RAG model, and all evaluation metrics consistently produced scores above 0.77, highlighting the efficacy of our system.</description>

      <title>An Early FIRST Reproduction and Improvements to Single-Token Decoding for Fast Listwise Reranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances have demonstrated that large language models (LLMs) excel as listwise rerankers, but their high computational demands remain a barrier to widespread adoption. Further, the traditional language modeling (LM) objective is not ideally suited for reranking tasks. FIRST is a novel approach that addresses these challenges by integrating a learning-to-rank objective and leveraging the logits of only the first generated token, thereby significantly reducing inference latency compared to traditional LLM rerankers. In this study, we extend the evaluation of FIRST to the TREC Deep Learning datasets (DL19-22), validating its robustness across diverse domains. We investigate the influence of different first-stage retrievers on FIRST rerankers, observing diminishing returns and patterns consistent with traditional LLM rerankers. Through applying the FIRST objective to a broader range of backbone models, we achieve effectiveness surpassing the original implementation. Our experiments confirm that fast reranking with single-token logits does not compromise out-of-domain reranking quality. To better quantify the computational savings in the original study, we measure and compare latency to find a 21%-42% gain across various models and benchmarks. Moreover, while LM training implicitly improves zero-shot single-token reranking, our experiments also raise questions about whether LM pre-training may hinder subsequent fine-tuning with the FIRST objective. These findings pave the way for more efficient and effective listwise reranking in future applications.</description>

      <title>Why These Documents? Explainable Generative Retrieval with Hierarchical Category Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative retrieval has recently emerged as a new alternative of traditional information retrieval approaches. However, existing generative retrieval methods directly decode docid when a query is given, making it impossible to provide users with explanations as an answer for "Why this document is retrieved?". To address this limitation, we propose Hierarchical Category Path-Enhanced Generative Retrieval(HyPE), which enhances explainability by generating hierarchical category paths step-by-step before decoding docid. HyPE leverages hierarchical category paths as explanation, progressing from broad to specific semantic categories. This approach enables diverse explanations for the same document depending on the query by using shared category paths between the query and the document, and provides reasonable explanation by reflecting the document's semantic structure through a coarse-to-fine manner. HyPE constructs category paths with external high-quality semantic hierarchy, leverages LLM to select appropriate candidate paths for each document, and optimizes the generative retrieval model with path-augmented dataset. During inference, HyPE utilizes path-aware reranking strategy to aggregate diverse topic information, allowing the most relevant documents to be prioritized in the final ranked list of docids. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that HyPE not only offers a high level of explainability but also improves the retrieval performance in the document retrieval task.</description>

      <title>Harnessing High-Level Song Descriptors towards Natural Language-Based Music Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems relying on Language Models (LMs) have gained popularity in assisting users to navigate large catalogs. LMs often exploit item high-level descriptors, i.e. categories or consumption contexts, from training data or user preferences. This has been proven effective in domains like movies or products. However, in the music domain, understanding how effectively LMs utilize song descriptors for natural language-based music recommendation is relatively limited. In this paper, we assess LMs effectiveness in recommending songs based on user natural language descriptions and items with descriptors like genres, moods, and listening contexts. We formulate the recommendation task as a dense retrieval problem and assess LMs as they become increasingly familiar with data pertinent to the task and domain. Our findings reveal improved performance as LMs are fine-tuned for general language similarity, information retrieval, and mapping longer descriptions to shorter, high-level descriptors in music.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs to Enable Natural Language Search on Go-to-market Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enterprise searches require users to have complex knowledge of queries, configurations, and metadata, rendering it difficult for them to access information as needed. Most go-to-market (GTM) platforms utilize advanced search, an interface that enables users to filter queries by various fields using categories or keywords, which, historically, however, has proven to be exceedingly cumbersome, as users are faced with seemingly hundreds of options, fields, and buttons. Consequently, querying with natural language has long been ideal, a notion further empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs).
  In this paper, we implement and evaluate a solution for the Zoominfo product for sellers, which prompts the LLM with natural language, producing search fields through entity extraction that are then converted into a search query. The intermediary search fields offer numerous advantages for each query, including the elimination of syntax errors, simpler ground truths, and an intuitive format for the LLM to interpret.
  We paired this pipeline with many advanced prompt engineering strategies, featuring an intricate system message, few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, and execution refinement. Furthermore, we manually created the ground truth for 500+ natural language queries, enabling the supervised fine-tuning of Llama-3-8B-Instruct and the introduction of sophisticated numerical metrics.
  Comprehensive experiments with closed, open source, and fine-tuned LLM models were conducted through exact, Jaccard, cosine, and semantic similarity on individual search entities to demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Overall, the most accurate closed model had an average accuracy of 97% per query, with only one field performing under 90%, with comparable results observed from the fine-tuned models.</description>

      <title>FineTuneBench: How well do commercial fine-tuning APIs infuse knowledge into LLMs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is great interest in fine-tuning frontier large language models (LLMs) to inject new information and update existing knowledge. While commercial LLM fine-tuning APIs from providers such as OpenAI and Google promise flexible adaptation for various applications, the efficacy of fine-tuning remains unclear. In this study, we introduce FineTuneBench, an evaluation framework and dataset for understanding how well commercial fine-tuning APIs can successfully learn new and updated knowledge. We analyze five frontier LLMs with commercially available fine-tuning APIs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, on their effectiveness in two settings: (1) ingesting novel information, such as recent news events and new people profiles, and (2) updating existing knowledge, such as updated medical guidelines and code frameworks. Our results reveal substantial shortcomings in all the models' abilities to effectively learn new information through fine-tuning, with an average generalization accuracy of 37% across all models. When updating existing knowledge, such as incorporating medical guideline updates, commercial fine-tuning APIs show even more limited capability (average generalization accuracy of 19%). Overall, fine-tuning GPT-4o mini is the most effective for infusing new knowledge and updating knowledge, followed by GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4o. The fine-tuning APIs for Gemini 1.5 Flesh and Gemini 1.5 Pro are unable to learn new knowledge or update existing knowledge. These findings underscore a major shortcoming in using current commercial fine-tuning services to achieve reliable knowledge infusion in common scenarios. We open source the FineTuneBench dataset at https://github.com/kevinwu23/StanfordFineTuneBench.</description>

      <title>Improving Multi-Domain Task-Oriented Dialogue System with Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Task-oriented dialogue (TOD) system is designed to accomplish user-defined tasks through dialogues. The TOD system has progressed towards end-to-end modeling by leveraging pre-trained large language models. Fine-tuning the pre-trained language models using only supervised learning leads to the exposure bias and token loss problem and it deviates the models from completing the user's task. To address these issues, we propose a TOD system that leverages a unified pre-trained language model, GPT2, as a base model. It is optimized using supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL). The issues in the TOD system are mitigated using a non-differentiable reward function. The reward is calculated using the weighted sum of the success rate and BLEU evaluation metrics. The success rate and BLEU metrics in reward calculation guide the language model for user task completion while ensuring a coherent and fluent response. Our model is acquired by fine-tuning a pre-trained model on the dialogue-session level which comprises user utterance, belief state, system act, and system response. Experimental results on MultiWOZ2.1 demonstrate that our model increases the inform rate by 1.60% and the success rate by 3.17% compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>Ev2R: Evaluating Evidence Retrieval in Automated Fact-Checking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current automated fact-checking (AFC) approaches commonly evaluate evidence either implicitly via the predicted verdicts or by comparing retrieved evidence with a predefined closed knowledge source, such as Wikipedia. However, these methods suffer from limitations, resulting from their reliance on evaluation metrics developed for different purposes and constraints imposed by closed knowledge sources. Recent advances in natural language generation (NLG) evaluation offer new possibilities for evidence assessment. In this work, we introduce Ev2R, an evaluation framework for AFC that comprises three types of approaches for evidence evaluation: reference-based, proxy-reference, and reference-less. We evaluate their effectiveness through agreement with human ratings and adversarial tests, and demonstrate that prompt-based scorers, particularly those leveraging LLMs and reference evidence, outperform traditional evaluation approaches.</description>

      <title>On Generative Agents in Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems are the cornerstone of today's information dissemination, yet a disconnect between offline metrics and online performance greatly hinders their development. Addressing this challenge, we envision a recommendation simulator, capitalizing on recent breakthroughs in human-level intelligence exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs). We propose Agent4Rec, a user simulator in recommendation, leveraging LLM-empowered generative agents equipped with user profile, memory, and actions modules specifically tailored for the recommender system. In particular, these agents' profile modules are initialized using real-world datasets (e.g. MovieLens, Steam, Amazon-Book), capturing users' unique tastes and social traits; memory modules log both factual and emotional memories and are integrated with an emotion-driven reflection mechanism; action modules support a wide variety of behaviors, spanning both taste-driven and emotion-driven actions. Each agent interacts with personalized recommender models in a page-by-page manner, relying on a pre-implemented collaborative filtering-based recommendation algorithm. We delve into both the capabilities and limitations of Agent4Rec, aiming to explore an essential research question: ``To what extent can LLM-empowered generative agents faithfully simulate the behavior of real, autonomous humans in recommender systems?'' Extensive and multi-faceted evaluations of Agent4Rec highlight both the alignment and deviation between agents and user-personalized preferences. Beyond mere performance comparison, we explore insightful experiments, such as emulating the filter bubble effect and discovering the underlying causal relationships in recommendation tasks. Our codes are available at https://github.com/LehengTHU/Agent4Rec.</description>

      <title>Logic Query of Thoughts: Guiding Large Language Models to Answer Complex Logic Queries with Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04264v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the superb performance in many tasks, large language models (LLMs) bear the risk of generating hallucination or even wrong answers when confronted with tasks that demand the accuracy of knowledge. The issue becomes even more noticeable when addressing logic queries that require multiple logic reasoning steps. On the other hand, knowledge graph (KG) based question answering methods are capable of accurately identifying the correct answers with the help of knowledge graph, yet its accuracy could quickly deteriorate when the knowledge graph itself is sparse and incomplete. It remains a critical challenge on how to integrate knowledge graph reasoning with LLMs in a mutually beneficial way so as to mitigate both the hallucination problem of LLMs as well as the incompleteness issue of knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose 'Logic-Query-of-Thoughts' (LGOT) which is the first of its kind to combine LLMs with knowledge graph based logic query reasoning. LGOT seamlessly combines knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, effectively breaking down complex logic queries into easy to answer subquestions. Through the utilization of both knowledge graph reasoning and LLMs, it successfully derives answers for each subquestion. By aggregating these results and selecting the highest quality candidate answers for each step, LGOT achieves accurate results to complex questions. Our experimental findings demonstrate substantial performance enhancements, with up to 20% improvement over ChatGPT.</description>

      <title>Cluster-based Graph Collaborative Filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) have significantly succeeded in learning user and item representations for recommendation systems. The core of their efficacy is the ability to explicitly exploit the collaborative signals from both the first- and high-order neighboring nodes. However, most existing GCN-based methods overlook the multiple interests of users while performing high-order graph convolution. Thus, the noisy information from unreliable neighbor nodes (e.g., users with dissimilar interests) negatively impacts the representation learning of the target node. Additionally, conducting graph convolution operations without differentiating high-order neighbors suffers the over-smoothing issue when stacking more layers, resulting in performance degradation. In this paper, we aim to capture more valuable information from high-order neighboring nodes while avoiding noise for better representation learning of the target node. To achieve this goal, we propose a novel GCN-based recommendation model, termed Cluster-based Graph Collaborative Filtering (ClusterGCF). This model performs high-order graph convolution on cluster-specific graphs, which are constructed by capturing the multiple interests of users and identifying the common interests among them. Specifically, we design an unsupervised and optimizable soft node clustering approach to classify user and item nodes into multiple clusters. Based on the soft node clustering results and the topology of the user-item interaction graph, we assign the nodes with probabilities for different clusters to construct the cluster-specific graphs. To evaluate the effectiveness of ClusterGCF, we conducted extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can significantly improve recommendation performance.</description>

      <title>RRADistill: Distilling LLMs' Passage Ranking Ability for Document Re-Ranking of Long-Tail Queries in a Search Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding the semantic relationships between queries and documents, even with lengthy and complex long-tail queries. These queries are challenging for feedback-based rankings due to sparse user engagement and limited feedback, making LLMs' ranking ability highly valuable. However, the large size and slow inference of LLMs necessitate the development of smaller, more efficient models (sLLMs). Recently, integrating ranking label generation into distillation techniques has become crucial, but existing methods underutilize LLMs' capabilities and are cumbersome. Our research, RRADistill: Re-Ranking Ability Distillation, propose an efficient label generation pipeline and novel sLLM training methods for both encoder and decoder models. We introduce an encoder-based method using a Term Control Layer to capture term matching signals and a decoder-based model with a ranking layer for enhanced understanding. A/B testing on a Korean-based search platform, validates the effectiveness of our approach in improving re-ranking for long-tail queries.</description>

      <title>Feature Noise Resilient for QoS Prediction with Probabilistic Deep Supervision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02580v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate Quality of Service (QoS) prediction is essential for enhancing user satisfaction in web recommendation systems, yet existing prediction models often overlook feature noise, focusing predominantly on label noise. In this paper, we present the Probabilistic Deep Supervision Network (PDS-Net), a robust framework designed to effectively identify and mitigate feature noise, thereby improving QoS prediction accuracy. PDS-Net operates with a dual-branch architecture: the main branch utilizes a decoder network to learn a Gaussian-based prior distribution from known features, while the second branch derives a posterior distribution based on true labels. A key innovation of PDS-Net is its condition-based noise recognition loss function, which enables precise identification of noisy features in objects (users or services). Once noisy features are identified, PDS-Net refines the feature's prior distribution, aligning it with the posterior distribution, and propagates this adjusted distribution to intermediate layers, effectively reducing noise interference. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world QoS datasets demonstrate that PDS-Net consistently outperforms existing models, achieving an average improvement of 8.91% in MAE on Dataset D1 and 8.32% on Dataset D2 compared to the ate-of-the-art. These results highlight PDS-Net's ability to accurately capture complex user-service relationships and handle feature noise, underscoring its robustness and versatility across diverse QoS prediction environments.</description>

Abstract: Singlish, or Colloquial Singapore English, is a language formed from oral and social communication within multicultural Singapore. In this work, we work on a fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) task: Parts-Of-Speech (POS) tagging of Singlish sentences. For our analysis, we build a parallel Singlish dataset containing direct English translations and POS tags, with translation and POS annotation done by native Singlish speakers. Our experiments show that automatic transition- and transformer- based taggers perform with only $\sim 80\%$ accuracy when evaluated against human-annotated POS labels, suggesting that there is indeed room for improvement on computation analysis of the language. We provide an exposition of challenges in Singlish annotation: its inconsistencies in form and semantics, the highly context-dependent particles of the language, its structural unique expressions, and the variation of the language on different mediums. Our task definition, resultant labels and results reflects the challenges in analysing colloquial languages formulated from a variety of dialects, and paves the way for future studies beyond POS tagging.</description>
