      <title>Exo-Daisy World: Revisiting Gaia Theory through an Informational Architecture Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Daisy World model has long served as a foundational framework for understanding the self-regulation of planetary biospheres, providing insights into the feedback mechanisms that may govern inhabited exoplanets. In this study, we extend the classic Daisy World model through the lens of Semantic Information Theory (SIT), aiming to characterize the information flow between the biosphere and planetary environment -- what we term the \emph{information architecture} of Daisy World systems. Our objective is to develop novel methodologies for analyzing the evolution of coupled planetary systems, including biospheres and geospheres, with implications for astrobiological observations and the identification of agnostic biosignatures. To operationalize SIT in this context, we introduce a version of the Daisy World model tailored to reflect potential conditions on M-dwarf exoplanets, formulating a system of stochastic differential equations that describe the co-evolution of the daisies and their planetary environment. Analysis of this Exo-Daisy World model reveals how correlations between the biosphere and environment intensify with rising stellar luminosity, and how these correlations correspond to distinct phases of information exchange between the coupled systems. This \emph{rein control} provides a quantitative description of the informational feedback between the biosphere and its host planet. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our approach for developing detailed ExoGaia models of inhabited exoplanetary systems, proposing new avenues for interpreting astrobiological data and exploring biosignature candidates.</description>

      <title>Possibilities for methanogenic and acetogenic life in molecular cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14291v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to panspermia, life on Earth may have originated from life forms transported through space from elsewhere. These life forms could have passed through molecular clouds, where the process of methanogenesis could have provided enough energy to sustain living organisms. In this study, we have calculated the Gibbs free energy released from synthesizing hydrocarbons for methanogenic (acetogenic) life in a molecular cloud, with methane (acetic acid) as the final metabolic product. Our calculations demonstrate that the chemical reactions during methanogenesis can release enough free energy to support living organisms. The methanogenic life may have served as the predecessor of life on Earth, and there is some preliminary evidence from various molecular biology studies to support this idea. Furthermore, we propose a potential distinguishing signal to test our model.</description>
