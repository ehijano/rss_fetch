      <title>Benchmarking semi-empirical quantum chemical methods on liquid water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stimulated by the renewed interest and recent developments in semi-empirical quantum chemical (SQC) methods for noncovalent interactions, we examine the properties of liquid water at ambient conditions by means of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, both with the conventional NDDO-type (neglect of diatomic differential overlap) methods, e.g. AM1 and PM6, and with DFTB-type (density-functional tight-binding) methods, e.g. DFTB2 and GFN-xTB. Besides the original parameter sets, some specifically reparametrized SQC methods (denoted as AM1-W, PM6-fm, and DFTB2-iBi) targeting various smaller water systems ranging from molecular clusters to bulk are considered as well. The quality of these different SQC methods for describing liquid water properties at ambient conditions are assessed by comparison to well-established experimental data and also to BLYP-D3 density functional theory-based ab initio MD simulations. Our analyses reveal that static and dynamics properties of bulk water are poorly described by all considered SQC methods with the original parameters, regardless of the underlying theoretical models, with most of the methods suffering from too weak hydrogen bonds and hence predicting a far too fluid water with highly distorted hydrogen bond kinetics. On the other hand, the reparametrized force-matchcd PM6-fm method is shown to be able to quantitatively reproduce the static and dynamic features of liquid water, and thus can be used as a computationally efficient alternative to electronic structure-based MD simulations for liquid water that requires extended length and time scales. DFTB2-iBi predicts a slightly overstructured water with reduced fluidity, whereas AM1-W gives an amorphous ice-like structure for water at ambient conditions.</description>

      <title>Fourier-Based 3D Multistage Transformer for Aberration Correction in Multicellular Specimens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution tissue imaging is often compromised by sample-induced optical aberrations that degrade resolution and contrast. While wavefront sensor-based adaptive optics (AO) can measure these aberrations, such hardware solutions are typically complex, expensive to implement, and slow when serially mapping spatially varying aberrations across large fields of view. Here, we introduce AOViFT (Adaptive Optical Vision Fourier Transformer) -- a machine learning-based aberration sensing framework built around a 3D multistage Vision Transformer that operates on Fourier domain embeddings. AOViFT infers aberrations and restores diffraction-limited performance in puncta-labeled specimens with substantially reduced computational cost, training time, and memory footprint compared to conventional architectures or real-space networks. We validated AOViFT on live gene-edited zebrafish embryos, demonstrating its ability to correct spatially varying aberrations using either a deformable mirror or post-acquisition deconvolution. By eliminating the need for the guide star and wavefront sensing hardware and simplifying the experimental workflow, AOViFT lowers technical barriers for high-resolution volumetric microscopy across diverse biological samples.</description>

      <title>SynLlama: Generating Synthesizable Molecules and Their Analogs with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative machine learning models for small molecule drug discovery have shown immense promise, but many molecules generated by this approach are too difficult to synthesize to be worth further investigation or further development. We present a novel approach by fine-tuning Meta's Llama3 large language models (LLMs) to create SynLlama, which generates full synthetic pathways made of commonly accessible Enamine building blocks and robust organic reaction templates. SynLlama explores a large synthesizable space using significantly less data compared to other state-of-the-art methods, and offers strong performance in bottom-up synthesis, synthesizable analog generation, and hit expansion, offering medicinal chemists a valuable tool for drug discovery developments. We find that SynLlama can effectively generalize to unseen yet purchasable building blocks, meaning that its reconstruction capabilities extend to a broader synthesizable chemical space than the training data.</description>

      <title>Random motility regulation drives the fragmentation of microbial ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-organization of microbial ecosystems involves a large variety of mechanisms, ranging from biochemical signaling to population dynamics. Among these, the role of motility regulation has been little studied, despite the importance of active migration processes. Here we show how weak, random motility regulation generically induces the fragmentation of bacterial ecosystems comprising a large number of coexisting strains. To do so, we simulate microscopic models of run-and-tumble bacteria whose self-propulsion speeds are regulated by the local density of each strain. Our simulations reveal that, as the heterogeneity of the interaction network increases, the ecosystem undergoes a phase transition leading to the emergence of distinct communities. To account for these results and assess their robustness, we use random-matrix theory to analyze the hydrodynamic description of the bacterial ecosystem, obtaining a quantitative agreement with our microscopic simulations. Our results are shown to hold for a variety of motility-regulation mechanisms and should be relevant to the study of community formation by motile organisms.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution Radial Fluctuations Enables Polarization-resolved Nonlinear Optical Nanoscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Second harmonic generation microscopy (SHG) is a powerful imaging modality which has found applications in investigating both biological and synthetic nanostructures. Like all optical microscopy techniques, the resolution of SHG is limited to approximately half the wavelength of the excitation light. Because of this several groups have proposed techniques to enable super-resolution SHG imaging. However, these techniques often involve quite complicated optical setups compared to standard SHG microscopes, a major impediment towards more widespread utilization. Here we apply super-resolution radial fluctuations (SRRF), a commonly used technique for super-resolution fluorescence imaging, to enable super-resolution SHG microscopy. By imaging individual nanostructures, we demonstrate that SRRF can provide resolution enhancement of up to 3x compared to a laser scanning SHG microscope, which is comparable to the best resolution enhancement reported in the literature. Additionally, we show that SRRF maintains the polarization dependence of SHG, therefore enabling super-resolution polarization SHG imaging. Finally, we perform SRRF processing on third harmonic generation images to demonstrate the significant potential of SRRF for other super-resolution nonlinear optical microscopy. Importantly, since SRRF can achieve super-resolution purely through image processing, the technique demonstrated here could be used to enhance the resolution of images obtained using a wide variety of nonlinear optical microscopy setups including both laser scanning and widefield configurations.</description>

      <title>Exact Results in Stochastic Processes with Division, Death, and Diffusion: Spatial Correlations, Marginal Entropy Production, and Macroscopic Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a generic class of stochastic particle-based models whose state at an instant in time is described by a set of continuous degrees of freedom (e.g. positions), and the length of this set changes stochastically in time due to birth-death processes. Using a master equation formalism, we write down the dynamics of the corresponding (infinite) set of probability distributions: this takes the form of coupled Fokker-Planck equations with model-dependent source and sink terms. We derive the general expression of entropy production rate for this class of models in terms of path irreversibility. To demonstrate the practical use of this framework, we analyze a biologically motivated model incorporating division, death, and diffusion, where spatial correlations arise through the division process. By systematically integrating out excess degrees of freedom, we obtain the marginal probability distribution, enabling exact calculations of key statistical properties such as average density and correlation functions. We validate our analytical results through numerical Brownian dynamics simulations, finding excellent agreement between theory and simulation. Our method thus provides a powerful tool for tackling previously unsolved problems in stochastic birth-death dynamics.</description>

      <title>Label-free mid-infrared photothermal microscopy revisits intracellular thermal dynamics: what do fluorescent nanothermometers measure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fluorescent nanothermometry has revealed pronounced inhomogeneous temperature distributions within cells and has opened the field of single-cell thermal biology. However, this finding has sparked a controversial discussion known as the 10^5 gap issue, which arises from a simple heat conduction calculation suggesting such large temperature distributions should not exist inside cells. Here, we address this issue using label-free mid-infrared photothermal microscopy, which enables us to measure heat-induced temperature variations under local thermal equilibrium via refractive index changes. First, we measured intracellular thermal diffusivity via transient thermal decay and determined that thermal diffusivity within living cells is 93-94% of water in the cytoplasm and nucleus. This result does not support the hypothesis that intracellular thermal conduction is considerably slower than in water. Next, we compared fluorescent nanothermometry with our label-free thermometry by measuring heat-induced temperature variations in living cells and found that the fluorescent nanothermometry showed a slowly varying signal in addition to a rapidly responding temperature change. This result indicates that fluorescent nanothermometers are sensitive to additional factors beyond the temperature defined under local thermal equilibrium, which do not follow the behavior predicted by thermal conduction. From this study, we conclude that the 10^5 gap issue arises from comparing two fundamentally different physical quantities. This finding also raises an open question regarding the origin of the additional factors that fluorescence nanothermometers measure.</description>

      <title>Phase changes of the flow rate in the vertebral artery caused by debranching thoracic endovascular aortic repair: effects of flow path and local vessel stiffness on vertebral arterial pulsation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite numerous studies on cerebral arterial blood flow, there has not yet been a comprehensive description of hemodynamics in patients undergoing debranching thoracic endovascular aortic repair (dTEVAR), a promising surgical option for aortic arch aneurysms. A phase delay of the flow rate in the left vertebral artery (LVA) in patients after dTEVAR compared to those before was experimentally observed, while the phase in the right vertebral artery (RVA) remained almost the same before and after surgery. Since this surgical intervention included stent graft implantation and extra-anatomical bypass, it was expected that the intracranial hemodynamic changes due to dTEVAR were coupled with fluid flow and pulse waves in cerebral arteries. To clarify this issue, A one-dimensional model (1D) was used to numerically investigate the relative contribution (i.e., local vessel stiffness and flow path changes) of the VA flow rate to the phase difference. The numerical results demonstrated a phase delay of flow rate in the LVA but not the RVA in postoperative patients undergoing dTEVAR relative to preoperative patients. The results further showed that the primary factor affecting the phase delay of the flow rate in the LVA after surgery compared to that before was the bypass, i.e., alteration of flow path, rather than stent grafting, i.e., the change in local vessel stiffness. The numerical results provide insights into hemodynamics in postoperative patients undergoing dTEVAR, as well as knowledge about therapeutic decisions.</description>

      <title>Alpha helices are more evolutionarily robust to environmental perturbations than beta sheets: Bayesian learning and statistical mechanics for protein evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03297v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How typical elements that shape organisms, such as protein secondary structures, have evolved, or how evolutionarily susceptible/resistant they are to environmental changes, are significant issues in evolutionary biology, structural biology, and biophysics. According to Darwinian evolution, natural selection and genetic mutations are the primary drivers of biological evolution. However, the concept of ``robustness of the phenotype to environmental perturbations across successive generations," which seems crucial from the perspective of natural selection, has not been formalized or analyzed. In this study, through Bayesian learning and statistical mechanics we formalize the stability of the free energy in the space of amino acid sequences that can design particular protein structure against perturbations of the chemical potential of water surrounding a protein as such robustness. This evolutionary stability is defined as a decreasing function of a quantity analogous to the susceptibility in the statistical mechanics of magnetic bodies specific to the amino acid sequence of a protein. Consequently, in a two-dimensional square lattice protein model composed of 36 residues, we found that as we increase the stability of the free energy against perturbations in environmental conditions, the structural space shows a steep step-like reduction. Furthermore, lattice protein structures with higher stability against perturbations in environmental conditions tend to have a higher proportion of $\alpha$-helices and a lower proportion of $\beta$-sheets. This result is qualitatively confirmed by comparing the histograms of the percentage of secondary structures of evolutionarily robust proteins and randomly selected proteins through an empirical validation using a protein database.</description>

      <title>Open-System Virus Particle Physics: A Path-Integral Viral Lattice Theory Using Non-Self Adjoint Stochastic PDEs and Fock-Space Formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a comprehensive theoretical biophysics model grounded in a path integral perspective and an m-sectorial open-system framework, to describe complex, damped viral phonon dynamics in resource limited and noise driven environments. By unifying wave mechanics (via PDEs with multiplicative noise), Markov jumps for occupant or arrangement transitions, and second quantized (Fock-space) expansions, our construction accommodates an unbounded number of viral lattices in a single global wavefunction. In doing so, we capture how an entire population potentially numbering in the millions may be represented by a single operator theoretic state, or orbit, whose evolution is governed by non-unitary semigroups with potential equilibrium or non equilibrium steady states. This approach admits action functionals over the space of system trajectories, enabling large deviation and flux analyses whenever detailed balance is broken by sustained resource inputs, as often happens in real infections.
  Such a global wavefunction thus synthesizes PDE wavefront modes, occupant transitions, and stochastically induced rearrangements into a single evolution equation, capturing how local capsid vibrations might catalyze large scale replication bursts, and vice versa. Our proofs show that, despite unbounded occupant expansions or morphological continuums, solutions remain finite norm over finite times. The well posedness extends to non-self-adjoint operators with complex damping, irreversibility, and operator-valued-noise, thus mirroring host constraints and immune factors that restrict virus proliferation. Our formalism invites direct experimental cross validation, from single virion tracking to population assays, and offers predictive insights for resource limited replication, capsid reorganizations, and potential intervention strategies in modern virology.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Modeling and Analysis of Transport Phenomena for Continuous Lyophilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lyophilization (aka freeze drying) is a typical process in pharmaceutical manufacturing used for improving the stability of various drug products, including its recent applications to mRNA vaccines. While extensive efforts have been dedicated to shifting the pharmaceutical industry toward continuous manufacturing, the majority of industrial-scale lyophilization is still being operated in a batch mode. This article presents the first mechanistic model for a complete continuous lyophilization process, which comprehensively incorporates and describes key transport phenomena in all three steps of lyophilization, namely freezing, primary drying, and secondary drying. The proposed model considers the state-of-the-art lyophilization technology, in which vials are suspended and move continuously through the process. The validated model can accurately predict the evolution of critical process parameters, including the product temperature, ice/water fraction, sublimation front position, and concentration of bound water, for the entire process. Several applications related to model-based process design and optimization of continuous lyophilization are also demonstrated. The final model is made available in MATLAB and Julia as an open-source software package called ContLyo, which can ultimately be leveraged for guiding the design and development of future continuous lyophilization processes.</description>

      <title>Extreme events at the onset of epileptic-like intermittent activity of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators on small-world networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the influence of coupling strength, network size, and randomness on the collective dynamics of FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators on complex networks. Using Watts-Strogatz small-world network connectivities, we identify four distinct dynamical phases: chaotic, intermittent, partially synchronized, and fully synchronized. The intermittent phase is characterized by the coexistence of chaotic behavior and chimera states, reminiscent of epileptic-seizure-related (ESR) intermittency observed in the brain. We analyze the inter-spike intervals of the individual oscillators, and the existence, duration, and frequency of ESR events as a function of the system parameters. Furthermore, we study the transitions into and out of the intermittent phase and show that peaks in the probability of extreme events--short transients of anomalously high synchronization--precede the transitions from chaos to intermittency and from partial to full synchronization. These transitions are followed by significant changes in the maximum Lyapunov exponent and Kaplan-Yorke dimension. Finally, we discuss how the coupling strength and network properties can be leveraged to control the system's state and the potential applications of extreme event analysis in the study of neural data.</description>

Abstract: To double the cellular population of ribosomes, a fraction of the active ribosomes is allocated to synthesize ribosomal proteins. Subsequently, these ribosomal proteins enter the ribosome self-assembly process, synthesizing new ribosomes and forming the well-known ribosome autocatalytic subcycle. Neglecting ribosome lifetime and the duration of the self-assembly process, the doubling rate of all cellular biomass can be equated with the fraction of ribosomes allocated to synthesize an essential ribosomal protein times its synthesis rate. However, ribosomes have a finite lifetime, and the assembly process has a finite duration. Furthermore, the number of ribosomes is known to decrease with slow growth rates. The finite lifetime of ribosomes and the decline in their numbers present a challenge in sustaining slow growth solely through controlling the allocation of ribosomes to synthesize more ribosomal proteins. When the number of ribosomes allocated per mRNA of an essential ribosomal protein is approximately one, the resulting fluctuations in the production rate of new ribosomes increase, causing a potential risk that the actual production rate will fall below the ribosome death rate. Thus, in this regime, a significant risk of extinction of the ribosome population emerges. To mitigate this risk, we suggest that the ribosome translation speed is used as an alternative control parameter, which facilitates the maintenance of slow growth rates with a larger ribosome pool. We clarify the observed reduction in translation speed at harsh environments in E. coli and C. Glutamicum, explore other mitigation strategies, and suggest additional falsifiable predictions of our model.</description>
