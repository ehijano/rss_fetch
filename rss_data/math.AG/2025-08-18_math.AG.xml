      <title>Deformations of maps with fixed target and curvature of direct image bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a smooth proper holomorphic fibration of complex manifolds. It is known that the semipositivity of the curvature of the direct image of the relative canonical bundle can be read in terms of the cup product with the Kodaira-Spencer class of the fibers.
  Motivated by this result, in this paper we study the relation between deformations of maps with fixed target and the curvature of certain direct image bundles. As a result, we find some curvature formulas and use them to prove a seminegativity result for a vector bundle of relative forms naturally related to the deformation data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct standard resolutions for analytic local modules on complex hypersurfaces using standard basis methods, with extensions to complete intersections. The algebraic version over arbitrary infinite fields is also suggested. Applications include derived category formula of local hypersurface blow-ups, revealing new connections between standard bases and categorical geometry.</description>

      <title>Bicentric configurations of pentagonal linkages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a planar $n$-gon with the sidelengths $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ and let us denote by $L=L(P)$ the corresponding planar polygonal linkage. We are concerned with the problem of finding conditions on the sidelengths $a_i$ which guarantee the existence of a bicentric configuration of $L$. Specifically, we present some related results on tangential and chordal polygons and characterize pentagonal linkages having bicentric configurations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify $G$-Mori fibre spaces equivariantly birational to smooth quadric threefolds with fixed-point free actions of the alternating group $G=\mathfrak A_5$. We deduce that such quadric threefolds are $G$-solid and the $G$-actions on them are not projectively linearizable.</description>

      <title>Coulomb branch localization, quasimaps, and surface counting in Calabi--Yau fourfolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a string theoretic approach to surface counting in local Calabi--Yau fourfolds via supersymmetric localization in topologically twisted four-dimensional gauge theories. This approach is based on a spectral correspondence between PT1-stable pairs on local fourfolds and twisted quasimaps with fixed two-dimensional domain associated to the ADHM quiver, or, equivalently, ADHM sheaves. For local toric fourfolds, we derive a conjectural residue formula for the K-theoretic quasimap partition via Coulomb branch localization. As a result, in this case, we obtain a conjectural prescription fixing all usual sign ambiguities in the equivariant computation of such invariants. We present some explicit computations for local P2, extending the results available in the literature, and describe the formalism in general. This is the first instance of Coulomb branch localization for a quasimap theory in the context of four-dimensional gauge theories.</description>

      <title>A cohomological smoothness conjecture for moduli of mixed characteristic local shtukas with one leg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a simple geometric characterization of the locus where the inscribed Banach--Colmez Tangent Spaces of moduli of mixed characteristic local shtukas with one leg and fixed determinant are connected. We conjecture that the structure morphism for the underlying diamond is cohomologically smooth over this locus and, applying the Fargues--Scholze Jacobian criterion, we prove this conjecture in the case of EL infinite level Rapoport--Zink spaces, generalizing a result of Ivanov--Weinstein in the basic case.</description>

      <title>Higher Zariski Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classical constructions of tensor-triangular geometry in the setting of stably symmetric monoidal idempotent-complete $\infty$-categories, henceforth referred to as 2-rings. In this setting, we produce a Zariski topology, a Zariski spectrum, a category of locally 2-ringed spaces (more generally $\infty$-topoi), and an affine spectrum-global sections adjunction, based on the framework of ``$\infty$-topoi with geometric structure'' as developed by Lurie in \cite{LurieDAG5}. Using work of Kock and Pitsch, we compute that the underlying space of the Zariski spectrum of a 2-ring recovers the Balmer spectrum of its homotopy category. These constructions mirror the analogous structures in the classical Zariski geometry of commutative rings (and commutative ring spectra), and we also demonstrate additional compatibility between classical Zariski and higher Zariski geometry. For rigid 2-rings, we show that the descent results of Balmer and Favi admit coherent enhancements. As a corollary, we obtain that the Zariski spectrum fully faithfully embeds rigid 2-rings into locally 2-ringed $\infty$-topoi. In an appendix, we prove a ``stalk-locality principle'' for the telescope conjecture in the rigid setting, extending earlier work of Hrbek.</description>

      <title>Positive density of primes of ordinary reduction for abelian varieties of simple signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By a result of Serre, if $A$ is an elliptic curve without CM defined over a number field $L$, then the set of primes of $L$ for which $A$ has ordinary reduction has density $1$. Katz and Ogus proved the same is true when $A$ is an abelian surface, after possibly passing to a finite extension of $L$. More recently, Sawin computed the density of the set of primes of $L$ for which an abelian surface $A$ has ordinary reduction, depending on the endomorphism algebra of $A$. In this paper, we prove some generalizations of these results when $A$ is an absolutely simple abelian variety of arbitrary dimension whose endomorphism algebra is a CM field $F$, under specific conditions on the signature of the multiplication action of $F$ on $A$. We include explicit examples from Jacobians of curves of genus three through seven admitting cyclic covers to the projective line.</description>

      <title>Banach modules, almost mathematics and condensed mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relationship between almost mathematics, condensed mathematics and the categories of seminormed and Banach modules over a Banach ring $A$, with submetric (norm-decreasing) $A$-module homomorphisms for morphisms. If $A$ is a Banach ring with a norm-multiplicative topologically nilpotent unit $\varpi$ contained in the closed unit ball $A_{\leq1}$ such that $\varpi$ admits a compatible system of $p$-power roots $\varpi^{1/p^{n}}$ with \begin{equation*}\lVert\varpi^{1/p^{n}}\rVert=\lVert\varpi\rVert^{1/p^{n}}\end{equation*}for all $n$, we prove that the "almost closed unit ball" functor \begin{equation*}M\mapsto M_{\leq1}^{a}\end{equation*}is an equivalence between the category of Banach $A$-modules and submetric $A$-module maps and the category of $\varpi$-adically complete, $\varpi$-torsion-free almost $(A_{\leq1}, (\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-modules. We also obtain an analogous result for Banach algebras and almost algebras. The main novelty in our approach is that we show that the norm on the Banach module $M$ is completely determined by the corresponding almost $A_{\leq1}$-module $M_{\leq1}^{a}$, rather than being determined only up to equivalence.
  We deduce from our results the existence of a natural fully faithful embedding of the category of Banach $A$-modules and submetric $A$-module maps into the category of (static) condensed almost $(A_{\leq1}, (\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-modules in the sense of Mann, which factors through the full subcategory of solid condensed $(A_{\leq1}, (\varpi^{1/p^{\infty}}))$-almost modules. If $A$ is perfectoid and the adic spectrum of $(A, A^{\circ})$ is totally disconnected, we show that this embedding transforms the complete tensor product of Banach $A$-modules into (an almost analog of) the solid tensor product of solid condensed almost modules.</description>

      <title>Anomaly cancellation for a $U(1)$ factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use methods of arithmetic geometry to solve the abelian local anomaly cancellation conditions for a four-dimensional gauge theory whose Lie algebra has a single $\mathfrak{u}_1$ summand, assuming that a solution exists. The resulting polynomial equations in the integer $\mathfrak{u}_1$ charges define a projective cubic hypersurface over the field of rational numbers. Generically, such a hypersurface is (by a theorem of Koll\'{a}r) a unirational variety, making it possible to find a finitely-many-to-one parametrization of all solutions (of which there are necessarily infinitely many). (Otherwise, such a hypersurface is either reducible or is a cone over an elliptic curve and all solutions can again be found in practice.) As an example, for the Standard Model Lie algebra with its three generations of quarks and leptons (or even with just a single generation and two $\mathfrak{su}_3 \oplus \mathfrak{su}_2$-singlet right-handed neutrinos), it follows that there are infinitely many anomaly-free possibilities for the $\mathfrak{u}_1$ hypercharges.</description>

      <title>Inscription, twistors, and $p$-adic periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the theory of inscribed $v$-sheaves, a differentiable extension of the theory of diamonds and $v$-sheaves with internal tangent bundles that are often relative inscribed Banach-Colmez spaces, then apply this theory to the study of $p$-adic periods. In particular, we construct natural inscribed versions of the Hodge and Hodge-Tate period maps and their lattice refinements for de Rham torsors, then compute the derivatives of these period maps in terms of classical structures in $p$-adic Hodge theory. These torsors include infinite level global Shimura varieties and infinite level local Shimura varieties, and for these spaces we also give another moduli-theoretic construction of the inscribed structure; the construction in the local Shimura case applies more generally to the non-minuscule moduli of mixed characterisic local shtukas with one leg. The key new ingredients in our study of inscribed structures on $p$-adic Lie group torsors over smooth rigid varieties over a $p$-adic field are the Liu-Zhu period map, a refinement of the Hodge period map whose derivative is the geometric Sen morphism/canonical Higgs field, and a closely related exact tensor functor from $\mathbb{Q}_p$-local systems to a category of twistor bundles on the relative thickened Fargues-Fontaine curve. These new structures are only visible after passing to the inscribed setting. We also discuss some possible implications of our computations in the vein of ``differential topology for diamonds."</description>

      <title>Bumpless pipe dreams encode Gr\"obner geometry of Schubert polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.08370v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In their study of infinite flag varieties, Lam, Lee, and Shimozono (2021) introduced bumpless pipe dreams in a new combinatorial formula for double Schubert polynomials. These polynomials are the TxT-equivariant cohomology classes of matrix Schubert varieties and of their flat degenerations. We give diagonal term orders with respect to which bumpless pipe dreams index the irreducible components of diagonal Gr\"obner degenerations of matrix Schubert varieties, counted with scheme-theoretic multiplicity.
  This indexing was conjectured by Hamaker, Pechenik, and Weigandt (2022). We also give a generalization to equidimensional unions of matrix Schubert varieties. This result establishes that bumpless pipe dreams are dual to and as geometrically natural as classical pipe dreams, for which an analogous anti-diagonal theory was developed by Knutson and Miller (2005).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.01306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using a geometric argument building on our new theory of graded sheaves, we compute the categorical trace and Drinfel'd center of the (graded) finite Hecke category $\mathsf{H}_W^\mathsf{gr} = \mathsf{Ch}^b(\mathsf{SBim}_W)$ in terms of the category of (graded) unipotent character sheaves, upgrading results of Ben-Zvi-Nadler and Bezrukavninov-Finkelberg-Ostrik. In type $A$, we relate the categorical trace to the category of $2$-periodic coherent sheaves on the Hilbert schemes $\mathsf{Hilb}_n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ of points on $\mathbb{C}^2$ (equivariant with respect to the natural $\mathbb{C}^* \times \mathbb{C}^*$ action), yielding a proof of (a $2$-periodized version of) a conjecture of Gorsky-Negut-Rasmussen which relates HOMFLY-PT link homology and the spaces of global sections of certain coherent sheaves on $\mathsf{Hilb}_n(\mathbb{C}^2)$. As an important computational input, we also establish a conjecture of Gorsky-Hogancamp-Wedrich on the formality of the Hochschild homology of $\mathsf{H}_W^\mathsf{gr}$.</description>

Abstract: We generalize Yekutieli-Zhang's noncommutative Serre Duality Theorem to the setting of noncommutative spaces associated to dg-algebras. As an application, we establish some finiteness properties of derived global sections over such noncommutative spaces. Along the way, we generalize Yekutieli's notion of a balanced dualizing complex to the setting of dg-algebras and establish some cases in which they exist.</description>

      <title>Log Geometric Models for Little Disks Operads in Even Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a model for the (non-unital) S^1-framed little 2d-dimensional disks operad for any positive integer d using logarithmic geometry. We also show that the unframed little 2d-dimensional disks operad has a model which can be constructed using log schemes with virtual morphisms.</description>

      <title>Description of the structure of DG--algebras via characters on a groupoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a description of graded derivations in group algebras. Using this result for arbitrary graduation of the group algebra, we describe all possible structures of DG algebras. The corresponding examples are given. The description is given in terms of characters on a groupoid analogous to the groupoid of inner action.</description>

      <title>Generalised height pairings and the Albanese kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Chabauty--Coleman--Kim method in depth two describes the rational points on a curve in terms of a generalisation of Nekov\'a\v{r}'s $p$-adic height pairing which replaces $\mathbb{G}_m$ with a higher Chow group. It is unclear both what the domain of definition of this pairing is, and how to compute it. This paper explores the relevance of the Beilinson--Bloch conjectures to this problem. In particular, it is shown that if $X$ is a smooth projective curve and the Albanese kernel of $X\times X$ is torsion, then there is an algorithm to compute the generalised height pairing on a pair of rational points on the Jacobian. This leads to the consideration of certain `motivic refinements' of the nonabelian cohomology varieties which arise in nonabelian Chabauty.</description>
