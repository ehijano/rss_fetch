      <title>Problem hardness of diluted Ising models: Population Annealing vs Simulated Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Population annealing is a variant of the simulated annealing algorithm that improves the quality of the thermalization process in systems with rough free-energy landscapes by introducing a resampling process. We consider the diluted Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Ising model using population annealing to study its efficiency in finding solutions to combinatorial optimization problems. From this study, we find an easy-hard-easy transition in the model hardness as the problem instances become more diluted, and associate this behaviour to the clusterization and connectivity of the underlying Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. We calculate the efficiency of obtaining minimum energy configurations and find that population annealing outperforms simulated annealing for the cases close to this hardness peak while reaching similar efficiencies in the easy limits. Finally, it is known that population annealing can be used to define an adaptive inverse temperature annealing schedule. We compare this adaptive method to a linear schedule and find that the adaptive method achieves improved efficiencies while being robust against final temperature miscalibrations.</description>

      <title>Rare Events and Single Big Jump Effects in Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Even in a simple stochastic process, the study of the full distribution of time integrated observables can be a difficult task. This is the case of a much-studied process such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process where, recently, anomalous dynamical scaling of large deviations of time integrated functionals has been highlighted. Using the mapping of a continuous stochastic process to a continuous time random walk via the "excursions technique'', we introduce a comprehensive formalism that enables the calculation of the complete distribution of the time-integrated observable $A = \int_0^T v^n(t) dt$, where $n$ is a positive integer and $v(t)$ is the random velocity of a particle following Ornstein-Uhlenbeck dynamics. We reveal an interesting connection between the anomalous rate function associated with the observable $A$ and the statistics of the area under the first-passage functional during an excursion. The rate function of the latter, analyzed here for the first time, exhibits anomalous scaling behavior and a dynamical phase transition, both of which are explored in detail. The case of the anomalous scaling of large deviations, originally associated to the presence of an instantonic solution in the weak noise regime of a path integral approach, is here produced by a so called "big jump effect'', in which the contribution to rare events is dominated by the largest excursion. Our approach, which is quite general for continuous stochastic processes, allows to associate a physical meaning to the anomalous scaling of large deviations, through the big jump principle.</description>

      <title>Ensemble inequivalence in the design of mixtures with super-Gibbs phase coexistence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing the phase behavior of multicomponent mixtures is a rich area with many potential applications. One key question is how more than $M+1$ phases, as would normally be allowed by Gibbs' phase rule at generic temperature in a mixture of $M$ molecular species, can be made to coexist in equilibrium. In the grandcanonical ensemble, such super-Gibbs phase equilibria can be realized by tuning the interactions among the $M$ species. This introduces $\sim M^2$ additional degrees of freedom and hence a superlinear number of phases that can coexist. We show that, surprisingly, there is no straightforward equivalence to the situation in the experimentally relevant canonical ensemble: here only a subset of the grandcanonical phases will generically be realized. This subset is determined by interfacial tensions in addition to bulk free energies. Using a graph-theoretical approach, we determine a sufficient set of inequalities for the interfacial tensions for which all grandcanonical phases are realized so that equivalence of ensembles is effectively restored. We illustrate the design method for a two-component mixture with four coexisting phases and point out the route for generalizing this to a higher number of components.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of an Electromechanical Energy Harvester</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many techniques originally developed in the context of deterministic control theory have been recently applied to the quest for optimal protocols in stochastic processes. Given a system subject to environmental fluctuations, one may ask what is the best way to change in time its controllable parameters in order to maximize, on average, a certain reward function, while steering the system between two pre-assigned states. In this work we study the problem of optimal control for a wide class of stochastic systems, inspired by a model of energy harvester. The stochastic noise in this system is due to the mechanical vibrations, while the reward function is the average power extracted from them. We consider the case in which the electrical resistance of the harvester can be changed in time, and we exploit the tools of control theory to work out optimal solutions in a perturbative regime, close to the stationary state. Our results show that it is possible to design protocols that perform better than any possible solution with constant resistance.</description>

      <title>Rigorous bound on diffusion for chaotic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of diffusion is one of the deepest physical phenomena observed in many-body interacting, chaotic systems. But establishing rigorously that correlation functions, say of the energy density, expand diffusively, remains one of the most important problems of mathematical physics. We show for the first time that diffusion is non-zero in almost every chaotic nearest-neighbor interacting quantum spin chain (spin-1/2, without magnetic field), at high enough temperatures. A chaotic system is defined in the precise sense that the Hilbert space of extensive charges is one-dimensional. Thus, under the widely expected assumption that almost every nearest-neighbor spin chain is indeed chaotic, we find that almost every nearest-neighbor spin chain has non-zero diffusion. Our main tool is the Green-Kubo formula for diffusivity, the mathematical technique of projection over quadratically extensive charges, and appropriate correlation decay bounds recently established. Our methods can be extended to finite or short ranges, magnetic field and higher spins. As we argue, according to the theory of nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamics, we further expect almost every nearest-neighbor interacting quantum spin chain to display superdiffusion, and thus have infinite diffusivity; however this is still beyond the reach of mathematical rigour.</description>

      <title>DSMC: A Statistical Mechanics Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a perspective in which Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) is viewed not in its traditional role as an algorithm for solving the Boltzmann equation but as a numerical method for statistical mechanics. First, analytical techniques such as the collision virial and Green-Kubo relations, commonly used in molecular dynamics, are used to study the numerical properties of the DSMC algorithm. The stochastic aspect of DSMC, which is often viewed as unwanted numerical noise, is shown to be a useful feature for problems in statistical physics, such as Brownian motion and thermodynamic fluctuations. Finally, it is argued that fundamental results from statistical mechanics can provide guardrails when applying machine learning to DSMC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A compilation of new results on the asymptotic behaviour of the Humbert functions $\Psi_1$ and $\Psi_2$, and also on the Appell function $F_2$, is presented. As a by-product, we confirm a conjectured limit which appeared recently in the study of the $1D$ Glauber-Ising model. We also propose two elementary asymptotic methods and confirm through some illustrative examples that both methods have great potential and can be applied to a large class of problems of asymptotic analysis. Finally, some directions of future research are pointed out in order to suggest ideas for further study.</description>

      <title>Annealed mean-field epidemiological model on scale-free networks with a mitigating factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An annealed version of the quenched mean-field model for epidemic spread is introduced and investigated analytically and assisted by numerical calculations. The interaction between individuals follows a prescription that is used to generate a scale-free network, and we have adjusted the number of connections to produce a sparse network. Specifically, the model's behavior near the infection threshold is examined, as well as the behavior of the stationary prevalence and the probability that a connection between individuals encounters an infected one. We found that these functions display a monotonically increasing dependence on the infection rate. Subsequently, a modification that mimics the mitigation in the probability of encountering an infected individual is introduced, following an old idea rooted in the Malthus-Verhulst model. We found that this modification drastically changes the probability that a connection meets an infected individual. However, despite this change, it does not alter the monotonically increasing behavior of the stationary prevalence.</description>

      <title>TeNeS-v2: Enhancement for Real-Time and Finite Temperature Simulations of Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems are challenging targets for computational physics due to their large degrees of freedom. The tensor networks, particularly Tensor Product States (TPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), effectively represent these systems on two-dimensional lattices. However, the technical complexity of TPS/PEPS-based coding is often too much for researchers to handle. To reduce this problem, we developed TeNeS (Tensor Network Solver). This paper introduces TeNeS-v2, which extends TeNeS with real-time and finite temperature simulations, providing deeper insights into quantum many-body systems. We detail the new algorithms, input/output design, and application examples, demonstrating TeNeS-v2's applicability to various quantum spin and Bose models on two-dimensional lattices.</description>

      <title>Sub-critical athermal flow in disordered materials caused by periodic variations of environmental conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Yield stress materials deform irreversibly at a finite strain-rate if loaded with a fixed stress $\sigma$ larger than some critical yield stress $\sigma_c$. When $\sigma&lt;\sigma_c$ deformation is only transient, unless thermal activation plays a role, in which case persistent deformation occurs as a creep activated process. Yet in subcritical athermal conditions we observe that cyclic time variation of system parameters can induce a steady-state flow, with a total deformation that scales linearly with the number of cycles applied. We characterize this phenomenon using well established models in the fields of depinning and yielding transitions. Interestingly, there is an endurance limit $\sigma_0&lt;\sigma_c$ for this process to occur, below which the advance is totally suppressed. We discuss implications of our findings to the study of sub-critical evolution of landforms in which periodic variations of external conditions (as for instance daily/seasonal cycles of temperature, humidity, etc.) are expected.</description>

      <title>Observation of prethermalization in weakly nonintegrable unitary maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate prethermalization by studying the statistical properties of the time-dependent largest Lyapunov exponent $\Lambda(t)$ for unitary-circuit maps upon approaching integrability. We follow the evolution of trajectories for different initial conditions and compute the mean $\mu(t)$ and standard deviation $\sigma(t)$ of $\Lambda(t)$. Thermalization implies a temporal decay $\sigma \sim t^{-1/2}$ at a converged finite value of $\mu$. We report prethermalization plateaus that persist for long times where both $\mu$ and $\sigma$ appear to have converged to finite values, seemingly implying differing saturated Lyapunov exponent values for different trajectories. The lifetime of such plateaus furnishes a novel time scale characterizing the thermalization dynamics of many-body systems close to integrability. We also find that the plateaus converge to their respective thermal values for long enough times.</description>

Abstract: We collect in this note some observations on the role of symmetries in Bayesian inference problems, that can be useful or detrimental depending on the way they act on the signal and on the observations. We emphasize in particular the need to gauge away unobservable invariances in the definition of a distance between a signal and its estimator, and the consequences this implies for the statistical mechanics treatment of such models, taking as a motivating example the extensive rank matrix factorization problem.</description>

      <title>Optimal spatial searches with long-range tunneling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A quantum walk on a lattice is a paradigm of a quantum search in a database. The database qubit strings are the lattice sites, qubit rotations are tunneling events, and the target site is tagged by an energy shift. For quantum walks on a continuous time, the walker diffuses across the lattice and the search ends when it localizes at the target site. The search time $T$ can exhibit Grover's optimal scaling with the lattice size $N$, namely, $T\sim \sqrt{N}$, on an all-connected, complete lattice. For finite-range tunneling between sites, instead, Grover's optimal scaling is warranted when the lattice is a hypercube of $d&gt;4$ dimensions. Here, we show that Grover's optimum can be reached in lower dimensions on lattices of long-range interacting particles, when the interaction strength scales algebraically with the distance $r$ as $1/r^{\alpha}$ and $0&lt;\alpha&lt;3d/2$. For $\alpha&lt;d$ the dynamics mimics the one of a globally connected graph. For $d&lt;\alpha&lt;d+2$, the quantum search on the graph can be mapped to a short-range model on a hypercube with spatial dimension $d_s=2d/(\alpha-d)$, indicating that the search is optimal for $d_s&gt;4$. Our work identifies an exact relation between criticality of long-range and short-range systems, it provides a quantitative demonstration of the resources that long-range interactions provide for quantum technologies, and indicates when existing experimental platforms can implement efficient analog quantum search algorithms.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space Diffusion in Systems with Approximate Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19260v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random matrix theory (RMT) universality is the defining property of quantum mechanical chaotic systems, and can be probed by observables like the spectral form factor (SFF). In this paper, we describe systematic deviations from RMT behaviour at intermediate time scales in systems with approximate symmetries. At early times, the symmetries allow us to organize the Hilbert space into approximately decoupled sectors, each of which contributes independently to the SFF. At late times, the SFF transitions into the final ramp of the fully mixed chaotic Hamiltonian. For approximate continuous symmetries, the transitional behaviour is governed by a universal process that we call Hilbert space diffusion. The diffusion constant corresponding to this process is related to the relaxation rate of the associated nearly conserved charge. By implementing a chaotic sigma model for Hilbert-space diffusion, we formulate an analytic theory of this process which agrees quantitatively with our numerical results for different examples.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent expansion and field-theoretic renormalization group for a singular nonlinear diffusion equation with anomalous scaling</title>

Abstract: The method of self-consistent expansions is a powerful tool for handling strong coupling problems that might otherwise be beyond the reach of perturbation theory, providing surprisingly accurate approximations even at low order. First applied in its embryonic form to fully-developed turbulence, it has subsequently been successfully applied to a variety of problems that include polymer statistics, interface dynamics and high order perturbation theory for the anharmonic oscillator. Here we show that the self-consistent expansion can be applied to singular perturbation problems arising in the theory of partial differential equations. We demonstrate its application to Barenblatt's nonlinear diffusion equation for porous media filtration, where the long-time asymptotics exhibits anomalous dimensions that can be systematically calculated using the perturbative renormalization group. We find that even the first order self-consistent expansion improves the approximation of the anomalous dimension obtained by the first-order perturbative renormalization group, especially in the strong coupling regime. We also develop a field-theoretic framework for deterministic partial differential equations to facilitate the application of self-consistent expansions to other dynamic systems, and illustrate its application using the example of Barenblatt's equation. The scope of our results on the combination of renormalization group and self-consistent expansions is limited to partial differential equations whose long-time asymptotics is controlled by incomplete similarity. However, our work suggests that these methods could be applied to a broader suite of singular perturbation problems such as boundary layer theory, multiple scales analysis and matched asymptotic expansions, for which excellent approximations using renormalization group methods alone are already available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of an information engine that extracts work from thermal fluctuations, using a mechanical cantilever submitted to electrostatic feedback control. The cantilever's position is continuously measured, and feedback is triggered by the first passage of the system across a fixed threshold. The information $\Delta I$ associated with the feedback is based on the first-passage-time distribution. In this setting, we derive and experimentally verify two distinct fluctuation theorems that involve $\Delta I$ and give a tight bound on the work produced by the engine. Our results extend beyond the specific application to our experiment: we develop a general framework for obtaining fluctuation theorems and work bounds, formulated in terms of probability distributions of protocols rather than underlying measurement outcomes.</description>

      <title>Application of boundary functionals of random processes in statistical physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17934v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The potential applications of boundary functionals of random processes, such as the extreme values of these processes, the moment of first reaching a fixed level, the value of the process at the moment of reaching the level, the moment of reaching extreme values, the time the process stays above a fixed level, and other functionals, are considered for the description of physical, chemical, and biological problems. Definitions of these functionals are provided, and characteristic functions are presented for the model with an exponential distribution of incoming demands. A generalization of these limitations is also considered. The potential uses of boundary functionals are demonstrated through examples such as a unicyclic network with affinity A, an asymmetric random walk, nonlinear diffusion, two-level model, Brownian motion, and multiple diffusing particles with reversible target-binding kinetics.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Transition due to particle losses in a monitored fermionic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there has been interest in the dynamics of monitored quantum systems using linear jump operators related to the creation or annihilation of particles. Here, we study the dynamics of the entanglement entropy under quantum jumps that induce local particle losses in a model of free fermions with hopping and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ pairing. We solve the non-unitary dynamics using the recently developed Faber Polynomial method and explore the different steady-state entanglement regimes by tuning the pairing strength, thus interpolating between monitored free fermions coherently driven by a particle number conserving Hamiltonian to a parity conserving one. In the absence of pairing, all quantum trajectories approach the vacuum at long times, with the entanglement entropy showing non-monotonic behavior over time that we capture with a phenomenological quasiparticle \emph{ansatz}. In this regime, quantum jumps play a key role, and we highlight this by exactly computing their waiting-time distribution. On the other hand, the interplay between losses and pairing gives rise to quantum trajectories with entangled steady-states. We show that by tuning the system parameters, a measurement-induced entanglement transition occurs where the entanglement entropy scaling changes from logarithmic to area-law. We compare this transition with the one derived in the no-click limit and observe qualitative agreement in most of the phase diagram. Furthermore, the statistics of entanglement gain and loss are analyzed to better understand the impact of the linear jump operators.</description>

      <title>Active Brownian particle under stochastic position and orientation resetting in a harmonic trap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical study of an Active Brownian Particle (ABP) subject to both position and orientation stochastic resetting in a two-dimensional harmonic trap. Utilizing a Fokker-Planck-based renewal approach, we derive the system's exact moments, including the mean parallel displacement, mean squared displacement (MSD), and the fourth-order moment of displacement, and compare these with numerical simulations. To capture deviations from Gaussian behavior, we analyze the excess kurtosis, which reveals rich dynamical crossovers over time. These transitions span from Gaussian behavior (zero excess kurtosis) to two distinct non-Gaussian regimes: an activity-dominated regime (negative excess kurtosis) and a resetting-dominated regime (positive excess kurtosis). Furthermore, we quantify the steady-state phase diagrams by varying three key control parameters: activity, resetting rate, and harmonic trap strength, using steady-state excess kurtosis as the primary metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the conventional Jarzynski equality does not hold for a system prepared in a microcanonical ensemble. We derive a modified equality that connects microcanonical work fluctuations to entropy production, in an analogous way to the Jarzynski equality, but with reference to an inverse temperature that depends on the path of the work protocol. For close to isothermal processes the modified equality can improve on the bound $\langle W\rangle\ge \Delta F$. Our result is a special case of a general expression for the microcanonical moment-generating function for any extensive quantity, which enables calculation of the breakdown of ensemble equivalence for thermodynamic fluctuations. We demonstrate our microcanonical Jarzynski equality in a system of driven two-level spins.</description>

      <title>Explicit dynamical properties of the Pelikan random map in the chaotic region and at the intermittent critical point towards the non-chaotic region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pelikan random trajectories $x_t \in [0,1[$ are generated by choosing the chaotic doubling map $x_{t+1}=2 x_t [mod 1]$ with probability $p$ and the non-chaotic half-contracting map $x_{t+1}=\frac{x_t}{2}$ with probability $(1-p)$. We compute various dynamical observables as a function of the parameter $p$ via two perspectives. In the first perspective, we focus on the closed dynamics within the subspace of probability densities that remain constant on the binary-intervals $x \in [ 2^{-n-1}, 2^{-n}[$ partitioning the interval $x \in [0,1[$ : the dynamics for the weights $\pi_t(n)$ of these intervals corresponds to a biased random walk on the half-infinite lattice $n \in \{0,1,2,..+\infty\}$ with resetting occurring with probability $p$ from the origin $n=0$ towards any site $n$ drawn with the distribution $2^{-n-1}$. In the second perspective, we study the Pelikan dynamics for any initial condition $x_0$ via the binary decomposition $x_t = \sum_{l=1}^{+\infty} \frac{\sigma_l (t)}{2^l} $, where the dynamics for the half-infinite lattice $l=1,2,..$ of the binary variables $\sigma_l(t) \in \{0,1\}$ can be reformulated in terms of two global variables : $z_t$ corresponds to a biased random walk on the half-infinite lattice $z \in \{0,1,2,..+\infty\}$ that may remain at the origin $z=0$ with probability $p$, while $F_t \in \{0,1,2,..t\}$ counts the number of time-steps $\tau \in [0,t-1]$ where $z_{\tau+1}=0=z_{\tau}$ and represents the number of the binary coefficients of the initial condition that have been erased. We discuss typical and large deviations properties in the chaotic region $\frac{1}{2}&lt;p&lt;1 $ as well as at the intermittent critical point $p_c=\frac{1}{2}$ towards the non-chaotic region $0&lt;p&lt;\frac{1}{2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a classical environment and subject to constraints that drive it out of equilibrium is described. The evolution of the system is governed by the quantum-classical Liouville equation. Rather than evaluating the evolution of the mixed quantum-classical density operator, we derive exact equations of motion for the nonequilibrium average values of a set of operators or variables, along with correlation function expressions for the dissipative coefficients that enter these equations. These equations are obtained by requiring that the exact nonequilibrium averages are equal to local nonequilibrium averages that depend on auxiliary fields whose values satisfy evolution equations obtained using projection operator methods. The results are illustrated by deriving reaction-diffusion equations coupled to fluid hydrodynamic equations for a dilute solution of quantum particles that can exist in two metastable states. Nonequilibrium steady states are discussed along with the reaction rate and diffusion correlation functions that characterize such states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the response of nonequilibrium systems to external perturbations remains a fundamental challenge in statistical physics. Here, we prove a novel universal bound stating that the response precision for state observable is fundamentally constrained to $1/2$ under single edge or vertex perturbations, independent of system size. Furthermore, we develop exact relations connecting responses to perturbations of arbitrary strengths, extending nonequilibrium response theory beyond the weak-perturbation regime. Through response equalities we also provide a novel physical interpretation of response sensitivity and recovers bounds previously obtained using graph-theoretical methods and extensive linear algebra. Our results provide a general mathematical framework applicable across diverse nonequilibrium systems and offer design principles for optimal sensing and information processing in biochemical systems.</description>

Abstract: We present two schemes for controlling the transport dynamics of mesoscopic devices. In both approaches, we manipulate the system's output - such as particle currents and energy flows - while maintaining symmetric transport properties, even under far-from-equilibrium conditions. We provide exact descriptions of the modified processes under each scheme and investigate their characteristics. Notably, one of the schemes is shown to minimize the dissimilarity between the original and modified processes, as quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence. These findings have the potential to enhance the design and control of mesoscopic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06661v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among various classes of quantum error correcting codes (QECCs), non-stabilizer codes have rich properties and are of theoretical and practical interest. Decoding non-stabilizer codes is, however, a highly non-trivial task. In this paper, we show that a decoding circuit for Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes can be straightforwardly extended to handle general QECCs. The key to the extension lies in the use of a pair of classical-quantum (CQ) codes associated with the QECC to be decoded. The decoding error of the proposed decoding circuit depends on the classical decoding errors of the CQ codes and their degree of complementarity. We demonstrate the power of the decoding circuit in a toy model of the black hole information paradox, improving decoding errors compared to previous results. In addition, we reveal that black hole dynamics may optimally encode quantum information but poorly encode classical information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.08060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Driven quantum materials often feature emergent topology, otherwise absent in static crystals. Dynamic bulk-boundary correspondence, encoded by nondissipative gapless modes residing near the Floquet zone center and/or boundaries, is its most prominent example. Here we show that topologically robust gapless dispersive modes appear along the grain boundaries, embedded in the interior of Floquet topological crystals, when the Floquet-Bloch band inversion occurring at a finite momentum (${\bf K}^{\rm Flq}_{\rm inv}$) and the Burgers vector (${\bf b}$) of the constituting array of dislocations satisfy ${\bf K}^{\rm Flq}_{\rm inv} \cdot {\bf b}=\pi$ (modulo $2 \pi$). Such nondissipative gapless states can be found near the center and/or edges of the Floquet Brillouin zone, irrespective of the drive protocol. We showcase these general outcomes for two-dimensional driven time-reversal symmetry breaking insulators. Promising experimental platforms hosting such dynamic topological dispersive bands in real materials are discussed.</description>

      <title>Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity: a Bayesian mean-field framework for epidemic inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Small-Coupling Dynamic Cavity (SCDC) method, a novel generalized mean-field approximation for epidemic inference and risk assessment within a fully Bayesian framework. SCDC accounts for non-causal effects of observations and uses a graphical model representation of epidemic processes to derive self-consistent equations for edge probability marginals. A small-coupling expansion yields time-dependent cavity messages capturing individual infection probabilities and observational conditioning. With linear computational cost per iteration in the epidemic duration, SCDC is particularly efficient and valid even for recurrent epidemic processes, where standard methods are exponentially complex. Tested on synthetic networks, it matches Belief Propagation in accuracy and outperforms individual-based mean-field methods. Notably, despite being derived as a small-infectiousness expansion, SCDC maintains good accuracy even for relatively large infection probabilities. While convergence issues may arise on graphs with long-range correlations, SCDC reliably estimates risk. Future extensions include non-Markovian models and higher-order terms in the dynamic cavity framework.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Block Hypergraph model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stochastic block model is widely used to generate graphs with a community structure, but no simple alternative currently exists for hypergraphs, in which more than two nodes can be connected together through a hyperedge. We discuss here such a hypergraph generalization, based on the clustering connection probability $P_{ij}$ between nodes of communities $i$ and $j$, and that uses an explicit and modulable hyperedge formation process. We focus on the standard case where $P_{ij}=p\delta_{ij}+q(1-\delta_{ij})$ when $0\leq q\leq p$. We propose a simple model that satisfies three criteria: it should be as simple as possible, when $p = q$ the model should be equivalent to the standard hypergraph random model, and it should use an explicit and modulable hyperedge formation process so that the model is intuitive and can easily express different real-world formation processes. We first show that for such a model the degree distribution and hyperedge size distribution can be approximated by binomial distributions with effective parameters that depend on the number of communities and $q/p$. Also, the composition of hyperedges goes for $q=0$ from `pure' hyperedges (comprising nodes belonging to the same community) to `mixed' hyperedges that comprise nodes from different communities for $q=p$. We test various formation processes and our results suggest that when they depend on the composition of the hyperedge, they tend to favor the dominant community and lead to hyperedges with a smaller diversity. In contrast, for formation processes that are independent from the hyperedge structure, we obtain hyperedges comprising a larger diversity of communities. The advantages of the model proposed here are its simplicity and flexibility that make it a good candidate for testing community-related problems, such as their detection, impact on various dynamics, and visualization.</description>

      <title>Extracting Error Thresholds through the Framework of Approximate Quantum Error Correction Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The robustness of quantum memory against physical noises is measured by two methods: the exact and approximate quantum error correction (QEC) conditions for error recoverability, and the decoder-dependent error threshold which assesses if the logical error rate diminishes with system size. Here we unravel their relations and propose a unified framework to extract an intrinsic error threshold from the approximate QEC condition, which could upper bound other decoder-dependent error thresholds. Our proof establishes that relative entropy, effectively measuring deviations from exact QEC conditions, serves as the order parameter delineating the transition from asymptotic recoverability to unrecoverability. Consequently, we establish a unified framework for determining the error threshold across both exact and approximate QEC codes, addressing errors originating from noise channels as well as those from code space imperfections. This result sharpens our comprehension of error thresholds across diverse QEC codes and error models.</description>

      <title>Classifying two-body Hamiltonians for Quantum Darwinism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Darwinism is a paradigm to understand how classically objective reality emerges from within a fundamentally quantum universe. Despite the growing attention that this field of research as been enjoying, it is currently not known what specific properties a given Hamiltonian describing a generic quantum system must have to allow the emergence of classicality. Therefore, in the present work, we consider a broadly applicable generic model of an arbitrary finite-dimensional system interacting with an environment formed from an arbitrary collection of finite-dimensional degrees of freedom via an unspecified, potentially time-dependent Hamiltonian containing at most two-body interaction terms. We show that such models support quantum Darwinism if the set of operators acting on the system which enter the Hamiltonian satisfy a set of commutation relations with a pointer observable and with one other. We demonstrate our results by analyzing a wide range of example systems: a qutrit interacting with a qubit environment, a qubit-qubit model with interactions alternating in time, and a series of collision models including a minimal model of a quantum Maxwell demon.</description>

      <title>Role of Quantum Coherence in Kinetic Uncertainty Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kinetic Uncertainty Relation (KUR) bounds the signal-to-noise ratio of stochastic currents in terms of the number of transitions per unit time, known as the dynamical activity. This bound was derived in a classical context, and can be violated in the quantum regime due to coherent effects. However, the precise connection between KUR violations and quantum coherence has so far remained elusive, despite significant investigation. In this work, we solve this problem by deriving a modified bound that exactly pinpoints how, and when, coherence might lead to KUR violations. Our bound is sensitive to the specific kind of unraveling of the quantum master equation. It therefore allows one to compare quantum jumps and quantum diffusion, and understand, in each case, how quantum coherence affects fluctuations. We illustrate our result on a double quantum dot, where the electron current is monitored either by electron jump detection or with continuous diffusive charge measurement.</description>

      <title>Stochastic thermodynamics and the Ericsson nano engine -- Efficiency from equilibrium results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study an Ericsson cycle whose working substance is a charged (quantum) oscillator in a magnetic field that is coupled to a heat bath. The resulting quantum Langevin equations with built-in noise terms encapsulate a thermodynamic structure and allow for the computation of the efficiency of the cycle. We numerically compute the efficiency of the cycle in the quasi-static regime using the steady-state thermodynamic functions of the system. Interestingly, it is found that by increasing the system-bath coupling strength, the efficiency of the cycle can be tuned to a maximum. We also explore the behavior of the efficiency as a function of the pair of magnetic-field values between which the cycle is operated.</description>

      <title>Classical Annealing of Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Spin Glass Using Suzuki-Kubo Mean-field Ising Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and demonstrate numerically a fast classical annealing scheme for the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) spin glass model, employing the Suzuki-Kubo meanfield Ising dynamics (supplemented by a modified Thouless-Anderson-Palmer reaction field). The resultant dynamics, starting from any arbitrary paramagnetic phase (with local $m_i=\pm 1$ for the $i^{th}$ spin, and the global magnetization $m=0$), takes the system quickly to an appropriate state with small local values of magnetization ($m_i$) commensurate with the (frustrated) interactions. As the temperature decreases with the annealing, the configuration practically remain (in an effective adiabatic way) close to the ground state as the $m_i$'s and the spin glass order parameter $q$ grow to unity. For an $N$-spin SK model (with $N$ up to 10000) the deviation in the annealed ground state energy per spin $E^0_N - E^0$ is found to scale as $N^{-2/3}$, with $E^0 = -0.7633\pm 0.0002 $ (analytical estimate being $E^0 =-0.7631667265 \dots$), fluctuation $\sigma_N $ in $E^0_N$ decreases as $\sim N^{-3/4}$ and the annealing time $\tau_N \sim N$, making this protocol highly efficient in estimating the ground state of the SK model.</description>

      <title>Scheme to Detect the Strong-to-weak Symmetry Breaking via Randomized Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking plays a central role in classifying the phases of quantum many-body systems. Recent developments have highlighted a novel symmetry-breaking pattern, in which the strong symmetry of a density matrix spontaneously breaks to the week symmetry. This strong-to-weak symmetry breaking is typically detected using multi-replica correlation functions, such as the R\'enyi-2 correlator. In this letter, we propose a practical protocol for detecting strong-to-weak symmetry breaking in experiments using the randomized measurement toolbox. Our scheme involves collecting the results of random Pauli measurements for (i) the original quantum state and (ii) the quantum state after evolution with the charged operators. Based on the measurement results, with a large number of samples, we can obtain the exact solution to the R\'enyi-2 correlator. With a small sample size, we can still provide an alternative approach to estimate the phase boundary to a decent accuracy. We perform numerical simulations of Ising chains with all-to-all decoherence as an exemplary demonstration. Our result opens the opportunity for the experimental studies of the novel quantum phases in mixed quantum states.</description>

      <title>Zero-temperature phase-flip rate in a biased parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A parametrically driven oscillator has two stable vibrational states at half the modulation frequency. The states have opposite phase and equal amplitudes. An extra drive at half the modulation frequency provides an effective bias that lifts the state symmetry. Quantum fluctuations lead to switching between the states, i.e., to phase-flip transitions. We develop a semiclassical approach that allows us to find the dependence of the switching rates on the amplitude of the bias and the parameters of the modulating field. We find that the rate of switching from a ''shallow'' state can become anomalously small at certain parameter values, leading to an efficient localization in this state. This is a consequence of the change of the topology of the oscillator phase trajectories. The results pave the way for implementing nonreciprocal quantum Ising systems based on parametric oscillators.</description>
