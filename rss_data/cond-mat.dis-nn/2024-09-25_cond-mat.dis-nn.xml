      <title>Fate of pseudo mobility-edge and multi-states in non-Hermitian Wannier-Stark lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between non-Hermiticity and disorder-free localization has recently become an intriguing and open question. In this work, we explore the impact of non-Hermiticity on pseudo mobility edges (MEs) and multi-states in disorder-free systems. We focus on a one-dimensional (1D) mosaic lattice with a finite-height Wannier-Stark potential under non-reciprocal non-Hermitian modulation. Using the transfer matrix techniques, we study how pseudo-MEs evolve under the influence of non-reciprocity. We then combine this with the perspective of similarity transformations to understand the changes in the emergent multi-states. Finally, we present the dynamical patterns of these multi-states. These findings expand the understanding of localization phenomena in non-Hermitian systems, offering new insights into the interplay between non-Hermiticity and disorder-free localization.</description>

      <title>What do clever algorithms for glasses do? Time reparametrization at work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultraslow dynamics of glass-formers has been explained by two views considered as mutually exclusive: one invokes locally hindered mobility, the other rests on the complexity of the configuration space. Here we demonstrate that the evolution responds strongly to the details of the dynamics by changing the speed of time-flow: it has time-reparametrization softness. This finding reconciles both views: while local constraints reparametrize the flow of time, the global landscape determines relationships between different correlations at the same times. We show that modern algorithms developed to accelerate the relaxation to equilibrium act by changing the time reparametrization. Their success thus relies on their ability to exploit reparametrization softness. We conjecture that these results extend beyond the realm of glasses to the optimization of more general constraint satisfaction problems and to broader classes of algorithms.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of percolation patterns in a kinetic replication model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The model of a one-dimensional kinetic contact process with parallel update is studied by the Monte Carlo simulations and finite-size scaling. The goal was to reveal the structure of the hidden percolative patterns (order parameters) in the active phase and the nature of transitions those patterns emerge through. Our results corroborate the earlier conjecture that in general the active (percolating) phases possess the hierarchical structure (tower of percolation patterns), where more complicated patterns emerge on the top of coexistent patterns of lesser complexity. Plethora of different patterns emerge via cascades of continuous transitions. We detect five phases with distinct patterns of percolation within the active phase of the model. All transitions on the phase diagram belong to the directed percolation universality class, as confirmed by the scaling analysis. To accommodate the case of multiple percolating phases the extension of the Janssen-Grassberger conjecture is proposed.</description>

      <title>Learning in associative networks through Pavlovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hebbian learning theory is rooted in Pavlov's Classical Conditioning. While mathematical models of the former have been proposed and studied in the past decades, especially in spin glass theory, only recently it has been numerically shown that it is possible to write neural and synaptic dynamics that mirror Pavlov conditioning mechanisms and also give rise to synaptic weights that correspond to the Hebbian learning rule.
  In this paper, we show that the same dynamics can be derived with equilibrium statistical mechanics tools and basic and motivated modeling assumptions. Then, we show how to study the resulting system of coupled stochastic differential equations assuming the reasonable separation of neural and synaptic timescale. In particular, we analytically demonstrate that this synaptic evolution converges to the Hebbian learning rule in various settings and compute the variance of the stochastic process. Finally, drawing from evidence on pure memory reinforcement during sleep stages, we show how the proposed model can simulate neural networks that undergo sleep-associated memory consolidation processes, thereby proving the compatibility of Pavlovian learning with dreaming mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Local insulator-to-superconductor transition in amorphous InO$_x$ films modulated by e-beam irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method enabling precise post-fabrication modulation of the electrical resistance in micrometer-scale regions of amorphous indium oxide (a-InO$_x$) films. By subjecting initially insulating films to an electron beam at room temperature, we demonstrate that the exposed region of the films becomes superconducting. The resultant superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) is adjustable up to 2.8 K by changing the electron dose and accelerating voltage. This technique offers a compelling alternative to traditional a-InO$_x$ annealing methods for both fundamental investigations and practical applications. Moreover, it empowers independent adjustment of electrical properties across initially identical a-InO$_x$ samples on the same substrate, facilitating the creation of superconducting microstructures with precise $T_c$ control at the micrometer scale. The observed resistance modifications likely stem from photoreduction induced by X-ray and/or UV radiation emitted during electron beam interactions with the film and substrate.</description>
