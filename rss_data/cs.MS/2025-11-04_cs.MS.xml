      <title>Numerically stable evaluation of closed-form expressions for eigenvalues of $3 \times 3$ matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trigonometric formulas for eigenvalues of $3 \times 3$ matrices that build on Cardano's and Vi\`ete's work on algebraic solutions of the cubic are numerically unstable for matrices with repeated eigenvalues. This work presents numerically stable, closed-form evaluation of eigenvalues of real, diagonalizable $3 \times 3$ matrices via four invariants: the trace $I_1$, the deviatoric invariants $J_2$ and $J_3$, and the discriminant $\Delta$. We analyze the conditioning of these invariants and derive tight forward error bounds. For $J_2$ we propose an algorithm and prove its accuracy. We benchmark all invariants and the resulting eigenvalue formulas, relating observed forward errors to the derived bounds. In particular, we show that, for the special case of matrices with a well-conditioned eigenbasis, the newly proposed algorithms have errors within the forward stability bounds. Performance benchmarks show that the proposed algorithm is approximately ten times faster than the highly optimized LAPACK library for a challenging test case, while maintaining comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Disciplined Biconvex Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce disciplined biconvex programming (DBCP), a modeling framework for specifying and solving biconvex optimization problems. Biconvex optimization problems arise in various applications, including machine learning, signal processing, computational science, and control. Solving a biconvex optimization problem in practice usually resolves to heuristic methods based on alternate convex search (ACS), which iteratively optimizes over one block of variables while keeping the other fixed, so that the resulting subproblems are convex and can be efficiently solved. However, designing and implementing an ACS solver for a specific biconvex optimization problem usually requires significant effort from the user, which can be tedious and error-prone. DBCP extends the principles of disciplined convex programming to biconvex problems, allowing users to specify biconvex optimization problems in a natural way based on a small number of syntax rules. The resulting problem can then be automatically split and transformed into convex subproblems, for which a customized ACS solver is then generated and applied. DBCP allows users to quickly experiment with different biconvex problem formulations, without expertise in convex optimization. We implement DBCP into the open source Python package dbcp, as an extension to the famous domain specific language CVXPY for convex optimization.</description>

      <title>Towards a Higher Roofline for Matrix-Vector Multiplication in Matrix-Free HOSFEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07042v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern GPGPUs provide massive arithmetic throughput, yet many scientific kernels remain limited by memory bandwidth. In particular, repeatedly loading precomputed auxiliary data wastes abundant compute resources while stressing the memory hierarchy. A promising strategy is to replace memory traffic with inexpensive recomputation, thereby alleviating bandwidth pressure and enabling applications to better exploit heterogeneous compute units. Guided by this strategy, we optimize the high-order/spectral finite element method (HOSFEM), a widely used approach for solving PDEs. Its performance is largely determined by AxLocal, a matrix-free kernel for element-local matrix-vector multiplications. In AxLocal, geometric factors dominate memory accesses while contributing minimally to computation, creating a bandwidth bottleneck that caps the performance roofline. To address this challenge, we propose the first practical, low-overhead on-the-fly recomputation of geometric factors for trilinear and parallelepiped elements. This reformulation reduces data movement and raises the achievable roofline, revealing untapped optimization potential for tensor contractions. With hardware-aware techniques including loop unrolling, Tensor Core acceleration, and constant memory utilization, the optimized kernels reach 85%-100% of the roofline efficiency. Compared with state-of-the-art implementations in the Nek series, they deliver speedups of 1.74x-4.10x on NVIDIA A100 and 1.99x-3.78x on Hygon K100, leading to a 1.12x-1.40x improvement in the full HOSFEM benchmark. These results demonstrate that combining algorithmic reformulation with hardware-specific tuning can remove long-standing bottlenecks and fully exploit the performance potential of large-scale high-order simulations.</description>

      <title>Dual-Regularized Riccati Recursions for Interior-Point Optimal Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16370v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive closed-form extensions of Riccati's recursions (both sequential and parallel) for solving dual-regularized LQR problems. We show how these methods can be used to solve general constrained, non-convex, discrete-time optimal control problems via a regularized interior point method, while guaranteeing that each primal step is a descent direction of an Augmented Barrier-Lagrangian merit function. We provide MIT-licensed implementations of our methods in C++ and JAX.</description>
