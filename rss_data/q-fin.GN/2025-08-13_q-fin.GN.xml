      <title>The Market Effects of Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09513v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While there is excitement about the potential for algorithms to optimize individual decision-making, changes in individual behavior will, almost inevitably, impact markets. Yet little is known about such effects. In this paper, I study how the availability of algorithmic prediction changes entry, allocation, and prices in the US single-family housing market, a key driver of household wealth. I identify a market-level natural experiment that generates variation in the cost of using algorithms to value houses: digitization, the transition from physical to digital housing records. I show that digitization leads to entry by investors using algorithms, but does not push out investors using human judgment. Instead, human investors shift toward houses that are difficult to predict algorithmically. Algorithmic investors predominantly purchase minority-owned homes, a segment of the market where humans may be biased. Digitization increases the average sale price of minority-owned homes by 5% and reduces racial disparities in home prices by 45%. Algorithmic investors, via competition, affect the prices paid by owner-occupiers and human investors for minority homes; such changes drive the majority of the reduction in racial disparities. The decrease in racial inequality underscores the potential for algorithms to mitigate human biases at the market level.</description>

      <title>Language of Persuasion and Misrepresentation in Business Communication: A Textual Detection Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Business communication digitisation has reorganised the process of persuasive discourse, which
  allows not only greater transparency but also advanced deception. This inquiry synthesises classical
  rhetoric and communication psychology with linguistic theory and empirical studies in the financial
  reporting, sustainability discourse, and digital marketing to explain how deceptive language can be
  systematically detected using persuasive lexicon. In controlled settings, detection accuracies of greater
  than 99% were achieved by using computational textual analysis as well as personalised transformer
  models. However, reproducing this performance in multilingual settings is also problematic and,
  to a large extent, this is because it is not easy to find sufficient data, and because few multilingual
  text-processing infrastructures are in place. This evidence shows that there has been an increasing
  gap between the theoretical representations of communication and those empirically approximated,
  and therefore, there is a need to have strong automatic text-identification systems where AI-based
  discourse is becoming more realistic in communicating with humans.</description>
