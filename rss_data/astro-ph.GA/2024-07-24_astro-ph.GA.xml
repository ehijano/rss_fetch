      <title>Combined Gemini-South and HST photometric analysis of the globular cluster NGC 6558. The age of the metal-poor population of the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NGC~6558 is a low-galactic latitude globular cluster projected in the direction of the Galactic bulge. Due to high reddening, this region presents challenges in deriving accurate parameters, which require meticulous photometric analysis. We present a combined analysis of near-infrared and optical photometry from multi-epoch high-resolution images collected with Gemini-South/GSAOI+GeMS (in the $J$ and $K_S$ filters) and HST/ACS (in the F606W and F814W filters). We aim to refine the fundamental parameters of NGC~6558, utilizing high-quality Gemini-South/GSAOI and HST/ACS photometries. Additionally, we intend to investigate its role in the formation of the Galactic bulge. We studied the impact of two differential reddening corrections on the age derivation. When removing as much as possible the Galactic bulge field star contamination, the isochrone fitting combined with synthetic colour-magnitude diagrams gives a distance of $8.41^{+0.11}_{-0.10}$ kpc, an age of $13.0\pm 0.9$ Gyr, a reddening of E($B-V$)$\,\,=0.34\pm0.02$, and a total-to-selective coefficient R$_V = 3.2\pm0.2$ thanks to the simultaneous near-infrared$-$Optical synthetic colour-magnitude diagram fitting. The orbital parameters showed that NGC~6558 is confined whitin the inner Galaxy and it is not compatible with a bar-shape orbit, indicating that it is a bulge member. The old age of NGC~6558, combined with similar metallicity and a blue horizontal branch in the Galactic bulge, indicates that it is part of the moderately metal-poor globular clusters. Assembling the old and moderately metal-poor ([Fe/H]$\,\,\sim-1.1$) clusters in the Galactic bulge, we derived their age-metallicity relation with star formation stars at $13.6\pm0.2$ Gyr and effective yields of $\rho=0.007\pm0.009\,\, Z_\odot$ showing a chemical enrichment ten times faster than the ex-situ globular clusters branch.</description>

      <title>Measuring 60-pc-scale Star Formation Rate of the Nearby Seyfert Galaxy NGC 1068 with ALMA, HST, VLT/MUSE, and VLA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation rate (SFR) is a fundamental parameter for describing galaxies and inferring their evolutionary course. HII regions yield the best measure of instantaneous SFR in galaxies, although the derived SFR can have large uncertainties depending on tracers and assumptions. We present an SFR calibration for the entire molecular gas disk of the nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068, based on our new high-sensitivity ALMA 100GHz continuum data at 55pc (=0."8) resolution in combination with the HST Pa{\alpha} line data. In this calibration, we account for the spatial variations of dust extinction, electron temperature of HII regions, AGN contamination, and diffuse ionized gas (DIG) based on publicly available multi-wavelength data. Especially, given the extended nature and the possible non-negligible contribution to the total SFR, a careful consideration of DIG is essential. With a cross-calibration between two corrected ionized gas tracers (free-free continuum&amp;Pa{\alpha}), the total SFR of the NGC 1068 disk is estimated to be 3.2\pm0.5 Msol/yr, one-third of the SFR without accounting for DIG (9.1\pm1.4 Msol/yr). We confirmed high SFR around the southern bar-end and the corotation radius, which is consistent with the previous SFR measurements. In addition, our total SFR exceeds the total SFR based on 8{\mu}m dust emission by a factor of 1.5. We attribute this discrepancy to the differences in the young stars at different stages of evolution traced by each tracer and their respective timescales. This study provides an example to address the various uncertainties in conventional SFR measurements and their potential to lead to significant SFR miscalculations.</description>

      <title>Large dark matter content and steep metallicity profile predicted for Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies formed in high-spin halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stellar properties of a sample of simulated ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) with stellar mass $M_\star=10^{7.5}$ - $10^{9} ~ \rm{M_{\odot}}$, selected from the TNG50 simulation, where UDGs form mainly in high-spin dwarf-mass halos. We divide our sample into star-forming and quenched UDGs, finding good agreement with the stellar assembly history measured in observations. Star-forming UDGs and quenched UDGs with $M_\star \geq 10^8\; \rm M_\odot$ in our sample are particularly inefficient at forming stars, having $2$ - $10$ times less stellar mass than non-UDGs for the same virial mass halo. These results are consistent with recent mass inferences in UDG samples and suggest that the most inefficient UDGs arise from a late assembly of the dark matter mass followed by a stellar growth that is comparatively slower (for star-forming UDGs) or that was interrupted due to environmental removal of the gas (for quenched UDGs). Regardless of efficiency, UDGs are $60\%$ poorer in [Fe/H] than the population of non-UDGs at a fixed stellar mass, with the most extreme objects having metal content consistent with the simulated mass-metallicity relation at $z \sim 2$. Quenched UDGs stop their star formation in shorter timescales than non-UDGs of similar mass and are, as a consequence, alpha-enhanced with respect to non-UDGs. We identify metallicity profiles in UDGs as a potential avenue to distinguish between different formation paths for these galaxies, where gentle formation as a result of high-spin halos would present well-defined declining metallicity radial profiles while powerful-outflows or tidal stripping formation models would lead to flatter or constant metallicity as a function of radius due</description>

      <title>Closing the gap: secular evolution of bar-induced dark gaps in presence of thick discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of dark gaps, a preferential light deficit along the bar minor axis, is observationally well known. The properties of dark gaps are thought to be associated with the properties of bars, and their spatial locations are often associated with bar resonances. However, a systematic study, testing the robustness and universality of these assumptions, is still largely missing. Here, we investigate the formation and evolution of bar-induced dark gaps using a suite of N-body models of (kinematically cold) thin and (kinematically hot) thick discs with varying thick disc mass fraction, and different thin-to-thick disc geometry. We find that dark gaps are a natural consequence of the trapping of disc stars by the bar. The properties of dark gaps (such as strength and extent) are well correlated with the properties of bars. For stronger dark gaps, the fractional mass loss along the bar minor axis can reach up to ~60-80 percent of the initial mass contained, which is redistributed within the bar. These trends hold true irrespective of the mass fraction in the thick disc and the assumed disc geometry. In all our models harbouring slow bars, none of the resonances (corotation, Inner Lindblad resonance, and 4:1 ultra-harmonic resonance) associated with the bar correspond to the location of dark gaps, thereby suggesting that the location of dark gaps is not a universal proxy for these bar resonances, in contrast with earlier studies.</description>

      <title>The 2024 KIDA network for interstellar chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the chemical composition of the interstellar medium (ISM) requires a strong synergy between laboratory astrophysics, modeling, and observations. In particular, astrochemical models have been developed for decades now and include an increasing number of processes studied in the laboratory or theoretically. These models follow the chemistry both in the gas phase and at the surface of interstellar grains. Since 2012, we have provided complete gas-phase chemical networks for astrochemical codes that can be used to model various environments of the ISM. Our aim is to introduce the new up-to-date astrochemical network kida.uva.2024 together with the ice chemical network and the fortran code to compute time dependent compositions of the gas, the ice surface, and the ice mantles under physical conditions relevant for the ISM. The gas-phase chemical reactions, as well as associated rate coefficients, included in kida.uva.2024 were carefully selected from the KIDA online database and represent the most recent values. The model predictions for cold core conditions and for when considering only gas-phase processes were computed as a function of time and compared to the predictions obtained with the previous version, kida.uva.2014. In addition, key chemical reactions were identified. The model predictions, including both gas and surface processes, were compared to the molecular abundances as observed in the cold core TMC1-CP. Many gas-phase reactions were revised or added to produce kida.uva.2024. The new model predictions are different by several orders of magnitude for some species. The agreement of this new model with observations in TMC-1 (CP) is, however, similar to the one obtained with the previous network.</description>

      <title>BUFFALO Wild Wings: A High Precision Free-Form Lens Model of MACSJ0416 with Constraints on Dark Matter from Substructure and Highly Magnified Arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new free-form and hybrid mass reconstructions of the galaxy cluster lens MACS J0416.1-2403 at $z=0.396$ using the lens inversion method GRALE. The reconstructions use 237 spectroscopically confirmed multiple images from Bergamini et. al. 2023 as the main input. Our primary model reconstructs images to a positional accuracy of 0.191", thus representing one of the most precise reconstructions of this lens to date. Our models find broad agreement with previous reconstructions, and identify two $\sim 10^{11} M_{\odot}$ light-unaffiliated substructures. We focus on two highly magnified arcs: Spock and Mothra. Our model features a unique critical curve structure around the Spock arc with 2 crossings. This structure enables sufficient magnification across this arc to potentially explain the large number of transients as microlensing events of supergiant stars. Additionally, we develop a model of the millilens substructure expected to be magnifying Mothra, which may be a binary pair of supergiants with $\mu \sim 6000$. This model accounts for flexibility in the millilens position while preserving the observed flux and minimizing image position displacements along the Mothra arc. We constrain the millilens mass and core radius to $\lesssim 10^6 M_{\odot}$ and $\lesssim 12$ pc, respectively, which would render it one of the smallest and most compact substructures constrained by lensing. If the millilens is dominated by wave dark matter, the axion mass is constrained to be $&lt; 3.0 \times 10^{-21}$ eV. Further monitoring of this lens with JWST will uncover more transients, permitting tighter constraints on the structure surrounding these two arcs.</description>

      <title>RadioSED I: Bayesian inference of radio SEDs from inhomogeneous surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present here RadioSED, a Bayesian inference framework tailored to modelling and classifying broadband radio spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using only data from publicly-released, large-area surveys. We outline the functionality of RadioSED, with its focus on broadband radio emissions which can trace kiloparsec-scale absorption within both the radio jets and the circumgalactic medium of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). In particular, we discuss the capability of RadioSED to advance our understanding of AGN physics and composition within youngest and most compact sources, for which high resolution imaging is often unavailable. These young radio AGN typically manifest as peaked spectrum (PS) sources which, before RadioSED, were difficult to identify owing to the large, broadband frequency coverage typically required, and yet they provide an invaluable environment for understanding AGN evolution and feedback. We discuss the implementation details of RadioSED, and we validate our approach against both synthetic and observational data. Since the surveys used are drawn from multiple epochs of observation, we also consider the output from RadioSED in the context of AGN variability. Finally, we show that RadioSED recovers the expected SED shapes for a selection of well-characterised radio sources from the literature, and we discuss avenues for further study of these and other sources using radio SED fitting as a starting point. The scalability and modularity of this framework make it an exciting tool for multiwavelength astronomers as next-generation telescopes begin several all-sky surveys. Accordingly, we make the code for RadioSED, which is written in Python, available on Github.</description>

      <title>A smooth filament origin for prolate galaxies "going bananas" in deep JWST images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare the abundant prolate shaped galaxies reported beyond z$&gt;$3 in deep JWST surveys, with the predicted {\it stellar} appearance of young galaxies in detailed hydro-simulations of three main dark matter contenders: Cold (CDM), Wave/Fuzzy ($\psi$DM) and Warm Dark Matter (WDM). We find the observed galaxy images closely resemble the elongated stellar appearance of young galaxies predicted for both $\psi$DM and WDM, during the first $\simeq$ 500Myr while material steadily accretes from long, smooth filaments. The dark mater halos of WDM and $\psi$DM also have pronounced, prolate elongation similar to the stars, indicating a shared, highly triaxial equilibrium. This is unlike CDM where the early stellar morphology is mainly spheroidal formed from fragmented filaments with frequent merging, resulting in modest triaxiality. Quantitatively, the excess of prolate galaxies observed by JWST matches well WDM and $\psi$DM for particle masses of 1.4KeV and $2.5\times 10^{-22}$ eV respectively. For CDM, several visible subhalos are typically predicted to orbit within the virial radius of each galaxy from subhalo accretion, whereas merging is initially rare for WDM and $\psi$DM. We also verify with our simulations that $\psi$DM may be distinguished from WDM by the form of the core, which is predicted to be smooth and centered for WDM, but is a dense soliton for $\psi$DM traced by stars and measurably offset from the galaxy center by random wave perturbations in the simulations. We emphasise that long smooth filaments absent of galaxies may prove detectable with JWST, traced by stars and gas with comoving lengths of 150kpc predicted at z$\simeq$10, depending on the particle mass of $\psi$DM or WDM.</description>

      <title>CHANG-ES XXXII: Spatially Resolved Thermal/Nonthermal Separation from Radio Data Alone -- New Probes into NGC 3044 and NGC 5775</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have carried out spatially resolved thermal/nonthermal separation on two edge-on galaxies, NGC~3044 and NGC~5775, using only radio data. Narrow-band imaging within a frequency band that is almost contiguous from 1.25 to 7.02 GHz (L-band, S-band and C-band) has allowed us to fit spectra and construct thermal, nonthermal, and nonthermal spectral index maps. This method does not require any ancillary H$\alpha$ and infrared data, or reliance on dust corrections that are challenging in edge-on galaxies. For NGC~3044, at 15 arcsec resolution, we find a median thermal fraction of $\sim\, 13$\% with an estimated uncertainty in this fraction of $\sim\, 50$\% at 4.13 GHz. This compares well with the H$\alpha$ mixture method results. We uncovered evidence for a vertical outflow feature reaching at least $z\,\sim\,3.5$ kpc in projection above the plane, reminiscent of M82's starburst wind. For the higher SFR galaxy, NGC~5775 at 12 arcsec resolution, we find a median thermal fraction of 44\% at 4.13 GHz with an estimated error on this fraction of 17\%. Both galaxies show a change of slope (flattening) in L-band. These results suggest that a radio-only method for separating thermal from nonthermal emission is not only feasible, but able to reveal new features that might otherwise be obscured in edge-on disks.</description>

      <title>Application of the Eddington inversion method to constrain the dark matter halo of galaxies using only observed surface brightness profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: *** Context: The halos of low-mass galaxies may allow us to constrain the nature of dark matter (DM), but the kinematic measurements to diagnose the required properties are technically extremely challenging. However, the photometry of these systems is doable. Aims. Using only stellar photometry, constrain key properties of the DM haloes in low-mass galaxies. *** Methods: Unphysical pairs of DM gravitational potentials and starlight distributions can be identified if the pair requires a distribution function f that is negative somewhere in the phase space. We use the classical Eddington inversion method (EIM) to compute f for a battery of DM gravitational potentials and around 100 observed low-mass galaxies with Mstar between 10**6 and 10**8 Msun. The battery includes NFW potentials (expected from cold DM) and potentials stemming from cored mass distributions (expected in many alternatives to cold DM). The method assumes spherical symmetry and isotropic velocity distribution and requires fitting the observed profiles with analytic functions, for which we use polytropes (with zero inner slope, a.k.a. core) and profiles with variable inner and outer slopes. The validity of all these assumptions is analyzed. *** Results: In general, the polytropes fit well the observed starlight profiles. If they were the correct fits (which could be the case) then all galaxies are inconsistent with NFW-like potentials. Alternatively, when the inner slope is allowed to vary for fitting, between 40% and 70% of the galaxies are consistent with cores in the stellar mass distribution and thus inconsistent with NFW-like potentials. *** Conclusions: Even though the stellar mass of the observed galaxies is still not low enough to constrain the nature of DM, this work shows the practical feasibility of the EIM technique to infer DM properties only from photometry.</description>

      <title>Unveiling In-Situ Spheroid Formation in Distant, Submillimeter-Bright Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The majority of stars in today's Universe reside within spheroids, which are bulges of spiral galaxies and elliptical galaxies. Their formation is still an unsolved problem. Infrared/submm-bright galaxies at high redshifts have long been suspected to be related to spheroids formation. Proving this connection has been hampered so far by heavy dust obscuration when focusing on their stellar emission or by methodologies and limited signal-to-noise ratios when looking at submm wavelengths. Here we show that spheroids are directly generated by star formation within the cores of highly luminous starburst galaxies in the distant Universe. This follows from the ALMA submillimeter surface brightness profiles which deviate significantly from those of exponential disks, and from the skewed-high axis-ratio distribution, both derived with a novel analysis technique. These galaxies are fully triaxial rather than flat disks: scale-height ratios are 0.5 on average and $&gt;0.6$ for most spatially compact systems. These observations, supported by simulations, reveal a cosmologically relevant pathway for in-situ spheroid formation through starbursts likely preferentially triggered by interactions (and mergers) acting on galaxies fed by non co-planar gas accretion streams.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Fields in Massive Star-forming Regions (MagMaR): Unveiling an Hourglass Magnetic Field in G333.46-0.16 using ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The contribution of the magnetic field to the formation of high-mass stars is poorly understood. We report the high-angular resolution ($\sim0.3^{\prime\prime}$, 870 au) map of the magnetic field projected on the plane of the sky (B$_\mathrm{POS}$) towards the high-mass star forming region G333.46$-$0.16 (G333), obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 1.2 mm as part of the Magnetic Fields in Massive Star-forming Regions (MagMaR) survey. The B$_\mathrm{POS}$ morphology found in this region is consistent with a canonical ``hourglass'' which suggest a dynamically important field. This region is fragmented into two protostars separated by $\sim1740$ au. Interestingly, by analysing H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ ($J=3-2$) line emission, we find no velocity gradient over the extend of the continuum which is consistent with a strong field. We model the B$_\mathrm{POS}$, obtaining a marginally supercritical mass-to-flux ratio of 1.43, suggesting an initially strongly magnetized environment. Based on the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, the magnetic field strength towards G333 is estimated to be 5.7 mG. The absence of strong rotation and outflows towards the central region of G333 suggests strong magnetic braking, consistent with a highly magnetized environment. Our study shows that despite being a strong regulator, the magnetic energy fails to prevent the process of fragmentation, as revealed by the formation of the two protostars in the central region.</description>

      <title>DIISC-V: Variations in H$\alpha$-to-FUV Star Formation Rate Ratios Across Star-forming Regions in Nearby Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the variations in far-ultraviolet (FUV) and H$\alpha$ star formation rates (SFR), SFR$_{UV}$ and SFR$_{H\alpha}$, respectively, at sub-kpc scales in 11 galaxies as part of the Deciphering the Interplay between the Interstellar Medium, Stars, and the Circumgalactic medium (DIISC) survey. Using archival GALEX FUV imagery and H$\alpha$+[NII] narrowband images obtained with the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope, we detect a total of 1335 (FUV-selected) and 1474 (H$\alpha$-selected) regions of recent high-mass star formation, respectively. We find the H$\alpha$-to-FUV SFR ratios tend to be lower primarily for FUV-selected regions, where SFR$_{H\alpha}$ generally underestimates the SFR by an average factor of 2-3, for SFR $&lt;$ 10$^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. In contrast, the SFRs are generally observed to be consistent for H$\alpha$-selected regions. This discrepancy arises from morphological differences between the two indicators. Extended FUV morphologies and larger areas covered by FUV-only regions, along with decreasing overlap between FUV clumps and compact HII regions with $R/R_{25}$ suggest that stochastic sampling of the initial mass function may be more pronounced in the outer regions of galaxies. Our observed H$\alpha$-to-FUV SFR ratios are also consistent with stochastic star formation model predictions. However, using larger apertures that include diffuse FUV emission results in an offset of 1 dex between SFR$_{H\alpha}$ and SFR$_{UV}$. This suggests that the observed low H$\alpha$-to-FUV SFR ratios in galaxies are likely caused by diffuse FUV emission, which can contribute $\sim$60-90\% to the total FUV flux.</description>

      <title>Mildly Super-Eddington Accretion Onto Slowly-Spinning Black Holes Explains the X-Ray Weakness of the Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a population of low-luminosity AGN at $z&gt;4$ in compact, red hosts (the "Little Red Dots", or LRDs), which are largely undetected in X-rays. We investigate this phenomenon using GRRMHD simulations of super-Eddington accretion onto a SMBH with $M_\bullet=10^7 \,\rm M_\odot$ at $z\sim6$, representing the median population; the SEDs that we obtain are intrinsically X-ray weak. The highest levels of X-ray weakness occur in SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates ($1.4&lt;f_{\rm Edd}&lt;4$) with zero spin, viewed at angles $&gt;30^\circ$ from the pole. X-ray bolometric corrections in the observed $2-10$ keV band reach $\sim10^4$ at $z=6$, $\sim5$ times higher than the highest constraint from X-ray stacking. Most SEDs exhibit $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ values outside standard ranges, with X-ray weakness increasing with optical-UV luminosity; they are also extraordinarily steep and soft in the X-rays (median photon index $\Gamma=3.1$, mode of $\Gamma=4.4$). SEDs strong in the X-rays have harder spectra with a high-energy bump when viewed near the hot ($&gt;10^8$ K) and highly-relativistic jet, whereas X-ray weak SEDs lack this feature. Viewing a SMBH within $10^\circ$ of its pole, where beaming enhances the X-ray emission, has a $\sim1.5\%$ probability, matching the LRD X-ray detection rate. Next-generation observatories like AXIS will detect X-ray weak LRDs at $z\sim6$ from any viewing angle. Although many SMBHs in the LRDs are already estimated to accrete at super-Eddington rates, our model explains $50\%$ of their population by requiring that their masses are overestimated by a mere factor of $\sim3$. In summary, we suggest that LRDs host slowly spinning SMBHs accreting at mildly super-Eddington rates, with large covering factors and broad emission lines enhanced by strong winds, providing a self-consistent explanation for their X-ray weakness and complementing other models.</description>

      <title>Exoplanets Across Galactic Stellar Populations with PLATO: Estimating Exoplanet Yields Around FGK Stars for the Thin Disk, Thick Disk and Stellar Halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to assess the potential of the upcoming PLATO mission to investigate exoplanet populations around stars in diverse Galactic environments, specifically focusing on the Milky Way thin disk, thick disk, and stellar halo. We aim to quantify PLATOs ability to detect planets in each environment and determine how these observations could constrain planet formation models. Beginning from the all-sky PLATO Input Catalog, we kinematically classify the 2.4 million FGK stars into their respective Galactic components. For the sub-sample of stars in the long-observation LOPS2 and LOPN1 PLATO fields, we estimate planet occurrence rates using the New Generation Planet Population Synthesis (NGPPS) dataset. Combining these estimates with a PLATO detection efficiency model, we predicted the expected planet yields for each Galactic environment during a nominal 2+2 year mission. Based on our analysis, PLATO is likely to detect at least 400 exoplanets around the alpha-enriched thick disk stars. The majority of those planets are expected to be Super-Earths and Sub-Neptunes with radii between 2 and 10 Earth radii and orbital periods between 2 and 50 days, ideal for studying the link between the radius valley and stellar chemistry. For the metal-poor halo, PLATO is likely to detect between 1 and 80 planets with periods between 10 and 50 days, depending on the potential existence of a metallicity threshold for planet formation. The PLATO fields contain more than 3,400 potential target stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -0.6, which will help to improve our understanding of planets around metal-poor stars. We identify a specific target list of 47 (kinematically classified) halo stars in the high-priority, high-SNR PLATO P1 sample, offering prime opportunities in the search for planets in metal-poor environments.</description>

      <title>Extreme magnetic fields around black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results of the event horizon-scale images of M87* and Sagittarius A* from the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration show that strong magnetic fields are likely present around the central black holes (BHs) in these sources. Magnetically arrested disks (MADs), the end stage of magnetic flux saturation around BHs, are especially rich in horizon-scale physics due to the presence of powerful jets and magnetic flux eruptions that provide significant feedback on the accretion mechanism. Here, we present an overview of our current knowledge about the magnetic field evolution in numerical simulations of accreting BHs, focusing on jet launching, black hole-interstellar medium feedback, and black hole imaging of MADs. We find that misaligned MAD accretion flows seemingly exhibit jet ejection cycles that could produce flaring states in radio-quiet active galactic nuclei. Further, we show that advances in horizon-scale interferometric telescopes could identify disk misalignment by imaging the disk-jet connection region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilized photometric data from the space telescope AKARI to identify potential planetary nebulae (PNe) and proto-planetary nebulae (PPNe) candidates. Using the colour-colour diagram, we found a region with a high concentration of established PNe and PPNe, comprising about 95% of the objects. Based on this, we identified 67 objects within this region that lack definitive classification in existing literature, suggesting they are promising candidates. We conducted Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) analysis and morphological investigations using imagery from various observatories and satellites. Finally, we present a list of 65 potential PNe and PPNe candidates.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon Dark Matter and Low-Frequency Gravitational Wave Detection with Gaia-like Astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrometric surveys offer us a method to search for elusive cosmic signatures, such as ultralight dark photon dark matter and gravitational waves, by observing the deflection to the apparent positions of the stars. The detection capabilities of such surveys rapidly decrease at low frequencies, because the signals become hardly distinguishable from the background motion of stars. In this work, we find that the background motion can be well described by a linear model over time, based on which we propose a linear background subtraction scheme. Compared to the conventional quadratic subtraction, the advantage of linear subtraction emerges within the frequency range below $6 \times 10^{-9}~{\rm Hz}$. Taking dark photons with purely gravitational interactions, dark photons with additional $U(1)_{B}$ or $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge interactions, and low-frequency gravitational waves as examples, we illustrate that the linear subtraction scheme can result in an enhancement of more than one order of magnitude in the exclusion limits of Gaia-like experiments in the low-frequency range.</description>

      <title>Unveiling galaxy pair alignment in cosmic filaments: A 3D exploration using EAGLE simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how galaxy pairs are oriented in three dimensions within cosmic filaments using data from the EAGLE simulation. We identify filament spines using DisPerSE and isolate galaxies residing in filamentary environments. Employing a FoF algorithm, we delineate individual filaments and determine their axes by diagonalizing the moment of inertia tensor. The orientations of galaxy pairs relative to the axis of their host filament are analyzed. Our study covers diverse subsets of filaments identified through varying linking lengths, examining how galaxy pairs align with the filament axis across different spatial parameters such as pair separation and distance from the filament spine. We consistently observe a strong alignment pattern characterized by the probability distribution for the cosine of the orientation angle, which is nearly identical in each case. Furthermore, the study investigates the impact of redshift space distortions, confirming that the alignment signal persists in both real and redshift space. To validate our method, we employ Monte Carlo simulations with different theoretical probability distributions. Our results reaffirm previous findings with projected two-dimensional distributions and extend our understanding of how filaments impact the spatial organization and evolution of galaxies across cosmic scales.</description>

      <title>Birth of the Galactic Disk Revealed by the H3 Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.02989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use chemistry ([alpha/Fe] and [Fe/H]), main sequence turnoff ages, and kinematics determined from H3 Survey spectroscopy and Gaia astrometry to identify the birth of the Galactic disk. We separate in-situ and accreted stars on the basis of angular momenta and eccentricities. The sequence of high-alpha in-situ stars persists down to at least [Fe/H]=-2.5 and shows unexpected non-monotonic behavior: with increasing metallicity the population first declines in [alpha/Fe], then increases over the range -1.3&lt;[Fe/H]&lt;-0.7, and then declines again at higher metallicities. The number of stars in the in-situ population rapidly increases above [Fe/H]=-1. The average kinematics of these stars are hot and independent of metallicity at [Fe/H]&lt;-1 and then become increasingly cold and disk-like at higher metallicities. The ages of the in-situ, high-alpha stars are uniformly very old (13 Gyr) at [Fe/H]&lt;-1.3, and span a wider range (8-12 Gyr) at higher metallicities. Interpreting the chemistry with a simple chemical evolution model suggests that the non-monotonic behavior is due to a significant increase in star formation efficiency, which began 13 Gyr ago. These results support a picture in which the first 1 Gyr of the Galaxy was characterized by a "simmering phase" in which the star formation efficiency was low and the kinematics had substantial disorder with some net rotation. The disk then underwent a dramatic transformation to a "boiling phase", in which the star formation efficiency increased substantially, the kinematics became disk-like, and the number of stars formed increased tenfold. We interpret this transformation as the birth of the Galactic disk at z~4. The physical origin of this transformation is unclear and does not seem to be reproduced in current galaxy formation models.</description>

      <title>Cluster Population Demographics in NGC 628 Derived from Stochastic Population Synthesis Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05912v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physical properties of star cluster populations offer valuable insights into their birth, evolution, and disruption. However, individual stars in clusters beyond the nearest neighbours of the Milky Way are unresolved, forcing analyses of star cluster demographics to rely on integrated light, a process fraught with uncertainty. Here we infer the demographics of the cluster population in the benchmark galaxy NGC 628 using data from the Legacy Extra-galactic UV Survey (LEGUS) coupled to a novel Bayesian forward-modelling technique. Our method analyzes all 1178 clusters in the LEGUS catalogue, $\sim4$ times more than prior studies severely affected by completeness cuts. Our results indicate that the cluster mass function is either significantly steeper than the commonly-observed slope of $-2$ or is truncated at $\approx 10^{4.5}$ M$_\odot$; the latter possibility is consistent with proposed relations between truncation mass and star formation surface density. We find that cluster disruption is relatively mild for the first $\approx 200$ Myr of cluster evolution; no evidence for mass-dependent disruption is found. We find suggestive but not incontrovertible evidence that inner galaxy clusters may be more prone to disruption and outer galaxy clusters have a more truncated mass function, but confirming or refuting these findings will require larger samples from future observations of outer galaxy clusters. Finally, we find that current stellar track and atmosphere models, along with common forms for cluster mass and age distributions, cannot fully capture all features in the multidimensional photometric distribution of star clusters. While our forward-modelling approach outperforms earlier backward-modeling approaches, some systematic differences persist between observed and modelled photometric distributions.</description>

      <title>Final parsec problem of black hole mergers and ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When two galaxies merge, they often produce a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) at their center. Numerical simulations with stars and cold dark matter show that SMBHBs typically stall out at a distance of a few parsecs apart and take billions of years to coalesce. This is known as the final parsec problem. We suggest that ultralight dark matter (ULDM) halos around SMBHBs can generate dark matter waves due to dynamical friction. These waves can effectively carry away orbital energy from the black holes, rapidly driving them together. To test this hypothesis, we performed numerical simulations of black hole binaries inside ULDM halos.
  Due to gravitational cooling and quasi-normal modes, the loss-cone problem can be avoided. The decay time scale gives lower bounds on masses of the ULDM particles and SMBHBs comparable to observational data. Our results imply that ULDM waves can lead to the rapid orbital decay of black hole binaries.</description>

      <title>True Pair-instability Supernova Descendant: Implications for the First Stars' Mass Distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The initial mass function (IMF) of the first Pop III stars remains a persistent mystery. Their predicted massive nature implies the existence of stars exploding as pair-instability supernovae (PISN), but no observational evidence had been found. Now, the LAMOST survey claims to have discovered a pure PISN descendant, J1010+2358, at ${\rm [Fe/H]}= -2.4$. Here we confirm that a massive 250-260 ${\rm M_\odot}$ PISN is needed to reproduce the abundance pattern of J1010+2358. However, the PISN contribution can be as low as 10%, since key elements are missing to discriminate between scenarios. We investigate the implications of this discovery for the Pop III IMF, by statistical comparison with the predictions of our cosmological galaxy formation model, NEFERTITI. First, we show that the non-detection of mono-enriched PISN descendants at ${\rm [Fe/H]}&lt;-2.5$ allows us to exclude: (i) a flat IMF at a 90% confidence level; and (ii) a Larson type IMF with characteristic mass $m_{\rm ch}/{\rm M_\odot} &gt; 191.16x - 132.44$, where x is the slope, at a 75% confidence level. Secondly, we show that if J1010+2358 has only inherited &lt;70% of its metals from a massive PISN, no further constraints can be put on the Pop III IMF. If, instead, J1010+2358 will be confirmed to be a nearly pure (&gt;90%) PISN descendant, it will offer strong and complementary constraints on the Pop III IMF, excluding the steepest and bottom-heaviest IMFs: $m_{\rm ch}/{\rm M_\odot} &lt; 143.21x - 225.94$. Our work shows that even a single detection of a pure PISN descendant can be crucial to our understanding of the mass distribution of the first stars.</description>

      <title>Strong asymptotic giant branch stars' spectral features in distant quiescent galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Age-dating and weighting stellar populations in galaxies are essential steps to study galaxy formation through cosmic times. Evolutionary population synthesis models with different input physics are used towards this aim. In particular, the contribution from the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stellar phase, which peaks for intermediate-age 0.6-2 Gyr systems, has been debated upon for decades. Here we report the detection of strong cool-star signatures in the rest-frame near-infrared spectra of three young (~1 Gyr), massive (~10^10 Msun) quiescent galaxies at large look-back time, z=1-2, using JWST/NIRSpec. The co-existence of oxygen- and carbon-type absorption features, spectral edges and features from rare species such as Vanadium, and possibly Zirconium, reveal a strong contribution from TP-AGB stars. Population synthesis models with significant TP-AGB contribution reproduce the observations better than those with weak TP-AGB, which are commonly used. These findings call for revisions of published stellar population fitting results, pointing to lower masses and younger ages, with additional implications on cosmic dust production and chemical enrichment. New generations of improved models are needed, informed by these and future observations.</description>

Abstract: Observations of large amount of massive galaxies with relatively old populations found at high redshifts are challenging galaxy formation scenarios within standard cosmology. Precise determinations of the average age of these galaxies would be useful for the discussion of this problem. Here we carry out a better constraint of the age of 200 V-shaped SED non-AGN galaxies at redshifts $2&lt;z&lt;4$ of the catalog of FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey, identified by V-shape in their spectral energy distribution (SED) with a Lyman and a Balmer break. SED fitting include a main stellar population in addition to a residual younger population and extinction. The galaxies are younger at higher redshift on average. However, for the galaxies with $z&gt;2.5$, we do not see a significant evolution of their average age, with all average ages of galaxies mostly remaining between 1 and 2 Gyr. Our research find that most massive galaxies ($\sim 10^{10} M_\odot$ ) are older (typically $&gt;\sim 1$ Gyr old) and formed earlier than less massive galaxies in our sample.</description>

      <title>Age and metal gradients in massive quiescent galaxies at $0.6 \lesssim z \lesssim 1.0$: implications for quenching and assembly histories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present spatially resolved, simple stellar population equivalent ages, stellar metallicities, and abundance ratios for 456 massive ($10.3\lesssim\log(\mathrm{M}_*/\mathrm{M}_\odot)\lesssim11.8$) quiescent galaxies at $0.6\lesssim z\lesssim1.0$ from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census, derived using full-spectrum models. Typically, we find flat age and [Mg/Fe] gradients, and negative [Fe/H] gradients, implying iron-rich cores. We also estimate intrinsic [Fe/H] gradients via forward modelling. We examine the observed gradients in three age bins. Younger quiescent galaxies typically have negative [Fe/H] gradients and positive age gradients, possibly indicating a recent central starburst. Additionally, this finding suggests that photometrically measured flat colour gradients in young quiescent galaxies are the result of the positive age and negative metallicity gradients cancelling each other. For older quiescent galaxies, the age gradients become flat and [Fe/H] gradients weaken, though remain negative. Thus, negative colour gradients at older ages are likely driven by metallicity gradients. The diminishing age gradient may result from the starburst fading. Furthermore, the persistence of the [Fe/H] gradients may suggest that the outskirts are simultaneously built up by mergers with lower metallicity satellites. On the other hand, the gradients could be inherited from the star-forming phase, in which case mergers may not be needed to explain our findings. This work illustrates the need for resolved spectroscopy, instead of just photometry, to measure stellar population gradients. Extending these measurements to higher redshift is imperative for understanding how stellar populations in quiescent galaxies are assembled over cosmic time.</description>

      <title>Chandra Survey in the AKARI North Ecliptic Pole Deep Field Optical/Infrared Identifications of X-ray Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a catalog of optical and infrared identifications (ID) of X-ray sources in the AKARI North Ecliptic Pole (NEP) Deep field detected with Chandra covering $\sim 0.34\,{\rm deg^{2}}$ with 0.5-2 keV flux limits ranging $\sim 2 \mathrm{-} 20\times 10^{-16}\,{\rm erg\,s^{-1}\,cm^{-2}}$. The optical/near-infrared counterparts of the X-ray sources are taken from our Hyper Suprime Cam (HSC)/Subaru and Wide-Field InfraRed Camera (WIRCam)/Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) data because these have much more accurate source positions due to their spatial resolution than that of {Chandra} and longer wavelength infrared data. We concentrate our identifications in the HSC $g$ band and WIRCam $K_{\rm s}$ band-based catalogs. To select the best counterpart, we utilize a novel extension of the likelihood-ratio (LR) analysis, where we use the X-ray flux as well as $g - K_{\rm s}$ colors to calculate the likelihood ratio. Spectroscopic and photometric redshifts of the counterparts are summarized. Also, simple X-ray spectroscopy is made on the sources with sufficient source counts.
  We present the resulting catalog in an electronic form. The main ID catalog contains 403 X-ray sources and includes X-ray fluxes, luminosities, $g$ and $K_{\rm s}$ band magnitudes, redshifts, and their sources, optical spectroscopic properties, as well as intrinsic absorption column densities and power-law indices from simple X-ray spectroscopy. The identified X-ray sources include 27 Milky-Way objects, 57 type I AGNs, 131 other AGNs, and 15 galaxies. The catalog serves as a basis for further investigations of the properties of the X-ray and near-infrared sources in this field. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Fragmentation of Dense Rotation-Dominated Structures Fed by Collapsing Gravomagneto-Sheetlets and Origin of Misaligned 100 au-Scale Binaries and Multiple Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07777</link>

Abstract: The majority of stars are in binary/multiple systems. How such systems form in turbulent, magnetized cores of molecular clouds in the presence of non-ideal MHD effects remains relatively under-explored. Through ATHENA++-based non-ideal MHD AMR simulations with ambipolar diffusion, we show that the collapsing protostellar envelope is dominated by dense gravo-magneto-sheetlets, a turbulence-warped version of the classic pseudodisk produced by anisotropic magnetic resistance to the gravitational collapse, in agreement with previous simulations of turbulent, magnetized single-star formation. The sheetlets feed mass, magnetic fields, and angular momentum to a Dense ROtation-Dominated (DROD) structure, which fragments into binary/multiple systems. This DROD fragmentation scenario is a more dynamic variant of the traditional disk fragmentation scenario for binary/multiple formation, with dense spiral filaments created by inhomogeneous feeding from the highly structured larger-scale sheetlets rather than the need for angular momentum transport, which is dominated by magnetic braking. Provided that the local material is sufficiently demagnetized, with a plasma-$\beta$ of 10 or more, collisions between the dense spiraling filaments play a key role in facilitating gravitational collapse and stellar companion formation by pushing the local magnetic Toomre parameter $Q_\mathrm{m}$ below unity. This mechanism can naturally produce {\it in situ} misaligned systems on the 100-au scale, often detected with high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. Our simulations also highlight the importance of non-ideal MHD effects, which affect whether fragmentation occurs and, if so, the masses and orbital parameters of the stellar companions formed.</description>

      <title>Stripe 82X Data Release 3: Multiwavelength Catalog with New Spectroscopic Redshifts and Black Hole Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the third catalog release of the wide-area (31.3 deg$^2$) Stripe 82 X-ray survey. This catalog combines previously published X-ray source properties with multiwavelength counterparts and photometric redshifts, presents 343 new spectroscopic redshifts, and provides black hole masses for 1297 Type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). With spectroscopic redshifts for 3457 out of 6181 Stripe 82X sources, the survey has a spectroscopic completeness of 56%. This completeness rises to 90% when considering the contiguous portions of the Stripe 82X survey with homogeneous X-ray coverage at an optical magnitude limit of $r&lt;22$. Within that portion of the survey, 23% of AGN can be considered obscured by being either a Type 2 AGN, reddened ($R-K &gt; 4$, Vega), or X-ray obscured with a column density $N_{\rm H} &gt; 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. Unlike other surveys, there is only a 18% overlap between Type 2 and X-ray obscured AGN. We calculated black hole masses for Type 1 AGN that have SDSS spectra using virial mass estimators calibrated on the H$\beta$,MgII, H$\alpha$, and CIV emission lines. We find wide scatter in these black hole mass estimates, indicating that statiscal analyses should use black hole masses calculated from the same formula to minimize bias. We find that the AGN with the highest X-ray luminosities are accreting at the highest Eddington ratios, consistent with the picture that most black hole mass accretion happens in the phase when the AGN is luminous ($L_{\rm 2-10 keV} &gt; 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$).</description>
