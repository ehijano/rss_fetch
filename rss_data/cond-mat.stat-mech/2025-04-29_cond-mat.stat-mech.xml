      <title>The Global Diffusion Limit for the Space Dependent Variable-Order Time-Fractional Diffusion Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The diffusion equation and its time-fractional counterpart can be obtained via the diffusion limit of continuous-time random walks with exponential and heavy-tailed waiting time distributions. The space dependent variable-order time-fractional diffusion equation is a generalization of the time-fractional diffusion equation with a fractional exponent that varies over space, modelling systems with spatial heterogeneity. However, there has been limited work on defining a global diffusion limit and an underlying random walk for this macroscopic governing equation, which is needed to make meaningful interpretations of the parameters for applications. Here, we introduce continuous time and discrete time random walk models that limit to the variable-order fractional diffusion equation via a global diffusion limit and space- and time- continuum limits. From this, we show how the master equation of the discrete time random walk can be used to provide a numerical method for solving the variable-order fractional diffusion equation. The results in this work provide underlying random walks and an improved understanding of the diffusion limit for the variable-order fractional diffusion equation, which is critical for the development, calibration and validation of models for diffusion in spatially inhomogeneous media with traps and obstacles.</description>

      <title>Percolation in the two-dimensional Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the Ising model from a percolation perspective has played a significant role in the modern theory of critical phenomena. We consider the celebrated square-lattice Ising model and construct percolation clusters by placing bonds, with probability $p$, between any pair of parallel spins within an extended range beyond nearest neighbors. At the Ising criticality, we observe two percolation transitions as $p$ increases: starting from a disordered phase with only small clusters, the percolation system enters into a stable critical phase that persists over a wide range $p_{c_1} &lt; p &lt; p_{c_2}$, and then develops a long-ranged percolation order with giant clusters for both up and down spins. At $p_{c1}$ and for the stable critical phase, the critical behaviors agree well with those for the Fortuin-Kasteleyn random clusters and the spin domains of the Ising model, respectively. At $p_{c2}$, the fractal dimension of clusters and the scaling exponent along $p$ direction are estimated as $y_{h2} = 1.958\,0(6)$ and $y_{p2} = 0.552(9)$, of which the exact values remain unknown. These findings reveal interesting geometric properties of the two-dimensional Ising model that has been studied for more than 100 years.</description>

      <title>Learning Stochastic Thermodynamics Directly from Correlation and Trajectory-Fluctuation Currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Markedly increased computational power and data acquisition have led to growing interest in data-driven inverse dynamics problems. These seek to answer a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in stochastic thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Different behaviors of diffusing diffusivity dynamics based on three different definitions of fractional Brownian motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of a "diffusing diffusivity" (DD), a stochastically time-varying diffusion coefficient, are explored within the frameworks of three different forms of fractional Brownian motion (FBM): (i) the Langevin equation driven by fractional Gaussian noise (LE-FBM), (ii) the Weyl integral representation introduced by Mandelbrot and van Ness (MN-FBM), and (iii) the Riemann-Liouville fractional integral representation (RL-FBM) due to L{\'e}vy. The statistical properties of the three FBM-generalized DD models are examined, including the mean-squared displacement (MSD), mean-squared increment (MSI), autocovariance function (ACVF) of increments, and the probability density function (PDF). Despite the long-believed equivalence of MN-FBM and LE-FBM, their corresponding FBM-DD models exhibit distinct behavior in terms of the MSD and MSI. In the MN-FBM-DD model, the statistical characteristics directly reflect an effective diffusivity equal to its mean value. In contrast, in LE-FBM-DD, correlations in the random diffusivity give rise to an unexpected crossover behavior in both MSD and MSI. We also find that the MSI and ACVF are nonstationary in RL-FBM-DD but stationary in the other two DD models. All DD models display a crossover from a short-time non-Gaussian PDF to a long-time Gaussian PDF. Our findings offer guidance for experimentalists in selecting appropriate FBM-generalized models to describe viscoelastic yet non-Gaussian dynamics in bio- and soft-matter systems with heterogeneous environments.</description>

      <title>Control of active field theories at minimal dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in experimental techniques enable the precise manipulation of a large variety of active systems, which constantly dissipate energy to sustain nonequilibrium phenomena without any equilibrium equivalent. To design novel materials out of active systems, an outstanding challenge is to rationalize how material properties can be optimally controlled by applying external perturbations. However, equilibrium thermodynamics is inadequate to guide the control of such nonequilibrium systems. Therefore, there is a dire need for a novel framework to provide a systematic toolbox for the thermodynamic control of active matter. Here, we build an optimization procedure for generic active field theories within a thermodynamically consistent formulation. Central to our approach is the distinction between the protocol heat, which is dissipated only during manipulation, and the total heat, which also accounts for the post-manipulation dissipation. We demonstrate that the latter generically features a global minimum with respect to the protocol duration. We deploy our versatile approach to an active theory of phase separation, and examine the scalings of the optimal protocol duration with respect to activity and system size. Remarkably, we reveal that the landscape of steady-state dissipation regulates the crossover between optimal control strategies for a finite duration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conjecture an approximate expression for the free energy in the thermodynamic limit of the classical square lattice Ising model in a uniform (real) magnetic field. The zero-field result is well known due to Onsager for more than eighty years, but no such result exists for a nonzero magnetic field on a regular lattice. We verify our conjecture using numerical tensor renormalization group (TRG) methods and find good agreement with a maximum deviation of $\sim2\%$ from the numerical results for the free energy across all $\beta$ and real magnetic field, $h$.</description>

      <title>Phases of Floquet code under local decoherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet code is a dynamical quantum memory with a periodically evolving logical space. As a defining feature, the code exhibits an anyon automorphism after each period, giving rise to a non-trivial evolution of each logical state. In this paper, we study the Floquet code under local decoherence and demonstrate that below the decoherence threshold, the code is in a robust phase characterized by the anyon automorphism. We first derive the 3D statistical mechanics model for the maximum likelihood decoder of the 2D Floquet code under local Pauli decoherence. We identify a class of two-qubit Pauli channels under which the 3D statistical mechanics model becomes decoupled 2D models and obtain the threshold for such decoherence channels. We then propose a diagnostic of the anyon automorphism in the presence of local decoherence. We analytically show that this diagnostic distinguishes the Floquet code from the toric code under repeated syndrome measurements and undergoes a phase transition at the threshold.</description>

      <title>A correspondence between the Rabi model and an Ising model with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By means of Trotter's formula, we show that transition amplitudes between coherent states in the Rabi model can be understood in terms of a certain Ising model featuring long-range interactions (i.e., beyond nearest neighbors) in its thermodynamic limit. Specifically, we relate the transition amplitudes in the Rabi Model to a sum over $n$ binary variables of the form of a partition function of an Ising model with $n$ spin sites, where $n$ is also the number of steps in Trotter's formula. From this, we show that a perturbative expansion in the energy splitting of the two-level subsystem in the Rabi model is equivalent to an expansion in the number of spin domains in the Ising model. We conclude by discussing how calculations in one model give nontrivial information about the other model, and vice-versa, as well as applications and generalizations this correspondence may find.</description>

      <title>Rumor propagation on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid spread of information and rumors through social media platforms, especially in group settings, motivates the need for more sophisticated models of rumor propagation. Traditional pairwise models do not account for group interactions, a limitation that we address by proposing a higher-order rumor model based on hypergraphs. Our model incorporates a group-based annihilation mechanism, where a spreader becomes a stifler when the fraction of hyperedges aware of the rumor exceeds a threshold. Our model has two distinct subcritical behaviors: exponential and power-law decay, which can coexist depending on the heterogeneity of the hypergraph. Interestingly, our analysis reveals continuous phase transitions in both homogeneous and heterogeneous hypergraphs, challenging the idea that higher-order interactions lead to discontinuous transitions. Finally, we validate our model using empirical data from Telegram and email cascades, providing additional evidence that real-world rumor propagation tends to occur near criticality. These results open the door to a more detailed understanding of rumor dynamics in higher-order systems.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation-induced first-order superfluid transition in unitary $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Fermi gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the superfluid phase transition in an $\mathrm{SU}(N)$-symmetric Fermi gas with $N$ distinct spin states using the functional renormalization group. To capture pairing phenomena beyond mean-field theory, we introduce an auxiliary bosonic field and employ the leading order of the derivative expansion of the partially bosonized effective average action. By discretizing the effective potential on a grid and numerically integrating the flow equations, we resolve the thermodynamic behavior near the transition. Our results reveal a fluctuation-induced first-order phase transition for $N \geq 4$, which is absent at the mean-field level. In the unitary regime, we provide quantitative predictions for the critical temperature, as well as for the discontinuities in the superfluid gap and entropy density as functions of $N$. With increasing $N$, the critical temperature decreases, while the discontinuities become more pronounced, indicating a stronger first-order transition.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Imaginary Time Crystals in the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parity-time symmetry constrains the spectrum of non-Hermitian systems to be either real or come in complex conjugate pairs. The transition between a symmetry-preserving phase with real energies and a symmetry-broken phase with complex energies is marked by exceptional points, one of the hallmarks of non-Hermitian systems. Because of these properties, these systems are widely studied, both theoretically and experimentally. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic properties of the gain and loss Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model for both bosons and fermions, and establish the existence of an imaginary time crystal phase, an imaginary time analogue of a time crystal. This phase occurs when there is a resonance condition between the Matsubara frequencies and the spectrum of the system, making the Green's function of the system oscillate in imaginary time with the Matsubara frequency. We show that this phase appears in the symmetry-broken region. In particular, the topological edge states of this system exhibit oscillations that are present for bosons. Finally, we discuss the applicability of our results for experiments. We examine signatures of these phases in terms of correlation functions in real time and oscillations in thermodynamic potential in inverse temperature $\beta$, and explore possible experimental platforms to realize this system.</description>

      <title>Melting of a Bosonic Mott Insulator in Kagome Optical Lattices with Sign-Inverted Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (dTWA), we investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of ultracold bosons confined in optical kagome lattices, focusing on both unfrustrated positive and frustrated negative hopping regimes. We consider a protocol in which the system is initialized in a Mott insulating state at unit filling, and the hopping amplitude is gradually increased from zero. For positive hopping, the melting of the Mott insulator is accompanied by the emergence of a sharp peak in the momentum distribution at the $\Gamma$ point of the lowest band, signaling the onset of superfluidity. In contrast, for negative hopping, the Mott insulator melts into a highly nontrivial state without long-range phase coherence, characterized instead by a broad momentum distribution within the flat band, consistent with recent experimental observations. These results demonstrate the applicability of dTWA to highly frustrated quantum systems and offer a new route for numerically exploring the dynamics of frustrated quantum magnets.</description>

      <title>Spin-Depairing-Induced Exceptional Fermionic Superfluidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We exhibit an uncountable family of extremal inhomogeneous Gibbs measures of the low temperature Ising model on regular tilings of the hyperbolic plane. These states arise as low temperature perturbations of local ground states having a sparse enough set of frustrated edges, the sparseness being measured in terms of the isoperimetric constant of the graph. This result is implied by an extension of the article [9] on regular trees to non-amenable graphs. We argue how we can deduce the extremality of an uncountable subset of the Series-Sinai states [30] at low temperature.</description>

Abstract: Using an S-matrix formulation we evaluate the conductance of a one dimensional free electron gas in double exchange interaction with a conical magnet. We find integer conductance steps depending on the energy window of the incoming electrons for conical magnets in different orientations and a modulated magnetic field profile. The conductance windows, that we attribute to potential or diffractive scattering, are characterized by spin selectivity depending on the magnetic field direction and chirality.</description>

      <title>Oscillation death by mechanochemical feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many cellular proteins, such as ERK, undergo oscillation death when cells are compressed, initiating many developmental processes in organisms. Whether such a transition arises from these proteins' specific biochemistry or generic dynamical features remains unclear. In this paper, we show that coupling mechanics to the chemistry of Hopf oscillators, such as ERK, through mechanochemical feedback (MCF) can generically drive oscillation death upon compression. We demonstrate this result using an active solid, a 1D ring of Brusselators coupled through damped springs, which we term Harmonic Brusselator Ring (HBR). Because of MCF, HBR's dynamics is non-Hermitian and breaks $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry in a scale-dependent manner, generating a rich array of patterns, including traveling pulses, chimera states, intermittent fluctuations, and collective oscillation death. Furthermore, MCF engenders three dynamic phase transitions that separate the observed patterns into four phases. The underlying symmetry of HBR implies that the observed patterns and phases may generically arise in many natural and synthetic systems.</description>

      <title>Comments on the minimal training set for CNN: a case study of the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the square lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The minimal training set to train a working CNN is explored in detail. The considered model is the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the square lattice. Here $J_1 &lt; 0$ and $J_2 &gt; 0$ are the nearest and next-to-nearest neighboring couplings, respectively. We train the CNN using the configurations of $g \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} J_2/|J_1| = 0.7$ and employ the resulting CNN to study the phase transition of $g = 0.8$. We find that this transfer learning is successful. In particular, only configurations of two temperatures, one is below and one is above the critical temperature $T_c$ of $g=0.7$, are needed to reach accurately determination of the $T_c$ of $g=0.8$. However, it may be subtle to use this strategy for the training. Specifically, for the considered model, due to the inefficiency of the single spin flip algorithm used in sampling the configurations at the low-temperature region, the two temperatures associated with the training set should not be too far away from the $T_c$ of $g=0.7$, otherwise, the performance of the obtained CNN is not of high quality, hence cannot determine the $T_c$ of $g=0.8$ accurately. For the considered model, we also uncover the condition for training a successful CNN when only configurations of two temperatures are considered as the training set.</description>

      <title>Finite temperature phase diagram of the extended Bose-Hubbard model in the presence of disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the finite- and non-zero temperature phase diagram of the Extended Bose-Hubbard Model for both pure and disordered systems. Such a system can be experimentally realized by trapping ultracold Rydberg atoms in optical lattices. By regulating the Rydberg excitation level and the lattice spacing, the system can be engineered to effectively have (i) only the nearest-neighbor interaction and (ii) both nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor interactions. For both of these situations, we construct the mean-field phase diagrams. It is found that the presence of a non-zero temperature significantly changes the phase diagram because now there is a competition between quantum and thermal fluctuations. We observe that conventional Mott insulator (MI) or charge-density-wave (CDW) lobes vanish at higher temperatures. In a pure system, they melt into a normal fluid. In contrast, the only insulating phase that survives at high temperatures in the presence of disorder is a Bose glass. It is evident that the CDW lobes melt at a lower temperature and the Mott lobes melt at higher temperatures. These transition temperatures depend on the on-site and nearest-neighbor interaction strengths, respectively. It is also found that, with the addition of disorder, the insulating lobes are destroyed at a relatively lower temperature. The mathematical framework that we present here is capable of treating long-range interactions, disorder, and finite temperature simultaneously, and versatile enough so that it can be extended to study different forms of disorder or longer-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Level spacing statistics of two unitary equivalent models with distinct local symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The full spectrum and integrability of unitary equivalent models are the same. A standard diagnostic tool of integrability is level spacing statistics which requires separating the full spectrum into sectors according to the symmetry. When two unitary equivalent models have different symmetries, it is interesting to know how their level spacing statistics show consistent conclusions. In this work, we examine the level spacing statistics of two unitary equivalent models with distinct local symmetries. The first model is spin-1 XXZ chain $H$, the second model is obtained by Kennedy-Tasaki transformation $U_{KT}HU_{KT}$. We find that the level spacings of model $H$ follow the statistics of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). However, model $U_{KT}HU_{KT}$ only displays GOE statistics in some sectors after a "hidden non-local symmetry" is resolved, and the other sectors labeled by quantum numbers corresponding to the local symmetries exhibit non-GOE statistics. Additionally, a mapping relation between the levels in the sector $\{Z,X,I\}$ of model $H$ and the sector $\{Z,X,I'\}$ of model $U_{KT}HU_{KT}$ is found, where $Z,X,I$ correspond to the quantum numbers of $\pi$ rotation around $z,x$ axes and bond-centered inversion.</description>

Abstract: The theory of superstatistics is a generalization of Boltzmann-Gibbs statistical mechanics which admits temperature fluctuations, and generates non-canonical ensembles from the distribution function of these fluctuations. Recently, some results have been presented showing that superstatistics is not universally applicable, but several conditions on the so-called fundamental inverse temperature function $\beta_F$ must be met by any superstatistical model. In this work we provide a set of neccessary and sufficient conditions for a non-equilibrium steady state model to be expressible by superstatistics, showing that $\beta_F$ by itself determines the existence of a superstatistical distribution of temperature.</description>

      <title>On interactive anisotropic walks in two dimensions generated from a three state opinion dynamics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10413v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A system of interacting walkers is considered in a two-dimensional hypothetical space, where the dynamics of each walker are governed by the opinion states of the agents of a fully connected three-state opinion dynamics model. Such walks, studied in different models of statistical physics, are usually considered in one-dimensional virtual spaces. Here, the mapping is done in such a way that the walk is directed along the Y-axis while it can move either way along the X-axis. The walk shows that there are three distinct regions as the noise parameter, responsible for driving a continuous phase transition in the model, is varied. In absence of any noise, the scaling properties and the form of the distribution along either axis do not follow any conventional form. For any finite noise below the critical point the bivariate distribution of the displacements is found to be a modified biased Gaussian function while above it, only the marginal distribution along one direction is Gaussian. The marginal probability distributions can be extracted and the scaling forms of different quantities, showing power law behaviour, are obtained. The directed nature of the walk is reflected in the marginal distributions as well as in the exponents.</description>

      <title>Weighted Point Configurations with Hyperuniformity: An Ecological Example and Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random point configurations are said to be in hyperuniform states, if density fluctuations are anomalously suppressed in large-scale. Typical examples are found in Coulomb gas systems in two dimensions especially called log-gases in random matrix theory, in which points are repulsively correlated by long-range potentials. In infertile lands like deserts continuous survival competitions for water and nutrition will cause long-ranged repulsive interactions among plants. We have prepared digital data of spatial configurations of center-of-mass for bushes weighted by bush sizes which we call masses. Data analysis shows that such ecological point configurations do not show hyperuniformity as unmarked point processes, but are in hyperuniform states as marked point processes in which mass distributions are taken into account. We propose the non-equilibrium statistical-mechanics models to generate marked point processes having hyperuniformity, in which iterations of random thinning of points and coalescing of masses transform initial uncorrelated point processes into non-trivial point processes with hyperuniformity. Combination of real data-analysis and computer simulations shows the importance of strong correlations in probability law between spatial point configurations and mass distributions of individual points to realize hyperuniform marked point processes.</description>

      <title>Chiral Instabilities in Driven-Dissipative Quantum Liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of periodically driven Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids (TLLs) coupled to a thermal bath using a Floquet-Lindblad approach. When the coupling to the bath satisfies detailed balance, we obtain a condition for parametric instabilities to be suppressed, symmetrically for both chiralities. Remarkably, by designing a purely chiral coupling to the bath, instead of instability suppression, we uncover a driven-dissipative phase transition between the former symmetric parametric instability and a new chiral parametric instability. In the latter, a single chirality of bosonic quasiparticles gets exponentially amplified, leading to a dynamical chiral imbalance within the TLL, reminiscent of the non-Hermitian skin effect.</description>

Abstract: Consider the elliptic operator given by \[ \mathscr{L}_\epsilon f=b\cdot\nabla f+\epsilon\Delta f \] for some smooth vector field $b:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^d$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$, and the initial-valued problem on $\mathbb{R}^d$ \[ \left\{\begin{aligned}&amp;\partial_t u_\epsilon=\mathscr{L}_\epsilon u_\epsilon,\\ &amp;u_\epsilon(0,\,\cdot)=u_0(\cdot), \end{aligned} \right. \] for some bounded continuous function $u_0$. Under the hypothesis that the diffusion on $\mathbb{R}^d$ induced by $\mathscr{L}_\epsilon$ has a Gibbs invariant measure of the form $\exp \{-U(x)/\epsilon\}dx$ for some smooth Morse potential function $U$, we provide the complete characterization of the multi-scale behavior of the solution $u_\epsilon$ in the regime $\epsilon\to0$. More precisely, we find the critical time scales $1\ll \theta_\epsilon^{(1)}\ll\cdots\ll \theta_\epsilon^{(q)}$ as $\epsilon\to0$, and the kernels $R_t^{(p)}:M_0\times M_0\to\mathbb{R}_+$, where $M_0$ denotes the set of local minima of $U$, such that \[ \lim_{\epsilon\to0}u_\epsilon(t\theta_\epsilon^{(p)},\,x)=\sum_{m'\in M_0}R_t^{(p)}(m,\,m')u_0(m'), \] for all $t&gt;0$ and $x$ in the domain of attraction of $m$ for the dynamical system $\dot{x}(t)=b(x(t))$. We then complete the characterization of the solution $u_\epsilon$ by computing the exact asymptotic limit of the solution between time scales
  $\theta_\epsilon^{(p)}$ and $\theta_\epsilon^{(p+1)}$ for each $p$, where $\theta_\epsilon^{(0)}=1$ and $\theta_\epsilon^{(q+1)}=\infty$. Our analysis makes essential use of the hierarchical tree structure underlying the metastable behavior in different time-scales of the diffusion induced by $\mathscr{L}_\epsilon$. This result can be regarded as the precise refinement of Freidlin-Wentzell theory which was not known for more than a half century.</description>

      <title>Charged critical behavior and nonperturbative continuum limit of three-dimensional lattice SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the three-dimensional (3D) lattice SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs theories with multicomponent ($N_f&gt;1$) degenerate scalar fields and U($N_f$) global symmetry, focusing on systems with $N_c=2$, to identify critical behaviors that can be effectively described by the corresponding 3D SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theory. The field-theoretical analysis of the RG flow allows one to identify a stable charged fixed point for large values of $N_f$, that would control transitions characterized by the global symmetry-breaking pattern ${\rm U}(N_f)\rightarrow \mathrm{SU}(2)\otimes \mathrm{U}(N_f-2)$. Continuous transitions with the same symmetry-breaking pattern are observed in the SU(2) lattice gauge model for $N_f \ge 30$. Here we present a detailed finite-size scaling analysis of the Monte Carlo data for several large values of $N_f$. The results are in substantial agreement with the field-theoretical predictions obtained in the large-$N_f$ limit. This provides evidence that the SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theories provide the correct effective description of the 3D large-$N_f$ continuous transitions between the disordered and the Higgs phase, where the flavor symmetry breaks to $\mathrm{SU}(2)\otimes \mathrm{U}(N_f-2)$. Therefore, at least for large enough $N_f$, the 3D SU($N_c$) gauge Higgs field theories with multicomponent scalar fields can be nonperturbatively defined by the continuum limit of lattice discretizatized models with the same local and global symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show how to use diagrammatic techniques to compute the weak-coupling perturbation series of the self-consistent solution to a Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) problem. This approach constitutes an alternative to using diagrammatic techniques directly as an impurity solver. It allows one to bypass the need of multiple perturbative series resummations within the DMFT self-consistency loop. It can be applied at or out of equilibrium, with any diagrammatic formalism, such as real times, imaginary times, or Matsubara frequencies formalisms. As a proof of principle, we illustrate our method with the half-filled Hubbard model on the Bethe lattice in the DMFT approximation, using Quantum Quasi-Monte Carlo (QQMC) to obtain the impurity perturbation series on the real time axis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a dense assembly of repulsive particles whose fluctuating sizes are subject to an energetic landscape that defines three species: two distinct states of particles with a finite size, and point particles as an intermediate state between the two previous species. We show that the non-equilibrium synchronization of sizes systematically leads to a homogeneous configuration associated with the survival of a single species. Remarkably, the relaxation towards such a configuration features a transient phase separation. By delineating and analyzing the dominant kinetic factors at play during relaxation, we recapitulate the phase diagram of species survival in terms of the parameters of the size landscape. Finally, we obtain a hydrodynamic mapping to equilibrium by coarse-graining the microscopic dynamics, which leads to predicting the nature of the transitions between various regimes where distinct species survive.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic speed limit for non-adiabatic work and its classical-quantum decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the fundamental constraint on work far beyond the adiabatic regime is crucial to investigating fast and efficient energy extraction or consumption processes. In this study, we derive thermodynamic speed limits for non-adiabatic work and quantify the fundamental costs of non-adiabatic work extraction or consumption processes in open quantum systems, where the costs are quantified by geometric and thermodynamic quantities. We further decompose the non-adiabatic work into classical and quantum contributions and derive their thermodynamic speed limits, clarifying the classical and quantum nature of the fundamental costs. The obtained results are numerically demonstrated by driven two-level systems.</description>

      <title>Enforced Gaplessness from States with Exponentially Decaying Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01977v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that an exponentially localized Hamiltonian must be gapless if its ground state has algebraic correlations. We show that even certain exponentially decaying correlations can imply gaplessness. This is exemplified by the deformed toric code $\propto \exp(\beta \sum_{\ell} Z_{\ell}) |\mathsf{TC}\rangle$, where $|\mathsf{TC}\rangle$ is a fixed-point toric code wavefunction. Although it has a confined regime for $\beta &gt; \beta_c$, recent work has drawn attention to its perimeter law loop correlations. Here, we show that these unusual loop correlations -- namely, perimeter law coexisting with a 1-form symmetry whose disorder operator has long-range order -- imply that any local parent Hamiltonian must either be gapless or have a degeneracy scaling with system size. Moreover, we construct a variational low-energy state for arbitrary local frustration-free Hamiltonians, upper bounding the finite-size gap by $O(1/L^3)$ on periodic boundary conditions. Strikingly, these variational states look like loop waves -- non-quasiparticle analogs of spin waves -- generated from the ground state by non-local loop operators. Our findings have implications for identifying the subset of Hilbert space to which gapped ground states belong, and the techniques have wide applicability. For instance, a corollary of our first result is that Glauber dynamics for the ordered phase of the two-dimensional classical Ising model on the torus must have a gapless Markov transition matrix, with our second result bounding its gap.</description>

      <title>Quantum-stabilized states in magnetic dipolar quantum gases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A decade ago, a universal stabilization mechanism driven by quantum fluctuations was discovered in ultracold Bose gases of highly magnetic atoms. This mechanism prevents these systems from collapsing and instead allows exotic states of matter to arise, including ultradilute quantum droplets, crystallized quantum states, and specifically supersolids. We review the experimental and theoretical progress in understanding these quantum-stabilized states, their emergence, and intriguing properties.</description>

      <title>Work Statistics and Quantum Trajectories: No-Click Limit and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generalized framework for quantum work statistics in continuously monitored quantum systems that extends the conventional two-point measurement scheme to include the effects of multiple generalized measurements and post-selection of no-click trajectories. By deriving a modified generating function for work, our approach naturally incorporates non-Hermitian dynamics arising from quantum jump processes and reveals deviations from the standard Jarzynski equality due to measurement-induced asymmetries. We illustrate our theoretical framework by analyzing a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model under local spin monitoring. In this model, increased measurement strength projects the system onto the no-click state, leading to a suppression of energy fluctuations and measurement-induced energy saturation, reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry of Finite XY Chains: A Comparison of Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a geometrical analysis of finite length XY quantum chains. We begin by examining the ground state and the first excited state of the model, emphasizing the impact of finite size effects under two distinct choices of the Jordan Wigner transformation: the Neveu Schwartz (NS) and Ramond (R) sectors. We explore the geometric features of the system by analyzing the quantum (Berry) curvature derived from the Fubini Study metric, which is intimately connected to the quantum Fisher information. This approach uncovers a rich interplay between boundary conditions and quantum geometry. In the gamma h parameter space, we identify distinct sign changing arcs of the curvature, confined to some region. These arcs mark transitions between the NS and R sectors, indicating fundamental changes in the structure of the fermionic ground state. Remarkably, the number of such transition lines increases with system size, hinting at an emergent continuum of topological boundary effects in the thermodynamic limit. Our findings highlight a novel mechanism where boundary conditions shape quantum geometric properties, offering new insights into finite size topology and the structure of low dimensional quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Three-local Charge Conservation Implies Quantum Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the existence of a local conserved charge supported by three neighboring sites, or its local version, Reshetikhin's condition, suffices to guarantee the existence of all higher conserved charges and hence the integrability of a quantum spin chain. This explains the 'coincidence' that no counterexample is known to Grabowski and Mathieu's long-standing conjecture despite the folklore that the conservation of local charges of order higher than 4 imposes additional constraints not implied by the conservation of the three-local charge.</description>
