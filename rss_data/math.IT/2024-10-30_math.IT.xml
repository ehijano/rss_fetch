      <title>Second-Order Analysis of CSMA Protocols for Age-of-Information Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a general framework to analyze and optimize age-of-information (AoI) in CSMA protocols for distributed uplink transmissions. The proposed framework combines two theoretical approaches. First, it employs second-order analysis that characterizes all random processes by their respective means and temporal variances and approximates AoI as a function of the mean and temporal variance of the packet delivery process. Second, it employs mean-field approximation to derive the mean and temporal variance of the packet delivery process for one node in the presence of interference from others. To demonstrate the utility of this framework, this paper applies it to the age-threshold ALOHA policy and identifies parameter settings that outperform those previously suggested as optimal in the original work that introduced this policy. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework provides precise AoI approximations and achieves significantly better performance, even in networks with a small number of users.</description>

      <title>Exploiting On-Orbit Characteristics for Joint Parameter and Channel Tracking in LEO Satellite Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-dynamic low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication (SATCOM) systems, frequent channel state information (CSI) acquisition consumes a large number of pilots, which is intolerable in resource-limited SATCOM systems. To tackle this problem, we propose to track the state-dependent parameters including Doppler shift and channel angles, by exploiting the physical and approximate on-orbit mobility characteristics for LEO satellite and ground users (GUs), respectively. As a prerequisite for tracking, we formulate the state evolution models for kinematic (state) parameters of both satellite and GUs, along with the measurement models that describe the relationship between the state-dependent parameters and states. Then the rough estimation of state-dependent parameters is initially conducted, which is used as the measurement results in the subsequent state tracking. Concurrently, the measurement error covariance is predicted based on the formulated Cram$\acute{\text{e}}$r-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Finally, with the extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based state tracking as the bridge, the Doppler shift and channel angles can be further updated and the CSI can also be acquired. Simulation results show that compared to the rough estimation methods, the proposed joint parameter and channel tracking (JPCT) algorithm performs much better in the estimation of state-dependent parameters. Moreover, as to the CSI acquisition, the proposed algorithm can utilize a shorter pilot sequence than benchmark methods under a given estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Partial Orders of Sequential Rate-Matched Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the partial order (POs) for both the binary erasure channel (BEC) and the binary memoryless symmetric channel (BMSC) under any sequential rate-matched polar codes. Firstly, we define the POs in the sense of rate-matched polar codes as a sequential block version. Furthermore, we demonstrate the persistence of POs after sequential rate matching in the BEC. Finally, leveraging the existing POs in the BEC, we obtain more POs in the BMSC under sequential rate matching. Simulations show that the PW sequence constructed from \beta-expansion can be improved by the tool of POs. Actually, any fixed reliable sequence in the mother polar codes can be improved by POs for rate matching.</description>

      <title>On Eigenvector Approximation of Diagonalizable Random Matrices with Random Perturbations: Properties and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the result on the top eigenvalue of the i.i.d.\ matrix with fixed perturbations by Tao to random perturbations. In particular, we consider a setup that $\mathbf{M}=\mathbf{W}+\lambda\mathbf{u}\mathbf{u}^*$ with $\mathbf{W}$ drawn from a Ginibre Orthogonal Ensemble and the perturbation $\mathbf{u}$ drawn uniformly from $\mathcal{S}^{d-1}$. We provide several asymptotic properties about the eigenvalues and the top eigenvector of the random matrix, which can not be obtained trivially from the deterministic perturbation case.
  We also apply our results to extend the work of Max Simchowitz, which provides an optimal lower bound for approximating the eigenspace of a symmetric matrix. We present a \textit{query complexity} lower bound for approximating the eigenvector of any asymmetric but diagonalizable matrix $\mathbf{M}$ corresponding to the largest eigenvalue. We show that for every $\operatorname{gap}\in (0,1/2]$ and large enough dimension $d$, there exists a random matrix $\mathbf{M}$ with $\operatorname{gap}(\mathbf{M})=\Omega(\operatorname{gap})$, such that if a matrix-vector query product algorithm can identity a vector $\hat{\mathbf{v}}$ which satisfies $\left\|\hat{\mathbf{v}}-\mathbf{v}_1(\mathbf{M}) \right\|_2^2\le \operatorname{const}\times \operatorname{gap}$, it needs at least $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log d}{\operatorname{gap}}\right)$ queries of matrix-vector products. In the inverse polynomial accuracy regime where $\epsilon \ge \frac{1}{\operatorname{poly}(d)}$, the complexity matches the upper bounds $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{\log(d/\epsilon)}{\operatorname{gap}}\right)$, which can be obtained via the power method. As far as we know, it is the first lower bound for computing the eigenvector of an asymmetric matrix, which is far more complicated than in the symmetric case.</description>

      <title>Extendibility limits quantum-secured communication and key distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Secret-key distillation from quantum states and channels is a central task of interest in quantum information theory, as it facilitates private communication over a quantum network. Here, we study the task of secret-key distillation from bipartite states and point-to-point quantum channels using local operations and one-way classical communication (one-way LOCC). We employ the resource theory of unextendible entanglement to study the transformation of a bipartite state under one-way LOCC, and we obtain several efficiently computable upper bounds on the number of secret bits that can be distilled from a bipartite state using one-way LOCC channels; these findings apply not only in the one-shot setting but also in some restricted asymptotic settings. We extend our formalism to private communication over a quantum channel assisted by forward classical communication. We obtain efficiently computable upper bounds on the one-shot forward-assisted private capacity of a channel, thus addressing a question in the theory of quantum-secured communication that has been open for some time now. Our formalism also provides upper bounds on the rate of private communication when using a large number of channels in such a way that the error in the transmitted private data decreases exponentially with the number of channel uses. Moreover, our bounds can be computed using semidefinite programs, thus providing a computationally feasible method to understand the limits of private communication over a quantum network.</description>

      <title>MultiTok: Variable-Length Tokenization for Efficient LLMs Adapted from LZW Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have drastically changed the prospects of AI by introducing technologies for more complex natural language processing. However, current methodologies to train such LLMs require extensive resources including but not limited to large amounts of data, expensive machinery, and lengthy training. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a new tokenization method inspired by universal Lempel-Ziv-Welch data compression that compresses repetitive phrases into multi-word tokens. With MultiTok as a new tokenizing tool, we show that language models are able to be trained notably more efficiently while offering a similar accuracy on more succinct and compressed training data. In fact, our results demonstrate that MultiTok achieves a comparable performance to the BERT standard as a tokenizer while also providing close to 2.5x faster training with more than 30% less training data.</description>

      <title>Minimum Entropy Coupling with Bottleneck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a novel lossy compression framework operating under logarithmic loss, designed to handle situations where the reconstruction distribution diverges from the source distribution. This framework is especially relevant for applications that require joint compression and retrieval, and in scenarios involving distributional shifts due to processing. We show that the proposed formulation extends the classical minimum entropy coupling framework by integrating a bottleneck, allowing for a controlled degree of stochasticity in the coupling. We explore the decomposition of the Minimum Entropy Coupling with Bottleneck (MEC-B) into two distinct optimization problems: Entropy-Bounded Information Maximization (EBIM) for the encoder, and Minimum Entropy Coupling (MEC) for the decoder. Through extensive analysis, we provide a greedy algorithm for EBIM with guaranteed performance, and characterize the optimal solution near functional mappings, yielding significant theoretical insights into the structural complexity of this problem. Furthermore, we illustrate the practical application of MEC-B through experiments in Markov Coding Games (MCGs) under rate limits. These games simulate a communication scenario within a Markov Decision Process, where an agent must transmit a compressed message from a sender to a receiver through its actions. Our experiments highlight the trade-offs between MDP rewards and receiver accuracy across various compression rates, showcasing the efficacy of our method compared to conventional compression baseline.</description>

      <title>Optimal Power Allocation and Time Sharing in Low Rank Multi-carrier Wi-Fi Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ever-evolving landscape of distributed wireless systems, e.g. multi-user AR/VR systems, demands high data rates (up to 500 Mbps per user) and low power consumption. With increasing number of participating users, uplink data transmission in the situation where the number of transmitter user antennas exceeds the number of access point (AP) antennas presents a low-rank channel problem. Current Wi-Fi standards using orthogonal multiple access (OMA) fail to address these requirements. Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based systems, while outperforming the OMA methods, still fall short of the requirement in low-rank channel uplink transmission, because they adhere to a single decoding order for successive interference cancelation (SIC). This paper proposes and develops a novel optimal power-subcarrier allocation algorithm to maximize the achieved data rates for this low rank channel scenario. Additionally, the proposed algorithm implements a novel time-sharing algorithm for simultaneously participating users, which adaptively varies the decoding orders to achieve higher data rates than any single decoding order. Extensive experimental validations demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves 39%, 28%, and 16% higher sum data rates than OMA, NOMA, and multi-carrier NOMA baselines respectively, under low-rank channel conditions, under varying SNR values. We further show that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the baselines with varying numbers of users or AP antennas, showing the effectiveness of the optimal power allocation and time-sharing.</description>

      <title>Scaling 6G Subscribers with Fewer BS Antennas using Multi-carrier NOMA in Fixed Wireless Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel power allocation and subcarrier optimization algorithm tailored for fixed wireless access (FWA) networks operating under low-rank channel conditions, where the number of subscriber antennas far exceeds those at the base station (BS). As FWA networks grow to support more users, traditional approaches like orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) struggle to maintain high data rates and energy efficiency due to the limited degrees of freedom in low-rank scenarios. Our proposed solution addresses this by combining optimal power-subcarrier allocation with an adaptive time-sharing algorithm that dynamically adjusts decoding orders to optimize performance across multiple users. The algorithm leverages a generalized decision feedback equalizer (GDFE) approach to effectively manage inter-symbol interference and crosstalk, leading to superior data rates and energy savings. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing OMA and NOMA baselines, particularly in low-rank conditions, with substantial gains in both data rate and energy efficiency. The findings highlight the potential of this method to meet the growing demand for scalable, high-performance FWA networks.</description>

      <title>$r$Age-$k$: Communication-Efficient Federated Learning Using Age Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative approach where multiple clients, coordinated by a parameter server (PS), train a unified machine-learning model. The approach, however, suffers from two key challenges: data heterogeneity and communication overhead. Data heterogeneity refers to inconsistencies in model training arising from heterogeneous data at different clients. Communication overhead arises from the large volumes of parameter updates exchanged between the PS and clients. Existing solutions typically address these challenges separately. This paper introduces a new communication-efficient algorithm that uses the age of information metric to simultaneously tackle both limitations of FL. We introduce age vectors at the PS, which keep track of how often the different model parameters are updated from the clients. The PS uses this to selectively request updates for specific gradient indices from each client. Further, the PS employs age vectors to identify clients with statistically similar data and group them into clusters. The PS combines the age vectors of the clustered clients to efficiently coordinate gradient index updates among clients within a cluster. We evaluate our approach using the MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets in highly non-i.i.d. settings. The experimental results show that our proposed method can expedite training, surpassing other communication-efficient strategies in efficiency.</description>

      <title>Reliability-Latency-Rate Tradeoff in Low-Latency Communications with Finite-Blocklength Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06769v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-latency communication plays an increasingly important role in delay-sensitive applications by ensuring the real-time information exchange. However, due to the constraint on the maximum instantaneous power, guaranteeing bounded latency is challenging. In this paper, we investigate the reliability-latency-rate tradeoff in low-latency communication systems with finite-blocklength coding (FBC). Specifically, we are interested in the fundamental tradeoff between error probability, delay-violation probability (DVP), and service rate. Based on the effective capacity (EC), we present the gain-conservation equations to characterize the reliability-latency-rate tradeoffs in low-latency communication systems. In particular, we investigate the low-latency transmissions over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and a Nakagami-$m$ fading channel. By defining the service rate gain, reliability gain, and real-time gain, we conduct an asymptotic analysis to reveal the fundamental reliability-latency-rate tradeoff of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications in the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime. To analytically evaluate and optimize the quality-of-service-constrained throughput of low-latency communication systems adopting FBC, an EC-approximation method is conceived to derive the closed-form expression of that throughput. Our results may offer some insights into the efficient scheduling of low-latency wireless communications, in which statistical latency and reliability metrics are crucial.</description>

      <title>Fully Decentralized Task Offloading in Multi-Access Edge Computing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of task offloading in multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems constituting $N$ devices assisted by an edge server (ES), where the devices can split task execution between a local processor and the ES. Since the local task execution and communication with the ES both consume power, each device must judiciously choose between the two. We model the problem as a large population non-cooperative game among the $N$ devices. Since computation of an equilibrium in this scenario is difficult due to the presence of a large number of devices, we employ the mean-field game framework to reduce the finite-agent game problem to a generic user's multi-objective optimization problem, with a coupled consistency condition. By leveraging the novel age of information (AoI) metric, we invoke techniques from stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) theory and study the tradeoffs between increasing information freshness and reducing power consumption. In numerical simulations, we validate that a higher load at the ES may lead devices to upload their task to the ES less often.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09746v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend coded distributed computing over finite fields to allow the number of workers to be larger than the field size. We give codes that work for fully general matrix multiplication and show that in this case we serendipitously have that all functions can be computed in a distributed fault-tolerant fashion over finite fields. This generalizes previous results on the topic. We prove that the associated codes achieve a recovery threshold similar to the ones for characteristic zero fields but now with a factor that is proportional to the genus of the underlying function field. In particular, we have that the recovery threshold of these codes is proportional to the classical complexity of matrix multiplication by a factor of at most the genus.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Relative Entropy Coding with Space Partitioning</title>

Abstract: Relative entropy coding (REC) algorithms encode a random sample following a target distribution $Q$, using a coding distribution $P$ shared between the sender and receiver. Sadly, general REC algorithms suffer from prohibitive encoding times, at least on the order of $2^{D_{\text{KL}}[Q||P]}$, and faster algorithms are limited to very specific settings. This work addresses this issue by introducing a REC scheme utilizing space partitioning to reduce runtime in practical scenarios. We provide theoretical analyses of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness with both toy examples and practical applications. Notably, our method successfully handles REC tasks with $D_{\text{KL}}[Q||P]$ about three times greater than what previous methods can manage, and reduces the bitrate by approximately 5-15% in VAE-based lossless compression on MNIST and INR-based lossy compression on CIFAR-10, compared to previous methods, significantly improving the practicality of REC for neural compression.</description>

      <title>Optimal Communication and Key Rate Region for Hierarchical Secure Aggregation with User Collusion</title>

Abstract: Secure aggregation is concerned with the task of securely uploading the inputs of multiple users to an aggregation server without letting the server know the inputs beyond their summation. It finds broad applications in distributed machine learning paradigms such as federated learning (FL) where multiple clients, each having access to a proprietary dataset, periodically upload their locally trained models (abstracted as inputs) to a parameter server which then generates an aggregate (e.g., averaged) model that is sent back to the clients as an initializing point for a new round of local training. To enhance the data privacy of the clients, secure aggregation protocols are developed using techniques from cryptography to ensure that the server infers no more information of the users' inputs beyond the desired aggregated input, even if the server can collude with some users. Although laying the ground for understanding the fundamental utility-security trade-off in secure aggregation, the simple star client-server architecture cannot capture more complex network architectures used in practical systems. Motivated by hierarchical federated learning, we investigate the secure aggregation problem in a $3$-layer hierarchical network consisting of clustered users connecting to an aggregation server through an intermediate layer of relays. Besides the conventional server security which requires that the server learns nothing beyond the desired sum of inputs, relay security is also imposed so that the relays infer nothing about the users' inputs and remain oblivious. For such a hierarchical secure aggregation (HSA) problem, we characterize the optimal multifaceted trade-off between communication (in terms of user-to-relay and relay-to-server communication rates) and secret key generation efficiency (in terms of individual key and source key rates).</description>
