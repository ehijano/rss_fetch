      <title>Mesh-Informed Reduced Order Models for Aneurysm Rupture Risk Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of the cardiovascular system needs to be accurately reproduced in order to promptly acknowledge health conditions; to this aim, advanced multifidelity and multiphysics numerical models are crucial. On one side, Full Order Models (FOMs) deliver accurate hemodynamic assessments, but their high computational demands hinder their real-time clinical application. In contrast, ROMs provide more efficient yet accurate solutions, essential for personalized healthcare and timely clinical decision-making. In this work, we explore the application of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) in cardiovascular medicine by integrating FOMs with ROMs for predicting the risk of aortic aneurysm growth and rupture. Wall Shear Stress (WSS) and the Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI), sampled at different growth stages of the abdominal aortic aneurysm, are predicted by means of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). GNNs exploit the natural graph structure of the mesh obtained by the Finite Volume (FV) discretization, taking into account the spatial local information, regardless of the dimension of the input graph. Our experimental validation framework yields promising results, confirming our method as a valid alternative that overcomes the curse of dimensionality.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the joint estimation of initial pressure and speed-of-sound distributions in photoacoustic computed tomography with consideration of canonical object constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) the accurate estimation of the initial pressure (IP) distribution generally requires knowledge of the object's heterogeneous speed-of-sound (SOS) distribution. Although hybrid imagers that combine ultrasound tomography with PACT have been proposed, in many current applications of PACT the SOS distribution remains unknown. Joint reconstruction (JR) of the IP and SOS distributions from PACT measurement data alone can address this issue. However, this joint estimation problem is ill-posed and corresponds to a non-convex optimization problem. While certain regularization strategies have been deployed, stabilizing the JR problem to yield accurate estimates of the IP and SOS distributions has remained an open challenge. To address this, the presented numerical studies explore the effectiveness of easy to implement canonical object constraints for stabilizing the JR problem. The considered constraints include support, bound, and total variation constraints, which are incorporated into an optimization-based method for JR. Computer-simulation studies that employ anatomically realistic numerical breast phantoms are conducted to evaluate the impact of these object constraints on JR accuracy. Additionally, the impact of certain data inconsistencies, such as caused by measurement noise and physics modeling mismatches, on the effectiveness of the object constraints is investigated. The results demonstrate, for the first time, that the incorporation of canonical object constraints in an optimization-based image reconstruction method holds significant potential for mitigating the ill-posed nature of the PACT JR problem.</description>

      <title>Enabling Clinical Use of Linear Energy Transfer in Proton Therapy for Head and Neck Cancer -- A Review of Implications for Treatment Planning and Adverse Events Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton therapy offers significant advantages due to its unique physical and biological properties, particularly the Bragg peak, enabling precise dose delivery to tumors while sparing healthy tissues. However, the clinical implementation is challenged by the oversimplification of the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) as a fixed value of 1.1, which does not account for the complex interplay between dose, linear energy transfer (LET), and biological endpoints. Lack of heterogeneity control or the understanding of the complex interplay may result in unexpected adverse events and suboptimal patient outcomes. On the other hand, expanding our knowledge of variable tumor RBE and LET optimization may provide a better management strategy for radioresistant tumors. This review examines recent advancements in LET calculation methods, including analytical models and Monte Carlo simulations. The integration of LET into plan evaluation is assessed to enhance plan quality control. LET-guided robust optimization demonstrates promise in minimizing high-LET exposure to organs at risk, thereby reducing the risk of adverse events. Dosimetric seed spot analysis is discussed to show its importance in revealing the true LET-related effect upon the adverse event initialization by finding the lesion origins and eliminating the confounding factors from the biological processes. Dose-LET volume histograms (DLVH) are discussed as effective tools for correlating physical dose and LET with clinical outcomes, enabling the derivation of clinically relevant dose-LET volume constraints without reliance on uncertain RBE models. Based on DLVH, the dose-LET volume constraints (DLVC)-guided robust optimization is introduced to upgrade conventional dose-volume constraints-based robust optimization, which optimizes the joint distribution of dose and LET simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Real-time cardiac cine MRI -- A comparison of a diffusion probabilistic model with alternative state-of-the-art image reconstruction techniques for undersampled spiral acquisitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ECG-gated cine imaging in breath-hold enables high-quality diagnostics in most patients, arrhythmia and inability to hold breath, however, can severely corrupt outcomes. Real-time cardiac MRI in free-breathing leverages robust and faster investigations regardless of these confounding factors. With the need for sufficient acceleration, adequate reconstruction methods, which transfer data into high quality images, are required. Undersampled spiral real-time acquisitions in free-breathing were conducted in a study with 16 healthy volunteers and 5 patients. Image reconstructions were performed using a novel score-based diffusion model, as well as a variational network and different compressed sensing approaches. The techniques were compared by means of an expert reader study, by calculating scalar metrics and difference images with respect to a segmented reference, and by a Bland-Altman analysis of cardiac functional parameters. In participants with irregular RR-cycles, spiral real-time acquisitions showed superior image quality with respect to the clinical reference standard. Reconstructions using the diffusion model, the variational network and l1-wavelets offered an overall comparable image quality, however sharpness was slightly increased by the diffusion approach. While slightly larger ejection fractions for the real-time acquisitions were exhibited with a bias of 1.6% for healthy subjects, differences in the data acquisition procedure resulted in uncertainties of 7.4%. The proposed real-time technique enables free-breathing acquisitions of spatio-temporal images with high-quality, covering the entire heart in less than one minute. Evaluation of the ejection fractions using the segmented reference can be significantly corrupted due to arrhythmias and averaging effects. Prolonged inference times of the diffusion model represent the main obstacle to overcome for clinical translation.</description>

      <title>Laser-FLASH: radiobiology at high dose, ultra-high dose-rate, single pulse laser-driven proton source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-driven proton sources have long been developed with an eye on their potential for medical application to radiation therapy. These sources are compact, versatile, and show peculiar characteristics such as extreme instantaneous dose rates, short duration and broad energy spectrum. Typical temporal modality of laser-driven irradiation, the so-called fast-fractionation, results from the composition of multiple, temporally separated, ultra-short dose fractions. In this paper we present the use of a high-energy laser system for delivering the target dose in a single nanosecond pulse, for ultra-fast irradiation of biological samples. A transport line composed by two permanent magnet quadrupoles and a scattering system is used to improve the dose profile and to control the delivered dose-per-pulse. A single-shot dosimetry protocol for the broad-spectrum proton source using Monte Carlo simulations was developed. Doses as high as 20Gy could be delivered in a single shot, lasting less than 10ns over a 1.0cm diameter sample holder, at a dose-rate exceeding 10^9 Gy/s. Exploratory application of extreme laser-driven irradiation conditions, falling within the FLASH irradiation protocol, are presented for in vitro and in vivo irradiation are presented. A reduction of radiation-induced oxidative stress in-vitro and radiation-induced developmental damage in vivo were observed, whereas anti-tumoral efficacy was confirmed by cell survival assay.</description>

      <title>Rosette spectroscopic imaging for whole-brain metabolite mapping at 7T: acceleration potential and reproducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole-brain proton magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (1H-MRSI) is a non-invasive technique for assessing neurochemical distribution in the brain, offering valuable insights into brain functions and neural diseases. It greatly benefits from the improved SNR at ultrahigh field strengths ($\geq$7T). However, 1H-MRSI still faces several challenges, such as long acquisition time and severe signal contaminations from water and lipids. In this study, 2D and 3D short TR/TE 1H-FID-MRSI sequences using rosette trajectories were developed with spatial resolutions of 4.48$\times$4.48 mm$^2$ and 4.48$\times$4.48$\times$4.50 mm$^3$, respectively. Water signals were suppressed using an optimized Five-variable-Angle-gaussian-pulses-with-ShorT-total-duration of 76 ms (FAST) water suppression scheme, and lipid signals were removed using the L2 regularization method. Metabolic maps of major 1H metabolites were obtained within 5:40 min with 16 averages and 1 average for the 2D and 3D acquisitions, respectively. Excellent inter-session reproducibility was shown, with the coefficients of variance (CV) being lower than 6% for N-Acetyle-L-aspartic acid (NAA), Glutamate (Glu), Choline Chloride and glycerophosphocholine (tCho), Creatine and Phosphocreatine (tCr), and Glycine and Myo-inositol (Gly+Ins). To explore the potential of further accelerating the acquisition, compressed sensing was applied retrospectively to the 3D datasets. The structural similarity index (SSIM) remained above 0.85 and 0.8 until $R = 2$ and $R = 3$ for the metabolite maps of Glu, NAA, tCr, and tCho, indicating the possibility for further reduction of acquisition time to around 2min.</description>

      <title>A Toolbox for Optimization of Reconstruction and Post-processing Pipelines in In Vivo $^{31}$P MR Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: X-nuclei imaging (e.g. 31P MRI) suffers low SNR due to lower gyromagnetic ratios and tissue concentrations than 1H MRI. Enhancing SNR requires high fields, advanced coils, optimized sequences, and sophisticated reconstruction methods. An optimized pipeline is essential for maximizing SNR in X-nuclei imaging. Purpose: To develop a toolbox of reconstruction and processing methods for fast 31P MR imaging, evaluating optimal pipelines for two data types: 31P-GRE and bSSFP-like MRF imaging. Methods: The toolbox includes coil combination (adaptive and whitened-SVD), k-space filtering, reconstruction (Kaiser-Bessel regridding with FFT and NUFFT), and denoising (compressed sensing and MP-PCA). 31P MR datasets were acquired at 7T using spiral encoding with a double-tuned birdcage coil and a 32-channel phased array. GRE parameters: readout 18.62ms, flip angle 59deg, TR 5400ms, TE 0.3ms. MRF used a bSSFP-like scheme: readout 9.12ms, TR 19.8ms, TE 0.3ms. Results: For GRE data, adaptive coil combination with Kaiser-Bessel regridding (AC-KB) achieved highest mean SNRs: 38 (phantom) and 3.4 (in vivo), outperforming others. For MRF data, whitened-SVD with Kaiser-Bessel regridding yielded an SNR of 18, surpassing AC-KB's 16. MP-PCA denoised GRE effectively; compressed sensing suited MRF data. Conclusion: We demonstrated a toolbox for optimizing fast 31P MR imaging pipelines. Optimal methods depend on acquisition and data. Kaiser-Bessel regridding outperforms NUFFT. Adaptive coil combination and MP-PCA denoising are preferred for GRE data; whitened-SVD and compressed sensing are superior for MRF data. Careful selection of processing methods is crucial, as conventional 1H MRI techniques may not suffice. The toolbox facilitates future investigation for other X-nuclei datasets.</description>

      <title>NoSENSE: Learned unrolled cardiac MRI reconstruction without explicit sensitivity maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel learned image reconstruction method for accelerated cardiac MRI with multiple receiver coils based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and algorithm unrolling. In contrast to many existing learned MR image reconstruction techniques that necessitate coil-sensitivity map (CSM) estimation as a distinct network component, our proposed approach avoids explicit CSM estimation. Instead, it implicitly captures and learns to exploit the inter-coil relationships of the images. Our method consists of a series of novel learned image and k-space blocks with shared latent information and adaptation to the acquisition parameters by feature-wise modulation (FiLM), as well as coil-wise data-consistency (DC) blocks.
  Our method achieved PSNR values of 34.89 and 35.56 and SSIM values of 0.920 and 0.942 in the cine track and mapping track validation leaderboard of the MICCAI STACOM CMRxRecon Challenge, respectively, ranking 4th among different teams at the time of writing.
