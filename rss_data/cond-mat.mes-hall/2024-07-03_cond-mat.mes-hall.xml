      <title>Crystal-field effects in the formation of Wigner-molecule supercrystals in moir\'e TMD superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For moir\'e bilayer TMD superlattices, full-configuration-interaction (FCI) calculations are presented that take into account both the intra-moir\'e-quantum-dot (MQD) charge-carrier Coulombic interactions, as well as the crystal-field effect from the surrounding moir\'e pockets (inter-moir\'e-QD interactions). Such FCI calculations enable an effective computational embedding strategy and allow for a complete interpretation of the counterintuitive experimental observations reported recently in the context of moir\'e TMD superlattices at integer fillings $\nu=2$ and 4. Two novel states of matter are reported: (i) a genuinely quantum-mechanical supercrystal of {\it sliding\/} Wigner molecules (WMs) for unstrained moir\'e TMD materials (when the crystal field is commensurate with the trilobal symmetry of the confining potential in each embedded MQD) and (ii) a supercrystal of {\it pinned\/} Wigner molecules when strain is involved and the crystal field is incommensurate with the trilobal symmetry of the confining potential in each embedded MQD. The case of $\nu=3$ is an exception, in that both unstrained and strained cases produce a supercrystal of pinned WMs, which is due to the congruence of intrinsic (that of the WM) and external (that of the confining potential of the MQD) $C_3$ point-group symmetries. Furthermore, it is shown that the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approach fails to describe the supercrystal of sliding WMs in the unstrained case, providing a qualitative agreement only in the case of a supercrystal of pinned WMs</description>

      <title>Supercell Wannier functions and faithful low-energy model for Bernal bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a minimal low-energy model for Bernal bilayer graphene and related rhombohedral graphene multilayers at low electronic densities by constructing Wannier orbitals defined in real-space supercells of the original primitive cell. Starting from an ab-initio electronic structure theory comprising the atomic carbon $p_z$-orbitals, momentum locality of the Fermi surface pockets around $K,K'$ is circumvented by backfolding the $\pi$-bands to the concomitant mini-Brillouin zone of the supercell, reminiscent of their (twisted) moir\'e counterparts. The supercell Wannier functions reproduce the spectral weight and Berry curvature of the microscopic model and offer an intuitive real-space picture of the emergent physics at low electronic densities being shaped by flavor-polarized wave packets with mesoscopic extent. By projecting an orbital-resolved, dual-gated Coulomb interaction to the effective Wannier basis, we find that the low-energy physics of Bernal bilayer graphene is governed by weak electron-electron interactions. Our study bridges between existing continuum theories and ab-initio studies of small Fermi pocket systems like rhombohedral graphene stacks by providing a symmetric lattice description of their low-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Thouless pumping in a driven-dissipative Kerr resonator array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thouless pumping is an emblematic manifestation of topology in physics, referring to the ability to induce a quantized transport of charge across a system by simply varying one of its parameters periodically in time. The original concept of Thouless pumping involves a non-interacting system, and has been implemented in several platforms. One current challenge in the field is to extend this concept to interacting systems. In this article, we propose a Thouless pump that solely relies on nonlinear physics, within a chain of coupled Kerr resonators. Leveraging the driven-dissipative nature of the system, we modulate in space and time the onsite Kerr interaction energies, and generate 1+1-dimensional topological bands in the Bogoliubov spectrum of excitations. These bands present the same topology as the ones obtained within the Harper-Hofstadter framework, and the Wannier states associated to each band experience a net displacement and show quantized transport according to the bands Chern numbers. Remarkably, we find driving configurations leading to band inversion, revealing an interaction-induced topological transition. Our numerical simulations are performed using realistic parameters inspired from exciton polaritons, which form a platform of choice for investigating driven topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Contact solitons as spin pistons in one-dimensional ferromagnetic channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic channels subject to spin injection have been theoretically shown to sustain dissipative exchange flows (DEFs). In the strong injection regime, a soliton is stabilized at the injection site, which has been termed a contact soliton DEF or CS-DEF. Here, we investigate the modulation of CS-DEFs as a mechanism to inject magnons into a DEF. By varying the injection current, the parameters connecting the soliton with the DEF via a boundary layer are varied. These lead to a modification in the DEF which is interpreted as a spin piston. The injected magnons follow the expected dispersion relation of DEFs, akin to the Bogoliubov - de Gennes dispersion relation. This work demonstrates that changes in the injected current can pumping magnons along a ferromagnetic channel via dissipative exchange flows.</description>

      <title>Atomistic Multiscale Modeling of Colloidal Plasmonic Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel fully atomistic multiscale classical approach to model the optical response of solvated real-size plasmonic nanoparticles (NPs) is presented. The model is based on the coupling of the Frequency Dependent Fluctuating Charges and Fluctuating Dipoles ($\omega$FQF$\mu$), specifically designed to describe plasmonic substrates, and the polarizable Fluctuating Charges (FQ) classical force field to model the solvating environment. The resulting $\omega$FQF$\mu$/FQ approach accounts for the interactions between the radiation and the NP, as well as with the surrounding solvent molecules, by incorporating mutual interactions between the plasmonic substrate and solvent. $\omega$FQF$\mu$/FQ is validated against reference TD-DFTB/FQ calculations, demonstrating remarkable accuracy, particularly in reproducing plasmon resonance frequency shifts for structures below the quantum-size limit. The flexibility and reliability of the approach are also demonstrated by simulating the optical response of homogeneous and bimetallic NPs dissolved in pure solvents and solvent mixtures.</description>

      <title>Inducing superconductivity in quantum anomalous Hall regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacing the quantum anomalous Hall insulator with a conventional superconductor is known to be a promising manner for realizing a topological superconductor, which has been continuously pursued for years. Such a proximity route depends to a great extent on the control of the delicate interfacial coupling of the two constituents. However, a recent experiment reported the failure to reproduce such a topological superconductor, which is ascribed to the negligence of the electrical short by the superconductor in the theoretical proposal. Here, we reproduce this topological superconductor with attention to the interface control. The resulted conductance matrix under a wide magnetic field range agrees with the fingerprint of this topological superconductor. This allows us to develop a phase diagram that unveils three regions parameterized by various coupling limits, which not only supports the feasibility to fabricate the topological superconductor by proximity but also fully explains the origin of the previous debate. The present work provides a comprehensible guide on fabricating the topological superconductor.</description>

      <title>Effect of nonlinear magnon interactions on the stochastic magnetization switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Telegraph noise caused by frequent switching of the magnetization in small magnetic devices has become a useful resource for probabilistic computing. Conventional theories have been based on a linearization of the fluctuations at the extrema of the magnetic free energy. We show theoretically that the non-linearities, specifically four-magnon scatterings, reduce the equilibrium fluctuation amplitude of the magnetization as well as the switching frequencies between local minima via the decay of the homogeneous Kittel mode into two spin waves with opposite momenta. Selectively suppressing the effective temperature of the finite-k spin waves, or reducing the radius of a thin magnetic disk enhance the switching frequency and improve performance of magnetic tunnel junctions in probabilistic computing applications.</description>

      <title>Thermal transport of flexural phonons in a rectangular wire</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum thermal transport of elastic excitations through a two-dimensional elastic waveguide between two thermal reservoirs. We solve the classical Kirchhoff-Love equation for rectangular wires and explore the dispersion relation for both the symmetric and antisymmetric solutions. Then, we study the phonon transport of these modes within the second quantization framework by analyzing the mean quadratic displacement, from which the energy density current, the temperature field, and conductance are determined. We identify the relevant modes contributing to thermal transport and explore the average temperature difference to reach the high-temperature limit. We expect our results to pave the way for understanding phonon-mediated thermal transport in two-dimensional mesoscopic quantum devices.</description>

      <title>GW effects on the topology of type-II Dirac cones in NiTe$_2$, PtSe$_2$ and PtTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body correlations are known to be responsible for a broad range of fascinating physical phenomena, introducing corrections that appear elusive at the mean-field level. An example of this is the Lifshitz transition that occurs as the Fermi surface topology changes when {\it e.g.} Coulomb interaction effects break into the picture. In particular, the Fermi velocity renormalization can lead a type-II Weyl semimetal at mean-field level to become a trivial or a type-I Dirac material when correlations are accounted for, which is far from being obvious. In this work we scrutinize the band structure of NiTe$_2$, a material that features a type-II Dirac point near the Fermi level within the mean-field approach. Including GW-level correlations, our findings showcase anisotropic corrections on the Dirac carrier velocity exceeding $100 \, \%$ enhancements, underscoring the nuanced influence of electronic interactions in the band structure. We also consider type-II Dirac crossings in PtSe$_2$ and PtTe$_2$ and observe that including many-body effects via GW the band topology changes, featuring trivial topology and type-I Dirac crossings, respectively. Our findings highlights the necessity to evaluate the many-body effects on non-trivial bands, contributing essential insights to the broader exploration of many-body correlation effects in type-II Dirac points of condensed-matter systems.</description>

      <title>Coulomb Hall drag induced by electron-electron skew scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of spin-orbit interaction on electron-electron scattering in the Coulomb drag setup. We study a setup made of a time-reversal-symmetry broken Weyl-semimetal (WSM) layer and a normal metal layer. The interlayer drag force consists of two components. The first one is conventional and it is parallel to the relative electronic boost velocity between the layers. This part of the drag tends to equilibrate the momentum distribution in the two layers, analogous to shear viscosity in hydrodynamics. In the WSM layer, the shift of the Fermi surface is not parallel to the electric field, due to skew scattering in the WSM. This induces a Hall current in the normal metal via the conventional component of the drag force. The second component of the drag force is perpendicular to the boost velocity in the Weyl semimetal and arises from interlayer e-e skew scattering, which results from two types of processes. The first process is an interference between electron-electron and electron-disorder scattering. The second process is due to the side jumps in electron-electron collisions in an external electric field. Both the parallel and perpendicular components of the drag are important for the anomalous Hall drag conductivity. On the other hand, for the Hall drag resistivity, the contribution from the parallel friction is partially cancelled in a broad temperature regime. This work provides insight into the microscopic mechanisms of Hall-like friction in electronic fluids.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of individual nanoparticles in cylindrical diatom frustule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diatoms are characterised by silica cell walls (frustules), which have highly ordered micro-/nano-structures. As the synthesis of such structures remains challenging, diatom frustules offer a promissing alternative to conventional porous particles in micro-/nano-engineering. In particular, for applications in drag deliverly systems, biosensors, and filters, an understanding of particle motion inside diatoms is of great impotance. In this study, we investigated nanoparticle (NP) motions inside diatom frustules using the single particle tracking (SPT) method. For these measruements, the diameter of the NP was about one-tenth smaller than that of the frustule. Inside the frustule, the diffusion motions of the NPs were suppressed, but this suppression was weakened near the exit of the frustule. Moreover, diffusion anisotropy between the axial and radial directions of the frustule was observed. This anisotropy is difficult to detect with ensemble methods; thus, the SPT method is a powerful approach for investigating NP motions in frustules.</description>

      <title>Integrability and dark states of the XX spin-1 central spin model in a transverse field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently shown that, for central spin-1/2 and central spin-1, the XX central spin model is integrable in the presence of a magnetic field oriented perpendicular to the XY plane in which the coupling exists. In the spin-1/2 case, it was also shown, through an appropriate limit of the non-skew symmetric XXZ Richardson-Gaudin models, that it remained integrable even when the magnetic field is tilted to contain an in-plane component. Although the model has not yet been shown to explicitly belong to a known class of Richardson- Gaudin models, we show, in this work, that the spin-1 case also remains integrable in a titled magnetic field. We do so by writing explicitly the complete set of conserved charges, then showing that these operators obey polynomial relations. It is finally demonstrated numerically that dark states, for which the central spin is completely unentangled with the bath, can emerge at strong enough coupling just as they do in the central spin-1/2 model in an arbitrarily oriented magnetic field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of band connectivity is a fundamental problem in condensed matter physics. Here, we develop a new method for analyzing band connectivity, which completely solves the outstanding questions of the reducibility and decomposition of band complexes. By translating the symmetry conditions into a set of band balance equations, we show that all possible band structure solutions can be described by a positive affine monoid structure, which has a unique minimal set of generators, called Hilbert basis. We show that Hilbert basis completely determine whether a band complex is reducible and how it can be decomposed. The band complexes corresponding to Hilbert basis vectors, termed as Hilbert band complexes (HBCs), can be regarded as elementary building blocks of band structures. We develop algorithms to construct HBCs, analyze their graph features, and merge them into large complexes. We find some interesting examples, such as HBCs corresponding to complete bipartite graphs, and complexes which can grow without bound by successively merging a HBC.</description>

      <title>Strong Charge-Photon Coupling in Planar Germanium Enabled by Granular Aluminium Superinductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High kinetic inductance superconductors are gaining increasing interest for the realisation of qubits, amplifiers and detectors. Moreover, thanks to their high impedance, quantum buses made of such materials enable large zero-point fluctuations of the voltage, boosting the coupling rates to spin and charge qubits. However, fully exploiting the potential of disordered or granular superconductors is challenging, as their inductance and, therefore, impedance at high values are difficult to control. Here we have integrated a granular aluminium resonator, having a characteristic impedance exceeding the resistance quantum, with a germanium double quantum dot and demonstrate strong charge-photon coupling with a rate of $g_\text{c}/2\pi= (566 \pm 2)$ MHz. This was achieved due to the realisation of a wireless ohmmeter, which allows \emph{in situ} measurements during film deposition and, therefore, control of the kinetic inductance of granular aluminium films. Reproducible fabrication of circuits with impedances (inductances) exceeding 13 k$\Omega$ (1 nH per square) is now possible. This broadly applicable method opens the path for novel qubits and high-fidelity, long-distance two-qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Theory of spin and orbital charge conversion at the surface states of Bi_{1-x}Sb_x topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological insulators are quantum materials involving Time-reversal protected surface states(TSS) making them appealing candidates for the design of next generation of highly efficient spintronic devices. The very recent observation of large transient spin-charge conversion (SCC) and subsequent powerful THz emission from Co|Bi_{1-x}Sb_x bilayers clearly demonstrates such potentiality and feasibility for the near future. Amongst the exotic properties appearing in and at the surface of such quantum materials, spin-momentum locking (SML) and Rashba-Edelstein effects remain as key ingredients to effectively convert the spin degree of freedom into a charge or a voltage signal. In this work, we extend our analyses to the quantification of orbital momentum-locking and related orbital charge conversion effects in Bi.85Sb.15 via orbital Rashba-Edelstein effects. In that sense, we will provide some clear theoretical and numerical insights implemented by multi-orbital and multi-layered tight-binding methods (TB) to clarify our recent experimental results obtained by THz-TDS spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Simulating electron-vibron energy transfer with quantum dots and resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gateable semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) provide a versatile platform for analog quantum simulations of electronic many-body systems. In particular, QD arrays offer a natural representation of the interacting $\pi$-electron system of small hydrocarbons. Here we investigate the prospects for extending QD simulators to encompass also the nuclear degrees of freedom. We represent the molecular vibrational modes by single-mode microwave resonators coupled capacitively to the QDs and study the gate-tunable energy transfer from a voltage-biased triple quantum dot (TQD) system to a single damped resonator mode. We determine the QD population inversions, the corresponding charge and energy currents as well as the resonator photon number, using Lindblad master equations and lowest-order perturbation theory within Keldysh Green function formalism. Along the way, we discuss the merits and shortcomings of the two methods.A central result is the interrelation of a pronounced minimum in the charge current with a maximum in energy transfer, arising from a gate-tunable interference effect in the molecular orbitals of the TQD electron system.</description>

      <title>Impact of planar defects on the reversal time of single magnetic domain nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experimental investigations of individual magnetic nanoparticles reveal a diverse range of magnetic relaxation times which cannot be explained by considering their size, shape, and surface anisotropy, suggesting other factors associated with the internal microstructure of the particles are at play. In this letter, we apply Langer's theory of thermal activation to single magnetic domain fcc Co nanoparticles, whose experimental microstructures are characterized by planar defects, and derive an analytic expression for the relaxation time. The obtained Arrhenius exponential and its prefactor, which is often assumed to be a constant, are here found to both depend exponentially on system size and the number of defects. Together they provide a quantitative prediction of the experimental findings, and more generally highlight the importance of structural defects when considering magnetic stability.</description>

      <title>Microscopic theory for electron-phonon coupling in twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene -- whether phonon-driven or electron-driven -- remains unresolved. The answer to this question is hindered by the absence of a quantitative and efficient model for electron-phonon coupling (EPC). In this work, we develop a first-principles-based microscopic theory to calculate EPC in twisted bilayer graphene for arbitrary twist angles without needing a periodic moir\'e supercell. We adopt a momentum-space model for the electronic and phonon structures and quantify the EPC using generalized Eliashberg-McMillan theory for superconductivity without an adiabatic approximation. Using this framework, we find that the EPC is significantly enhanced near the magic angle, and drops abruptly for larger twist angles. We show that the EPC strength of a phonon corresponds to the modification of the moir\'e potential. In particular, we identify several $\Gamma$-phonon branches that contribute most significantly to the EPC, including one layer breathing mode, three layer shearing modes, and one chiral mode. These phonons should be experimentally detectable via Raman spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry Probed by Chiral Excitonic Optical Response of Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically derive the sum rule for the negative first moment of the absorptive optical conductivity with excitonic effects and establish its connection to the quantum weight $K$ and Chern number $C$ of the ground state. Applying this framework, we investigate the excitonic optical response of the Chern insulator at hole filling factor $\nu=1$ in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$. A single chiral exciton state, which selectively absorbs circularly polarized light of a specific handedness, dominates the optical sum rule. The chiral exciton state comprises two types of interlayer electron-hole transitions, which cancel out the total out-of-plane dipole moment. The absorption spectrum shows nearly perfect magnetic circular dichroism, which can be attributed to the nearly saturated bound $K \ge |C|$ of the Chern insulator under study. Our work illustrates the potential of using excitonic optical responses to probe quantum geometry encoded by $K$ and $C$.</description>

      <title>When Could Abelian Fractional Topological Insulators Exist in Twisted MoTe$_2$ (and Other Systems)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using comprehensive exact diagonalization calculations on $\theta \approx 3.7 ^{\circ}$ twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ ($t$MoTe$_2$), as well as idealized Landau level models also relevant for lower $\theta$, we extract general principles for engineering fractional topological insulators (FTIs) in realistic situations. First, in a Landau level setup at $\nu=1/3+1/3$, we investigate what features of the interaction destroy an FTI. For both pseudopotential interactions and realistic screened Coulomb interactions, we find that sufficient suppression of the short-range repulsion is needed for stabilizing an FTI. We then study $\theta \approx 3.7 ^{\circ}$ $t$MoTe$_2$ with realistic band-mixing and anisotropic non-local dielectric screening. Our finite-size calculations only find an FTI phase at $\nu=-4/3$ in the presence of a significant additional short-range attraction $g$ that acts to counter the Coulomb repulsion at short distances. We discuss how further finite-size drifts, dielectric engineering, Landau level character, and band-mixing effects may reduce the required value of $g$ closer towards the experimentally relevant conditions of $t$MoTe$_2$. Projective calculations into the $n=1$ Landau level, which resembles the second valence band of $\theta\simeq 2.1^\circ$ $t$MoTe$_2$, do not yield FTIs for any $g$, suggesting that FTIs at low-angle $t$MoTe$_2$ for $\nu=-8/3$ and $-10/3$ may be unlikely. While our study highlights the challenges, at least for the fillings considered, to obtaining an FTI with transport plateaus, even in large-angle $t$MoTe$_2$ where fractional Chern insulators are experimentally established, we also provide potential sample-engineering routes to improve the stability of FTI phases.</description>

      <title>Constraints on real space representations of Chern bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Chern band is characterized by a Wannier obstruction indicating the absence of a basis of complete, orthogonal, and exponentially-localized states. Here, we study the properties of real space bases of a Chern band obtained by relaxing either exponential localization or orthogonality and completeness. This yields two distinct real space representations of a band with Chern number $C$: (i) a basis of complete orthogonal Wannier states which decay as power-law and (ii) a basis of exponentially-localized overcomplete non-orthogonal coherent states. For (i), we show that the power-law tail only depends on the Chern number and provide an explicit gauge choice leading to the universal asymptotic $w({\boldsymbol r}) \approx \frac{C e^{-i C \varphi_{\boldsymbol r}}}{2\pi |{\boldsymbol r}|^2}$ up to a normalized Bloch-periodic spinor. For (ii), we prove a rigorous lower bound on the spatial spread that can always be saturated for ideal bands. We provide an explicit construction of the maximally localized coherent state by mapping the problem to a dual Landau level problem where the Berry curvature and trace of the quantum metric take the roles of an effective magnetic field and scalar potential, respectively. Our coherent state result rigorously bounds the spatial spread of any localized state constructed as a linear superposition of wavefunctions within the Chern band. Remarkably, we find that such bound does not generically scale with the Chern number and provide an explicit example of an exponentially localized state in a Chern $C$ band whose size does not increase with $|C|$. Our results show that band topology can be encoded in a real space description and set the stage for a systematic study of interaction effects in topological bands in real space.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic uniform 2D moir\'e superlattices with controllable angles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Moir\'e superlattices, engineered through precise stacking of van der Waals (vdW) layers, hold immense promise for exploring strongly correlated and topological phenomena. However, these applications have been held back by the common preparation method: tear-and-stack of Scotch tape exfoliated monolayers. It has low efficiency and reproducibility, along with challenges of twist angle inhomogeneity, interfacial contamination, micrometer sizes, and a tendency to untwist at elevated temperatures. Here we report an effective strategy to construct highly consistent vdW moir\'e structures with high production throughput, near-unity yield, pristine interfaces, precisely controlled twist angles, and macroscopic scale (up to centimeters) with enhanced thermal stability. We further demonstrate the versatility across various vdW materials including transition metal dichalcogenides, graphene, and hBN. The expansive size and high quality of moir\'e structures enables high-resolution mapping of the reciprocal space back-folded lattices and moir\'e mini band structures with low energy electron diffraction (LEED) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This technique will have broad applications in both fundamental studies and mass production of twistronic devices.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Short-Range Order in GeSn Grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy and Chemical Vapor Deposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic short-range order (SRO) in direct-bandgap GeSn for infrared photonics has recently attracted attention due to its notable impact on band structures. However, the SRO in GeSn thin films grown by different methods have hardly been compared. This paper compares SRO in GeSn thin films of similar compositions grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) using atom probe tomography. An $\sim$15% stronger preference for Sn-Sn 1$^{st}$ nearest neighbor (1NN) is observed in MBE GeSn than CVD GeSn for both thin film and quantum well samples with Sn composition ranging from 7 to 20%. Interestingly, samples grown by different deposition tools under the same method (either MBE or CVD) showed remarkable consistency in Sn-Sn 1NN SRO, while MBE vs. CVD showed clear differences. Supported by theoretical modeling, we consider that this difference in SRO originates from the impact of surface termination, where MBE surfaces are exposed to ultrahigh vacuum while CVD surfaces are terminated by H to a good extent. This finding not only suggests engineering surface termination or surfactants during the growth as a potential approach to control SRO in GeSn, but also provides insight into the underlying reasons for very different growth temperature between MBE and CVD that directly impact the strain relaxation behavior.</description>

      <title>Multiple topological transitions and spectral singularities in non-Hermitian Floquet systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between Floquet driving and non-Hermitian gain/loss could give rise to intriguing phenomena including topological funneling of light, edge-state delocalization, anomalous topological transitions and Floquet non-Hermitian skin effects. In this work, we uncover two unique phenomena in Floquet systems caused by gain and loss. First, multiple topological transitions from anomalous Floquet second-order topological insulators to anomalous Floquet first-order topological insulators and then to normal insulators can be induced by gain and loss. Interestingly, the resulting anomalous Floquet insulators further carry hybrid skin-topological boundary modes, which could either be fully localized or localized to different edges at different time slices and traversing along all edges in a single driving period. The topological phase transitions are also shown to be detectable through studies of transmission properties in the setting of coupled ring resonators. Second, gain and loss are found to induce singularities in the Floquet spectral, around which anomalous transmissions at flat quasienergy bands are predicted. These discoveries not only enhanced our understanding of topological matter and phase transitions in driven non-Hermitian systems, but also promoted their experimental realizations in optical and acoustic settings.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced dissipative quantum phase transition in a head-to-tail atomic Josephson junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a dissipative phase transition in a head-to-tail Bose Josephson junction. The quantum phase transition has the same origin as the one in a resistively shunted Josephson junction, but the intrinsic momentum coupling between the Josephson mode and the bath modes enables us to observe the dissipative phase transition without any synthetic dissipation. We show that the inter-atomic interaction strength plays the role of the damping parameter. Consequently, in contrast to a resistively shunted Josephson circuit, the Bose Josephson junction can exhibit an insulating phase in a wider parameter region by increasing the repulsive interaction strength, which is robust against nonperturbative effects. We argue that tight transverse confinement of the quasi-one-dimensional atomic gas allows us to reach the insulating phase.</description>

      <title>Wideband Coherent Microwave Conversion via Magnon Nonlinearity in Hybrid Quantum System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Frequency conversion is a widely realized physical process in nonlinear systems of optics and electronics. As an emerging nonlinear platform, spintronic devices have the potential to achieve stronger frequency conversion. Here, we demonstrated a microwave frequency conversion method in a hybrid quantum system, integrating nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond with magnetic thin film CoFeB. We achieve a conversion bandwidth ranging from 0.1 to 12GHz, presenting an up to $\mathrm{25^{th}}$ order frequency conversion and further display the application of this method for frequency detection and qubits coherent control. Distinct from traditional frequency conversion techniques based on nonlinear electric response, our approach employs nonlinear magnetic response in spintronic devices. The nonlinearity, originating from the symmetry breaking such as domain walls in magnetic films, presents that our method can be adapted to hybrid systems of other spintronic devices and spin qubits, expanding the application scope of spintronic devices and providing a promising on-chip platform for coupling quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Violation of the Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law in a 2D topological insulator due to Majorana bound states (MBS) is studied via the Lorenz ratio in the single-particle picture. We study the scaling of the Lorenz ratio in the presence and absence of MBS with inelastic scattering modeled using a Buttiker voltage-temperature probe. We compare our results with that seen in a quantum dot junction in the Luttinger liquid picture operating in the topological Kondo regime. We explore the scaling of the Lorentz ratio in our setup when either inelastic scattering occurs with both phase and momentum relaxation or via phase relaxation alone. This scaling differs from that predicted by the Luttinger liquid picture for both uncoupled and coupled Majorana bound states and depends on the nature of inelastic scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments have realized steady-state electrical injection of interlayer excitons in electron-hole bilayers subject to a large bias voltage. In the ideal case in which interlayer tunneling is negligibly weak, the system is in quasi-equilibrium with a reduced effective band gap. Interlayer tunneling introduces a current and drives the system out of equilibrium. In this work we derive a nonequilibrium field theory description of interlayer excitons in biased electron-hole bilayers. In the large bias limit, we find that p-wave interlayer tunneling reduces the effective band gap and increases the effective temperature for intervalley excitons. We discuss possible experimental implications for InAs/GaSb quantum wells and transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers.</description>

      <title>Dyakonov-Shur instability of electronic fluid: Spectral effect of weak magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study numerically and analytically how the Dyakonov-Shur instability for a two-dimensional (2D) inviscid electronic fluid in a long channel can be affected by an external, out-of-plane static magnetic field. By linear stability analysis for a model based on the shallow-water equations, we describe the discrete spectrum of frequencies in the complex plane. When the fluid system is near the subsonic-to-supersonic transition point, a magnetically controlled gap between the stability and instability spectra of the complex eigen-frequencies is evident by our computations. This suggests that the passage from stability to instability (and vice versa) is no longer continuous in the effective Mach parameter of the boundary conditions. We connect this complex-valued gap to a multivalued function characterizing the exact electronic steady state. In a regime of weak magnetic fields, we derive a scaling law for the eigen-frequencies by perturbation theory. We discuss implications of our results in efforts to generate terahertz electromagnetic radiation by 2D electronic transport.</description>

Abstract: We investigate magnetic properties of quantum dot arrays of moir\'e triangular superlattices. Starting from a reciprocal space model, we use the projection technique to obtain maximally localized Wannier functions and determine generalized Hubbard model parameters. The many-body Hamiltonian is solved using the exact diagonalization method as a function of the number of electrons in differently shaped quantum dots arrays. Finite spin polarization is observed within a wide range of filling factors for small twist angles and sufficiently strong interactions in most of the studied structures. The prospect for a magnetization controlled by applying a displacement field is presented. In the vicinity of half-filling, signatures of Nagaoka ferromagnetism in moir\'e materials are seen, which we demonstrate by comparing results with the corresponding on-site Hubbard model.</description>

Abstract: Quantum systems can be used as probes in the context of metrology for enhanced parameter estimation. In particular, the delicacy of critical systems to perturbations can make them ideal sensors. Arguably the simplest realistic probe system is a spin-1/2 impurity, which can be manipulated and measured in-situ when embedded in a fermionic environment. Although entanglement between a single impurity probe and its environment produces nontrivial many-body effects, criticality cannot be leveraged for sensing. Here we introduce instead the two-impurity Kondo (2IK) model as a novel paradigm for critical quantum metrology, and examine the multiparameter estimation scenario at finite temperature. We explore the full metrological phase diagram numerically and obtain exact analytic results near criticality. Enhanced sensitivity to the inter-impurity coupling driving a second-order phase transition is evidenced by diverging quantum Fisher information (QFI) and quantum signal-to-noise ratio (QSNR). However, with uncertainty in both coupling strength and temperature, the multiparameter QFI matrix becomes singular -- even though the parameters to be estimated are independent -- resulting in vanishing QSNRs. We demonstrate that by applying a known control field, the singularity can be removed and measurement sensitivity restored. For general systems, we show that the degradation in the QSNR due to uncertainties in another parameter is controlled by the degree of correlation between the unknown parameters.</description>

      <title>Measurement-driven Langevin modeling of superparamagnetic tunnel junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11988v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superparamagnetic tunnel junctions are important devices for a range of emerging technologies, but most existing compact models capture only their mean switching rates. Capturing qualitatively accurate analog dynamics of these devices will be important as the technology scales up. Here we present results using a one-dimensional overdamped Langevin equation that captures statistical properties of measured time traces, including voltage histograms, drift and diffusion characteristics as measured with Kramers-Moyal coefficients, and dwell times distributions. While common macrospin models are more physically-motivated magnetic models than the Langevin model, we show that for the device measured here, they capture even fewer of the measured experimental behaviors.</description>
