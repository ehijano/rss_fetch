      <title>On a two-component Camassa-Holm equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-component generalization of the Camassa-Holm equation and its reduction proposed recently by Xue, Du and Geng [Appl. Math. Lett. {\bf 146} (2023) 108795] are studied. For this two-component equation, its missing bi-Hamiltonian structure is constructed and a Miura transformation is introduced so that it may be regarded as a modification of the very first two-component Camassa-Holm equation. %[Phys. Rev. E {\bf 53} (1996) ; Lett. Math. Phys. {\bf 53 } (2006)]. Using a proper reciprocal transformation, a particular reduction of this two-component equation, which admits $N-$ peakon solution, is brought to the celebrated Burgers equation.</description>

      <title>Energy cascades and condensation via coherent dynamics in Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work makes analytic progress in the deterministic study of turbulence in Hamiltonian systems by identifying two types of energy cascade solutions and the corresponding large- and small-scale structures they generate. The first cascade represents condensate formation via a highly coherent process recently uncovered, while the second cascade, which has not been previously observed, leads to the formation of other large-scale structures. The concentration of energy at small scales is characterized in both cases by the development of a power-law spectrum in finite time, causing the blow-up of Sobolev norms and the formation of coherent structures at small scales. These structures approach two different types of singularities: a point discontinuity in one case and a cusp in the other. The results are fully analytic and explicit, based on two solvable families of Hamiltonian systems identified in this study.</description>

      <title>Direct linearisation of the non-commutative Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01686v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the non-commutative Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation and a `lifted' modified Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (mKP) equation are directly linearisable, and thus integrable in this sense. There are several versions of the non-commutative mKP equations, including the two-dimensional generalisations of the non-commutative modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation and its alternative form (amKdV). Herein we derive the `lifted' mKP equation, whose solutions are the natural two-dimensional extension of those for the non-commutative mKdV equation derived in Blower and Malham. We also present the log-potential form of the mKP equation, from which all of these non-commutative mKP equations can be derived. To achieve the integrability results, we construct the pre-Poppe algebra that underlies the KP and mKP equations. This is a non-commutative polynomial algebra over the real line generated by the solution (and its partial derivatives) to the linearised form of the KP and mKP equations. The algebra is endowed with a pre-Poppe product, based on the product rule for semi-additive operators pioneered by Poppe for the commutative KP equation. Integrability corresponds to establishing a particular polynomial expansion in the respective pre-Poppe algebra. We also present numerical simulations of soliton-like interactions for the non-commutative KP equation.</description>

      <title>Integrability in Perturbed Black Holes: Background Hidden Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the presence of integrable hidden structures in the dynamics of perturbed non-rotating black holes (BHs). This can also be considered as a first step in a wider program of an effective identification of ``slow'' and ``fast'' degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the (binary) BH dynamics, following a wave-mean flow perspective. The slow DoFs would be associated with a nonlinear integrable dynamics, on which the fast ones propagate following an effective linear dynamics. BH perturbation theory offers a natural ground to test these properties. Indeed, the decoupling of Einstein equations into wave master equations with a potential provides an instance of such splitting into (frozen) slow DoFs (background potential) over which the linear dynamics of the fast ones (perturbation master functions) evolve. It has been recently shown that these wave equations possess an infinite number of symmetries that correspond to the flow of the infinite hierarchy of Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations. Starting from these results, we systematically investigate the presence of integrable structures in BH perturbation theory. We first study them in Cauchy slices and then extend the analysis to hyperboloidal foliations. This second step introduces a splitting of the master equation into bulk and boundary contributions, unveiling an underlying structural relation with the slow and fast DoFs. This insight represents a first step to establish the integrable structures associated to the slow DoFs as bulk symmetries of the dynamics of perturbed BHs.</description>
