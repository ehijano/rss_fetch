      <title>Two-by-two ordinal patterns in art paintings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative analysis of visual arts has recently expanded to encompass a more extensive array of artworks due to the availability of large-scale digitized art collections. Consistent with formal analyses by art historians, many of these studies highlight the significance of encoding spatial structures within artworks to enhance our understanding of visual arts. However, defining universally applicable, interpretable, and sufficiently simple units that capture the essence of paintings and their artistic styles remains challenging. Here we examine ordering patterns in pixel intensities within two-by-two partitions of images from nearly 140,000 paintings created over the past thousand years. These patterns, categorized into eleven types based on arguments of continuity and symmetry, are both universally applicable and detailed enough to correlate with low-level visual features of paintings. We uncover a universal distribution of these patterns, with consistent prevalence within groups, yet modulated across groups by a nontrivial interplay between pattern smoothness and the likelihood of identical pixel intensities. This finding provides a standardized metric for comparing paintings and styles, further establishing a scale to measure deviations from the average prevalence. Our research also shows that these simple patterns carry valuable information for identifying painting styles, though styles generally exhibit considerable variability in the prevalence of ordinal patterns. Moreover, shifts in the prevalence of these patterns reveal a trend in which artworks increasingly diverge from the average incidence over time; however, this evolution is neither smooth nor uniform, with substantial variability in pattern prevalence, particularly after the 1930s.</description>

      <title>The benefit of ignorance for traffic through a random congestible network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When traffic is routed through a network that is susceptible to congestion, the self-interested decisions made by individual users do not, in general, produce the optimal flow. This discrepancy is quantified by the so-called "price of anarchy." Here we consider whether the traffic produced by self-interested users is made better or worse when users have uncertain knowledge about the cost functions of the links in the network, and we define a parallel concept that we call the "price of ignorance." We introduce a simple model in which fast, congestible links and slow, incongestible links are mixed randomly in a large network and users plan their routes with finite uncertainty about which of the two cost functions describes each link. One of our key findings is that a small level of user ignorance universally improves traffic, regardless of the network composition. Further, there is an optimal level of ignorance which, in our model, causes the self-interested user behavior to coincide with the optimum. Many features of our model can be understood analytically, including the optimal level of user ignorance and the existence of critical scaling near the percolation threshold for fast links, where the potential benefit of user ignorance is greatest.</description>

      <title>Exploring the dynamics of self-citations and their role in shaping scientific impact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms driving the distribution of scientific citations is a key challenge in assessing the scientific impact of authors. We investigate the influence of the preferential attachment rule (PAR) in this process by analyzing individual citation events from the DBLP dataset, enabling us to estimate the probability of citations being assigned preferentially. Our findings reveal that, for the aggregated dataset, PAR dominates the citation distribution process, with approximately 70% of citations adhering to this mechanism. However, analysis at the individual level shows significant variability, with some authors experiencing a greater prevalence of preferential citations, particularly in the context of external citations. In contrast, self-citations exhibit notably different behaviour, with only 20% following PAR. We also demonstrate that the prominence of PAR increases with an author's citability (average citations per paper), suggesting that more citable authors are preferentially cited, while less-cited authors experience more random citation patterns. Furthermore, we show that self-citations may influence bibliometric indexes. Our results emphasise the distinct dynamics of self-citations compared to external citations, raising questions about the mechanisms driving self-citation patterns. These findings provide new insights into citation behaviours and highlight the limitations of existing approaches in capturing the nuances of scientific impact.</description>

      <title>Symmetries, Scaling Laws and Phase Transitions in Consumer Advertising Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02175v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how consumers respond to business advertising efforts is essential for optimizing marketing investment. This research introduces a new modeling approach based on the concepts of symmetries and scaling laws in physics to describe consumer response to advertising dynamics. Drawing from mathematical frameworks used in physics and social sciences, we propose a model that accounts for a key aspect: the saturation effect. The model is validated against commonly used models, including the Michaelis-Menten and Hill equations, showing its ability to better capture nonlinearities in advertising effects. We introduce new key parameters like Marketing Sensitivity, Response Sensitivity, and Behavioral Sensitivit, that offer additional insights into the drivers of audience engagement and advertising performance. Our model provides a rigorous yet practical tool for understanding audience behavior, contributing to the improvement of budget allocation strategies.</description>

      <title>Coalescing Force of Group Pressure: Consensus in Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04301v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work extends the recent opinion dynamics model from Cheng et al., emphasizing the role of group pressure in consensus formation. We generalize the findings to incorporate social influence algorithms with general time-varying, opinion-dependent weights and multidimensional opinions, beyond bounded confidence dynamics. We demonstrate that, with uniformly positive conformity levels, group pressure consistently drives consensus and provide a tighter estimate for the convergence rate. Unlike previous models, the common public opinion in our framework can assume arbitrary forms within the convex hull of current opinions, offering flexibility applicable to real-world scenarios such as opinion polls with random participant selection. This analysis provides deeper insights into how group pressure mechanisms foster consensus under diverse conditions.</description>

      <title>Does excellence correspond to universal inequality level? Evidences from scholarly citations and Olympic medal data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the inequality of citations received for different publications of various researchers and Nobel laureates in Physics, Chemistry, Medicine and Economics using their Google Scholar data for the period 2012-2024. Our findings reveal that citation distributions are highly unequal, with even greater disparity among the Nobel laureates. We then show that measures of inequality, such as Gini and Kolkata indices, could be a useful indicator for distinguishing the Nobel laureates from the others. It may be noted, such high level of inequality corresponds to critical point fluctuations, indicating that excellence correspond to (self-organized dynamical) critical point. We also analyze the inequality in the medal tally of different countries in the summer and winter Olympic games over the years, and find that a similar level of high inequality exists there as well. Our results indicate that inequality measures can serve as proxies for competitiveness and excellence.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous gait synchronisation in the wild: exploring the effect of distance and level of interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gait synchronization in pedestrians is influenced by biomechanical, environmental, and cognitive factors. Studying gait in ecological settings provides insights often missed in controlled experiments. This study tackles the challenges of assessing gait coordination in real-world interactions using a dataset of uninstructed pedestrian trajectories recorded in an underground pedestrian street network. The data are annotated for group relations, interaction levels, and physical contact. The main goals of our study is to devise a method to identify gait synchronisation from trajectory data and to provide an in-depth analysis of social factors affecting gait synchronisation in pedestrian groups. To that end, we first propose a method to extract gait residuals from pedestrian trajectories, which capture motion of the body caused by gait-induced oscillations. We thereafter apply a suite of analytical techniques spanning both frequency and nonlinear domains. Frequency-based methods, including the Gait Synchronisation Index and Cross Wavelet Coherence, quantify the alignment of oscillatory patterns in gait. Complementary nonlinear measures, such as Lyapunov exponents, determinism, and recurrence quantification metrics, offer deeper insights into the dynamical stability and predictability of coupled gaits. Results show that higher social interaction and closer distances enhance gait synchronization, reducing stride frequency variation and increasing stability. Additionally, triad formation and relative positioning are shown to influence synchronisation. Overall, our findings suggest that social interactions shape pedestrian gait coordination, with interaction level and distance being key factors.</description>

      <title>Neural embedding of beliefs reveals the role of relative dissonance in human decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07237v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Beliefs form the foundation of human cognition and decision-making, guiding our actions and social connections. A model encapsulating beliefs and their interrelationships is crucial for understanding their influence on our actions. However, research on belief interplay has often been limited to beliefs related to specific issues and relied heavily on surveys. We propose a method to study the nuanced interplay between thousands of beliefs by leveraging an online user debate data and mapping beliefs onto a neural embedding space constructed using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM). This belief space captures the interconnectedness and polarization of diverse beliefs across social issues. Our findings show that positions within this belief space predict new beliefs of individuals and estimate cognitive dissonance based on the distance between existing and new beliefs. This study demonstrates how LLMs, combined with collective online records of human beliefs, can offer insights into the fundamental principles that govern human decision-making.</description>

      <title>Exploring near-optimal energy systems with stakeholders: a novel approach for participatory modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Involving people in energy systems planning can increase the legitimacy and socio-political feasibility of energy transitions. Participatory research in energy modelling offers the opportunity to engage with stakeholders in a comprehensive way, but is limited by how results can be generated and presented without imposing assumptions and discrete scenarios on the participants. To this end, we present a methodology and a framework, based on near-optimal modelling results, that can incorporate stakeholders in a holistic and engaging way. We confront stakeholders with a continuum of modelling-based energy system designs via an interactive interface allowing them to choose essentially any combination of components that meet the system requirements. Together with information on the implications of different technologies, it is possible to assess how participants prioritise different aspects in energy systems planning while also facilitating learning in an engaging and stimulating way. We showcase the methodology for the remote Arctic settlement of Longyearbyen and illustrate how participants deviate consistently from the cost optimum. At the same time, they manage to balance different priorities such as emissions, costs, and system vulnerability leading to a better understanding of the complexity and intertwined nature of decisions.</description>
