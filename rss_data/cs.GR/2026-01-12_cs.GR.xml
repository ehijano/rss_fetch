      <title>More Power to the Particles: Analytic Geometry for Partial Optimal Transport-based Fluid simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an analytic construction of the geometry required for free-surface fluid simulations and deformation mechanics based on partial optimal transport such as the Gallou\"et-M\'erigot's scheme or the Power Particles method. Such methods previously relied on a discretization of the cells by leveraging a classical convex cell clipping algorithm. However, this results in a heavy computational cost and a coarse approximation of the evaluated quantities. In contrast, our algorithm efficiently computes the generalized Laguerres cells, that is, intersections between Laguerre cells and spheres. This makes it possible to more precisely compute the volume and the area of the facets as well as strongly reducing the number of operations required to obtain the geometry. Additionally, we provide a dedicated rendering framework solely based on the computed volumetric structure.</description>

      <title>DexterCap: An Affordable and Automated System for Capturing Dexterous Hand-Object Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing fine-grained hand-object interactions is challenging due to severe self-occlusion from closely spaced fingers and the subtlety of in-hand manipulation motions. Existing optical motion capture systems rely on expensive camera setups and extensive manual post-processing, while low-cost vision-based methods often suffer from reduced accuracy and reliability under occlusion. To address these challenges, we present DexterCap, a low-cost optical capture system for dexterous in-hand manipulation. DexterCap uses dense, character-coded marker patches to achieve robust tracking under severe self-occlusion, together with an automated reconstruction pipeline that requires minimal manual effort. With DexterCap, we introduce DexterHand, a dataset of fine-grained hand-object interactions covering diverse manipulation behaviors and objects, from simple primitives to complex articulated objects such as a Rubik's Cube. We release the dataset and code to support future research on dexterous hand-object interaction.</description>

      <title>Sketch&amp;Patch++: Efficient Structure-Aware 3D Gaussian Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05394v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observe that Gaussians exhibit distinct roles and characteristics analogous to traditional artistic techniques -- like how artists first sketch outlines before filling in broader areas with color, some Gaussians capture high-frequency features such as edges and contours, while others represent broader, smoother regions analogous to brush strokes that add volume and depth. Based on this observation, we propose a hybrid representation that categorizes Gaussians into (i) Sketch Gaussians, which represent high-frequency, boundary-defining features, and (ii) Patch Gaussians, which cover low-frequency, smooth regions. This semantic separation naturally enables layered progressive streaming, where the compact Sketch Gaussians establish the structural skeleton before Patch Gaussians incrementally refine volumetric detail.
  In this work, we extend our previous method to arbitrary 3D scenes by proposing a novel hierarchical adaptive categorization framework that operates directly on the 3DGS representation. Our approach employs multi-criteria density-based clustering, combined with adaptive quality-driven refinement. This method eliminates dependency on external 3D line primitives while ensuring optimal parametric encoding effectiveness. Our comprehensive evaluation across diverse scenes, including both man-made and natural environments, demonstrates that our method achieves up to 1.74 dB improvement in PSNR, 6.7% in SSIM, and 41.4% in LPIPS at equivalent model sizes compared to uniform pruning baselines. For indoor scenes, our method can maintain visual quality with only 0.5\% of the original model size. This structure-aware representation enables efficient storage, adaptive streaming, and rendering of high-fidelity 3D content across bandwidth-constrained networks and resource-limited devices.</description>

      <title>LayerGS: Decomposition and Inpainting of Layered 3D Human Avatars via 2D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for decomposing arbitrarily posed humans into animatable multi-layered 3D human avatars, separating the body and garments. Conventional single-layer reconstruction methods lock clothing to one identity, while prior multi-layer approaches struggle with occluded regions. We overcome both limitations by encoding each layer as a set of 2D Gaussians for accurate geometry and photorealistic rendering, and inpainting hidden regions with a pretrained 2D diffusion model via score-distillation sampling (SDS). Our three-stage training strategy first reconstructs the coarse canonical garment via single-layer reconstruction, followed by multi-layer training to jointly recover the inner-layer body and outer-layer garment details. Experiments on two 3D human benchmark datasets (4D-Dress, Thuman2.0) show that our approach achieves better rendering quality and layer decomposition and recomposition than the previous state-of-the-art, enabling realistic virtual try-on under novel viewpoints and poses, and advancing practical creation of high-fidelity 3D human assets for immersive applications.

      <title>Data-Driven Compute Overlays for Interactive Geographic Simulation and Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present interactive data-driven compute overlays for native and web-based 3D geographic map applications based on WebGPU. Our data-driven overlays are generated in a multi-step compute workflow from multiple data sources on the GPU. We demonstrate their potential by showing results from snow cover and avalanche simulations, where simulation parameters can be adjusted interactively and results are visualized instantly. Benchmarks show that our approach can compute large-scale avalanche simulations in milliseconds to seconds, depending on the size of the terrain and the simulation parameters, which is multiple orders of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art Python implementation.</description>

      <title>Differential Locally Injective Grid Deformation and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04494v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grids are a general representation for capturing regularly-spaced information, but since they are uniform in space, they cannot dynamically allocate resolution to regions with varying levels of detail. There has been some exploration of indirect grid adaptivity by replacing uniform grids with tetrahedral meshes or locally subdivided grids, as inversion-free deformation of grids is difficult. This work develops an inversion-free grid deformation method that optimizes differential weight to adaptively compress space. The method is the first to optimize grid vertices as differential elements using vertex-colorings, decomposing a dense input linear system into many independent sets of vertices which can be optimized concurrently. This method is then also extended to optimize UV meshes with convex boundaries. Experimentally, this differential representation leads to a smoother optimization manifold than updating extrinsic vertex coordinates. By optimizing each sets of vertices in a coloring separately, local injectivity checks are straightforward since the valid region for each vertex is fixed. This enables the use of optimizers such as Adam, as each vertex can be optimized independently of other vertices. We demonstrate the generality and efficacy of this approach through applications in isosurface extraction for inverse rendering, image compaction, and mesh parameterization.</description>
