      <title>Image-based modelling of rock non-linear deformation under low-stress levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rock geophysical properties are widely reported to exhibit non-linear behaviours under low-stress conditions (below 10-20 MPa) before transitioning to the linear elastic stage, primarily due to the closure of microcracks and grain interfaces. Image-based modelling of rock deformation struggles to effectively characterise the microcrack closure effect because of the partial-volume effect, where image voxels are larger than microcracks and contain both pore and solid phases. This study presents a novel method to simulate non-linear rock deformation under elevated stress conditions. The method reconstructs digital rock models by treating partial-volume voxels as transitional phases that incorporate microcracks. By assigning intermediate elastic moduli and assuming that the pore portion within each partial-volume voxel deforms before the remaining solid content, the method employs the finite element method to simulate rock deformation and calculate the porosity of the deformed model. The method is tested on two Bentheimer sandstone models, and the results demonstrate its ability to predict the non-linear changes in porosity and elastic properties as the effective stress increases. This work provides a new pathway for image-based modelling of non-linear rock deformation considering the microcrack closure effect, offering valuable insights into the complex mechanical behaviour of rocks under confinement.</description>

      <title>Fluid flow and hydration in oceanic lithosphere: Insights from theory and numerical investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The oceanic mantle lithosphere has considerable potential to store chemically bound water, thereby being an important factor for the deep water cycle. However, the actual extent of hydrous alteration in such mantle rocks is debated. Geodynamic modeling has the potential to directly predict the extent of fluid flow through oceanic lithosphere, and, in turn, the extent of serpentinization. By comparing theory and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that conventional geodynamic models are inherently inconsistent with the physics of brittle deformation, and, as a result, they overestimate the extent of fluid flow during extension. In contrast to the extensive serpentinization often inferred with bending-related processes during subduction, limited serpentinization is consistent with theoretical predictions and geophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Defending Saltwater Intrusion: The Freshwater Pushback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Saltwater Intrusion (SWI) threatens freshwater availability, agriculture, and ecosystem resilience in coastal regions. While sea-level rise (SLR) is a known driver of long-term salinization, the counteracting role of freshwater discharge remains underexamined. Here, we combine long-term observations with numerical modeling and machine learning reconstruction to quantify the buffering capacity of freshwater outflows across the U.S. coastline. In systems such as Delaware Bay and parts of the Gulf and South Atlantic coasts, the salt front has shifted seaward in recent decades, linked to increased discharge, despite SLR over that time period. We show that a 10 - 35% increase in freshwater flow can offset the salinity impact of 0.5 m of SLR, though regional variation is significant. With future discharge trends diverging spatially, SWI responses will be highly uneven. These results highlight the critical role of freshwater management in mitigating salinity risks under climate change, with implications for water resource resilience, coastal planning, and long-term adaptation strategies.</description>

      <title>Vessel Detection and Localization Using Distributed Acoustic Sensing in Submarine Optical Fiber Cables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Submarine cables play a critical role in global internet connectivity, energy transmission, and communication but remain vulnerable to accidental damage and sabotage. Recent incidents in the Baltic Sea highlighted the need for enhanced monitoring to protect this vital infrastructure. Traditional vessel detection methods, such as synthetic aperture radar, video surveillance, and multispectral satellite imagery, face limitations in real-time processing, adverse weather conditions, and coverage range. This paper explores Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) as an alternative by repurposing submarine telecommunication cables as large-scale acoustic sensor arrays. DAS offers continuous real-time monitoring, operates independently of cooperative systems like the "Automatic Identification System" (AIS), being largely unaffected by lighting or weather conditions. However, existing research on DAS for vessel tracking is limited in scale and lacks validation under real-world conditions. To address these gaps, a general and systematic methodology is presented for vessel detection and distance estimation using DAS. Advanced machine learning models are applied to improve detection and localization accuracy in dynamic maritime environments. The approach is evaluated over a continuous ten-day period, covering diverse ship and operational conditions, representing one of the largest-scale DAS-based vessel monitoring studies to date, and for which we release the full evaluation dataset. Results demonstrate DAS as a practical tool for maritime surveillance, with an overall F1-score of over 90% in vessel detection, and a mean average error of 141 m for vessel distance estimation, bridging the gap between experimental research and real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>WAFER: A new method to retrieve sun-induced fluorescence based on spectral wavelet decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sun-induced fluorescence (SIF) as a close remote sensing based proxy for photosynthesis is accepted as a useful measure to remotely monitor vegetation health and gross primary productivity. In this work we present the new retrieval method WAFER (WAvelet decomposition FluorEscence Retrieval) based on wavelet decompositions of the measured spectra of reflected radiance as well as a reference radiance not containing fluorescence. By comparing absolute absorption line depths by means of the corresponding wavelet coefficients, a relative reflectance is retrieved independently of the fluorescence, i.e. without introducing a coupling between reflectance and fluorescence. The fluorescence can then be derived as the remaining offset. This method can be applied to arbitrary chosen wavelength windows in the whole spectral range, such that all the spectral data available is exploited, including the separation into several frequency (i.e. width of absorption lines) levels and without the need of extensive training datasets. At the same time, the assumptions about the reflectance shape are minimal and no spectral shape assumptions are imposed on the fluorescence, which not only avoids biases arising from wrong or differing fluorescence models across different spatial scales and retrieval methods but also allows for the exploration of this spectral shape for different measurement setups. WAFER is tested on a synthetic dataset as well as several diurnal datasets acquired with a field spectrometer (FloX) over an agricultural site. We compare the WAFER method to two established retrieval methods, namely the improved Fraunhofer line discrimination (iFLD) method and spectral fitting method (SFM) and find a good agreement with the added possibility of exploring the true spectral shape of the offset signal and free choice of the retrieval window.

      <title>Deep operator network for surrogate modeling of poroelasticity with random permeability fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Poroelasticity -- coupled fluid flow and elastic deformation in porous media -- often involves spatially variable permeability, especially in subsurface systems. In such cases, simulations with random permeability fields are widely used for probabilistic analysis, uncertainty quantification, and inverse problems. These simulations require repeated forward solves that are often prohibitively expensive, motivating the development of efficient surrogate models. However, efficient surrogate modeling techniques for poroelasticity with random permeability fields remain scarce. In this study, we propose a surrogate modeling framework based on the deep operator network (DeepONet), a neural architecture designed to learn mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces. The proposed surrogate model approximates the solution operator that maps random permeability fields to transient poroelastic responses. To enhance predictive accuracy and stability, we integrate three strategies: nondimensionalization of the governing equations, input dimensionality reduction via Karhunen--Lo\'eve expansion, and a two-step training procedure that decouples the optimization of branch and trunk networks. The methodology is evaluated on two benchmark problems in poroelasticity: soil consolidation and ground subsidence induced by groundwater extraction. In both cases, the DeepONet achieves substantial speedup in inference while maintaining high predictive accuracy across a wide range of permeability statistics. These results highlight the potential of the proposed approach as a scalable and efficient surrogate modeling technique for poroelastic systems with random permeability fields.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Analytical Turbulence Closures for Quasi-Geostrophic Ocean Flows with Coastal Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06678v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical turbulence simulations typically involve parameterizations such as Large Eddy Simulations (LES). Applications to geophysical flows, especially ocean flows, are further complicated by the presence of complex topography and interior landforms such as coastlines, islands, and capes. In this work, we extend pseudo-spectral quasi-geostrophic (QG) numerical schemes and GPU-based solvers to simulate flows with coastal boundaries using the Brinkman volume penalization approach. We incorporate sponging and a splitting scheme to handle inflow and aperiodic boundary conditions. We evaluate four analytical sub-grid-scale (SGS) closures based on the eddy viscosity hypothesis: the standard Smagorinsky and Leith closures, and their dynamic variants. We show applications to QG flows past circular islands and capes with the beta-plane approximation. We perform both a priori analysis of the SGS closure terms as well as a posteriori assessment of the SGS terms and simulated vorticity fields. Our results showcase differences between the various closures, especially their approach to phase and feature reconstruction errors in the presence of coastal boundaries.</description>
