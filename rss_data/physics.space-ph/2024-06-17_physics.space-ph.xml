      <title>Interstellar Neutral Hydrogen in the Heliosphere: New Horizons Observations in the Context of Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interstellar neutral (ISN) hydrogen is the most abundant species in the outer heliosheath and the very local interstellar medium (VLISM). Charge exchange collisions in the outer heliosheath result in filtration, reducing the ISN hydrogen density inside the heliosphere. Additionally, these atoms are intensively ionized close to the Sun, resulting in a substantial reduction of their density within a few au from the Sun. The products of this ionization - pickup ions (PUIs) - are detected by charged particle detectors. The Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) instrument on New Horizons provides, for the first time, PUI observations from the distant heliosphere. We analyze the observations collected between 22 and 52 au from the Sun to find the ISN hydrogen density profile and compare the results with predictions from global heliosphere models. We conclude that the density profile derived from the observations is inconsistent with steady-state model predictions. This discrepancy is not explained by time variations close to the Sun and thus may be related to the temporal evolution of the outer boundaries or VLISM conditions. Furthermore, we show that the cold and hot models of ISN hydrogen distribution are not a good approximation closer to the termination shock. Therefore, we recommend a new fiduciary point based on the available New Horizons observations at 40 au from the Sun, at ecliptic direction (285.62{\deg}, 1.94{\deg}), where the ISN hydrogen density is 0.11 cm$^{-3}$. The continued operation of New Horizons should give better insight into the source of the discussed discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Phase-space entropy cascade and irreversibility of stochastic heating in nearly collisionless plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a nearly collisionless plasma consisting of a species of `test particles' in 1D-1V, stirred by an externally imposed stochastic electric field. The mean effect on the particle distribution function is stochastic heating. Accompanying this heating is the generation of fine-scale structure in the distribution function, which we characterize with the collisionless (Casimir) invariant $C_2 \propto \iint dx dv \, \langle f^2 \rangle$. We find that $C_2$ is transferred from large scales to small scales in both position and velocity space via a phase-space cascade enabled by both particle streaming and nonlinear interactions between particles and the stochastic electric field. We compute the steady-state fluxes and spectrum of $C_2$ in Fourier space, with $k$ and $s$ denoting spatial and velocity wavenumbers, respectively. Whereas even the linear phase mixing alone would lead to a constant flux of $C_2$ to high $s$ (towards the collisional dissipation range) at every $k$, the nonlinearity accelerates this cascade by intertwining velocity and position space so that the flux of $C_2$ is to both high $k$ and high $s$ simultaneously. Integrating over velocity (spatial) wavenumbers, the $k$-space ($s$-space) flux of $C_2$ is constant down to a dissipation length (velocity) scale that tends to zero as the collision frequency does, even though the rate of collisional dissipation remains finite. The resulting spectrum in the inertial range is a self-similar function in the $(k,s)$ plane, with power-law asymptotics at large $k$ and $s$. We argue that stochastic heating is made irreversible by this entropy cascade and that, while collisional dissipation accessed via phase mixing occurs only at small spatial scales rather than at every scale as it would in a linear system, the cascade makes phase mixing even more effective overall in the nonlinear regime than in the linear one.</description>

      <title>The relative prevalence of wave-packets and coherent structures in the inertial and kinetic ranges of turbulence as seen by Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Solar Orbiter (SO) mission provides the opportunity to study the evolution of solar wind turbulence. We use SO observations of nine extended intervals of homogeneous turbulence to determine when turbulent magnetic field fluctuations may be characterized as: (i) wave-packets and (ii) coherent structures (CS). We perform the first systematic scale-by-scale decomposition of the magnetic field using two wavelets known to resolve wave-packets and discontinuities, the Daubechies 10 (Db10) and Haar respectively. The probability distributions (pdfs) of turbulent fluctuations on small scales exhibit stretched tails, becoming Gaussian at the outer scale of the cascade. Using quantile-quantile plots, we directly compare the wavelet fluctuations pdfs, revealing three distinct regimes of behaviour. Deep within the inertial range (IR) both decompositions give essentially the same fluctuation pdfs. Deep within the kinetic range (KR) the pdfs are distinct as the Haar wavelet fluctuations have larger variance and more extended tails. On intermediate scales, spanning the IR-KR break, the pdf is composed of two populations: a core of common functional form containing $\sim97\%$ of fluctuations, and tails which are more extended for Haar fluctuations than Db10 fluctuations. This establishes a crossover between wave-packet (core) and CS (tail) phenomenology in the IR and KR respectively. The range of scales where the pdfs are $2$-component is narrow at $0.9$ au ($4-16$ s) and broader ($0.5-8$ s) at $0.4$ au. As CS and wave-wave interactions are both candidates to mediate the turbulent cascade, these results offer new insights into the distinct physics of the IR and KR.</description>
