      <title>Improving volatility forecasts of the Nikkei 225 stock index using a realized EGARCH model with realized and realized range-based volatilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper applies the realized exponential generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (REGARCH) model to analyze the Nikkei 225 index from 2010 to 2017, utilizing realized variance (RV) and realized range-based volatility (RRV) as high-frequency measures of volatility. The findings show that REGARCH models outperform standard GARCH family models in both in-sample fitting and out-of-sample forecasting, driven by the dynamic information embedded in high-frequency realized measures. Incorporating multiple realized measures within a joint REGARCH framework further enhances model performance. Notably, RRV demonstrates superior predictive power compared to RV, as evidenced by improvements in forecast accuracy metrics. Moreover, the forecasting results remain robust under both rolling-window and recursive evaluation schemes.</description>

      <title>Kotlarski's lemma for dyadic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to identify the distributions of the error components in the two-way dyadic model $y_{ij}=c+\alpha_i+\eta_j+\varepsilon_{ij}$. To this end, we extend the lemma of Kotlarski (1967), mimicking the arguments of Evdokimov and White (2012). We allow the characteristic functions of the error components to have real zeros, as long as they do not overlap with zeros of their first derivatives.</description>

      <title>Panel Data Estimation and Inference: Homogeneity versus Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we define an underlying data generating process that allows for different magnitudes of cross-sectional dependence, along with time series autocorrelation. This is achieved via high-dimensional moving average processes of infinite order (HDMA($\infty$)). Our setup and investigation integrates and enhances homogenous and heterogeneous panel data estimation and testing in a unified way. To study HDMA($\infty$), we extend the Beveridge-Nelson decomposition to a high-dimensional time series setting, and derive a complete toolkit set. We exam homogeneity versus heterogeneity using Gaussian approximation, a prevalent technique for establishing uniform inference. For post-testing inference, we derive central limit theorems through Edgeworth expansions for both homogenous and heterogeneous settings. Additionally, we showcase the practical relevance of the established asymptotic properties by revisiting the common correlated effects (CCE) estimators, and a classic nonstationary panel data process. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via extensive numerical studies using both simulated and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Inference on varying coefficients in spatial autoregressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present simple to implement Wald-type statistics that deliver a general nonparametric inference theory for linear restrictions on varying coefficients in a range of spatial autoregressive models. Our theory covers error dependence of a general form, allows for a degree of misspecification robustness via nonparametric spatial weights and permits inference on both varying regression and spatial coefficients. One application of our method finds evidence for constant returns to scale in the production function of the Chinese nonmetal mineral industry, while another finds a nonlinear impact of the distance to the employment center on housing prices in Boston. A simulation study confirms that our tests perform well in finite-samples.</description>

      <title>Horowitz-Manski-Lee Bounds with Multilayered Sample Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the causal effect of job training on wage rates in the presence of firm heterogeneity. When training affects the sorting of workers to firms, sample selection is no longer binary but is ``multilayered". This paper extends the canonical Heckman (1979) sample selection model -- which assumes selection is binary -- to a setting where it is multilayered. In this setting Lee bounds set identifies a total effect that combines a weighted-average of the causal effect of job training on wage rates across firms with a weighted-average of the contrast in wages between different firms for a fixed level of training. Thus, Lee bounds set identifies a policy-relevant estimand only when firms pay homogeneous wages and/or when job training does not affect worker sorting across firms. We derive analytic expressions for sharp bounds for the causal effect of job training on wage rates at each firm that leverage information on firm-specific wages. We illustrate our partial identification approach with two empirical applications to job training experiments. Our estimates demonstrate that even when conventional Lee bounds are strictly positive, our within-firm bounds can be tight around 0, showing that the canonical Lee bounds may capture only a pure sorting effect of job training.</description>

      <title>Scale-Insensitive Neural Network Significance Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a scale-insensitive framework for neural network significance testing, substantially generalizing existing approaches through three key innovations. First, we replace metric entropy calculations with Rademacher complexity bounds, enabling the analysis of neural networks without requiring bounded weights or specific architectural constraints. Second, we weaken the regularity conditions on the target function to require only Sobolev space membership $H^s([-1,1]^d)$ with $s &gt; d/2$, significantly relaxing previous smoothness assumptions while maintaining optimal approximation rates. Third, we introduce a modified sieve space construction based on moment bounds rather than weight constraints, providing a more natural theoretical framework for modern deep learning practices. Our approach achieves these generalizations while preserving optimal convergence rates and establishing valid asymptotic distributions for test statistics. The technical foundation combines localization theory, sharp concentration inequalities, and scale-insensitive complexity measures to handle unbounded weights and general Lipschitz activation functions. This framework better aligns theoretical guarantees with contemporary deep learning practice while maintaining mathematical rigor.</description>
