      <title>Diffusion and pattern formation in spatial games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion plays an important role in a wide variety of phenomena, from bacterial quorum sensing to the dynamics of traffic flow. While it generally tends to level out gradients and inhomogeneities, diffusion has nonetheless been shown to promote pattern formation in certain classes of systems. Formation of stable structures often serves as a key factor in promoting the emergence and persistence of cooperative behavior in otherwise competitive environments, however an in-depth analysis on the impact of diffusion on such systems is lacking. We therefore investigate the effects of diffusion on cooperative behavior using a cellular automaton (CA) model of the noisy spatial iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), physical extension and stochasticity being unavoidable characteristics of several natural phenomena. We further derive a mean-field (MF) model that captures the 3-species predation dynamics from the CA model and highlight how pattern formation arises in this new model, then characterize how including diffusion by interchange similarly enables the emergence of large scale structures in the CA model as well. We investigate how these emerging patterns favors cooperative behavior for parameter space regions where IPD error rates classically forbid such dynamics. We thus demonstrate how the coupling of diffusion with non-linear dynamics can, counter-intuitively, promote large scale structure formation and in return establish new grounds for cooperation to take hold in stochastic spatial systems.</description>

      <title>Interaction spaces: towards a universal mathematical theory of complex systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first steps of interaction spaces theory, a universal mathematical theory of complex systems which is able to embed cellular automata, agent based models, master equation based models, stochastic or deterministic, continuous or discrete dynamical systems, networked dynamical models, artificial neural networks and genetic algorithms in a single notion. Therefore, interaction spaces represent a common mathematical language that can be used to describe several complex systems modeling frameworks. This is the first step to start a mathematical theory of complex systems. Every notion is introduced both using an intuitive description by listing lots of examples, and using a modern mathematical language.</description>

      <title>A mathematical definition of complex adaptive system as interaction space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a mathematical notion of complex adaptive system by following the original intuition of G.K. Zipf about the principle of least effort, an intuitive idea which is nowadays informally widespread in complex systems modeling. We call generalized evolution principle this mathematical notion of interaction spaces theory. Formalizing and generalizing Mandelbrot's ideas, we also prove that a large class of these systems satisfy a power law. We finally illustrate the notion of complex adaptive system with theorems describing a Von Th\"unen-like model. The latter can be easily generalized to other complex systems and describes the appearance of emergent patterns. Every notion is introduced both using an intuitive description with lots of examples, and using a modern mathematical language.</description>

      <title>Transient amplification of broken symmetry in elastic snap-through</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A snap-through bifurcation occurs when a bistable structure loses one of its stable states and moves rapidly to the remaining state. For example, a buckled arch with symmetrically clamped ends can snap between an inverted and a natural state as the ends are released. A standard linear stability analysis suggests that the arch becomes unstable to asymmetric perturbations. Surprisingly, our experiments show that this is not always the case: symmetric transitions are also observed. Using experiments, numerics, and a toy model, we show that the symmetry of the transition depends on the rate at which the ends are released with sufficiently fast loading leading to symmetric snap-through. Our toy model reveals that this behavior is caused by a region of the system's state space in which any initial asymmetry is amplified. The system may not enter this region when loaded fast (hence remaining symmetric) but will traverse it for some interval of time when loaded slowly, causing a transient amplification of asymmetry. Our toy model suggests that this behavior is not unique to snapping arches, but rather can be observed in dynamical systems where both a saddle-node and a pitchfork bifurcation occur in close proximity.</description>

      <title>Stability of fronts in the diffusive Rosenzweig-MacArthur model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15260v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a diffusive Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model in the situation when the prey diffuses at the rate much smaller than that of the predator. In a certain parameter regime, the existence of fronts in the system is known: the underlying dynamical system in a singular limit is reduced to a scalar Fisher-KPP equation and the fronts supported by the full system are small perturbations of the Fisher-KPP fronts. The existence proof is based on application of the Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory with respect to two small parameters. This paper is focused on the stability of the fronts. We analyze the stability by means of energy estimates, exponential dichotomies, the Evans function calculation, and a technique that involves constructing the unstable augmented bundles. The energy estimates provide bounds on the unstable spectrum which depend on the small parameters of the system; the bounds are inversely proportional to these parameters. We further improve these estimates by showing that the eigenvalue problem is a small perturbation of some limiting (as the modulus of the eigenvalue parameter goes to infinity) system, and that the limiting system has exponential dichotomies. Persistence of the exponential dichotomies then leads to bounds uniform in the small parameters. The main novelty of this approach is related to the fact that the limit of the eigenvalue problem is not autonomous. We then use the concept of the unstable augmented bundles and by treating these as multiscale topological structures with respect to the same two small parameters consequently as in the existence proof, we show that the stability of the fronts is also governed by the scalar Fisher-KPP equation.</description>
