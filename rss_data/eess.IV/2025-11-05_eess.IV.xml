      <title>Opto-Electronic Convolutional Neural Network Design Via Direct Kernel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Opto-electronic neural networks integrate optical front-ends with electronic back-ends to enable fast and energy-efficient vision. However, conventional end-to-end optimization of both the optical and electronic modules is limited by costly simulations and large parameter spaces. We introduce a two-stage strategy for designing opto-electronic convolutional neural networks (CNNs): first, train a standard electronic CNN, then realize the optical front-end implemented as a metasurface array through direct kernel optimization of its first convolutional layer. This approach reduces computational and memory demands by hundreds of times and improves training stability compared to end-to-end optimization. On monocular depth estimation, the proposed two-stage design achieves twice the accuracy of end-to-end training under the same training time and resource constraints.</description>

      <title>MammoClean: Toward Reproducible and Bias-Aware AI in Mammography through Dataset Harmonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of clinically reliable artificial intelligence (AI) systems for mammography is hindered by profound heterogeneity in data quality, metadata standards, and population distributions across public datasets. This heterogeneity introduces dataset-specific biases that severely compromise the generalizability of the model, a fundamental barrier to clinical deployment. We present MammoClean, a public framework for standardization and bias quantification in mammography datasets. MammoClean standardizes case selection, image processing (including laterality and intensity correction), and unifies metadata into a consistent multi-view structure. We provide a comprehensive review of breast anatomy, imaging characteristics, and public mammography datasets to systematically identify key sources of bias. Applying MammoClean to three heterogeneous datasets (CBIS-DDSM, TOMPEI-CMMD, VinDr-Mammo), we quantify substantial distributional shifts in breast density and abnormality prevalence. Critically, we demonstrate the direct impact of data corruption: AI models trained on corrupted datasets exhibit significant performance degradation compared to their curated counterparts. By using MammoClean to identify and mitigate bias sources, researchers can construct unified multi-dataset training corpora that enable development of robust models with superior cross-domain generalization. MammoClean provides an essential, reproducible pipeline for bias-aware AI development in mammography, facilitating fairer comparisons and advancing the creation of safe, effective systems that perform equitably across diverse patient populations and clinical settings. The open-source code is publicly available from: https://github.com/Minds-R-Lab/MammoClean.</description>

      <title>Resource-efficient Automatic Refinement of Segmentations via Weak Supervision from Light Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delineating anatomical regions is a key task in medical image analysis. Manual segmentation achieves high accuracy but is labor-intensive and prone to variability, thus prompting the development of automated approaches. Recently, a breadth of foundation models has enabled automated segmentations across diverse anatomies and imaging modalities, but these may not always meet the clinical accuracy standards. While segmentation refinement strategies can improve performance, current methods depend on heavy user interactions or require fully supervised segmentations for training. Here, we present SCORE (Segmentation COrrection from Regional Evaluations), a weakly supervised framework that learns to refine mask predictions only using light feedback during training. Specifically, instead of relying on dense training image annotations, SCORE introduces a novel loss that leverages region-wise quality scores and over/under-segmentation error labels. We demonstrate SCORE on humerus CT scans, where it considerably improves initial predictions from TotalSegmentator, and achieves performance on par with existing refinement methods, while greatly reducing their supervision requirements and annotation time. Our code is available at: https://gitlab.inria.fr/adelangl/SCORE.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models are Robust Pretrainers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have gained significant attention for high-fidelity image generation. Our work investigates the potential of exploiting diffusion models for adversarial robustness in image classification and object detection. Adversarial attacks challenge standard models in these tasks by perturbing inputs to force incorrect predictions. To address this issue, many approaches use training schemes for forcing the robustness of the models, which increase training costs. In this work, we study models built on top of off-the-shelf diffusion models and demonstrate their practical significance: they provide a low-cost path to robust representations, allowing lightweight heads to be trained on frozen features without full adversarial training. Our empirical evaluations on ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and PASCAL VOC show that diffusion-based classifiers and detectors achieve meaningful adversarial robustness with minimal compute. While clean and adversarial accuracies remain below state-of-the-art adversarially trained CNNs or ViTs, diffusion pretraining offers a favorable tradeoff between efficiency and robustness. This work opens a promising avenue for integrating diffusion models into resource-constrained robust deployments.</description>

      <title>A Calibration Method for Indirect Time-of-Flight Cameras to Eliminate Internal Scattering Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-camera light scattering is a typical form of non-systematic interference in indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) cameras, primarily caused by multiple reflections and optical path variations within the camera body. This effect can significantly reduce the accuracy of background depth measurements. To address this issue, this paper proposes a calibration-based model derived from real measurement data, introducing three physically interpretable calibration parameters: a normal-exposure amplitude influence coefficient, an overexposure amplitude influence coefficient, and a scattering phase shift coefficient. These parameters are used to describe the effects of foreground size, exposure conditions, and optical path differences on scattering interference. Experimental results show that the depth values calculated using the calibrated parameters can effectively compensate for scattering-induced errors, significantly improving background depth recovery in scenarios with complex foreground geometries and varying illumination conditions. This approach provides a practical, low-cost solution for iToF systems, requiring no complex hardware modifications, and can substantially enhance measurement accuracy and robustness across a wide range of real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Challenging DINOv3 Foundation Model under Low Inter-Class Variability: A Case Study on Fetal Brain Ultrasound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Purpose: This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of foundation models in fetal ultrasound (US) imaging under low inter-class variability conditions. While recent vision foundation models such as DINOv3 have shown remarkable transferability across medical domains, their ability to discriminate anatomically similar structures has not been systematically investigated. We address this gap by focusing on fetal brain standard planes--transthalamic (TT), transventricular (TV), and transcerebellar (TC)--which exhibit highly overlapping anatomical features and pose a critical challenge for reliable biometric assessment.
  Methods: To ensure a fair and reproducible evaluation, all publicly available fetal ultrasound datasets were curated and aggregated into a unified multicenter benchmark, FetalUS-188K, comprising more than 188,000 annotated images from heterogeneous acquisition settings. DINOv3 was pretrained in a self-supervised manner to learn ultrasound-aware representations. The learned features were then evaluated through standardized adaptation protocols, including linear probing with frozen backbone and full fine-tuning, under two initialization schemes: (i) pretraining on FetalUS-188K and (ii) initialization from natural-image DINOv3 weights.
  Results: Models pretrained on fetal ultrasound data consistently outperformed those initialized on natural images, with weighted F1-score improvements of up to 20 percent. Domain-adaptive pretraining enabled the network to preserve subtle echogenic and structural cues crucial for distinguishing intermediate planes such as TV.
  Conclusion: Results demonstrate that generic foundation models fail to generalize under low inter-class variability, whereas domain-specific pretraining is essential to achieve robust and clinically reliable representations in fetal brain ultrasound imaging.</description>

      <title>Reliability Assessment Framework Based on Feature Separability for Pathological Cell Image Classification under Prior Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01953v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background and objective: Prior probability shift between training and deployment datasets challenges deep learning--based medical image classification. Standard correction methods reweight posterior probabilities to adjust prior bias, yet their benefit is inconsistent. We developed a reliability framework identifying when prior correction helps or harms performance in pathological cell image analysis. Methods: We analyzed 303 colorectal cancer specimens with CD103/CD8 immunostaining, yielding 185,432 annotated cell images across 16 cell types. ResNet models were trained under varying bias ratios (1.1--20$\times$). Feature separability was quantified using cosine similarity--based likelihood quality scores, reflecting intra- versus inter-class distinctions in learned feature spaces. Multiple linear regression, ANOVA, and generalized additive models (GAMs) evaluated associations among feature separability, prior bias, sample adequacy, and F1 performance. Results: Feature separability dominated performance ($\beta = 1.650$, $p &lt; 0.001$), showing 412-fold stronger impact than prior bias ($\beta = 0.004$, $p = 0.018$). GAM analysis showed strong predictive power ($R^2 = 0.876$) with mostly linear trends. A quality threshold of 0.294 effectively identified cases requiring correction (AUC = 0.610). Cell types scoring $&gt;0.5$ were robust without correction, whereas those $&lt;0.3$ consistently required adjustment. Conclusion: Feature extraction quality, not bias magnitude, governs correction benefit. The proposed framework provides quantitative guidance for selective correction, enabling efficient deployment and reliable diagnostic AI.</description>

      <title>Estimation of Segmental Longitudinal Strain in Transesophageal Echocardiography by Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Segmental longitudinal strain (SLS) of the left ventricle (LV) is an important prognostic indicator for evaluating regional LV dysfunction, in particular for diagnosing and managing myocardial ischemia. Current techniques for strain estimation require significant manual intervention and expertise, limiting their efficiency and making them too resource-intensive for monitoring purposes. This study introduces the first automated pipeline, autoStrain, for SLS estimation in transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) using deep learning (DL) methods for motion estimation. We present a comparative analysis of two DL approaches: TeeFlow, based on the RAFT optical flow model for dense frame-to-frame predictions, and TeeTracker, based on the CoTracker point trajectory model for sparse long-sequence predictions.
  As ground truth motion data from real echocardiographic sequences are hardly accessible, we took advantage of a unique simulation pipeline (SIMUS) to generate a highly realistic synthetic TEE (synTEE) dataset of 80 patients with ground truth myocardial motion to train and evaluate both models. Our evaluation shows that TeeTracker outperforms TeeFlow in accuracy, achieving a mean distance error in motion estimation of 0.65 mm on a synTEE test dataset.
  Clinical validation on 16 patients further demonstrated that SLS estimation with our autoStrain pipeline aligned with clinical references, achieving a mean difference (95\% limits of agreement) of 1.09% (-8.90% to 11.09%). Incorporation of simulated ischemia in the synTEE data improved the accuracy of the models in quantifying abnormal deformation. Our findings indicate that integrating AI-driven motion estimation with TEE can significantly enhance the precision and efficiency of cardiac function assessment in clinical settings.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Magnetic Particle Imaging System Matrix Recovery Using a Vision Transformer with Residual Feature Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a hybrid deep learning framework, the Vision Transformer with Residual Feature Network (VRF-Net), for recovering high-resolution system matrices in Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI). MPI resolution often suffers from downsampling and coil sensitivity variations. VRF-Net addresses these challenges by combining transformer-based global attention with residual convolutional refinement, enabling recovery of both large-scale structures and fine details. To reflect realistic MPI conditions, the system matrix is degraded using a dual-stage downsampling strategy. Training employed paired-image super-resolution on the public Open MPI dataset and a simulated dataset incorporating variable coil sensitivity profiles. For system matrix recovery on the Open MPI dataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 0.403, pSNR = 39.08 dB, and SSIM = 0.835 at 2x scaling, and maintained strong performance even at challenging scale 8x (pSNR = 31.06 dB, SSIM = 0.717). For the simulated dataset, VRF-Net achieved nRMSE = 4.44, pSNR = 28.52 dB, and SSIM = 0.771 at 2x scaling, with stable performance at higher scales. On average, it reduced nRMSE by 88.2%, increased pSNR by 44.7%, and improved SSIM by 34.3% over interpolation and CNN-based methods. In image reconstruction of Open MPI phantoms, VRF-Net further reduced reconstruction error to nRMSE = 1.79 at 2x scaling, while preserving structural fidelity (pSNR = 41.58 dB, SSIM = 0.960), outperforming existing methods. These findings demonstrate that VRF-Net enables sharper, artifact-free system matrix recovery and robust image reconstruction across multiple scales, offering a promising direction for future in vivo applications.</description>

      <title>Accounting for Underspecification in Statistical Claims of Model Superiority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning methods are increasingly applied in medical imaging, yet many reported improvements lack statistical robustness: recent works have highlighted that small but significant performance gains are highly likely to be false positives. However, these analyses do not take \emph{underspecification} into account -- the fact that models achieving similar validation scores may behave differently on unseen data due to random initialization or training dynamics. Here, we extend a recent statistical framework modeling false outperformance claims to include underspecification as an additional variance component. Our simulations demonstrate that even modest seed variability ($\sim1\%$) substantially increases the evidence required to support superiority claims. Our findings underscore the need for explicit modeling of training variance when validating medical imaging systems.</description>

      <title>Cross-modal Diffusion Modelling for Super-resolved Spatial Transcriptomics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12973v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recent advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST) allows to characterize spatial gene expression within tissue for discovery research. However, current ST platforms suffer from low resolution, hindering in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, current super-resolution methods are limited by restoration uncertainty and mode collapse. Although diffusion models have shown promise in capturing complex interactions between multi-modal conditions, it remains a challenge to integrate histology images and gene expression for super-resolved ST maps. This paper proposes a cross-modal conditional diffusion model for super-resolving ST maps with the guidance of histology images. Specifically, we design a multi-modal disentangling network with cross-modal adaptive modulation to utilize complementary information from histology images and spatial gene expression. Moreover, we propose a dynamic cross-attention modelling strategy to extract hierarchical cell-to-tissue information from histology images. Lastly, we propose a co-expression-based gene-correlation graph network to model the co-expression relationship of multiple genes. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in ST super-resolution on three public datasets.</description>

      <title>Real World Federated Learning with a Knowledge Distilled Transformer for Cardiac CT Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07557v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Federated learning is a renowned technique for utilizing decentralized data while preserving privacy. However, real-world applications often face challenges like partially labeled datasets, where only a few locations have certain expert annotations, leaving large portions of unlabeled data unused. Leveraging these could enhance transformer architectures ability in regimes with small and diversely annotated sets. We conduct the largest federated cardiac CT analysis to date (n=8,104) in a real-world setting across eight hospitals. Our two-step semi-supervised strategy distills knowledge from task-specific CNNs into a transformer. First, CNNs predict on unlabeled data per label type and then the transformer learns from these predictions with label-specific heads. This improves predictive accuracy and enables simultaneous learning of all partial labels across the federation, and outperforms UNet-based models in generalizability on downstream tasks. Code and model weights are made openly available for leveraging future cardiac CT analysis.</description>

      <title>Joint Lossless Compression and Steganography for Medical Images via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01782v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have driven promising progress in lossless image compression. However, directly adopting existing paradigms for medical images suffers from an unsatisfactory trade-off between compression performance and efficiency. Moreover, existing LLM-based compressors often overlook the security of the compression process, which is critical in modern medical scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel joint lossless compression and steganography framework. Inspired by bit plane slicing (BPS), we find it feasible to securely embed privacy messages into medical images in an invisible manner. Based on this insight, an adaptive modalities decomposition strategy is first devised to partition the entire image into two segments, providing global and local modalities for subsequent dual-path lossless compression. During this dual-path stage, we innovatively propose a segmented message steganography algorithm within the local modality path to ensure the security of the compression process. Coupled with the proposed anatomical priors-based low-rank adaptation (A-LoRA) fine-tuning strategy, extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method in terms of compression ratios, efficiency, and security.

      <title>SatFusion: A Unified Framework for Enhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion</title>

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of the digital society, the proliferation of satellites in the Satellite Internet of Things (Sat-IoT) has led to the continuous accumulation of large-scale multi-temporal and multi-source images across diverse application scenarios. However, existing methods fail to fully exploit the complementary information embedded in both temporal and source dimensions. For example, Multi-Image Super-Resolution (MISR) enhances reconstruction quality by leveraging temporal complementarity across multiple observations, yet the limited fine-grained texture details in input images constrain its performance. Conversely, pansharpening integrates multi-source images by injecting high-frequency spatial information from panchromatic data, but typically relies on pre-interpolated low-resolution inputs and assumes noise-free alignment, making it highly sensitive to noise and misregistration. To address these issues, we propose SatFusion: A Unified Framework for Enhancing Satellite IoT Images via Multi-Temporal and Multi-Source Data Fusion. Specifically, SatFusion first employs a Multi-Temporal Image Fusion (MTIF) module to achieve deep feature alignment with the panchromatic image. Then, a Multi-Source Image Fusion (MSIF) module injects fine-grained texture information from the panchromatic data. Finally, a Fusion Composition module adaptively integrates the complementary advantages of both modalities while dynamically refining spectral consistency, supervised by a weighted combination of multiple loss functions. Extensive experiments on the WorldStrat, WV3, QB, and GF2 datasets demonstrate that SatFusion significantly improves fusion quality, robustness under challenging conditions, and generalizability to real-world Sat-IoT scenarios.

      <title>Invited Paper: BitMedViT: Ternary-Quantized Vision Transformer for Medical AI Assistants on the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13760</link>

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in interpreting complex medical imaging data. However, their significant computational and memory demands pose challenges for deployment in real-time, resource-constrained mobile and wearable devices used in clinical environments. We introduce, BiTMedViT, a new class of Edge ViTs serving as medical AI assistants that perform structured analysis of medical images directly on the edge. BiTMedViT utilizes ternary- quantized linear layers tailored for medical imaging and com- bines a training procedure with multi-query attention, preserving stability under ternary weights with low-precision activations. Furthermore, BiTMedViT employs task-aware distillation from a high-capacity teacher to recover accuracy lost due to extreme quantization. Lastly, we also present a pipeline that maps the ternarized ViTs to a custom CUDA kernel for efficient memory bandwidth utilization and latency reduction on the Jetson Orin Nano. Finally, BiTMedViT achieves 86% diagnostic accuracy (89% SOTA) on MedMNIST across 12 datasets, while reducing model size by 43x, memory traffic by 39x, and enabling 16.8 ms inference at an energy efficiency up to 41x that of SOTA models at 183.62 GOPs/J on the Orin Nano. Our results demonstrate a practical and scientifically grounded route for extreme-precision medical imaging ViTs deployable on the edge, narrowing the gap between algorithmic advances and deployable clinical tools.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Models for Enhanced Vitreous OCT Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00881</link>

Abstract: Purpose: To evaluate deep learning (DL) models for enhancing vitreous optical coherence tomography (OCT) image quality and reducing acquisition time. Methods: Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (cDDPMs), Brownian Bridge Diffusion Models (BBDMs), U-Net, Pix2Pix, and Vector-Quantised Generative Adversarial Network (VQ-GAN) were used to generate high-quality spectral-domain (SD) vitreous OCT images. Inputs were SD ART10 images, and outputs were compared to pseudoART100 images obtained by averaging ten ART10 images per eye location. Model performance was assessed using image quality metrics and Visual Turing Tests, where ophthalmologists ranked generated images and evaluated anatomical fidelity. The best model's performance was further tested within the manually segmented vitreous on newly acquired data. Results: U-Net achieved the highest Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR: 30.230) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM: 0.820), followed by cDDPM. For Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), Pix2Pix (0.697) and cDDPM (0.753) performed best. In the first Visual Turing Test, cDDPM ranked highest (3.07); in the second (best model only), cDDPM achieved a 32.9% fool rate and 85.7% anatomical preservation. On newly acquired data, cDDPM generated vitreous regions more similar in PSNR to the ART100 reference than true ART1 or ART10 B-scans and achieved higher PSNR on whole images when conditioned on ART1 than ART10. Conclusions: Results reveal discrepancies between quantitative metrics and clinical evaluation, highlighting the need for combined assessment. cDDPM showed strong potential for generating clinically meaningful vitreous OCT images while reducing acquisition time fourfold. Translational Relevance: cDDPMs show promise for clinical integration, supporting faster, higher-quality vitreous imaging. Dataset and code will be made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Video Super-Resolution: Towards Diffusion-Based Methods without Motion Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03355v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we rethink the approach to video super-resolution by introducing a method based on the Diffusion Posterior Sampling framework, combined with an unconditional video diffusion transformer operating in latent space. The video generation model, a diffusion transformer, functions as a space-time model. We argue that a powerful model, which learns the physics of the real world, can easily handle various kinds of motion patterns as prior knowledge, thus eliminating the need for explicit estimation of optical flows or motion parameters for pixel alignment. Furthermore, a single instance of the proposed video diffusion transformer model can adapt to different sampling conditions without re-training. Empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets illustrate the feasibility of diffusion-based, alignment-free video super-resolution.</description>
