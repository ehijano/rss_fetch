      <title>Recursive Optimal Stopping with Poisson Stopping Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper solves a recursive optimal stopping problem with Poisson stopping constraints using the penalized backward stochastic differential equation (PBSDE) with jumps. Stopping in this problem is only allowed at Poisson random intervention times, and jumps play a significant role not only through the stopping times but also in the recursive objective functional and model coefficients. To solve the problem, we propose a decomposition method based on Jacod-Pham that allows us to separate the problem into a series of sub-problems between each pair of consecutive Poisson stopping times. To represent the value function of the recursive optimal stopping problem when the initial time falls between two consecutive Poisson stopping times and the generator is concave/convex, we leverage the comparison theorem of BSDEs with jumps. We then apply the representation result to American option pricing in a nonlinear market with Poisson stopping constraints.</description>

      <title>Optimal market-neutral currency trading on the cryptocurrency platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15461v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This research proposes a novel arbitrage approach with respect to multivariate pair trading called Optimal Trading Technique (OTT). We introduce the method to selectively form a "bucket" of fiat currencies anchored to cryptocurrency for simultaneously monitoring and exploiting trading opportunities. To handle the quantitative conflicts that arise when receiving multiple trading signals, a bi-objective convex optimization process is designed to cater to the investor's preference between profitability and risk tolerance. This process includes tunable parameters such as volatility punishment, action thresholds. During our experiments in the cryptocurrency market from 2020 to 2022 when the market was experiencing a vigorous bull-run immediately followed by a bear-run, the OTT realized an annualized profit of 15.49%. We further carried out the experiments in bull, bear, and full-cycle market conditions separately, and found that OTT is capable of achieving stable profit under various market conditions. Apart from the profitability side of the OTT, the arbitrage operation provides a new perspective of trading, which requires no external shorting and never hold intermediate cryptocurrency during the arbitrage period.</description>
