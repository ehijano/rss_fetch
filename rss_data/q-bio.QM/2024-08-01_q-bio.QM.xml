      <title>Artificial Intelligence Enhanced Digital Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing for Precision Medicine and Molecular Diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise quantification of nucleic acids is pivotal in molecular biology, underscored by the rising prominence of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) in diagnosing infectious diseases and conducting genomic studies. This review examines recent advancements in digital Polymerase Chain Reaction (dPCR) and digital Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (dLAMP), which surpass the limitations of traditional NAAT by offering absolute quantification and enhanced sensitivity. In this review, we summarize the compelling advancements of dNNAT in addressing pressing public health issues, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we explore the transformative role of artificial intelligence (AI) in enhancing dNAAT image analysis, which not only improves efficiency and accuracy but also addresses traditional constraints related to cost, complexity, and data interpretation. In encompassing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) development and potential of both software and hardware, the all-encompassing Point-of-Care Testing (POCT) systems cast new light on benefits including higher throughput, label-free detection, and expanded multiplex analyses. While acknowledging the enhancement of AI-enhanced dNAAT technology, this review aims to both fill critical gaps in the existing technologies through comparative assessments and offer a balanced perspective on the current trajectory, including attendant challenges and future directions. Leveraging AI, next-generation dPCR and dLAMP technologies promises integration into clinical practice, improving personalized medicine, real-time epidemic surveillance, and global diagnostic accessibility.</description>

      <title>Plant and insect proteins support optimal bone growth and development; Evidences from a pre-clinical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By 2050, the global population will exceed 9 billion, demanding a 70% increase in food production. Animal proteins alone may not suffice and contribute to global warming. Alternative proteins such as legumes, algae, and insects are being explored, but their health impacts are largely unknown. For this, three-week-old rats were fed diets containing 20% protein from various sources for six weeks. A casein-based control diet was compared to soy isolate, spirulina powder, chickpea isolate, chickpea flour, and fly larvae powder. Except for spirulina, alternative protein groups showed comparable growth patterns to the casein group. Morphological and mechanical tests of femur bones matched growth patterns. Caecal 16S analysis highlighted the impact on gut microbiota diversity. Chickpea flour showed significantly lower $\alpha$-diversity compared with casein and chickpea isolate groups while chickpea flour, had the greatest distinction in $\beta$-diversity. Alternative protein sources supported optimal growth, but quality and health implications require further exploration.</description>

      <title>Post$-$operative glioblastoma cancer cell distribution in the peritumoural oedema</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the most aggressive primary brain tumour, exhibits low survival rates due to its rapid growth, infiltrates surrounding brain tissue, and is highly resistant to treatment. One major challenge is oedema infiltration, a fluid build$-$up that provides a path for cancer cells to invade other areas. MRI resolution is insufficient to detect these infiltrating cells, leading to relapses despite chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In this work, we propose a new multiscale mathematical modelling method, to explore the oedema infiltration and predict tumour relapses. To address tumour relapses, we investigated several possible scenarios for the distribution of remaining GBM cells within the oedema after surgery. Furthermore, in this computational modelling investigation on tumour relapse scenarios were investigated assuming the presence of clinically relevant chemo$-$radio therapy numerical results suggest that a higher concentration of GBM cells near the surgical cavity edge led to limited spread and slower progression of tumour relapse. Finally, we explore mathematical and computational avenues for reconstructing relevant shapes for the initial distributions of GBM cells within the oedema from available MRI scans. The results obtained show good overlap between our simulation and the patient serial MRI scans taken 881 days into the treatment. While still under analytical investigation, this work paves the way for robust reconstruction of tumour relapses from available clinical data.</description>

      <title>UMMAN: Unsupervised Multi-graph Merge Adversarial Network for Disease Prediction Based on Intestinal Flora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The abundance of intestinal flora is closely related to human diseases, but diseases are not caused by a single gut microbe. Instead, they result from the complex interplay of numerous microbial entities. This intricate and implicit connection among gut microbes poses a significant challenge for disease prediction using abundance information from OTU data. Recently, several methods have shown potential in predicting corresponding diseases. However, these methods fail to learn the inner association among gut microbes from different hosts, leading to unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we present a novel architecture, Unsupervised Multi-graph Merge Adversarial Network (UMMAN). UMMAN can obtain the embeddings of nodes in the Multi-Graph in an unsupervised scenario, so that it helps learn the multiplex association. Our method is the first to combine Graph Neural Network with the task of intestinal flora disease prediction. We employ complex relation-types to construct the Original-Graph and disrupt the relationships among nodes to generate corresponding Shuffled-Graph. We introduce the Node Feature Global Integration (NFGI) module to represent the global features of the graph. Furthermore, we design a joint loss comprising adversarial loss and hybrid attention loss to ensure that the real graph embedding aligns closely with the Original-Graph and diverges from the Shuffled-Graph. Comprehensive experiments on five classical OTU gut microbiome datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our method. (We will release our code soon.)</description>

      <title>DiffFit: Visually-Guided Differentiable Fitting of Molecule Structures to a Cryo-EM Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02465v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce DiffFit, a differentiable algorithm for fitting protein atomistic structures into an experimental reconstructed Cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) volume map. In structural biology, this process is necessary to semi-automatically composite large mesoscale models of complex protein assemblies and complete cellular structures that are based on measured cryo-EM data. The current approaches require manual fitting in three dimensions to start, resulting in approximately aligned structures followed by an automated fine-tuning of the alignment. The DiffFit approach enables domain scientists to fit new structures automatically and visualize the results for inspection and interactive revision. The fitting begins with differentiable three-dimensional (3D) rigid transformations of the protein atom coordinates followed by sampling the density values at the atom coordinates from the target cryo-EM volume. To ensure a meaningful correlation between the sampled densities and the protein structure, we proposed a novel loss function based on a multi-resolution volume-array approach and the exploitation of the negative space. This loss function serves as a critical metric for assessing the fitting quality, ensuring the fitting accuracy and an improved visualization of the results. We assessed the placement quality of DiffFit with several large, realistic datasets and found it to be superior to that of previous methods. We further evaluated our method in two use cases: automating the integration of known composite structures into larger protein complexes and facilitating the fitting of predicted protein domains into volume densities to aid researchers in identifying unknown proteins. We implemented our algorithm as an open-source plugin (github.com/nanovis/DiffFit) in ChimeraX, a leading visualization software in the field.

      <title>Non-Adaptive Multi-Stage Algorithm for Group Testing with Prior Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-stage algorithm for non-adaptive Group Testing (GT) with general correlated prior statistics. The proposed solution can be applied to any correlated statistical prior represented in trellis, e.g., finite state machines and Markov processes. We introduce a variation of List Viterbi Algorithm (LVA) to enable accurate recovery using much fewer tests than objectives, which efficiently gains from the correlated prior statistics structure. Our numerical results demonstrate that the proposed Multi-Stage GT (MSGT) algorithm can obtain the optimal Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) performance with feasible complexity in practical regimes, such as with COVID-19 and sparse signal recovery applications, and reduce in the scenarios tested the number of pooled tests by at least $25\%$ compared to existing classical low complexity GT algorithms. Moreover, we analytically characterize the complexity of the proposed MSGT algorithm that guarantees its efficiency.</description>
