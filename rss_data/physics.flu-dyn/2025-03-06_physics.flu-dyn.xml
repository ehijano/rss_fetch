      <title>Tradeoffs in Biconic Intake Aerodynamic Design Optimization with Sub-optimal Oswatitsch Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of sub-optimal Oswatitsch solutions is introduced in order to systematically conduct a tradeoff between total pressure recovery (TPR) and intake drag coefficient (CDi) for supersonic intakes. It is shown that the Oswatitsch-optimal TPR for a biconic intake may be enhanced by adding a conical flare which modifies the terminal normal shock into a novel Lambda shock structure. The optimization problem is formulated along the lines of Axiomatic Design Theory with the conical angle pair and the cowl fineness ratio as the two design parameters. Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations are performed to iteratively arrive at the optimal solutions, with and without an intake length constraint, for a fixed value of the intake mass flow rate. The results are used to generate the Pareto front in the space of the objective functions, which yields the set of solutions between which TPR and Cdi may be traded off for one another. Additionally, an off-Oswatitsch solution, where only the second cone angle is altered from its optimal Oswatitsch value, is obtained and is compared with the sub-optimal Oswatitsch solutions that form the Pareto front.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and energy dissipation from wave breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wave breaking is a critical process in the upper ocean: an energy sink for the surface wave field and a source for turbulence in the ocean surface boundary layer. We apply a novel multi-layer numerical solver resolving upper-ocean dynamics over scales from O(50cm) to O(1km), including a broad-banded wave field and wave breaking. The present numerical study isolates the effect of wave breaking and allows us to study the surface layer in wave-influenced and wave-breaking-dominated regimes. Following our previous work showing wave breaking statistics in agreement with field observations, we extend the analysis to underwater breaking-induced turbulence and related dissipation (in freely decaying conditions). We observe a rich field of vorticity resulting from the turbulence generation by breaking waves. We discuss the vertical profiles of dissipation rate which are compared with field observations, and propose an empirical universal shape function. Good agreement is found, further demonstrating that wave breaking can dominate turbulence generation in the near-surface layer. We examine the dissipation from different angles: the global dissipation of the wave field computed from the decaying wave field, the spectral dissipation from the fifth moment of breaking front distribution, and a turbulence dissipation estimated from the underwater strain rate tensor. Finally, we consider how these different estimates can be understood as part of a coherent framework.</description>

      <title>Industrialisation of spectral/hp element method for incompressible, transitional flow around Formula 1 geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study applies the high-fidelity spectral/hp element method using the open-source Nektar++ framework to simulate the unsteady, transitional flow around complex 3D geometries representative of the Formula 1 industry. This study extends the work on a previously investigated industrial benchmark, the Imperial Front Wing (IFW), derived from the McLaren MP4-17D race car's front wing and endplate design. A combined configuration of the IFW with a wheel in contact with a moving ground in a rolling state is considered, representing the first instance of such a configuration being simulated using higher-order methods. The rolling wheel combined with the IFW (IFW-W) provides the most realistic industrial configuration until now. The spectral/hp element method is applied to this test case to solve the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, simulating the flow at a Reynolds number of $\mathbf{2.2 \times 10^5}$. Time-averaged results from the unsteady simulation are compared to experimental Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) data to assess the model's fidelity, offering insights into its reliability for accurately representing key flow characteristics. This research addresses the challenges and requisites associated with achieving diverse levels of flow resolution using the under-resolved DNS/implicit LES approach.</description>

      <title>Transient and steady convection in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate thermal convection in a two-dimensional square box using the no-slip condition on all boundaries, and isothermal bottom and top walls and adiabatic sidewalls. We choose 0.1 and 1 for the Prandtl number and vary the Rayleigh number between $10^6$ and $10^{12}$. We particularly study the temporal evolution of integral transport quantities towards their steady states. Perhaps not surprisingly, the velocity field evolves more slowly than the thermal field. Its steady state is nominal in the sense that large-amplitude low-frequency oscillations persist around plausible averages. We study these oscillation characteristics.</description>

      <title>Influence of Membrane Characteristics on Efficiency of Vacuum Membrane Distillation: a Lattice Boltzmann Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With increasing water scarcity, membrane distillation technology has gained widespread attention as an innovative method for seawater desalination.However,existing studies often overlook the influence of membrane characteristics on mass transfer efficiency. This study, based on the lattice Boltzmann method,proposes a model for a novel Poly(tetraethynylpyrene) membrane material to reveal the influence of membrane characteristics on the performance of vacuum membrane distillation. The model considers the factors such as porosity, tortuosity, membrane thickness, pore size, membrane surface wettability and temperature difference on the permeate flux. The results show that the permeate flux increases linearly with the porosity and decreases exponentially with the tortuosity factor. There is an optimal membrane thickness range (2{\mu}m) beyond which the permeate flux decreases exponentially. In addition, the permeate flux increases exponentially with increasing temperature difference and pore size. Further analysis of the effect of membrane surface wettability shows that permeate flux increases with increasing hydrophobicity. Finally, the feed temperature and tortuosity factor have the largest effect on permeate flux,followed by membrane thickness and, subsequently, pore size. The model can be further extended to study other configurations of membrane distillation technologies.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic memory and Quincke rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spontaneous (so-called Quincke) rotation of an uncharged, solid, dielectric, spherical particle under a steady electric field is analyzed, accounting for the inertia of the particle and the transient fluid inertia, or ``hydrodynamic memory,'' due to the unsteady Stokes flow around the particle. The dynamics of the particle are encapsulated in three coupled nonlinear integro-differential equations for the evolution of the angular velocity of the particle, and the components of the induced dipole of the particle that are parallel and transverse to the applied field. These equations represent a generalization of the celebrated Lorenz system. A numerical solution of these `modified Lorenz equations' (MLE) shows that hydrodynamic memory leads to an increase in the threshold field strength for chaotic particle rotation, which is in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. Furthermore, hydrodynamic memory leads to an increase in the range of field strengths where multi-stability between steady and chaotic rotation occurs. At large field strengths, chaos ceases and the particle is predicted to execute periodic rotational motion.</description>

      <title>Steady undisturbed velocity correction scheme for Euler-Lagrange simulations near planar walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Euler-Lagrange (EL) point-particle simulations rely on hydrodynamic force closure models to accurately predict particle dynamics in flows. The closure models currently employed for dilute particle-laden flows require the undisturbed fluid velocity estimated at the particle center. Recovering this undisturbed velocity necessitates modeling the particle-induced disturbance on the flow. In this work, we present a new framework for velocity disturbance modeling near no-slip walls, suited for dilute gas-solid flows characterized by large Stokes numbers. For small disturbance Reynolds numbers, the velocity disturbance governing equations reduce to the steady Stokes equations. To exactly satisfy the no-slip and no-penetration boundary conditions for the velocity disturbance at the location of the planar wall, we employ the method of images to derive the Green's functions of the Stokes equations for Wendland and Gaussian force regularization kernels. An additional convolution product with a mesh-spacing dependent Gaussian kernel is performed to match the solution produced by a discrete flow solver. We verify the proposed analytical model by comparing the velocity disturbance generated on a computational mesh with the model predictions. An extension of the model for finite particle Reynolds numbers is proposed by multiplying an Oseen correction factor in an unbounded domain. The correction scheme is validated using canonical test cases involving the motion of a single particle parallel and perpendicular to a wall at various Stokes numbers, particle Reynolds numbers, and particle diameter to mesh-spacing ratios. Owing to the polynomial representation of the velocity disturbance for a Wendland force regularization, the current model is computationally efficient and well-suited for large-scale, two-way coupled EL simulations.</description>

      <title>Modelling of the dewetting of ultra-thin liquid films on chemically patterned substrates: linear spectrum and deposition patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Liquid films of nanometric thickness are prone to spinodal dewetting driven by disjoining pressure, meaning that a non-wetting liquid film of homogeneous thickness in the range of tens of nanometers will spontaneously break into droplets. The surface energy of the underlying solid substrate heavily influences the dynamics and resulting droplet configurations. Here, we study the dewetting of thin liquid films on physically flat but chemically heterogeneous substrates using the thin film equation. We use linear stability analysis (LSA) to describe and predict the system's behavior until the film ruptures and compare it to numerical simulations. Based on our calculations, we propose a potential method for measuring surface energy patterns. Furthermore, we study the non-linear dynamics and the eventually formed droplet pattern by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Structured Input-Output Modeling and Robust Stability Analysis of Compressible Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently introduced structured input-output analysis is a powerful method for capturing nonlinear phenomena associated with incompressible flows, and this paper extends that method to the compressible regime. The proposed method relies upon a reformulation of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, which allows for an exact quadratic formulation of the dynamics of perturbations about a steady base flow. To facilitate the structured input-output analysis, a pseudo-linear model for the quadratic nonlinearity is proposed and the structural information of the nonlinearity is embedded into a structured uncertainty comprising unknown `perturbations'. The structured singular value framework is employed to compute the input-output gain, which provides an estimate of the robust stability margin of the flow perturbations, as well as the forcing and response modes that are consistent with the nonlinearity structure. The analysis is then carried out on a plane, laminar compressible Couette flow over a range of Mach numbers. The structured input-output gains identify an instability mechanism, characterized by a spanwise elongated structure in the streamwise-spanwise wavenumber space at a subsonic Mach number, that takes the form of an oblique structure at sonic and supersonic Mach numbers. In addition, the structured input-output forcing and response modes provide insight into the thermodynamic and momentum characteristics associated with a source of instability. Comparisons with a resolvent/unstructured analysis reveal discrepancies in the distribution of input-output gains over the wavenumber space as well as in the modal behavior of an instability, thus highlighting the strong correlation between the structural information of the nonlinearity and the underlying flow physics.</description>

      <title>Scaling Function Learning: A sparse aerodynamic data reconstruction method for generalizing aircraft shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and complete aerodynamic data sets are the basis for comprehensive and accurate evaluation of the overall performance of aircraft. However, the sampling cost of full-state aerodynamic data is extremely high, and there are often differences between wind tunnel conditions and actual flight conditions. Conventional scaling parameter extraction methods can solve the problem of aerodynamic state extrapolation, but hard to achieve data migration and shape generalization. In order to realize the low-cost construction of a full-state nonlinear aerodynamic database, this research proposes the Scaling Function Learning (SFL) method. In SFL method, symbolic regression is used to mine the composite function expression of aerodynamic force coefficient for a relatively complete aerodynamic data set of typical aircraft. The inner layer of the function represents a scaling function. The SFL method was validated on the HB-2 by extracting scaling parameters for axial force coefficients and generalizing the scaling function by releasing its constants. The effectiveness and accuracy of the scaling function are verified using different hypersonic aircraft configurations, such as HBS, double ellipsoid, sharp cone, and double cone missile. The results show that the extracted scaling function has the ability to generalize across states and configurations. With only 3-4 state samples, the aerodynamic database construction of variable Mach number, angle of attack and Reynolds number can be realized, which shows great state extrapolation ability with a relative error of about 1-5%. This research also lays a methodological foundation for parameter space dimensionality reduction and small sample modeling of other complex high-dimensional engineering problems.</description>

      <title>Assessment of averaged 1D models for column adsorption with 3D computational experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present manuscript, we formulate a 3D mathematical model describing the capture of a contaminant in an adsorption column. The novelty of our approach involves the description of mass transfer by adsorption via a nonlinear evolution equation defined on the surface of the porous media, while Stokes flow and an advection-diffusion equation describe the contaminant transport through the interstices. Numerical simulations of the 3D model on different porous geometries, with the same porosity but different microstructure, have revealed a minimal impact of the microstructure on contaminant distribution within the column. Of particular interest is the little variation in the radial direction. Then, assuming a fine structure made of a periodic array of spheres and employing homogenization theory, we have rigorously derived an averaged 1D model of column adsorption. The model has the same mathematical form than the standard 1D column adsorption model, but contains a dispersion coefficient that explicitly incorporates microstructural details of the porous media. Consequently, our model offers a theoretical foundation for the widely used 1D model in the literature. Lastly, we compare the numerical solution of the 1D model with numerical simulations of the 3D model. The concentration profiles of the 1D model closely match the cross-section averaged concentration profiles of the 3D model. Likewise, the contaminant breakthrough curves at the outlet of both models are nearly indistinguishable. These results confirm the reliability of 1D models for investigating, optimizing, and aiding in the design of column adsorption processes for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Turbulence Modeling for Separated Flows Considering Non-Local Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study aims to enhance the generalizability of Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models, which are crucial for engineering applications. Classic RANS turbulence models often struggle to predict separated flows accurately. Recently, Data-driven machine learning approaches for turbulence modeling have been explored to address this issue. However, these models are often criticized for their limited generalizability. In this study, we address this issue by incorporating non-local effects into data-driven turbulence modeling. Specifically, we introduce a transport equation for the correction term \b{eta} of the shear stress transport (SST) model to encode non-local information along the mean streamline. The coefficients of the equation are calibrated using high-fidelity data from the NASA hump and periodic hills. The resulting model, termed the \b{eta}-Transport model, demonstrates high accuracy across various separated flows outside the training set, including periodic hills with different geometries and Reynolds numbers, the curved backward-facing step, a two-dimensional bump, and a three-dimensional simplified car body. In all tested cases, the \b{eta}-Transport model yields smaller or equal prediction errors compared to those from classic local data-driven turbulence models using algebraic relations for \b{eta}. These results indicate improved generalizability for separated flows. Furthermore, the \b{eta}-Transport model shows similar accuracy to the baseline model in basic flows including the mixing layer and the channel flow. Therefore, the non-local modeling approach presented here offers a promising pathway for developing more generalizable data-driven turbulence models.</description>

      <title>Classifying acoustic cavitation with machine learning trained on multiple physical models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16142v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Acoustic cavitation threshold charts are used to map between acoustic parameters (mainly intensity and frequency) and different regimes of acoustic cavitation. The two main regimes are transient cavitation, where a bubble collapses, and stable cavitation, where a bubble undergoes periodic oscillations without collapse. The cavitation charts strongly depend on the physical model used to compute the bubble dynamics and the algorithm for classifying the cavitation threshold. The differences between modeling approaches become especially noticeable for resonant bubbles and when sonication parameters result in large-amplitude oscillations. This paper proposes a machine learning approach that integrates three physical models, i.e., the Rayleigh-Plesset, Keller-Miksis and Gilmore equations, and multiple cavitation classification techniques. Specifically, we classify the cavitation regimes based on the maximum radius, the acoustic Mach number, the kurtosis factor of acoustic emissions, and the Flynn criterion on the inertial and pressure functions. Four machine learning strategies were developed to predict the likelihood of the transient and stable cavitation, using equally weighted contributions from classification techniques. By solving the differential equations for bubble dynamics across a range of sonication and material parameters and applying cross-validation on held-out test data, our framework demonstrates high predictive accuracy for cavitation regimes. This physics-informed machine learning approach offers probabilistic insights into cavitation likelihood, combining diverse physical models and classification strategies, each contributing different levels of physical rigor and interpretability.</description>
