      <title>Interpretable cancer cell detection with phonon microscopy using multi-task conditional neural networks for inter-batch calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) show great potential in revealing underlying information from phonon microscopy (high-frequency ultrasound) data to identify cancerous cells. However, this technology suffers from the 'batch effect' that comes from unavoidable technical variations between each experiment, creating confounding variables that the AI model may inadvertently learn. We therefore present a multi-task conditional neural network framework to simultaneously achieve inter-batch calibration, by removing confounding variables, and accurate cell classification of time-resolved phonon-derived signals. We validate our approach by training and validating on different experimental batches, achieving a balanced precision of 89.22% and an average cross-validated precision of 89.07% for classifying background, healthy and cancerous regions. Classification can be performed in 0.5 seconds with only simple prior batch information required for multiple batch corrections. Further, we extend our model to reconstruct denoised signals, enabling physical interpretation of salient features indicating disease state including sound velocity, sound attenuation and cell-adhesion to substrate.</description>

      <title>FluxGAT: Integrating Flux Sampling with Graph Neural Networks for Unbiased Gene Essentiality Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gene essentiality, the necessity of a specific gene for the survival of an organism, is crucial to our understanding of cellular processes and identifying drug targets. Experimental determination of gene essentiality requires large growth screens that are time-consuming and expensive, motivating the development of in-silico approaches. Existing methods predominantly utilise flux balance analysis (FBA), a constraint-based optimisation algorithm; however, they are fundamentally limited by the necessity of a predefined cellular objective function. This requirement introduces an element of observer bias, as the objective function often reflects the researcher's assumptions rather than the cell's biological goals. Here, we present FluxGAT, a graph neural network (GNN) model capable of predicting gene essentiality directly from graphical representations of flux sampling data. Flux sampling removes the need for objective functions, thereby eliminating observer bias. FluxGAT leverages the unique strengths of GNNs in learning representations of complex relationships within metabolic reaction networks. The success of our approach in predicting experimentally determined gene essentiality, with almost double the sensitivity of FBA, explores the possibility of predicting cellular phenotypes in cases when objectives are less understood. Thus, we demonstrate a method for more general gene essentiality predictions across a broader spectrum of biological systems and environments.</description>

      <title>Cross-system biological image quality enhancement based on the generative adversarial network as a foundation for establishing a multi-institute microscopy cooperative network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-quality fluorescence imaging of biological systems is limited by processes like photobleaching and phototoxicity, and also in many cases, by limited access to the latest generations of microscopes. Moreover, low temporal resolution can lead to a motion blur effect in living systems. Our work presents a deep learning (DL) generative-adversarial approach to the problem of obtaining high-quality (HQ) images based on their low-quality (LQ) equivalents. We propose a generative-adversarial network (GAN) for contrast transfer between two different separate microscopy systems: a confocal microscope (producing HQ images) and a wide-field fluorescence microscope (producing LQ images). Our model proves that such transfer is possible, allowing us to receive HQ-generated images characterized by low mean squared error (MSE) values, high structural similarity index (SSIM), and high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values. For our best model in the case of comparing HQ-generated images and HQ-ground truth images, the median values of the metrics are 6x10-4, 0.9413, and 31.87, for MSE, SSIM, and PSNR, respectively. In contrast, in the case of comparison between LQ and HQ ground truth median values of the metrics are equal to 0.0071, 0.8304, and 21.48 for MSE, SSIM, and PSNR respectively. Therefore, we observe a significant increase ranging from 14% to 49% for SSIM and PSNR respectively. These results, together with other single-system cross-modality studies, provide proof of concept for further implementation of a cross-system biological image quality enhancement.</description>

      <title>Negative Spillover: A Potential Source of Bias in Pragmatic Clinical Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.10978v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pragmatic clinical trials evaluate the effectiveness of health interventions in real-world settings. Negative spillover can arise in a pragmatic trial if the study intervention affects how scarce resources are allocated between patients in the intervention and comparison groups. This can harm patients assigned to the control group and lead to overestimation of treatment effect. While this type of negative spillover is often addressed in trials of social welfare and public health interventions, there is little recognition of this source of bias in the medical literature. In this article, I examine what causes negative spillover and how it may have led clinical trial investigators to overestimate the effect of patient navigation, AI-based physiological alarms, and elective induction of labor. I also suggest ways to detect negative spillover and design trials that avoid this potential source of bias.</description>
