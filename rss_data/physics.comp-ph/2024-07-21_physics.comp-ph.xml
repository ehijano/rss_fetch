      <title>Application of a spectral scheme to simulate horizontally slowly varying three-dimensional ocean acoustic propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional numerical models for underwater sound propagation are popular in computational ocean acoustics. For horizontally slowly varying waveguide environments, an adiabatic mode-parabolic equation hybrid theory can be used for simulation. This theory employs adiabatic modes in the vertical direction, simplifying the solution of the sound pressure to the solution of horizontal refractive index of vertical modes. The refractive equations in the horizontal direction are further solved by a ``split-step" wide-angle parabolic equation model, following the approach of the ``vertical modes and horizontal parabolic equation". Existing three-dimensional sound propagation models mostly use finite difference methods for discretization, but in recent years, the academic community has proposed new types of sound propagation models based on spectral methods. Spectral methods are numerical discretization methods based on orthogonal polynomial approximation and weighted residual principles. They offer advantages such as high computational accuracy and fast convergence. In this study, a three-dimensional adiabatic mode-parabolic equation hybrid model discretized using spectral methods is proposed. In the vertical direction, the modal functions are solved using the Chebyshev spectral method. The medium layering is handled using a domain decomposition strategy, and the leaky modes under semi-infinite boundary conditions are addressed using an eigenvalue transformation technique. In the horizontal direction, the perfectly matched layer technique is utilized to handle unbounded computational domains, and the perfectly matched layer and computational domain are segmented into multiple layers. Numerical simulations show that the Chebyshev spectral method achieves reliable results in the application of the adiabatic mode-parabolic equation hybrid model.</description>

      <title>Evidential Deep Learning for Interatomic Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have been widely used to facilitate large scale molecular simulations with ab initio level accuracy. However, MLIP-based molecular simulations frequently encounter the issue of collapse due to decreased prediction accuracy for out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To mitigate this issue, it is crucial to enrich the training set with active learning, where uncertainty estimation serves as an effective method for identifying and collecting OOD data. Therefore, a feasible method for uncertainty estimation in MLIPs is desired. The existing methods either require expensive computations or compromise prediction accuracy. In this work, we introduce evidential deep learning for interatomic potentials (eIP) with a physics-inspired design. Our experiments demonstrate that eIP consistently generates reliable uncertainties without incurring notable additional computational costs, while the prediction accuracy remains unchanged. Furthermore, we present an eIP-based active learning workflow, where eIP is used not only to estimate the uncertainty of molecular data but also to perform uncertainty-driven dynamics simulations. Our findings show that eIP enables efficient sampling for a more diverse dataset, thereby advancing the feasibility of MLIP-based molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>Discrete element method model of soot aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soot is a component of atmospheric aerosols that affects climate by scattering and absorbing the sunlight. Soot particles are fractal aggregates composed of elemental carbon. In the atmosphere, the aggregates acquire coatings by condensation and coagulation, resulting in significant compaction of the aggregates that changes the direct climate forcing of soot. Currently, no models exist to rigorously describe the process of soot restructuring, reducing prediction accuracy of atmospheric aerosol models. We develop a discrete element method contact model to simulate restructuring of fractal soot aggregates, represented as assemblies of spheres joined by cohesion and by sintered necks. The model is parametrized based on atomic force spectroscopy data and is used to simulate soot restructuring, showing that the fraction of necks in aggregates determines the restructuring pathway. Aggregates with fewer necks undergo local compaction, while aggregates with nearly-full necking prefer global compaction. Additionally, full compaction occurs within tens of nanoseconds, orders of magnitude faster than the time scale of soot aging through condensation. An important implication is that in atmospheric soot aggregates, the rate of condensation determines how many necks are fractured simultaneously, affecting the restructuring pathway, e.g., producing highly compact, thinly-coated soot as observed in recent studies.</description>

      <title>Deep learning density functional theory Hamiltonian in real space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning electronic structures from ab initio calculations holds great potential to revolutionize computational materials studies. While existing methods proved success in deep-learning density functional theory (DFT) Hamiltonian matrices, they are limited to DFT programs using localized atomic-like bases and heavily depend on the form of the bases. Here, we propose the DeepH-r method for deep-learning DFT Hamiltonians in real space, facilitating the prediction of DFT Hamiltonian in a basis-independent manner. An equivariant neural network architecture for modeling the real-space DFT potential is developed, targeting a more fundamental quantity in DFT. The real-space potential exhibits simplified principles of equivariance and enhanced nearsightedness, further boosting the performance of deep learning. When applied to evaluate the Hamiltonian matrix, this method significantly improved in accuracy, as exemplified in multiple case studies. Given the abundance of data in the real-space potential, this work may pave a novel pathway for establishing a ``large materials model" with increased accuracy.</description>

      <title>Fourier's law breakdown for the planar-rotor chain with long-range coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermal conductivity, $\kappa$, of a homogeneous chain of generically-ranged interacting planar rotors, more precisely the inertial $\alpha-XY$ model, is numerically studied with the coupling constant decaying as $r^{-\alpha}$. The conductance ($\sigma\equiv \kappa/L$) is calculated for typical values of $\alpha$, temperature $T$ and lattice size $L$. For large $L$, the results can be collapsed into an universal $q$-stretched exponential form, namely $L^{\delta_{\alpha}} \sigma \propto e_{q_{\alpha}}^{-B_{\alpha}(L^{\gamma_{\alpha}}T)^{\eta_{\alpha}}}$, where $e_q^z\equiv [1+ (1-q)z]^{1/(1-q)}$. The parameters $(\gamma_{\alpha},\delta_{\alpha},B_{\alpha}, \eta_{\alpha})$ are $\alpha$-dependent, and $q_{\alpha}$ is the index of the $q$-stretched exponential. This form is achievable due to the ratio $\eta_{\alpha}/(q-1)$ being almost constant with respect to the lattice size $L$. Two distinct regimes are identified: for $0 \le \alpha &lt; 2$, the Fourier law is violated, whereas for $\alpha\ge 2$, it is satisfied. These findings provide significant insights into heat conduction mechanisms in systems with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Cluster Sliding Ferroelectricity in Trilayer Quasi-Hexagonal C60</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric polarization typically originates from non-centrosymmetric charge distributions. Since chemical bonds between atoms of the same elements favor centrosymmetric crystal structures and symmetrically distributed electron charges, elemental ferroelectrics are extremely rare. In comparison to atoms, elemental clusters are less symmetric and typically have various preferred orientations in crystals. Consequently, the assembly of clusters with different orientations tends to break the inversion symmetry. Based on this concept, we show that sliding ferroelectricity naturally emerges in trilayer quasi-hexagonal phase (qHP) C60, a cluster-assembled carbon allotrope recently synthesized. Trilayer qHP C60's have several stable polar structures, which are distinguishable in second-harmonic generation (SHG) responses. Compared to previously found elemental ferroelectrics, trilayer qHP C60's have sizable band gaps and some of them have both switchable out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations. Remarkably, the out-of-plane and in-plane polarizations are decoupled, enabling an easy-to-implement construction of Van der Waals homostructures with ferroelectrically switchable chirality.</description>

      <title>Initial tensor construction and dependence of the tensor renormalization group on initial tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to construct a tensor network representation of partition functions without singular value decompositions nor series expansions. The approach is demonstrated for one- and two-dimensional Ising models and we study the dependence of the tensor renormalization group (TRG) on the form of the initial tensors and their symmetries. We further introduce variants of several tensor renormalization algorithms. Our benchmarks reveal a significant dependence of various TRG algorithms on the choice of initial tensors and their symmetries. However, we show that the boundary TRG technique can eliminate the initial tensor dependence for all TRG methods. The numerical results of TRG calculations can thus be made significantly more robust with only a few changes in the code. Furthermore, we study a three-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory without gauge-fixing and confirm the applicability of the initial tensor construction. Our method can straightforwardly be applied to systems with longer range and multi-site interactions, such as the next-nearest neighbor Ising model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An increasing interest in molecular structures whose long term dynamics resemble those of bistable mechanical systems promotes the the search of possible candidates that may operate as two-state switching units. Of particular interest are the systems that are capable to exhibit such bistable effects as spontaneous vibrations, stochastic resonance and spontaneous synchronization. Previously, in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations it has been demonstrated that short pyridine-furan springs show these bistable phenomena. In this article we introduce a coarse-grained model of such springs and investigate the possibility to observe the bistability effects, such as spontaneous vibrations, in such model. Our findings allow the studies of short pyridine-furan springs at large time an length scales and open field for further computational research of large bistable systems.</description>

      <title>Edge Formation Mechanism of Single-Walled Carbon Nanotube Revealed by Molecular Dynamics Simulations based on a Neural Network Potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.09264v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the high potential for applications utilizing the unique properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs), the applications remain challenging due to the difficulty of synthesizing SWCNTs with a specific chirality. To elucidate the mechanisms that determine their chirality during growth, intensive efforts have been devoted to classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. However, the mechanism of chirality determination has not been fully clarified, which can partly be attributed to the limited accuracy of empirical interatomic potentials in reproducing the behavior of carbon and metal atoms. In this work, we develop a neural network potential (NNP) for carbon-metal system to accurately describe the SWCNT growth, and perform MD simulations of SWCNT growth using the NNP. The MD simulations demonstrate the process of defect-free chirality-definable SWCNT growth with dynamic rearrangement of edge configurations, and the consistency between the probability of edge configuration appearance and the entropy-driven edge stability predicted from the nanotube-catalyst interfacial energy. It is also shown that the edge defect formation is induced by vacancy and suppressed by vacancy healing through adatom diffusion on the SWCNT edges. These results provide insights into the edge formation thermodynamics and kinetics of SWCNTs, an important clue to the chirality-controlled synthesis of SWCNTs.</description>

Abstract: Deep-learning density functional theory (DFT) shows great promise to significantly accelerate material discovery and potentially revolutionize materials research. However, current research in this field primarily relies on data-driven supervised learning, making the developments of neural networks and DFT isolated from each other. In this work, we present a theoretical framework of neural-network DFT, which unifies the optimization of neural networks with the variational computation of DFT, enabling physics-informed unsupervised learning. Moreover, we develop a differential DFT code incorporated with deep-learning DFT Hamiltonian, and introduce algorithms of automatic differentiation and backpropagation into DFT, demonstrating the capability of neural-network DFT. The physics-informed neural-network architecture not only surpasses conventional approaches in accuracy and efficiency, but also offers a new paradigm for developing deep-learning DFT methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generalization of the discrete Lehmann representation (DLR) to three-point correlation and vertex functions in imaginary time and Matsubara frequency. The representation takes the form of a linear combination of judiciously chosen exponentials in imaginary time, and products of simple poles in Matsubara frequency, which are universal for a given temperature and energy cutoff. We present a systematic algorithm to generate compact sampling grids, from which the coefficients of such an expansion can be obtained by solving a linear system. We show that the explicit form of the representation can be used to evaluate diagrammatic expressions involving infinite Matsubara sums, such as polarization functions or self-energies, with controllable, high-order accuracy. This collection of techniques establishes a framework through which methods involving three-point objects can be implemented robustly, with a substantially reduced computational cost and memory footprint.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1809.01002v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We look at computational physics from an electrical engineering perspective and suggest that several concepts of mathematics, not so well-established in computational physics literature, present themselves as opportunities in the field. We discuss elliptic complexes and highlight the category theoretical background and its role as a unifying language between algebraic topology, differential geometry, and modelling software design. In particular, the ubiquitous concept of naturality is central. Natural differential operators have functorial analogues on the cochains of triangulated manifolds. In order to establish this correspondence, we derive formulas involving simplices and barycentric coordinates, defining discrete vector fields and a discrete Lie derivative as a result of a discrete analogue of Cartan's magic formula. This theorem is the main mathematical result of the paper.</description>

      <title>Waveflow: boundary-conditioned normalizing flows applied to fermionic wavefunctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14839v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An efficient and expressive wavefunction ansatz is key to scalable solutions for complex many-body electronic structures. While Slater determinants are predominantly used for constructing antisymmetric electronic wavefunction ans\"{a}tze, this construction can result in limited expressiveness when the targeted wavefunction is highly complex. In this work, we introduce Waveflow, an innovative framework for learning many-body fermionic wavefunctions using boundary-conditioned normalizing flows. Instead of relying on Slater determinants, Waveflow imposes antisymmetry by defining the fundamental domain of the wavefunction and applying necessary boundary conditions. A key challenge in using normalizing flows for this purpose is addressing the topological mismatch between the prior and target distributions. We propose using O-spline priors and I-spline bijections to handle this mismatch, which allows for flexibility in the node number of the distribution while automatically maintaining its square-normalization property. We apply Waveflow to a one-dimensional many-electron system, where we variationally minimize the system's energy using variational quantum Monte Carlo (VQMC). Our experiments demonstrate that Waveflow can effectively resolve topological mismatches and faithfully learn the ground-state wavefunction.</description>

      <title>Polynomial propagators for classical molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical molecular dynamics simulation is performed mostly using the established velocity Verlet integrator or other symplectic propagation schemes. In this work, an alternative formulation of numerical propagators for classical molecular dynamics is introduced based on an expansion of the time evolution operator in series of Chebyshev and Newton polynomials. The suggested propagators have, in principle, arbitrary order of accuracy which can be controlled by the choice of expansion order after that the series is truncated. However, the expansion converges only after a minimum number of terms is included in the expansion and this number increases linearly with the time step size. Measurements of the energy drift demonstrate the acceptable long-time stability of the polynomial propagators. It is shown that a system of interacting Lennard-Jones particles is tractable by the proposed technique and that the scaling with the expansion order is only polynomial while the scaling with the number of particles is the same as with the conventional velocity Verlet. The proposed method is, in principle, extendable for further interaction force fields and for integration with a thermostat, and can be parallelized to speed up the computation of every time step.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel method for identifying transients suitable for both strong signal-dominated and background-dominated objects. By employing the unsupervised machine learning algorithm known as Expectation Maximization, we achieve computing time reductions of over $10^4$ on a single CPU compared to conventional brute-force methods. Furthermore, this approach can be readily extended to analyze multiple flares. We illustrate the algorithm's application by fitting the IceCube neutrino flare of TXS 0506+056.</description>
