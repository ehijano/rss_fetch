      <title>The First Known Problem That Is FPT with Respect to Node Scanwidth but Not Treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural parameters of graphs, such as treewidth, play a central role in the study of the parameterized complexity of graph problems. Motivated by the study of parametrized algorithms on phylogenetic networks, scanwidth was introduced recently as a new treewidth-like structural parameter for directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that respects the edge directions in the DAG. The utility of this width measure has been demonstrated by results that show that a number of problems that are fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to both treewidth and scanwidth allow algorithms with a better dependence on scanwidth than on treewidth. More importantly, these scanwidth-based algorithms are often much simpler than their treewidth-based counterparts: the name ``scanwidth'' reflects that traversing a tree extension (the scanwidth-equivalent of a tree decomposition) of a DAG amounts to ``scanning'' the DAG according to a well-chosen topological ordering. While these results show that scanwidth is useful especially for solving problems on phylogenetic networks, all problems studied through the lens of scanwidth so far are either FPT with respect to both scanwidth and treewidth, or W[$\ell$]-hard, for some $\ell \ge 1$, with respect to both. In this paper, we show that scanwidth is not just a proxy for treewidth and provides information about the structure of the input graph not provided by treewidth, by proving a fairly stark complexity-theoretic separation between these two width measures. Specifically, we prove that Weighted Phylogenetic Diversity with Dependencies is FPT with respect to the scanwidth of the food web but W[$\ell$]-hard with respect to its treewidth, for all $\ell \ge 1$. To the best of our knowledge, no such separation between these two width measures has been shown for any problem before.</description>

      <title>Makespan Minimization in Split Learning: From Theory to Practice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Split learning recently emerged as a solution for distributed machine learning with heterogeneous IoT devices, where clients can offload part of their training to computationally-powerful helpers. The core challenge in split learning is to minimize the training time by jointly devising the client-helper assignment and the schedule of tasks at the helpers. We first study the model where each helper has a memory cardinality constraint on how many clients it may be assigned, which represents the case of homogeneous tasks. Through complexity theory, we rule out exact polynomial-time algorithms and approximation schemes even for highly restricted instances of this problem. We complement these negative results with a non-trivial polynomial-time 5-approximation algorithm. Building on this, we then focus on the more general heterogeneous task setting considered by Tirana et al. [INFOCOM 2024], where helpers have memory capacity constraints and clients have variable memory costs. In this case, we prove that, unless P=NP, the problem cannot admit a polynomial-time approximation algorithm for any approximation factor. However, by adapting our aforementioned 5-approximation algorithm, we develop a novel heuristic for the heterogeneous task setting and show that it outperforms heuristics from prior works through extensive experiments.</description>

      <title>Derandomizing Isolation In Catalytic Logspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09374v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A language is said to be in catalytic logspace if we can test membership using a deterministic logspace machine that has an additional read/write tape filled with arbitrary data whose contents have to be restored to their original value at the end of the computation. The model of catalytic computation was introduced by Buhrman et al [STOC2014].
  As our first result, we obtain a catalytic logspace algorithm for computing a minimum weight witness to a search problem, with small weights, provided the algorithm is given oracle access for the corresponding weighted decision problem. In particular, our reduction yields CL algorithms for the search versions of the following three problems: planar perfect matching, planar exact perfect matching and weighted arborescences in weighted digraphs.
  Our second set of results concern the significantly larger class CL^{NP}_{2-round}. We show that CL^{NP}_{2-round} contains SearchSAT and the complexity classes BPP, MA and ZPP^{NP[1]}. While SearchSAT is shown to be in CL^{NP}_{2-round} using the isolation lemma, the other three containments, while based on the compress-or-random technique, use the Nisan-Wigderson [JCSS 1994] based pseudo-random generator. These containments show that CL^{NP}_{2-round} resembles ZPP^NP more than P^{NP}, providing some weak evidence that CL is more like ZPP than P.
  For our third set of results we turn to isolation well inside catalytic classes. We consider the unambiguous catalytic class CTISP[poly(n),logn,log^2n]^UL and show that it contains reachability and therefore NL. This is a catalytic version of the result of van Melkebeek &amp; Prakriya [SIAM J. Comput. 2019]. Building on their result, we also show a tradeoff between the workspace of the oracle and the catalytic space of the base machine. Finally, we extend these catalytic upper bounds to LogCFL.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of estimating ground state entanglement and free energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the entanglement structure of local Hamiltonian ground spaces is a physically motivated problem, with applications ranging from tensor network design to quantum error-correcting codes. To this end, we study the complexity of estimating ground state entanglement, and more generally entropy estimation for low energy states and Gibbs states. We find, in particular, that the classes qq-QAM [Kobayashi, le Gall, Nishimura, SICOMP 2019] (a quantum analogue of public-coin AM) and QMA(2) (QMA with unentangled proofs) play a crucial role for such problems, showing: (1) Detecting a high-entanglement ground state is qq-QAM-complete, (2) computing an additive error approximation to the Helmholtz free energy (equivalently, a multiplicative error approximation to the partition function) is in qq-QAM, (3) detecting a low-entanglement ground state is QMA(2)-hard, and (4) detecting low energy states which are close to product states can range from QMA-complete to QMA(2)-complete. Our results make progress on an open question of [Bravyi, Chowdhury, Gosset and Wocjan, Nature Physics 2022] on free energy, and yield the first QMA(2)-complete Hamiltonian problem using local Hamiltonians (cf. the sparse QMA(2)-complete Hamiltonian problem of [Chailloux, Sattath, CCC 2012]).</description>

      <title>Context-Free Recognition with Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transformers excel empirically on tasks that process well-formed inputs according to some grammar, such as natural language and code. However, it remains unclear how they can process grammatical syntax. In fact, under standard complexity conjectures, standard transformers cannot recognize context-free languages (CFLs), a canonical formalism to describe syntax, or even regular languages, a subclass of CFLs. Past work proves that $\mathcal{O}(\log(n))$ looping layers (w.r.t. input length n) allows transformers to recognize regular languages, but the question of context-free recognition remained open. In this work, we show that looped transformers with $\mathcal{O}(\log(n))$ looping layers and $\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ padding tokens can recognize all CFLs. However, training and inference with $\mathcal{O}(n^6)$ padding tokens is potentially impractical. Fortunately, we show that, for natural subclasses such as unambiguous CFLs, the recognition problem on transformers becomes more tractable, requiring $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ padding. We empirically validate our results and show that looping helps on a language that provably requires logarithmic depth. Overall, our results shed light on the intricacy of CFL recognition by transformers: While general recognition may require an intractable amount of padding, natural constraints such as unambiguity yield efficient recognition algorithms.</description>
