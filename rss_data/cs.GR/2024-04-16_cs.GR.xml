      <title>Efficient evaluation of Bernstein-B\'{e}zier coefficients of B-spline basis functions over one knot span</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: New differential-recurrence relations for B-spline basis functions are given. Using these relations, a recursive method for finding the Bernstein-B\'{e}zier coefficients of B-spline basis functions over a single knot span is proposed. The algorithm works for any knot sequence which guarantees that all B-spline functions are at least $C^0$-continuous. It has good numerical behavior and has an asymptotically optimal computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Generating Human Interaction Motions in Scenes with Text Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present TeSMo, a method for text-controlled scene-aware motion generation based on denoising diffusion models. Previous text-to-motion methods focus on characters in isolation without considering scenes due to the limited availability of datasets that include motion, text descriptions, and interactive scenes. Our approach begins with pre-training a scene-agnostic text-to-motion diffusion model, emphasizing goal-reaching constraints on large-scale motion-capture datasets. We then enhance this model with a scene-aware component, fine-tuned using data augmented with detailed scene information, including ground plane and object shapes. To facilitate training, we embed annotated navigation and interaction motions within scenes. The proposed method produces realistic and diverse human-object interactions, such as navigation and sitting, in different scenes with various object shapes, orientations, initial body positions, and poses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach surpasses prior techniques in terms of the plausibility of human-scene interactions, as well as the realism and variety of the generated motions. Code will be released upon publication of this work at https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/tesmo.</description>

      <title>Fluid Implicit Particle Simulation for CPU and GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the current challenges in physically-based simulations, and, more specifically, fluid simulations, is to produce visually appealing results at interactive rates, capable of being used in multiple forms of media. In recent times, a lot of effort has been made with regards to this with the use of multi-core architectures, as many of the computations involved in the algorithms for these simulations are very well suited for these architectures. Although there is a considerable amount of works regarding acceleration techniques in this field, there is yet room to further explore and analyze some of them. To investigate this problem, we surveyed the topic of fluid simulations and some of the recent contributions towards this field. Additionally, we implemented two versions of a fluid simulation algorithm, one on the CPU and the other on the GPU using NVIDIA's CUDA framework, with the intent of gaining a better understanding of the effort needed to move these simulations to a multi-core architecture and the performance gains that we get with it.</description>

      <title>Objects as volumes: A stochastic geometry view of opaque solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory for the representation of opaque solids as volumes. Starting from a stochastic representation of opaque solids as random indicator functions, we prove the conditions under which such solids can be modeled using exponential volumetric transport. We also derive expressions for the volumetric attenuation coefficient as a functional of the probability distributions of the underlying indicator functions. We generalize our theory to account for isotropic and anisotropic scattering at different parts of the solid, and for representations of opaque solids as stochastic implicit surfaces. We derive our volumetric representation from first principles, which ensures that it satisfies physical constraints such as reciprocity and reversibility. We use our theory to explain, compare, and correct previous volumetric representations, as well as propose meaningful extensions that lead to improved performance in 3D reconstruction tasks.</description>
