      <title>Derivation and physical interpretation of the general solutions to the wave equations for electromagnetic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inhomogeneous wave equations for the scalar, vector, and Hertz potentials are derived starting from retarded charge, current, and polarization densities and then solved in the reciprocal (or k-) space to obtain general solutions, which are formulated as nested integrals of such densities over the source volume, k-space, and time. The solutions thus obtained are inherently free of spatial singularities and do not require introduction by fiat of combinations of advanced and retarded terms as done previously to cure such singularities for the point-charge model. Physical implications of these general solutions are discussed in the context of specific examples involving either the real or reciprocal space forms of the different potentials. The present approach allows for k-space expansions of the potentials for arbitrary distributions of charges and may lead to applications in condensed matter and fluorescence-based imaging.</description>

      <title>Deeper understandings of the gauge theory for the first order inhomogeneous linear elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our previous study [1] has demonstrated that the gauge theory is a proper framework for characterizing the local temporal and spatial interactions in inhomogeneous elastic media. However, in that study temporal interactions were interpreted as the compensation for the loss of kinetic energy resulting from homogenization process, distinct from damping effects. In addition, that study did not account for the integration of temporal and spatial transformations, leading to the omission of some crucial information such as thermal stresses. In this paper, we address this oversight to establish generalized equations by employing a unified methodology that encompasses the integrated temporal-spatial transformations and the principle of minimum dissipation. Among many interesting new findings, we highlight that the newly derived equations are inherently consistent with the first and the second laws of thermodynamics, because this gauge theory naturally incorporates the fundamental mechanism that governs the partitioning between the dissipative and the non-dissipative energy.</description>

      <title>Unified Approach to Power-Efficiency Trade-Off of Generic Thermal Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the diverse functionalities of different thermal machines, their optimization relies on a case-by-case basis, lacking unified results. In this work, we propose a general approach to determine power-efficiency trade-off relation (PETOR) for any thermal machine. For cases where cycle (of duration $\tau$) irreversibility satisfies the typical $1/\tau$-scaling, we provide a unified PETOR which is applicable to heat engines, refrigerators, heat exchangers and heat pumps. It is shown that, some typical PETORs, such as those for low-dissipation Carnot cycles (including heat engine and refrigerator cycles) and the steady-state heat engines operating between finite-sized reservoirs are naturally recovered.</description>

      <title>Energy transport in a free Euler-Bernoulli beam in terms of Schr\"odinger's wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger equation is not frequently used in the framework of the classical mechanics, though historically this equation was derived as a simplified equation, which is equivalent to the classical Germain-Lagrange dynamic plate equation. The question concerning the exact meaning of this equivalence is still discussed in modern literature. In this note, we consider the one-dimensional case, where the Germain-Lagrange equation reduces to the Euler-Bernoulli equation, which is used in the classical theory of a beam. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between the set of all solutions (i.e., wave functions ${\psi}$) of the 1D time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation for a free particle with arbitrary complex initial data and the set of ordered pairs of quantities (the beam strain and the particle velocity), which characterize solutions $u$ of the beam equation with arbitrary real initial data. Thus, the dynamics of a free infinite Euler-Bernoulli beam can be described by the Schr\"odinger equation for a free particle and vice versa. Finally, we show that for two corresponding solutions $u$ and ${\psi}$ the mechanical energy density calculated for $u$ propagates in the beam exactly in the same way as the probability density calculated for ${\psi}$.</description>

      <title>New Bounds on Spherical Antenna Bandwidth and Directivity: Updates to the Chu-Harrington Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Chu circuit model provides the basis for analyzing the minimum radiation quality factor, Q, of a given spherical mode. However, examples of electrically large spherical radiators readily demonstrate that this Q limit has limitations in predicting bandwidth. Spherical mode radiation is reexamined and an equivalent 1D transmission line model is derived that exactly models the fields. This model leads to a precise cutoff frequency of the spherical waveguide, which provides a clear boundary between propagating and evanescent fields. A new delineation of 'stored' and 'radiated' electromagnetic energy is postulated, which leads to a new definition of spherical mode Q. Next, attention is turned to the Harrington bound on the directivity-bandwidth tradeoff of an antenna with an arbitrary size. Harrington derived the maximum directivity for a specified number of spherical harmonics such that the Q is not 'large'. Here, the method of Lagrange multipliers is used to quantify the maximum directivity for a given bandwidth. It is shown that optimally exciting all spherical harmonics (including n&gt;ka) enables both larger directivity and bandwidth than Harrington's previous limit. While Chu and Harrington's analyses are generally good approximations for most situations, the new self-consistent theory that defines fundamental antenna limits leads to updated results.</description>

      <title>The Bouc-Wen Model for Binary Direct Collinear Collisions of Convex Viscoplastic Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08147v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study mathematical models of binary direct collinear collisions of convex viscoplastic bodies based on two incremental collision laws that employ the Bouc-Wen differential model of hysteresis to represent the elastoplastic behavior of the materials of the colliding bodies. These collision laws are the Bouc-Wen-Simon-Hunt-Crossley collision law (BWSHCCL) and the Bouc-Wen-Maxwell collision law (BWMCL). The BWSHCCL comprises of the Bouc-Wen model amended with a nonlinear Hertzian elastic spring element and connected in parallel to a nonlinear displacement-dependent and velocity-dependent energy dissipation element. The BWMCL comprises of the Bouc-Wen model amended with a nonlinear Hertzian elastic spring element and connected in series to a linear velocity-dependent energy dissipation element. The mathematical models of the collision process are presented in the form of finite-dimensional initial value problems. We show that the models possess favorable analytical properties (e.g., global existence, uniqueness, and boundedness of the solutions) under suitable restrictions on the values of their parameters. Furthermore, we show that excellent agreement can be achieved between experimental data and numerical approximations of the behavior of the mathematical models across a wide range of initial relative velocities of the colliding bodies while using parameterizations of the models that are independent of the initial relative velocity.</description>
