      <title>Entropy and Economics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy is a very useful concept from physics that tries to explain how a system behaves from a point of view of the thermodynamics. However, there are two ways to explain entropy, and it depends on if we are studying a microsystem or a microsystem. From a macroscopically point of view, it is important to describe if the system is a reversible system or not. However, form the microscopically point of view, the concept of chaos is related to entropy. In such case, entropy measures the amount of disorder into the system. Otherwise, the idea of connecting at the same time the analysis of the macro and micro system with the use of entropy it is not very common.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals of Perpetual Futures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06888v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perpetual futures -- swap contracts that never expire -- are the most popular derivative traded in cryptocurrency markets, with more than $100 billion traded daily. Perpetuals provide investors with leveraged exposure to cryptocurrencies, which does not require rollover or direct cryptocurrency holding. To keep the gap between perpetual futures and spot prices small, long position holders periodically pay short position holders a funding rate proportional to this gap. The funding rate incentivizes trades that tend to narrow the futures-spot gap. But unlike fixed-maturity futures, perpetuals are not guaranteed to converge to the spot price of their underlying asset at any time, and familiar no-arbitrage prices for perpetuals are not available, as the contracts have no expiry date to enforce arbitrage. Here, using a weaker notion of random-maturity arbitrage, we derive no-arbitrage prices for perpetual futures in frictionless markets and no-arbitrage bounds for markets with trading costs. These no-arbitrage prices provide a valuable benchmark for perpetual futures and simultaneously prescribe a strategy to exploit divergence from these fundamental values. Empirically, we find that deviations of crypto perpetual futures from no-arbitrage prices are considerably larger than those documented in traditional currency markets. These deviations comove across cryptocurrencies and diminish over time as crypto markets develop and become more efficient. A simple trading strategy generates large Sharpe ratios even for investors paying the highest trading costs on Binance, which is currently the largest crypto exchange by volume.</description>
