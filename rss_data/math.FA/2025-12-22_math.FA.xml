      <title>Spectral properties of Toeplitz operators with harmonic function symbols on the Bergman space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the spectral properties of Toeplitz operators on the Bergman space of unit disk. We present an integral representation of $T^*_{z^m}$, which establishes a connection between the Bergman functions and certain partial differential equations. Moreover, by leveraging the Poincar\'{e} theorem in difference equations, this paper describes the kernels of certain Toeplitz operators with harmonic polynomial symbols and further gives sufficient conditions for the connectedness of the spectra of these operators. The spectral properties of $T_\varphi$ with $\varphi (z) =\overline{z}^{m} + \alpha z^m + \beta$ are characterized, showing that $\sigma(T_\varphi)= \overline{\varphi (\mathbb {D})}$, the Fredholm index of $T_\varphi$ can only be one of $m, -m$ and $0$, and $T_\varphi$ satisfies Coburn's theorem. These findings offer an illuminating example for studying the essential projective spectra of non-commuting operators.</description>

      <title>Affine isoperimetric inequalities for the first eigenvalue of the $m$-th order Affine $p$-Laplace Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Haddad, Jim\'enez, and Montenegro introduced the affine $p$-Laplace operator, $p&gt;1$, and studied associated affine versions of the isoperimetric inequalities for the first eigenvalue of the affine $p$-Laplace operator, including the affine Faber-Krahn inequality and affine Talenti inequality. In this work, we introduce the $m$th-order $p$-Laplace operator $\Delta_{Q,p}^\mathcal{A} f$, which recovers the affine $p$-Laplace operator when $m=1$ and $Q$ is a symmetric interval.
  Given $n,m \in \mathbb{N}$, a sufficiently smooth convex body $Q \subset \mathbb{R}^m$, a bounded, open set $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ and $p &gt;1$, we investigate the eigenvalue problem \[\begin{cases} \Delta_{Q,p}^\mathcal{A} f = \lambda_{1,p}^\mathcal{A}(Q,\Omega) |f|^{p-2} f &amp;\text{ in } \Omega; \\ f=0 &amp; \text{ on } \partial \Omega, \end{cases} \] for $f \in W^{1,p}_0(\Omega)$. Finally, we establish $m$th-order extensions of the affine Talenti inequality and affine Faber-Krahn inequality, which, upon choosing $m=1$, yield new, asymmetric versions of those aforementioned inequalities.</description>

      <title>Minimizing numerical radius of weighted cyclic matrices under permutation of the weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we answer a question asked by Chien et al. in arXiv:2304.06050 in which they study the numerical range of weighted cyclic matrices under permutation of their entries. Namely, we are interested in how $w(A_\sigma)$ fluctuates for various permutations $\sigma\in S_n$ and fixed $0\leq a_1&lt;\cdots&lt;a_n$ with $A_\sigma=\begin{pmatrix} 0&amp;a_{\sigma(1)}&amp;{}&amp;{}&amp;{}\cr {}&amp;0&amp;a_{\sigma(2)}&amp;{}&amp;{}\cr {}&amp;{}&amp;\ddots&amp;\ddots&amp;{}\cr {}&amp;{}&amp;{}&amp;\ddots&amp;a_{\sigma(n-1)}\cr a_{\sigma(n)}&amp;{}&amp;{}&amp;{}&amp;0 \end{pmatrix}$. Previous results of Gau \cite{gau2024proof} and Chang and Wang \cite{chang2012maximizing} made clear the case when $w(A_\sigma)$ is maximal among all the $w(A_\mu)$ with $\mu\in S_n$. Chien et al. in arXiv:2304.06050 ask what the permutation which makes $w(A_\sigma)$ minimal for $n\geq 6$ could be. Answering this question is the aim of this note.</description>

      <title>On Coorbit Fr\'echet Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a new approach to coorbit space theory. Usually, coorbit spaces are defined by collecting all distributions for which the voice transform associated with a square-integrable group representation possesses a certain decay, usually measured in a Banach space norm such as weighted $L_p$-norms. Unfortunately, in cases where the representation does not satisfy certain integrability conditions, one is faced with a bottleneck, namely that the discretization of the coorbit spaces is surprisingly difficult. It turns out that in these cases the construction of coorbit spaces as Fr\'echet spaces is much more convenient since then atomic decompositions can be established in a very natural way.</description>

      <title>Circular orders: Topology and continuous actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the topology of abstract circularly ordered sets. While the algebraic notion is classical, the general topological theory has received comparatively little attention.
  This work provides a self-contained topological exposition and presents several new directions and results. Specifically, we:
  Initiate a systematic study of Generalized Circularly Ordered Topological Spaces (GCOTS).
  Analyze in detail Nov\'ak's regular completion and prove that it is the canonical minimal circularly ordered compactification. Provide a convex uniform structure description of circularly ordered compactifications. This implies several new results in the theory of compactifications for topological group actions. Reexamine functions of Bounded Variation on abstract circularly ordered sets and prove generalizations of Helly's selection theorem (for circular and linear orders).
  These developments and a systematic analysis of circular order topologies are motivated also by recent applications in topological dynamics, particularly in joint works with E. Glasner, which demonstrate that circularly ordered dynamical systems provide a natural class of ``tame" dynamics.</description>

      <title>Existence and Configuration of Invariant Sets in $C^\infty([a,b])$ on which the Differential Operator Exhibits Devaney's Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the chaotic behavior of the differential operator $\frac{d}{dx}$ on the space of smooth functions $C^\infty([a,b])$ equipped with the $L^p$-norm ($1\le p\le\infty$). We explicitly construct a homeomorphism between a subset of $C^\infty([a,b])$ and the shift space. Moreover, inspired by symbolic dynamics, we demonstrate that invariant sets, on which the differential operator behaves analogously to the shift, are densely configured in $C^\infty([a,b])$. We also prove that the differential operator is chaotic on the entire space $C^\infty([a,b])$ using a similar approach.</description>

      <title>Inclusion constants for free spectrahedra with applications to quantum incompatibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the matrix cube problem, inclusions of free spectrahedra have been used successfully to obtain relaxations of hard spectrahedral inclusion problems. The quality of such a relaxation is quantified by the inclusion constant associated with each free spectrahedron. While optimal values of inclusion constants were known in certain highly symmetric cases, no general method for computing them was available. In this work, we show that inclusion constants for Cartesian products of free simplices can be computed using methods from non-commutative polynomial optimization, together with a detailed analysis of the extreme points of the associated free spectrahedra. This analysis also yields new closed-form analytic expressions for these constants. As an application to quantum information theory, we prove new bounds on the amount of white noise that incompatible measurements can tolerate before they become compatible. In particular, we study the case of one dichotomic and one $k$-outcome measurement, as well as the case of four dichotomic qubit measurements.</description>

      <title>Inner factors of Dirichlet space functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every function in the Dirichlet space on the unit disc has an inner/outer factorization. We study which inner functions occur in this way. For Blaschke products, this is the well known question of which subsets of the disc are zero sets for the Dirichlet space. We also consider singular inner factors, and in particular prove an analogue of the Shapiro-Shields theorem in this setting. Our results on singular inner factors also yield new sufficient conditions for zero sets.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study spectral Barron spaces whose elements are made up of some vector-valued functions on a compact group whose Fourier transforms admit a certain summability property. We investigate their functional properties and some continuous embeddings of these spaces with respect to other function spaces among which are Sobolev spaces of vector-valued functions and the space of bounded vector-valued functions on compact groups.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate heat semigroups on a quantum automorphism group ${\rm Aut}^+(B)$ of a finite dimensional C*-algebra $B$ and its Plancherel trace. We show ultracontractivity, hypercontractivity, and the spectral gap inequality of the heat semigroups on ${\rm Aut}^+(B)$. Furthermore, we obtain the sharpness of the Sobolev embedding property and the Hausdorff-Young inequality of ${\rm Aut}^+(B)$.</description>

      <title>Capacitary Muckenhoupt Weights and Weighted Norm Inequalities for Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal H_{\infty}^\delta$ denote the Hausdorff content of dimension $\delta\in(0,n]$ defined on subsets of $\mathbb R^n$. The principal problem, considered in this paper, is to characterize the non-negative function $w$ for which the weighted $L^p$-norm inequality with $p\in(1,\infty)$ and the weighted weak $L^1$-norm inequality on Hardy-Littlewood maximal operators associated with Hausdorff contents hold true. To achieve this, we introduce a class of capacitary Muckenhoupt weights depending on the dimension $\delta$, denoted as $\mathcal A_{p,\delta}$, which enjoys the strict monotonicity on the dimension index $\delta$. Then we show that, for any $p\in(1,\infty)$ and $\delta\in(0,n]$, the weighted $L^p$-norm inequality holds true if and only if $w\in\mathcal A_{p,\delta}$, and the weighted weak $L^1$-norm inequality holds true if and only if $w\in\mathcal A_{1,\delta}$ by a new approach developed in this paper. As the second objective, applying this new approach, the seminal properties of classical Muckenhoupt $A_p$ weights, such as the reverse H\"older inequality [R. R. Coifman and C. Fefferman, Studia Math. 51 (1974), 241-250], the self-improving property [B. Muckenhoupt, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 165 (1972), 207-226], and Jones' factorization theorem [P. W. Jones, Ann. of Math. (2) 111 (1980), 511-530], are all established within the framework of capacitary Muckenhoupt weight class $\mathcal A_{p,\delta}$. Finally, we also show that the maximal operator is bounded on the weak weighted Choquet-Lebesgue space $L_w^{p,\infty}(\mathbb R^n,{\mathcal H}_\infty^\delta)$ if and only if $w\in\mathcal A_{p,\delta}$ with $p\in(1,\infty)$ and $\delta\in(0,n]$.</description>

      <title>On almost commuting unitary matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03674v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A question going back to Halmos asks when two approximately commuting matrices of a certain kind are close to exactly commuting matrices of the same kind. It has long been known that there is a winding number obstruction for approximately commuting unitary matrices to be close, in a dimension-independent way, to genuinely commuting unitary matrices. In this paper, under the vanishing of the said obstruction, we obtain effective bounds for the distance to commuting unitary matrices in terms of the commutator of the original matrices.</description>

      <title>Generalized infinite dimensional Alpha-Procrustes based geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work extends the recently introduced Alpha-Procrustes family of Riemannian metrics for symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices by incorporating generalized versions of the Bures-Wasserstein (GBW), Log-Euclidean, and Wasserstein distances. While the Alpha-Procrustes framework has unified many classical metrics in both finite- and infinite- dimensional settings, it previously lacked the structural components necessary to realize these generalized forms. We introduce a formalism based on unitized Hilbert-Schmidt operators and an extended Mahalanobis norm that allows the construction of robust, infinite-dimensional generalizations of GBW and Log-Hilbert-Schmidt distances. Our approach also incorporates a learnable regularization parameter that enhances geometric stability in high-dimensional comparisons. Preliminary experiments reproducing benchmarks from the literature demonstrate the improved performance of our generalized metrics, particularly in scenarios involving comparisons between datasets of varying dimension and scale. This work lays a theoretical and computational foundation for advancing robust geometric methods in machine learning, statistical inference, and functional data analysis.</description>
