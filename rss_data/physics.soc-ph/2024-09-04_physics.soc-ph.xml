      <title>Quantum Ecosystem Research and Analysis in Colombia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of quantum computing in the last few years has led many countries to make relevant public investments in that field. However, Colombia lacks any investment or legislation in this area. Most previous studies have focused on other countries, contributing to the region's significant lag. In this paper, we propose efforts to include quantum computing as a fundamental pillar of Colombia's development plan. In this research we involved three stakeholders: academia (Universidad Nacional de Colombia), industry (Alianza Team), and government (Vice Ministry of Digital Transformation). We anticipate that our work will provide a connection between all stakeholders involved in public investments in quantum technology in the country and will facilitate its legislation.</description>

      <title>Projections of Earth's technosphere. I. Scenario modeling, worldbuilding, and overview of remotely detectable technosignatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study uses methods from futures studies to develop a set of ten self-consistent scenarios for Earth's 1000-year future, which can serve as examples for defining technosignature search strategies. We apply a novel worldbuilding pipeline that evaluates the dimensions of human needs in each scenario as a basis for defining the observable properties of the technosphere. Our scenarios include three with zero-growth stability, two that have collapsed into a stable state, one that oscillates between growth and collapse, and four that continue to grow. Only one scenario includes rapid growth that could lead to interstellar expansion. We examine absorption spectral features for a few scenarios to illustrate that nitrogen dioxide can serve as a technosignature to distinguish between present-day Earth, pre-agricultural Earth, and an industrial 1000-year future Earth. Three of our scenarios are spectrally indistinguishable from pre-agricultural Earth, even though these scenarios include expansive technospheres. Up to nine of these scenarios could represent steady-state examples that could persist for much longer timescales, and it remains possible that short-duration technospheres could be the most abundant. Our scenario set provides the basis for further systematic thinking about technosignature detection as well as for imagining a broad range of possibilities for Earth's future.</description>

      <title>Modelisation a base d'Agent Augmentes par LLM pour les Simulations Sociales: Defis et Opportunites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to make significant strides, their better integration into agent-based simulations offers a transformational potential for understanding complex social systems. However, such integration is not trivial and poses numerous challenges. Based on this observation, in this paper, we explore architectures and methods to systematically develop LLM-augmented social simulations and discuss potential research directions in this field. We conclude that integrating LLMs with agent-based simulations offers a powerful toolset for researchers and scientists, allowing for more nuanced, realistic, and comprehensive models of complex systems and human behaviours.</description>

      <title>Collective Predictive Coding as Model of Science: Formalizing Scientific Activities Towards Generative Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a new conceptual framework called Collective Predictive Coding as a Model of Science (CPC-MS) to formalize and understand scientific activities. Building on the idea of collective predictive coding originally developed to explain symbol emergence, CPC-MS models science as a decentralized Bayesian inference process carried out by a community of agents. The framework describes how individual scientists' partial observations and internal representations are integrated through communication and peer review to produce shared external scientific knowledge. Key aspects of scientific practice like experimentation, hypothesis formation, theory development, and paradigm shifts are mapped onto components of the probabilistic graphical model. This paper discusses how CPC-MS provides insights into issues like social objectivity in science, scientific progress, and the potential impacts of AI on research. The generative view of science offers a unified way to analyze scientific activities and could inform efforts to automate aspects of the scientific process. Overall, CPC-MS aims to provide an intuitive yet formal model of science as a collective cognitive activity.</description>

      <title>Widespread misidentification of SEM instruments in the peer-reviewed materials science and engineering literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials science and engineering (MSE) research has, for the most part, escaped the doubts raised about the reliability of the scientific literature by recent large-scale replication studies in psychology and cancer biology. However, users on post-publication peer review sites have recently identified dozens of articles where the make and model of the scanning electron microscope (SEM) listed in the text of the paper does not match the instrument's metadata visible in the images in the published article. In order to systematically investigate this potential risk to the MSE literature, we develop a semi-automated approach to scan published figures for this metadata and check it against the SEM instrument identified in the text. Starting from an exhaustive set of 1,067,102 articles published since 2010 in 50 journals with impact factors ranging from 2 to 24, we identify 11,314 articles for which SEM make and model can be identified in an image's metadata. For 21.2% of those articles, the image metadata does not match the SEM manufacturer or model listed in the text and, for another 24.7%, at least some of the instruments used in the study are not reported. Unexplained patterns common to many of these articles suggest the involvement of paper mills, organizations that mass-produce, sell authorship on, and publish fraudulent scientific manuscripts at scale.</description>

      <title>Professionalising Community Management Roles in Interdisciplinary Research Projects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we discuss community management in interdisciplinary research teams, focusing on recognising and professionalising roles referred to here as the Research Community Managers (RCM). Drawing insights and examples from research and data science projects, we discuss how RCM roles address some of the researchâ€™s most pressing challenges, from promoting best practices for open research and reproducibility to engaging diverse stakeholders in community-led research and ensuring fair recognition for their contributions. We offer a Community Maturation Indicator and share examples of projects from The Alan Turing Institute, the UK's national institute for data science and Artificial Intelligence (AI), where institutionally supported RCM roles were established.
  With the aim to integrate RCM expertise in teams involved in data science and AI research, we provide an RCM Skills and Competencies Framework. We also propose a roadmap for professionalising RCM roles by improving recognition and rewards, potential career paths and organisational support structures. To systematically sustain and progress these roles, we recommend institutional investment in establishing RCM teams that are empowered to prioritise collaboration, transparency and community-based approaches in interdisciplinary projects, such as in data science and AI. As a team, RCMs are well placed to connect disparate teams, initiatives and resources across the organisation, building more resilient research communities that can achieve greater innovation, improved project outcomes and a strongly connected ecosystem, with impacts extending beyond their narrow contexts.</description>

      <title>Deduction of the Bromilow's time-cost model from the fractal nature of activity networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1969 Bromilow observed that the time $T$ to execute a construction project follows a power law scaling with the project cost $C$, $T\sim C^B$ [Bromilow 1969]. While the Bromilow's time-cost model has been extensively tested using data for different countries and project types, there is no theoretical explanation for the algebraic scaling. Here I mathematically deduce the Bromilow's time-cost model from the fractal nature of activity networks. The Bromislow's exponent is $B=1-\alpha$, where $1-\alpha$ is the scaling exponent between the number of activities in the critical path $L$ and the number of activities $N$, $L\sim N^{1-\alpha}$ with $0\leq\alpha&lt;1$ [Vazquez et al 2023]. I provide empirical data showing that projects with low serial/parallel (SP)% have lower $B$ values than those with higher SP%. I conclude that the Bromilow's time-cost model is a law of activity networks, the Bromilow's exponent is a network property and forecasting project duration from cost should be limited to projects with high SP%.</description>

      <title>Inequality and Concentration in Farmland Production and Size: Regional Analysis for the European Union from 2010 to 2020</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to Eurostat estimates, the overall number of farms in Europe declined of about 3 million units between 2010 and 2020. Parallel, the agricultural standard output increased from 304 billion to nearly 360 billion over the same period. Such evidence, legitimately leads to questions about how the structure (e.g., type of production and average size) of farms has changed and whether this change has been uniform or heterogeneous within Europe. In this paper, we aim at investigating the phenomenon of market concentration in the European agricultural and livestock farming industry from 2010 to 2020 at the regional level by exploiting the spatio-temporal dynamics of the Gini concentration index for the land owned by the European farmers and for their standard output. In particular, we are interested in exploring the variability within-and-between regions with regard to land and production size to assess if the European agricultural market suffered from an increasingly concentration of power in fewer but larger farm holding. The extensive mapping provided by this study may allow a fine spatial-scale socio-economic and political assessment of the European agricultural market integration process, its recent and future trends in the complex and uncertain post-COVID context and the restructuring of international relations due to crises and the green energy transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change will result in more frequent, more intense and longer-lasting heat waves by 2050. As part of its Climate Plan and its resilience strategy, the City of Paris is deploying, through its Oasis program, a network of urban cool islands to mitigate the urban heat island phenomena: schoolyards are renovated in order to reduce the heat stress of users. We establish a methodology aiming to quantify the microclimatic impact of the transformation. Mobile measurements are carried out within a case courtyard under hot conditions and coupled with fixed weather station data to evaluate heat stress using UTCI. The heat stress mapping thus obtained allows a first microclimatic diagnosis of the schoolyard.</description>

      <title>Scalable analysis of stop-and-go waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing stop-and-go waves at the scale of miles and hours of data is an emerging challenge in traffic research. In the past, datasets were of limited scale and could be easily analyzed by hand or with rudimentary methods to identify a very limited set of traffic waves present within the data. This paper introduces an automatic and scalable stop-and-go wave identification method capable of capturing wave generation, propagation, dissipation, as well as bifurcation and merging, which have previously been observed only very rarely. Using a concise and simple critical-speed based definition of a stop-and-go wave, the proposed method identifies all wave boundaries that encompass spatio-temporal points where vehicle speed is below a chosen critical speed. The method is built upon a graph-based representation of the spatio-temporal points associated with stop-and-go waves, specifically wave front (start) points and wave tail (end) points, and approaches the solution as a graph component identification problem. The method is implemented in Python and demonstrated on a large-scale dataset, I-24 MOTION INCEPTION. New insights revealed from this demonstration with emerging phenomena include: (a) we demonstrate that waves do generate, propagate, and dissipate at a scale (miles and hours) and ubiquity never observed before; (b) wave fronts and tails travels at a consistent speed for a critical speed between 10-20 mph, with propagation variation across lanes, where wave speed on the outer lane are less consistent compared to those on the inner lane; (c) wave fronts and tails propagate at different speeds; (d) wave boundaries capture rich and non-trivial wave topologies, highlighting the complexity of waves.</description>

      <title>Statistics of punctuation in experimental literature -- the remarkable case of "Finnegans Wake" by James Joyce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the recent studies indicate, the structure imposed onto written texts by the presence of punctuation develops patterns which reveal certain characteristics of universality. In particular, based on a large collection of classic literary works, it has been evidenced that the distances between consecutive punctuation marks, measured in terms of the number of words, obey the discrete Weibull distribution - a discrete variant of a distribution often used in survival analysis. The present work extends the analysis of punctuation usage patterns to more experimental pieces of world literature. It turns out that the compliance of the the distances between punctuation marks with the discrete Weibull distribution typically applies here as well. However, some of the works by James Joyce are distinct in this regard - in the sense that the tails of the relevant distributions are significantly thicker and, consequently, the corresponding hazard functions are decreasing functions not observed in typical literary texts in prose. "Finnegans Wake" - the same one to which science owes the word "quarks" for the most fundamental constituents of matter - is particularly striking in this context. At the same time, in all the studied texts, the sentence lengths - representing the distances between sentence-ending punctuation marks - reveal more freedom and are not constrained by the discrete Weibull distribution. This freedom in some cases translates into long-range nonlinear correlations, which manifest themselves in multifractality. Again, a text particularly spectacular in terms of multifractality is "Finnegans Wake".</description>

      <title>Analysis of flows in social media uncovers a new multi-step model of information spread</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the advent of the internet, communication paradigms have continuously evolved, resulting in a present-day landscape where the dynamics of information dissemination have undergone a complete transformation compared to the past. In this study, we challenge the conventional two-step flow model of communication, a long-standing paradigm in the field. Our approach introduces a more intricate multi-step and multi-actor model that effectively captures the complexities of modern information spread. We test our hypothesis by examining the spread of information on the Twitter platform. Our findings support the multi-step and multi-actor model hypothesis. In this framework, influencers (individuals with a significant presence in social media) emerges as new central figures and partially take on the role previously attributed to opinion leaders. However, this does not apply to opinion leaders who adapt and reaffirm their influential position on social media, here defined as opinion-leading influencers. Additionally, we note a substantial number of adopters directly accessing information sources, suggesting a potentialdecline if influence in both opinion leaders and influencers. Finally, we found distinctions in the diffusion patterns of left- and right-leaning groups, indicating variations in the underlying structure of information dissemination across different ideologies.</description>

      <title>Finding Large Independent Sets in Networks Using Competitive Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many decision-making algorithms draw inspiration from the inner workings of individual biological systems. However, it remains unclear whether collective behavior among biological species can also lead to solutions for computational tasks. By studying the coexistence of species that interact through simple rules on a network, we demonstrate that the underlying dynamical system can recover near-optimal solutions to the maximum independent set problem -- a fundamental, computationally hard problem in graph theory. Furthermore, we observe that the optimality of these solutions is improved when the competitive pressure in the system is gradually increased. We explain this phenomenon by showing that the cascade of bifurcation points, which occurs with rising competitive pressure in our dynamical system, naturally gives rise to Katz centrality-based node removal in the network. By formalizing this connection, we propose a biologically inspired discrete algorithm for approximating the maximum independent set problem on a graph. Our results indicate that complex systems may collectively possess the capacity to perform non-trivial computations, with implications spanning biology, economics, and other fields.</description>

      <title>Detection of anomalous spatio-temporal patterns of app traffic in response to catastrophic events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we uncover patterns of usage mobile phone applications and information spread in response to perturbations caused by unprecedented events. We focus on categorizing patterns of response in both space and time and tracking their relaxation over time. To this end, we use the NetMob2023 Data Challenge dataset, which provides mobile phone applications traffic volume data for several cities in France at a spatial resolution of 100$m^2$ and a time resolution of 15 minutes for a time period ranging from March to May 2019. We analyze the spread of information before, during, and after the catastrophic Notre-Dame fire on April 15th and a bombing that took place in the city centre of Lyon on May 24th using volume of data uploaded and downloaded to different mobile applications as a proxy of information transfer dynamics. We identify different clusters of information transfer dynamics in response to the Notre-Dame fire within the city of Paris as well as in other major French cities. We find a clear pattern of significantly above-baseline usage of the application Twitter (currently known as X) in Paris that radially spreads from the area surrounding the Notre-Dame cathedral to the rest of the city. We detect a similar pattern in the city of Lyon in response to the bombing. Further, we present a null model of radial information spread and develop methods of tracking radial patterns over time. Overall, we illustrate novel analytical methods we devise, showing how they enable a new perspective on mobile phone user response to unplanned catastrophic events, giving insight into how information spreads during a catastrophe in both time and space.</description>

      <title>Epidemic paradox induced by awareness driven network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stationary epidemic processes in scale-free networks with local awareness behavior adopted by only susceptible, only infected, or all nodes. We find that while the epidemic size in the susceptible-aware and the all-aware scenarios scales linearly with the network size, the scaling becomes sublinear in the infected-aware scenario, suggesting that fewer aware nodes may reduce the epidemic size more effectively. We explain this paradox via numerical and theoretical analysis, and highlight the role of influential nodes and their disassortativity to raise awareness in epidemic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Compact 15-minute cities are greener</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 15-minute city concept, advocating for cities where essential services are accessible within 15 minutes on foot and by bike, has gained significant attention in recent years. However, despite being celebrated for promoting sustainability, there is an ongoing debate regarding its effectiveness in reducing car usage and, subsequently, emissions in cities. In particular, large-scale evaluations of the effectiveness of the 15-minute concept in reducing emissions are lacking. To address this gap, we investigate whether cities with better walking accessibility, like 15-minute cities, are associated with lower transportation emissions. Comparing 700 cities worldwide, we find that cities with better walking accessibility to services emit less CO$_2$ per capita for transport. Moreover, we observe that among cities with similar average accessibility, cities spreading over larger areas tend to emit more. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of decentralised urban planning, especially the proximity-based 15-minute city, in promoting sustainable mobility. However, they also emphasise the need to integrate local accessibility with urban compactness and efficient public transit, which are vital in large cities.</description>

      <title>The overlooked need for Ethics in Complexity Science: Why it matters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complexity science, despite its broad scope and potential impact, has not kept pace with fields like artificial intelligence, biotechnology and social sciences in addressing ethical concerns. The field lacks a comprehensive ethical framework, leaving us, as a community, vulnerable to ethical challenges and dilemmas. Other areas have gone through similar experiences and created, with discussions and working groups, their guides, policies and recommendations. Therefore, here we highlight the critical absence of formal guidelines, dedicated ethical committees, and widespread discussions on ethics within the complexity science community. Drawing on insights from the disciplines mentioned earlier, we propose a roadmap to enhance ethical awareness and action. Our recommendations include (i) initiating supportive mechanisms to develop ethical guidelines specific to complex systems research, (ii) creating open-access resources, and (iii) fostering inclusive dialogues to ensure that complexity science can responsibly tackle societal challenges and achieve a more inclusive environment. By initiating this dialogue, we aim to encourage a necessary shift in how ethics is integrated into complexity research, positioning the field to address contemporary challenges more effectively.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analysis of the Future of Atomically Precise Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically Precise Manufacturing (APM) refers to the assembly of materials with atomic precision, representing a highly advanced technology with significant potential. However, the development of APM remains in its early stages, with applications largely confined to specialized fields and lacking cohesion within a unified discipline. The current literature on APM is often dominated by older, speculative papers that discuss its immense potential risks and benefits without sufficient grounding in the latest advancements or practical limitations that exist today. This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive assessment of current APM and near-APM technologies, as well as using the barriers to further progress to predict future developments. Through this analysis, we seek to establish a clearer understanding of the present state of the technology and then use these insights to predict the future trajectory of APM. By doing so, we aim to create a more grounded discourse on APM and its potential risks and benefits, while also guiding future research on the necessary regulations and safety considerations for this emerging field.</description>

      <title>Modeling contagious disease spreading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An understanding of the disease spreading phenomenon based on a mathematical model is extremely needed for the implication of the correct policy measures to contain the disease propagation. Here, we report a new model namely the Ising-SIR model describing contagious disease spreading phenomena including both airborne and direct contact disease transformations. In the airborne case, a susceptible agent can catch the disease either from the environment or its infected neighbors whereas in the second case, the agent can be infected only through close contact with its infected neighbors. We have performed Monte Carlo simulations on a square lattice using periodic boundary conditions to investigate the dynamics of disease spread. The simulations demonstrate that the mechanism of disease spreading plays a significant role in the growth dynamics and leads to different growth exponent. In the direct contact disease spreading mechanism, the growth exponent is nearly equal to two for some model parameters which agrees with earlier empirical observations. In addition, the model predicts various types of spatiotemporal patterns that can be observed in nature.</description>

      <title>Supervised Pattern Recognition Involving Skewed Feature Densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pattern recognition constitutes a particularly important task underlying a great deal of scientific and technologica activities. At the same time, pattern recognition involves several challenges, including the choice of features to represent the data elements, as well as possible respective transformations. In the present work, the classification potential of the Euclidean distance and a dissimilarity index based on the coincidence similarity index are compared by using the k-neighbors supervised classification method respectively to features resulting from several types of transformations of one- and two-dimensional symmetric densities. Given two groups characterized by respective densities without or with overlap, different types of respective transformations are obtained and employed to quantitatively evaluate the performance of k-neighbors methodologies based on the Euclidean distance an coincidence similarity index. More specifically, the accuracy of classifying the intersection point between the densities of two adjacent groups is taken into account for the comparison. Several interesting results are described and discussed, including the enhanced potential of the dissimilarity index for classifying datasets with right skewed feature densities, as well as the identification that the sharpness of the comparison between data elements can be independent of the respective supervised classification performance.</description>

      <title>Healthcare system resilience and adaptability to pandemic disruptions in the United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding healthcare system resilience has become paramount, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which imposed unprecedented burdens on healthcare services and severely impacted public health. Resilience is defined as the system's ability to absorb, recover from, and adapt to disruptions; however, despite extensive studies on this subject, we still lack empirical evidence and mathematical tools to quantify its adaptability (the ability of the system to adjust to and learn from disruptions). By analyzing millions of patients' electronic medical records across US states, we find that the COVID-19 pandemic caused two successive waves of disruptions within the healthcare systems, enabling natural experiment analysis of the adaptive capacity for each system to adapt to past disruptions. We generalize the quantification framework and find that the US healthcare systems exhibit substantial adaptability but only a moderate level of resilience. When considering system responses across racial groups, Black and Hispanic groups were more severely impacted by pandemic disruptions than White and Asian groups. Physician abundance is the key characteristic for determining healthcare system resilience. Our results offer vital guidance in designing resilient and sustainable healthcare systems to prepare for future waves of disruptions akin to COVID-19 pandemics.</description>

      <title>DAOs of Collective Intelligence? Unraveling the Complexity of Blockchain Governance in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) have transformed organizational structures by shifting from traditional hierarchical control to decentralized approaches, leveraging blockchain and cryptoeconomics. Despite managing significant funds and building global networks, DAOs face challenges like declining participation, increasing centralization, and inabilities to adapt to changing environments, which stifle innovation. This paper explores DAOs as complex systems and applies complexity science to explain their inefficiencies. In particular, we discuss DAO challenges, their complex nature, and introduce the self-organization mechanisms of collective intelligence, digital democracy, and adaptation. By applying these mechansims to improve DAO design and construction, a practical design framework for DAOs is created. This contribution lays a foundation for future research at the intersection of complexity science and DAOs.</description>

      <title>Structural properties in the diffusion of the solar photovoltaic in Italy: individual people/householder vs firms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.01329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops two mathematical models to understand subjects' behavior in response to the urgency of a change and inputs from governments e.g., (subsides) in the context of the diffusion of the solar photovoltaic in Italy. The first model is a Markovian model of interacting particle systems. The second one, instead, is a Mean Field Game model. In both cases, we derive the scaling limit deterministic dynamics, and we compare the latter to the Italian solar photovoltaic data. We identify periods where the first model describes the behavior of domestic data well and a period where the second model captures a particular feature of data corresponding to companies. The comprehensive analysis, integrated with a philosophical inquiry focusing on the conceptual vocabulary and correlative implications, leads to the formulation of hypotheses about the efficacy of different forms of governmental subsidies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Council of the European Union (EU) is one of the main decision-making bodies of the EU. Many decisions require a qualified majority: the support of 55% of the member states (currently 15) that represent at least 65% of the total population. We investigate how the power distribution, based on the Shapley-Shubik index, and the proportion of winning coalitions change if these criteria are modified within reasonable bounds. The power of the two countries with about 4% of the total population each is found to be almost flat. The level of decisiveness decreases if the population criterion is above 68\% or the states criterion is at least 17. The proportion of winning coalitions can be increased from 13.2% to 20.8% (30.1%) such that the maximal relative change in the Shapley-Shubik indices remains below 3.5% (5.5%). Our results are indispensable in evaluating any proposal for reforming the qualified majority voting system.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Evolutionary Pressure and Diminishing Returns Might Explain the Fermi Paradox: On What Super-AIs Are Like</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03685v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With an evolutionary approach, the basis of morality can be explained as adaptations to problems of cooperation. With 'evolution' taken in a broad sense, evolving AIs that satisfy the conditions for evolution to apply will be subject to the same cooperative evolutionary pressure as biological entities. Here the adaptiveness of increased cooperation as material safety and wealth increase is discussed -- for humans, for other societies, and for AIs. Diminishing beneficial returns from increased access to material resources also suggests the possibility that, on the whole, there will be no incentive to for instance colonize entire galaxies, thus providing a possible explanation of the Fermi paradox, wondering where everybody is. It is further argued that old societies could engender, give way to, super-AIs, since it is likely that super-AIs are feasible, and fitter. Closing is an aside on effective ways for morals and goals to affect life and society, emphasizing environments, cultures, and laws, and exemplified by how to eat.
  Appended are an algorithm for colonizing for example a galaxy quickly, models of the evolution of cooperation and fairness under diminishing returns, and software for simulating signaling development. It is also noted that there can be no exponential colonization or reproduction, for mathematical reasons, as each entity takes up a certain amount of space.</description>

      <title>Interplay of network structure and talent configuration on wealth dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The economic success of individuals is often determined by a combination of talent, luck, and assistance from others. We introduce a new agent-based model that simultaneously considers talent, luck, and social interaction. This model allows us to explore how network structure (how agents interact) and talent distribution among agents affect the dynamics of capital accumulation through analytical and numerical methods. We identify a phenomenon as ``talent configuration effect", which refers to the influence of how talent is allocated to individuals (nodes) in the network. We analyze this effect through two key properties: talent assortativity (TA) and talent-degree correlation (TD). In particular, we focus on three economic indicators: growth rate ($n_{\rm rate}$), Gini coefficient (inequality: $n_{\rm Gini}$), and meritocratic fairness ($n_{LT}$). This investigation helps us understand the interplay between talent configuration and network structure on capital dynamics. We find that, in the short term, positive correlations exist between TA and TD for all three economic indicators. Furthermore, the dominant factor influencing capital dynamics depends on the network topology. In scale-free networks, TD has a stronger influence on the economic indices than TA. Conversely, in lattice-like networks, TA plays a more significant role. Our findings address that high socioeconomic homophily can create a dilemma between growth and equality, and that hub monopolization by few highly talented agents makes economic growth strongly dependent on their performances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we make use of graphon theory to study opinion dynamics on large undirected networks. The opinion dynamics models that we take into consideration allow for negative interactions between the individuals, i.e. competing entities whose opinions can grow apart. We consider both the repelling model and the opposing model that are studied in the literature. We define the repelling and the opposing dynamics on graphons and we show that their initial value problem's solutions exist and are unique. We then show that the graphon dynamics well approximate the dynamics on large graphs that converge to a graphon. This result applies to large random graphs that are sampled according to a graphon. All these facts are illustrated in an extended numerical example.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of An Information Theoretic Analog of Two Masses on a Spring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this short communication we investigate an information theoretic analogue of the classic two masses on spring system, arising from a physical interpretation of Friston's free energy principle in the theory of learning in a system of agents. Using methods from classical mechanics on manifolds, we define a kinetic energy term using the Fisher metric on distributions and a potential energy function defined in terms of stress on the agents' beliefs. The resulting Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) produces a variation of the classic DeGroot dynamics. In the two agent case, the potential function is defined using the Jeffrey's divergence and the resulting dynamics are characterized by a non-linear spring. These dynamics produce trajectories that resemble flows on tori but are shown numerically to produce chaos near the boundary of the space. We then investigate persuasion as an information theoretic control problem where analysis indicates that manipulating peer pressure with a fixed target is a more stable approach to altering an agent's belief than providing a slowly changing belief state that approaches the target.</description>

      <title>Characterizing limit order books in call auctions of a stock market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical and dynamical characters of stock markets have been extensively studied, which now is providing the firm basis for econophysics and its application as ``stylized facts''. However, most of those studies are for markets under the continuous auction, i.e. trades are executed sequentially. There has been less research on another major type of auction, call auctions, where orders are accumulated and those are executed at once in the final moment. This study focuses on the structure of the limit order books of stocks under the call auctions. Using the data of all stocks listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange, we find that the shape of the limit order books in call auctions are well fitted by a simple functional form of hyperbolic tangent. From the fitting, we define the ``median spread'' and the ``width'' of limit orders. The ratio of the ``width'' to the ``median spread'' of most stocks are found to be similar, indicating that the execution ratio (the trading volume relative to the total number of orders) are nearly equal among them. Furthermore, the deviation in this ratio from the majority is found to be a good indicator for finding the stocks of the companies making outstanding profit. Our results demonstrate that those parameters of the structure of the limit order book well characterizes the states of the market under call auctions.</description>

      <title>Coherence resonance in influencer networks</title>

Abstract: Complex networks are abundant in nature and many share an important structural property: they contain a few nodes that are abnormally highly connected (hubs). Some of these hubs are called influencers because they couple strongly to the network and play fundamental dynamical and structural roles. Strikingly, despite the abundance of networks with influencers, little is known about their response to stochastic forcing. Here, for oscillatory dynamics on influencer networks, we show that subjecting influencers to an optimal intensity of noise can result in enhanced network synchronization. This new network dynamical effect, which we call coherence resonance in influencer networks, emerges from a synergy between network structure and stochasticity and is highly nonlinear, vanishing when the noise is too weak or too strong. Our results reveal that the influencer backbone can sharply increase the dynamical response in complex systems of coupled oscillators.</description>

      <title>Cascades towards noise-induced transitions on networks revealed using information flows</title>

Abstract: Complex networks, from neuronal assemblies to social systems, can exhibit abrupt, system-wide transitions without external forcing. These endogenously generated ``noise-induced transitions'' emerge from the intricate interplay between network structure and local dynamics, yet their underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Our study unveils two critical roles that nodes play in catalyzing these transitions within dynamical networks governed by the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution. We introduce the concept of ``initiator nodes'', which absorb and propagate short-lived fluctuations, temporarily destabilizing their neighbors. This process initiates a domino effect, where the stability of a node inversely correlates with the number of destabilized neighbors required to tip it. As the system approaches a tipping point, we identify ``stabilizer nodes'' that encode the system's long-term memory, ultimately reversing the domino effect and settling the network into a new stable attractor. Through targeted interventions, we demonstrate how these roles can be manipulated to either promote or inhibit systemic transitions. Our findings provide a novel framework for understanding and potentially controlling endogenously generated metastable behavior in complex networks. This approach opens new avenues for predicting and managing critical transitions in diverse fields, from neuroscience to social dynamics and beyond.</description>

      <title>An embedding-based distance for temporal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal graphs are commonly used to represent time-resolved relations between entities in many natural and artificial systems. Many techniques were devised to investigate the evolution of temporal graphs by comparing their state at different time points. However, quantifying the similarity between temporal graphs as a whole is an open problem. Here, we use embeddings based on time-respecting random walks to introduce a new notion of distance between temporal graphs. This distance is well-defined for pairs of temporal graphs with different numbers of nodes and different time spans. We study the case of a matched pair of graphs, when a known relation exists between their nodes, and the case of unmatched graphs, when such a relation is unavailable and the graphs may be of different sizes. We use empirical and synthetic temporal network data to show that the distance we introduce discriminates graphs with different topological and temporal properties. We provide an efficient implementation of the distance computation suitable for large-scale temporal graphs.</description>
