      <title>Repetitive TMS-based Identification of Methamphetamine-Dependent Individuals Using EEG Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on methamphetamine (METH) users' craving levels is often assessed using questionnaires. This study explores the feasibility of using neural signals to obtain more objective results. EEG signals recorded from 20 METH-addicted participants Before and After rTMS (MBT and MAT) and from 20 healthy participants (HC) are analyzed. In each EEG paradigm, participants are shown 15 METH-related and 15 neutral pictures randomly, and the relative band power (RBP) of each EEG sub-band frequency is derived. The average RBP across all 31 channels, as well as individual brain regions, is analyzed. Statistically, MAT's alpha, beta, and gamma RBPs are more like those of HC compared to MBT, as indicated by the power topographies. Utilizing a random forest (RF), the gamma RBP is identified as the optimal frequency band for distinguishing between MBT and HC with a 90% accuracy. The performance of classifying MAT versus HC is lower than that of MBT versus HC, suggesting that the efficacy of rTMS can be validated using RF with gamma RBP. Furthermore, the gamma RBP recorded by the TP10 and CP2 channels dominates the classification task of MBT versus HC when receiving METH-related image cues. The gamma RBP during exposure to METH-related cues can serve as a biomarker for distinguishing between MBT and HC and for evaluating the effectiveness of rTMS. Therefore, real-time monitoring of gamma RBP variations holds promise as a parameter for implementing a customized closed-loop neuromodulation system for treating METH addiction.</description>

      <title>Allee Synaptic Plasticity and Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural plasticity is fundamental to memory storage and retrieval in biological systems, yet existing models often fall short in addressing noise sensitivity and unbounded synaptic weight growth. This paper investigates the Allee-based nonlinear plasticity model, emphasizing its biologically inspired weight stabilization mechanisms, enhanced noise robustness, and critical thresholds for synaptic regulation. We analyze its performance in memory retention and pattern retrieval, demonstrating increased capacity and reliability compared to classical models like Hebbian and Oja's rules. To address temporal limitations, we extend the model by integrating time-dependent dynamics, including eligibility traces and oscillatory inputs, resulting in improved retrieval accuracy and resilience in dynamic environments. This work bridges theoretical insights with practical implications, offering a robust framework for modeling neural adaptation and informing advances in artificial intelligence and neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Principles of Physiological Closed-Loop Controllers in Neuromodulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As neurostimulation devices increasingly incorporate closed-loop functionality, the greater design complexity brings additional requirements for risk management and special considerations to optimise benefit. This manuscript creates a common framework upon which all current and planned neuromodulation-based physiological closed-loop controllers (PCLCs) can be mapped including integration of the Technical Considerations of Medical Devices with Physiologic Closed-Loop Control Technology guidance published in 2023 by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a classification of feedback (reactive) and feedforward (predictive) biomarkers, and control systems theory. We explain risk management in the context of this framework and illustrate its applications for three exemplary technologies. This manuscript serves as guidance to the emerging field of PCLCs in neuromodulation, mitigating risk through standardized nomenclature and a systematic outline for rigorous device development, testing, and implementation.</description>

      <title>Effective Stimulus Propagation in Neural Circuits: Driver Node Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13615v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise control of signal propagation in modular neural networks represents a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. We establish a framework for identifying optimal control nodes that maximize stimulus transmission between weakly coupled neural populations. Using spiking stochastic block model networks, we systematically compare driver node selection strategies - including random sampling and topology-based centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, harmonic, and percolation centrality) - to determine minimal control inputs for achieving inter-population synchronization. Targeted stimulation of just 10-20% of the most central neurons in the source population significantly enhances spiking propagation fidelity compared to random selection. This approach yields a 64-fold increase in signal transfer efficiency at critical inter-module connection densities. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for precision neuromodulation in biological neural systems and neurotechnology applications.</description>

      <title>Sophisticated Learning: A novel algorithm for active learning during model-based planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Sophisticated Learning (SL), a planning-to-learn algorithm that embeds active parameter learning inside the Sophisticated Inference (SI) tree-search framework of Active Inference. Unlike SI -- which optimizes beliefs about hidden states -- SL also updates beliefs about model parameters within each simulated branch, enabling counterfactual reasoning about how future observations would improve subsequent planning.
  We compared SL with Bayes-adaptive Reinforcement Learning (BARL) agents as well as with its parent algorithm, SI. Using a biologically inspired seasonal foraging task in which resources shift probabilistically over a 10x10 grid, we designed experiments that forced agents to balance probabilistic reward harvesting against information gathering.
  In early trials, where rapid learning is vital, SL agents survive, on average, 8.2% longer than SI and 35% longer than Bayes-adaptive Reinforcement Learning. While both SL and SI showed equal convergence performance, SL reached this convergence 40% faster than SI. Additionally, SL showed robust out-performance of other algorithms in altered environment configurations.
  Our results show that incorporating active learning into multi-step planning materially improves decision making under radical uncertainty, and reinforces the broader utility of Active Inference for modeling biologically relevant behavior.</description>
