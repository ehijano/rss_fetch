      <title>Decentralized Social Media and Artificial Intelligence in Digital Public Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital public health monitoring has long relied on data from major social media platforms. Twitter was once an indispensable resource for tracking disease outbreaks and public sentiment in real time. Researchers used Twitter to monitor everything from influenza spread to vaccine hesitancy, demonstrating that social media data can serve as an early-warning system for emerging health threats. However, recent shifts in the social media landscape have challenged this data-driven paradigm. Platform policy changes, exemplified by Twitter's withdrawal of free data access, now restrict the very data that fueled a decade of digital public health research. At the same time, advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), have dramatically expanded our capacity to analyze large-scale textual data across languages and contexts. This presents a paradox: we possess powerful new AI tools to extract insights from social media, but face dwindling access to the data. In this viewpoint, we examine how digital public health monitoring is navigating these countervailing trends. We discuss the rise of decentralized social networks like Mastodon and Bluesky as alternative data sources, weighing their openness and ethical alignment with research against their smaller scale and potential biases. Ultimately, we argue that digital public health surveillance must adapt by embracing new platforms and methodologies, focusing on common diseases and broad signals that remain detectable, while advocating for policies that preserve researchers' access to public data in privacy-respective ways.</description>

      <title>Sedimentary models of fossil biomolecules, principles and methodological improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deamination has historically been important for authenticating ancient biomolecules. However, expanding paleogenomic datasets indicate that damage patterns are more influenced by burial hydrology and microstructural context than by molecular age or ancestry. Fossils interact with their environments differently: some form closed, water-restricted compartments that preserve minimally damaged endogenous biomolecules, whereas others serve as open molecular reservoirs in which infiltrated environmental biomolecules undergo extensive deamination from repeated water exposure. Reliance on deamination alone can therefore suppress endogenous signals and complicate the interpretation of exogenous sequences. By introducing the molecular sedimentation model for fossil biomolecules, this Perspective outlines a source tracing framework that integrates fossil microstructure, ecological reference sets, and species-specific fragments to enable more reliable molecular inference across diverse depositional environments.</description>

      <title>The Endocranial Cast of Khirtharia (Artiodactyla, Raoellidae) Provides New Insights into the Earliest Evolution of the Cetacean Brain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Introduction: Raoellidae are small artiodactyls retrieved from the middle Eocene of Asia (ca. -47 Ma) and closely related to stem Cetacea. Morphological observations of their endocranial structures allow for outlining some of the early steps of the evolutionary history of the cetacean brain. The external features of the brain and associated sinuses of Raoellidae are so far only documented by the virtual reconstruction of the endocast based on specimens of the species Indohyus indirae. These specimens are however too deformed to fully access the external morphology, surface area, and volume measurements of the brain. Methods: We bring here new elements to the picture of the raoellid brain by an investigation of the internal structures of an exceptionally well-preserved cranium collected from the Kalakot area (Jammu and Kashmir, India) referred to the species Khirtharia inflata. Micro-CT scan investigation and virtual reconstruction of the endocast and associated sinuses of this specimen provide crucial additional data about the morphological diversity within Raoellidae as well as reliable linear, surfaces, and volumes measurements, allowing for quantitative studies. Results: We show that, like I. indirae, the brain of K. inflata exhibits a mosaic of features observed in earliest artiodactyls: a small neocortex with simple folding pattern, widely exposed midbrain, and relatively long cerebellum. But, like Indohyus, the brain of Khirtharia shows unique derived characters also observed in stem cetaceans: narrow elongated olfactory bulbs and peduncles, posterior location of the braincase in the cranium, and complex network of blood vessels around the cerebellum. The volume of the brain relative to body mass of K. inflata is markedly small when compared to other early artiodactyls. Conclusion: We show here that cetaceans that nowadays have the second biggest brain after humans derive from a group of animals that had a lower-than-average expected brain size. This is probably a side effect of the adaptation to aquatic life. Conversely, this very small brain size relative to body mass might be another line of evidence supporting the aquatic habits in raoellids.</description>

      <title>Colorings of unrooted tree-based networks and related graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mathematical phylogenetics, evolutionary relationships are often represented by trees and networks. The latter are typically used whenever the relationships cannot be adequately described by a tree, which happens when so-called reticulate evolutionary events happen, such as horizontal gene transfer or hybridization. But as such events are known to be relatively rare for most species, evolution is sometimes thought of as a process that can be represented by a tree with some additional edges, i.e., with a network that is still ``somewhat treelike''. In this context, different versions of so-called tree-based networks have played a major role in recent phylogenetic literature. Yet, surprisingly little is known about their combinatorial and graph-theoretic properties. In our manuscript, we answer a recently published question concerning the colorability of a specific class of tree-based networks. In particular, we will investigate an even more general class of graphs and show their 3-colorability. This nicely links recent phylogenetic concepts with classical graph theory.</description>

Abstract: This review explores the integration of Artificial Intelligence into Horizon Scanning, focusing on identifying and responding to emerging threats and opportunities linked to Infectious Diseases. We examine how AI tools can enhance signal detection, data monitoring, scenario analysis, and decision support. We also address the risks associated with AI adoption and propose strategies for effective implementation and governance. The findings contribute to the growing body of Foresight literature by demonstrating the potential and limitations of AI in Public Health preparedness.</description>

      <title>Muller's ratchet in a near-critical regime: tournament versus fitness proportional selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Muller's ratchet, in its prototype version, models a haploid, asexual population whose size~$N$ is constant over the generations. Slightly deleterious mutations are acquired along the lineages at a constant rate, and individuals carrying less mutations have a selective advantage. The classical variant considers {\it fitness proportional} selection, but other fitness schemes are conceivable as well. Inspired by the work of Etheridge et al. ([EPW09]) we propose a parameter scaling which fits well to the ``near-critical'' regime that was in the focus of [EPW09] (and in which the mutation-selection ratio diverges logarithmically as $N\to \infty$). Using a Moran model, we investigate the``rule of thumb'' given in [EPW09] for the click rate of the ``classical ratchet'' by putting it into the context of new results on the long-time evolution of the size of the best class of the ratchet with (binary) tournament selection, which (other than that of the classical ratchet) follows an autonomous dynamics up to the time of its extinction.
  In [GSW23] it was discovered that the tournament ratchet has a hierarchy of dual processes which can be constructed on top of an Ancestral Selection graph with a Poisson decoration. For a regime in which the mutation/selection-ratio remains bounded away from 1, this was used in [GSW23] to reveal the asymptotics of the click rates as well as that of the type frequency profile between clicks. We will describe how these ideas can be extended to the near-critical regime in which the mutation-selection ratio of the tournament ratchet converges to 1 as $N\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Noisy information channel mediated prevention of the tragedy of the commons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synergy between evolutionary dynamics of cooperation and fluctuating state of shared resource being consumed by the cooperators is essential for averting the tragedy of the commons. Not only in humans, but also in the cognitively-limited organisms, this interplay between the resource and the cooperation is ubiquitously witnessed. The strategically interacting players engaged in such game-environment feedback scenarios naturally pick strategies based on their perception of the environmental state. Such perception invariably happens through some sensory information channels that the players are endowed with. The unfortunate reality is that any sensory channel must be noisy due to various factors; consequently, the perception of the environmental state becomes faulty rendering the players incapable of adopting the strategy that they otherwise would. Intriguingly, situation is not as bad as it sounds. Here we introduce the hitherto neglected information channel between players and the environment into the paradigm of stochastic evolutionary games with a view to bringing forward the counterintuitive possibility of emergence and sustenance of cooperation on account of the noise in the channel. Our primary study is in the simplest non-trivial setting of two-state stochastically fluctuating resource harnessed by a large unstructured population of cooperators and defectors adopting either memory-1 strategies or reactive strategies while engaged in repeated two-player interactions. The effect of noisy information channel in enhancing the cooperation in reactive-strategied population is unprecedented. We find that the propensity of cooperation in the population is inversely related to the mutual information (normalized by the channel capacity) of the corresponding information channel.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-free inference of phylogenetic tree posterior distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phylogenetic inference, the task of reconstructing how related sequences evolved from common ancestors, is a central objective in evolutionary genomics. The current state-of-the-art methods exploit probabilistic models of sequence evolution along phylogenetic trees, by searching for the tree maximizing the likelihood of observed sequences, or by estimating the posterior of the tree given the sequences in a Bayesian framework. Both approaches typically require to compute likelihoods, which is only feasible under simplifying assumptions such as independence of the evolution at the different positions of the sequence, and even then remains a costly operation. Here we present the first likelihood-free inference method for posterior distributions over phylogenies. It exploits a novel expressive encoding for pairs of sequences, and a parameterized probability distribution factorized over a succession of subtree merges. The resulting network provides accurate estimates of the posterior distribution outperforming both state-of-the-art maximum likelihood methods and a previous likelihood-free method for point estimation. It opens the way to fast and accurate phylogenetic inference under models of sequence evolution beyond those amenable to current likelihood-based inference methods.</description>
