      <title>Bridging Solar and Stellar Physics: Role of SDO in Understanding Stellar Active Regions and Atmospheric Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar-stellar connection provides a unique framework for understanding magnetic activity and atmospheric heating across a broad spectrum of stars. Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) of NASA, equipped with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, and Extreme ultraviolet Variability Experiment, has enabled detailed Sun-as-a-star studies that bridge solar and stellar physics. Integrating spatially resolved solar observations into disk-integrated datasets, these studies provide insights into magnetic activity occurring in distant stars. This review highlights key results from recent analyses that employed all three SDO instruments to characterize active regions, quantify universal heating relationships, and reconstruct stellar X-ray and ultraviolet spectra. We discuss how these findings advance our understanding of stellar magnetic activity, provide predictive tools for exoplanetary environments, and outline future directions for applying solar-based frameworks to diverse stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Gaia24ccy: An outburst followed the footsteps of its predecessor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion-driven outbursts in young stellar objects remain poorly understood, largely limited by a statistically small sample of closely followed-up events. This underscores the importance of a thorough exploration of each outbursting object. We studied a peculiar outbursting system, Gaia24ccy, which exhibited two $\Delta g \sim$ 3.8 mag outbursts in 2019 and 2024. The system consists of two unresolved, nearly identical, and rapidly rotating young stars: Gaia24ccy A (1.1419 days) and Gaia24ccy B (1.7898 days). Periodogram analyses just before the onset of the outbursts suggest Gaia24ccy B to be the outbursting component. Unlike any previously known EXor sources, the two outburst profiles show a very similar evolution: both rose at the same rate for the first 15 days, followed by many 'sub-bursts' on the timescale of 10-20 days. The 2019 outburst lasted 145-255 days, while the 2024 outburst persisted for 367 days. We infer the unstable region to lie at $r_{\rm trigger} \simeq 0.019-0.047$ au ($\sim5-12.3 R_\star$). The accreted mass per event $M_{\rm acc}\sim10^{-5} M_\odot$ can be provided by a compact inner-disk reservoir. The photometric rise/decay timescales and the mid-infrared color evolution favor a thermal-viscous trigger in a hot inner disk, while the appearance of rich emission-line spectra indicates concurrent magnetospheric compression - together best described by a hybrid picture. Finally, we explain the reddening of the mid-infrared color observed during the outburst as a consequence of the competing emission from the viscous disk and the photosphere.</description>

      <title>Stellar Paternity Tests: Matching High-Latitude B Stars to the Open Clusters of their Birth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: OB stars generally form in open clusters within the Milky Way's thin disk, so when they are found at high Galactic latitudes, it is thought that they were ejected from their birth clusters during the past few tens of millions of years. Using Gaia Data Release 3 (hereafter DR3) data, we traced the kinematic trajectories of 39 high-latitude B-type stars and 447 Galactic open clusters with high-quality astrometry to search for moments of past intersection. In cases where we found matching trajectories, we also considered the clusters' HR diagrams to confirm parent-orphan pairs have matching ages. Further analysis of the clusters' core environments allowed us to determine a probable ejection mechanism. Through these paternity tests, we have identified possible origins for five of these orphaned B-type stars. Here we present the likely travel times, ejection velocities, and a discussion of the runaway mechanism for each case. We also identify one star whose trajectory did not bring it near the disk during the time period of our analysis, and we discuss its possible origins as well.</description>

      <title>Multiple shocks generated by the 2024 May 14 coronal mass ejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study characterises a series of type~II radio bursts associated with a CME that occurred on 14 May, focusing on the coronal conditions during the event and identifying the likely location of the shocks where the radio bursts are generated. The CME was tracked using a combination of white light and extreme ultraviolet observations of the solar corona taken by three instruments: GOES-SUVI, two coronagraphs of the SOHO-LASCO, together with ground-based radio observations between 10-240~MHz from I-LOFAR. The radial distances of the radio sources were examined using a series of density models, with both PFSS and MHD models used to examine the coronal plasma conditions. Four type~II bursts were identified in the I$-$LOFAR radio dynamic spectrum over $\sim$15~minutes, exhibiting features such as band splitting, herringbones, and fragmentation. The shocks were found to have speeds ranging between $\sim$443$-$2075~km s$^{-1}$, with drift rates of $\sim-$361 to -78~kHz~s$^{-1}$. The shocks were found to have a $M_A \approx$ 3.21$-$3.57. indicating that they were super-Alfv\'enic. The first type~II burst was triggered $\sim$18~minutes after the CME launch, with each burst appearing to have been generated at a different height in the corona. Analysis of the derived kinematics and modelling results suggests that the type~II bursts were likely produced at the shoulders of the CME near the flanks, where open magnetic field lines and relatively low Alfv\'en speeds facilitated shock formation. This multi-instrument study shows that multiple type II bursts from a single CME originated at different coronal heights, with modelling indicating their generation near the CME flanks, where low Alfv\'en speeds and open magnetic field lines facilitated shock formation.</description>

      <title>Lithium as a probe of stellar and galactic physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium plays a unique role in astrophysics, as it is a powerful diagnostic for the physics and evolution of low-mass stars, Galactic archaeology, and cosmology. We review the Li observations in stars at different phases of their evolution, the strengths and the limitations of the current theoretical stellar models to explain the Li abundance data, our understanding of the Li sources and of the evolution of Li through- out the Galactic history. Key takeaways from the current state of the research in the field are: 1) Stellar evolution models accounting for fundamental transport processes of chemical species and angular momentum hold the promise of providing a common stellar Li depletion explanation to the Li abundance patterns observed in all Galactic stellar populations, including the dip and the plateau(s). 2) Novae are most probably the main source of Li in the Galaxy, on observational (but not yet theoretically established) grounds. 3) Radial migration of stars in the Galactic disk holds the key to understand many aspects of the Li evolution in the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>WFST Supernovae in the First Year: I. Statistical Study of 16 Early-phase Type Ia Supernovae from the Pilot Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present 16 early-phase type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) discovered during the pilot survey of the 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST-PS) from March 4 to July 10, 2024, including three SNe Ia with early-excess emission features (EExSNe Ia). The discovery magnitude of the 16 WFST-PS early-phase SNe is at least 3 mag fainter than their peak brightness. A large scatter of color indices is found in approximately the first 10 days of supernova explosions, indicating diverse photometric behaviors in the early phase. Three EExSNe Ia show relatively brighter peak luminosities and longer rise time compared to those of non-EExSNe Ia. The results indicate that current theoretical models require further refinement to fully capture the early photometric evolution of SNe Ia. Based on the initial high-cadence ugr-band data from the WFST-PS survey, we emphasize that early near-ultraviolet (NUV) observations are indispensable for placing tight constraints on the explosion mechanisms and progenitor systems of SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>WFST Supernovae in the First Year: II. SN 2024aedt: Systematical Study of a Transitional Type Ia Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic observations of a transitional type Ia SN 2024aedt, discovered by the 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) within one day of the explosion. Its light curve is characterized by a peak absolute magnitude of $M_B = -18.49 \pm 0.03$ mag and a decline rate of $\Delta m_{15}(B) = 1.53 \pm 0.36$ mag, placing the object on the $\Delta m_{15}(B)$--$M_B$ diagram in the transition region between normal and subluminous SNe Ia. Furthermore, the early-color evolution and host galaxy environment of SN 2024aedt underscore its transitional nature, sharing properties with both normal and 91bg-like SNe Ia. Light-curve modeling with MOSFiT yields a synthesized $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ mass of $0.414 \pm 0.042\,M_{\odot}$ and a total ejecta mass of $0.548 \pm 0.108\,M_{\odot}$. A comparison with theoretical models suggests that the evolutionary trend can be broadly explained by both delayed-detonation (DDT) and double-detonation (DDet) scenarios while possible early-excess emissions predicted by DDet cannot be identified given the limited detections soon after the SN explosion. Although the overall spectral evolution of SN 2024aedt is similar to that of other transitional SNe Ia, the spectroscopic comparison reveals diversity in the early-phase blue-end features, which becomes more homogeneous at later phases. The result indicates the importance of early-time observations in understanding the origin of SN Ia diversity.</description>

      <title>WFST Supernovae in the First Year: III. Systematical Study of the Photometric Behavior of Early-phase Core-collapse Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the multiband photometric properties of seven supernovae (SNe) showing double-peaked light-curve evolution and prominent shock-cooling emission, observed by the Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) during its first year of operation. By jointly employing an analytic early shock-cooling model and the Arnett radioactive-diffusion model, we fit the bolometric light curves and infer ejecta masses in the range $1.1$-$2.6 M_\odot$, consistent with a transitional population between ultra-stripped supernovae (USSNe) and normal stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe). The envelope masses are estimated to be $M_{\rm env}=0.1$-$0.4 M_\odot$, while the progenitors are constrained to be yellow or blue supergiants (YSGs/BSGs) with radii of $R=120$-$300 R_\odot$. Using empirical relations, we estimate progenitor luminosities of $L=10^{4.6}$-$10^{4.9} L_\odot$, corresponding to zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) masses of $8$-$20 M_\odot$. Theoretical models suggest that such progenitors are more naturally produced through binary evolution channels, as single-star evolutionary pathways are unable to yield ejecta masses this low.</description>

      <title>A Kinetic Route to Helicity-Constrained Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through 2D3V PIC simulations of freely decaying sub-ion turbulence, intermittent localized regions with $\mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{B} \neq 0$ are found to be statistically associated with reductions in the magnitude of magnetic helicity while evolving in the early electron-scale interaction phase. Motivated by this behavior, we propose a source-compensated, history-dependent helicity density that satisfies an exact local balance identity by construction, enabling Saffman-type two-point correlation integrals which, under standard flux-decorrelation assumptions, can exhibit intermediate-scale plateaus that are roughly time-independent. In our simulations we demonstrate such plateaus to remain approximately invariant even as the usual Saffman helicity integral plateau value $I_H$ evolves during the early kinetic stage. Under approximate single-scale self-similarity, the plateau behavior of the magnetic integral is consistent with the 2D decay constraint $BL \sim \text{const}$. For initially net-helical configurations, we observe rapid development of mixed-signed magnetic helicity patches and a decrease of the global fractional helicity, such that the decay over the kinetic interval is again most consistent with the cancellation-dominated scaling constraint.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Formation of Thioethanal (CH$_{3}$CHS). Gas-Phase and Ice-Surface Mechanisms involving Secondary Sulfur Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation pathways of sulfur-bearing species in the interstellar medium are crucial to understand astrochemical processes in cold molecular clouds and to gain new insights about the sulfur budget in these regions. We aim to explore the recently detected, thioethanal (CH$_{3}$CHS) formation mechanisms from thioethanol (CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH) as a precursor in addition to secondary sulfur products. The electronic structure methods and density functional theory for both gas-phase and ice-grain surface environments is employed. To mimic interstellar ice-mantles, we use medium (W6) and large amorphized (W22) water clusters as implemented in Binding Energy Evaluation protocol. A barrierless formation mechanism for CH$_{3}$CHS under low-temperature interstellar conditions is identified, in the gas phase. Surface environments modulate activation barriers in a site-specific manner, elucidated through both Langmuir-Hinshelwood and Eley-Rideal initiated surface reaction pathways. Compared to oxygen analogs, sulfur chemistry enables alternate pathways due to weaker S-H bonding, with a competing route forming ethane-1,1-di-thiol (CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH), on the ice-grain surface, potentially reducing CH$_{3}$CHS yields. The first accurate binding energy for thioethanol on water ice is also reported, confirming its greater volatility than ethanol. The proposed mechanism offers a tentative hypothesis for the apparent mutual exclusive detections of the CH$_{3}$CH$_{2}$SH and CH$_{3}$CHS in TMC-1, Orion, and Sgr B2(N), that further requires validation through quantitative astrochemical modeling and also to distinguish this chemical differentiation from observational sensitivity limitations. These qualitative findings highlight the multifaceted chemical behavior of sulfur-bearing organics in the interstellar medium and support CH$_{3}$CH(SH)SH as promising astro-chemical targets.</description>

      <title>Characterization of compressible fluctuations in solar wind streams dominated by balanced and imbalanced turbulence: Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter and Wind observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing compressible fluctuations in the solar wind is essential for understanding their role in solar wind acceleration and heating, yet their origin and evolution across different turbulence regimes remain poorly understood. In this study, we carry out a statistical analysis of the properties of compressible fluctuations in solar wind dominated by balanced and imbalanced turbulence. Using in-situ measurements from Wind, Solar Orbiter, and Parker Solar Probe, we investigate the scale dependence of density and magnetic field fluctuations and their correlations with plasma beta and radial distance. Our results indicate that solar wind compressibility is likely affected by both expansion effects and compressible dynamics governed by local plasma conditions. The non-Alfvenic wind is dominated by anti-correlated fluctuations, whereas the Alfvenic wind contains a mixture of correlated and anti-correlated fluctuations, though the latter remain prevalent. While the anti-correlated component is consistent with MHD slow magnetosonic modes, the correlated (fast mode-like) component is not reproduced by predictions from either linear MHD theory or nonlinear models of forced compressible fluctuations. Nevertheless, the dominant slow mode component explains the observed dependence on beta and the enhanced density fluctuations measured by Parker Solar Probe. This further suggests that slow mode waves contribute significantly to the compressible energy budget near the Sun and may play an important role in solar wind heating and acceleration close to the Sun.</description>

      <title>Evidence for Multimodal Superfluidity of Neutrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present theoretical and experimental evidence for a new phase of matter in neutron-rich systems that we call multimodal superfluidity. Using ab initio lattice calculations, we show that the condensate consists of coexisting s-wave pairs, p-wave pairs in entangled double pair combinations, and quartets composed of bound states of two s-wave pairs. We identify multimodal superfluidity as a general feature of single-flavor spin-1/2 fermionic systems with attractive s-wave and p-wave interactions, provided the system is stable against collapse into a dense droplet. Beyond neutrons at sub-saturation densities, we demonstrate that this phase appears in generalized attractive extended Hubbard models in one, two, and three dimensions. We elucidate the mechanism for this coexistence using self-consistent few-body Cooper models and compare with Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. We also derive the form of the effective action and show that spin, rotational, and parity symmetries remain unbroken. Finally, we analyze experimental data to show that p-wave pair gaps and quartet gaps are present in atomic nuclei, and we discuss the consequences of this new phase for the structure and dynamics of neutron star crusts.</description>

Abstract: Studying coronal rain formation through thermal non-equilibrium (TNE) and thermal instability (TI) provides insights into coronal heating mechanisms. We analysed a quiescent coronal rain event using space-based observations from the High-Resolution Imager in Extreme Ultraviolet (\hrieuv) of Solar Orbiter (SolO), the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) of the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), and the Slit-Jaw Imager (SJI) from the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) from November 1st, 2023. During the coronal rain shower, the coronal loop exhibits substantial EUV variability and structural changes. Rain clumps fell at $72-87$ km s$^{-1}$ with cool EUV absorbing core sizes of $\approx$600 km and densities of $\approx6\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$ preceded by strong compressions. These mostly isothermal compressions suggest energy transfer into the rain, decelerating it and possibly reducing cooling rates -- consistent with accretion braking timescales. The shower carried microflare-level energy ($4.64\times10^{26}$ erg), with clumps producing impacts that reach the lower transition region and are visible across all EUV channels and in SJI 1400 \AA. The impacts generated hot rebound flows ($10^{6.2}-10^{6.3} $K, $85-87$ km s$^{-1}$) that refilled and reheated the loop but carried less than $15\%$ of the clumps' kinetic energy. We detected steady footpoint heating signatures consistent with the TNE-TI scenario, with an estimated amplitude of $10^{-2\pm0.3}$ erg cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ and heating scale heights of $2-10$~Mm, matching active region values. Coronal rain may thus serve as both a template for accretion braking and a proxy for integrated heating driving TNE-TI cycles.</description>

      <title>First Resolution of a Main Sequence G-Star Astrosphere Using Chandra</title>

Abstract: We report resolution of a halo of X-ray line emission surrounding the Zero Age Main Sequence (ZAMS) G8.5V star HD 61005 by Chandra ACIS-S. Located only 36.4 pc distant, HD 61005 is young (approx. 100 Myr), x-ray bright (300 times Solar), observed with nearly edge-on geometry, and surrounded by Local Interstellar Medium (LISM) material denser than in the environ of the Sun. HD 61005 is known to harbor large amounts of circumstellar dust in a dense ecliptic plane full of mm-sized particles plus attached, extended wing like structures full of micron sized particles, which are evidence for a strong LISM-dust disk interaction. These properties aided our ability to resolve the 220 au wide astrosphere of HD61005, the first ever observed for a main sequence G-star. The observed x-ray emission morphology is roughly spherical, as expected for an astrospheric structure dominated by the host star. The Chandra spectrum of HD 61005 is a combination of a hard stellar coronal emission (T=8 MK) at Lx = 6 x10e29 erg per sec, plus an extended halo contribution at Lx = 1x10e29 erg per sec dominated by charge exchange (CXE) lines, such as those of OVIII and NeIX. The Chandra CXE x-ray morphology does not track the planar dust morphology but does extend out roughly to where the base of the dust wings begins. We present a toy model of x-ray emission produced by stellar wind (SW)-LISM CXE interactions, similar to the state of the young Sun when it was approximately 100 Myrs old (Guinan and Engle 2007), and transiting through an approximately 1000 times denser part of the interstellar medium (ISM) such as a Giant Molecular Cloud (Stern 2003, Opher and Loeb 2024).</description>

      <title>The magnetic origin of the outer boundaries of sunspots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11160v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Sunspot boundaries are commonly outlined by contours of the continuum intensity. However, their magnetic nature has not yet been fully characterised.
  Aims. We investigate the properties of the outer boundary of a long-lived sunspot to identify the magnetic property that defines it.
  Methods. We analysed the magnetic properties of AR NOAA11591 spot during its two passages across the solar disc, using SDO/HMI continuum intensity and magnetic field, and determined their contours to outline the outer boundary.
  Results. During the 1st disc passage, in which the sunspot is in its stable phase, the intensity contours at 0.9 of the mean quiet Sun intensity and isocontours of the magnetic field strength of 625G provide an almost perfect match between the two contours. With these thresholds, the time-averaged area of mismatch is minimised, yielding an average distance between the contours of 0.58 pixel, corresponding to less than 0.26 arcsec. During the 2nd disc passage, the spot shows clear signs of decay, and we find that the 0.9 intensity and 625G magnetic isocontours detach from each other, coupled to the disappearance of penumbra. In this super-equipartition area, granulation still operates.
  Conclusions. Based on a comparison with simulation data from our previous work, and in agreement with findings of other authors, we conclude that the outer boundary of stable sunspots is defined by an invariant magnetic field: the equipartition field. From the discrepancy between intensity and magnetic contours during the decaying phase of the sunspot, we surmise that alongside the well-established (magneto-)convective regimes of the photosphere - granular, penumbral, and umbral - a super-equipartition granular regime can be identified. In this regime, bright, but smaller granules occur where the magnetic field exceeds equipartition but remains sub-critical for convection suppression.</description>

      <title>How the Oblique Drift Instability Alters Solar Wind Heating and Constrains the Distribution of Solar Wind Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion-driven plasma instability thresholds, derived from linear theory, constrain the distribution of solar observations in parameter space, defining boundaries of stable plasma parameters. Excursions beyond these thresholds result in the emission of energy, transferred from particles to coherent electromagnetic waves, acting to adjust the system toward a more stable configuration. In this work, we use linear Vlasov--Maxwell theory to define parametric limits for a low-$\beta$ plasma that contains a drifting proton beam or helium ($\alpha$-particle) population. A sufficiently fast and dense drifting population triggers an Oblique Drift Instability (ODI). This instability decreases the velocity drift between the thermal core proton and secondary populations and prevents the ratio of core thermal to magnetic pressure $\beta_c$ from decreasing below a minimum value by increasing the temperatures - i.e. heating - of both the core and drifting populations. Our theoretical results are of interest for Parker Solar Probe observations, as they provide an additional mechanism for perpendicular heating of ions active in the sub-\Alfvenic solar wind. The ODI may explain the discrepancy between long-standing expectations of measurements of very low-$\beta$ plasmas with very large ion temperature anisotropies in the near-Sun environment and in situ observations, where $\beta$ is consistently measured above a few percent and the secondary ion populations drift faster than the bulk of proton population by no more than approximately the local Alfven speed.</description>

      <title>A compact object with a K type star companion in the solar neighborhood: a wide post common envelope binary with a white dwarf candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Post-common envelope binaries (PCEBs) consisting of a white dwarf (WD) plus a main-sequence (MS) star can constrain current prescriptions of common envelope evolution (CEE) and calibrate theoretical models of binary formation and evolution. Most PCEBs studied to date have typical orbital periods of hours to a few days and can be well explained by assuming inefficient CEE to expel the envelope. However, there are currently several systems with relatively wide orbital periods ($&gt;$18 days). To explain these wide PCEBs, additional sources of energy have been suggested to be taken into account. Here, we present the discovery and observational characterization of a compact object ($M\,\geq\,0.58\,\rm M_{\odot}$) with a K-type star companion in the solar neighborhood ($d\sim 112$ pc) and an orbital period of $P_{\rm orb}\sim 14$ days. The compact object binary is likely to be a system consisting of a WD and a barium dwarf, making it the shortest-period barium star binary candidate. Such a system with an orbital period within the gap between tight and wide binaries provides a test of whether additional energy sources are required to explain its formation. Using binary evolution models, we investigate the evolutionary history of this wide PCEB system and find that the observed properties of this source can be explained without invoking any extra energy source.</description>

      <title>Solar Wind Heating Near the Sun: A Radial Evolution Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing the plasma state in the near-Sun environment is essential to constrain the mechanisms that heat and accelerate the solar wind. In this study, we use Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations from Encounters 1 through 24 to investigate the radial evolution of solar wind plasma and magnetic field properties in this region. Using intervals with high field-of-view ($&gt;85\%$) coverage, we derive the radial profiles of magnetic field strength ($|B|$), proton density ($N$), bulk speed ($V$), total proton temperature ($T$), parallel ($T_\parallel$) and perpendicular ($T_\perp$) temperatures, temperature anisotropy ($T_\perp/T_\parallel$), plasma beta ($\beta$), Alfv\'{e}n Mach number ($M_A$), and magnetic field fluctuations ($\delta B/B$) for sub and super-Alfv\'{e}nic regions. In super-Alfv\'{e}nic regions, power-law of $|B|$, $N$, $V$, and $T$ as a function of heliocentric distance are broadly consistent with previous \textit{Helios} results at $&gt;0.3$ AU. The radial evolution of the components of the temperature tensor reveals distinct behavior: $T_\perp$ decreases monotonically with distance, whereas $T_\parallel$ exhibits a non-monotonic trend -- decreasing in the sub-Alfv\'{e}nic region, increasing just beyond the Alfv\'{e}n surface. We interpret the increase in $T_\parallel$ as a proxy for proton beam occurrence. We further examine the evolution of magnetic field fluctuations, finding decreasing radial/parallel fluctuations but enhanced tangential/normal/perpendicular fluctuations in sunward direction. These fluctuations may provide free energy for beam generation and particle heating via wave-particle interactions.</description>

      <title>A Unified Charge-Dependent Modulation Model for AMS-02 Proton and Antiproton Fluxes during Solar Minimum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified charge-dependent solar modulation model by solving the three-dimensional Parker transport equation, incorporating a realistic wavy heliospheric current sheet to treat drift effects self-consistently. Using a local interstellar spectrum from GALPROP constrained by Voyager data, we fit the model to time-resolved proton and antiproton fluxes measured by the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer - 02 (AMS-02) during the solar-quiet period (May 2011 to June 2022). To enable rapid parameter scans, we employ neural-network-based surrogate models to compute propagation and modulation matrices efficiently. The results demonstrate that the model simultaneously describes the observed proton and antiproton fluxes with physically reasonable parameters, providing a unified account of charge-dependent modulation.</description>
