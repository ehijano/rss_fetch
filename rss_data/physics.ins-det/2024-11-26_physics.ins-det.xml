      <title>All Electrical NZFMR Magnetometry up to 500$^\circ$C Using SiC Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silicon Carbide (SiC) is renowned for its exceptional thermal stability, making it a crucial material for high-temperature power devices in extreme environments. While optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) in SiC has been widely studied for magnetometry, it requires complex setups involving optical and microwave sources. Similarly, electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR) in SiC, which relies on an electrical readout of spin resonance, has also been explored for magnetometry. However, both techniques require microwave excitation, which limits their scalability. In contrast, SiC's spin-dependent recombination (SDR) currents enable a purely electrical approach to magnetometry through the near zero-field magnetoresistance (NZFMR) effect, where the device resistance changes in response to small magnetic fields. Despite its potential, NZFMR remains underexplored for high-temperature applications. In this work, we demonstrate the use of NZFMR in SiC diodes for high-temperature magnetometry and achieve sensitive detection of weak magnetic fields at temperatures up to 500$^\circ$C . Our technology offers a simple and cost-effective alternative to other magnetometry architectures. The NZFMR signal is modulated by an external magnetic field, which alters the singlet-triplet pair ratio controlled by hyperfine interactions between nuclear and electron/hole spins as well as dipole-dipole/exchange interactions between electron and hole spins, providing a novel mechanism for magnetometry sensing at elevated temperatures. A critical advantage of our approach is its low power consumption -less than 0.5 W at 500$^\circ$C for magnetic fields below 5 Gauss. This approach provides a sensitive, reliable, and scalable solution with promising applications in space exploration, automotive systems, and industrial sectors, where high performance in extreme conditions is essential.</description>

      <title>Single-Shot Ionization-Based Transverse Profile Monitor for Pulsed Electron Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental demonstration of a single-shot, non-destructive electron beam diagnostic based on the ionization of a low-density pulsed gas jet. In our study, 7~MeV electron bunches from a radio frequency (RF) photoinjector, carrying up to 100 pC of charge, traversed a localized distribution of nitrogen gas (N$_2$). The interaction of the electron bunches with the N$_2$ gas generated a correlated signature in the ionized particle distribution, which was spatially magnified using a series of electrostatic lenses and recorded with a micro-channel-plate detector. Various modalities, including point-to-point imaging and velocity mapping, are investigated. A temporal trace of the detector current enabled the identification of single- and double-ionization events. The characteristics of the ionization distribution, dependence on gas density, total bunch charge, and other parameters, are described. Approaches to scaling to higher electron bunch density and energy are suggested. Additionally, the instrument proves useful for comprehensive studies of the ionization process itself.</description>

      <title>Project TAIPAN: Results from a Novel Gravity Gradiometer Field Test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Project TAIPAN has been carried out jointly by Trinity Research Lab and the Frequency and Quantum Metrology Research Group located at the School of Physics, Mathematics and Computing of the University of Western Australia (UWA). Lockheed Martin Corporation (USA) has also been a partner in this joint collaboration providing financial backing to the project and other support including advanced modelling, assessment of laboratory tests and data analysis. The project aim was to develop a miniaturised gravity gradiometer to measure horizontal mixed gradient components of the Earth gravity in a small, lightweight package that can be deployed in a fixed 4D mode, in a borehole, or on moving exploration platforms including ground-based, airborne and submersible. The gradiometer design has evolved through a few prototypes combining the design of its sensing element with ultra low noise microwave and capacitive read out. The most recent prototype of the gradiometer using novel ultra sensitive capacitive pick off metrology has been trialled in the harsh environment of Outback Western Australia over a known gravity anomaly displaying steep gradients. Despite adverse weather conditions, results of the trial indicate that the gradiometer operated as expected, closely replicating the gravity gradient profile extrapolated from a regional gravity survey.</description>

      <title>Detection of Sulfur Dioxide by Broadband Cavity-Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy (BBCEAS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sulfur dioxide ($\mathrm{SO}_2$) is an important precursor for the formation of atmospheric sulfate aerosol and acid rain. We present an instrument using Broadband Cavity-Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy (BBCEAS) for the measurement of $\mathrm{SO}_2$ with a minimum limit of detection of 0.75 ppbv (3-$\sigma$) using the spectral range 305.5--312 nm and an averaging time of 5 min. The instrument consists of high-reflectivity mirrors (0.9985 at 310 nm) and a deep UV light source (Light Emitting Diode). The effective absorption path length of the instrument is 610 m with a 0.966 m base length. Published reference absorption cross sections were used to fit and retrieve the $\mathrm{SO}_2$ concentrations and were compared to fluorescence standard measurements for $\mathrm{SO}_2$. The comparison was well correlated ($R^2 = 0.9998$) with a correlation slope of 1.04. Interferences for fluorescence measurements were tested, and the BBCEAS showed no interference, while ambient measurements responded similarly to standard measurement techniques.</description>

      <title>Continuous-wave cryogenic optical absorption spectrometer for sub-THz frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design of a continuous-wave, highly sensitive optical spectrometer for millimeter-wave frequencies between 50 and 1000 GHz. The spectrometer uses photomixing of near-infrared light to generate radiation in a wide frequency range, and the absorbed optical power is determined directly through measurements of the sample temperature. This enables relative sensitivities of up to $10^6$ for the sample absorption coefficient below liquid-helium temperatures, suitable for measurements on highly reflective samples. The instrument is also compatible with high magnetic fields. In order to validate its performance, we measure the ferromagnetic resonance in the Mott insulator YTiO$_3$, the electron spin resonance in a standard free-radical reference compound, and the antiferromagnetic resonance in a van der Waals magnetic material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space exploration to have the biosignatures of extraterrestrial life on different planets with oceans in our solar system and beyond requires the design and manufacturing of robust and reliable electronic systems that can be used for sensing, data processing, controlling motor/actuators, and communication while surviving an extreme environment. Commercial off the shelf (COTS) components cannot survive a long time in such harsh environments after being housed in a Warm Electronics Box, and any electronic system designed for such extreme conditions must be tailored to suit such operation. The presence of extremely cold temperatures and high radiation adversely affects the device parameters over time, i.e. the operation of electronic systems.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Resolution of the Timepix4 Detector for 100 keV and 200 keV Electrons for Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have evaluated the imaging capabilities of the Timepix4 hybrid silicon pixel detector for 100 keV and 200 keV electrons in a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM). Using the knife-edge method, we have measured the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) at both energies. Our results show a decrease in MTF response at Nyquist (spatial) frequency, dropping from approximately 0.16 at 100 keV to 0.0046 at 200 keV. However, by using the temporal structure of the detected events, including the arrival time and amplitude provided by the Timepix4, we enhanced the spatial discrimination of electron arrival. This approach improved the MTF at Nyquist by factors of 2.12 for 100 keV and 3.16 for 200 keV. These findings demonstrate that the blurring effects caused by extended electron trajectories within the sensing layer can be effectively corrected in the image data.</description>

      <title>Transforming Antarctic Ice into a Cherenkov Neutrino Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this chapter, we describe how the IceCube Neutrino Observatory transformed a cubic kilometer of natural ice at the geographic South Pole into a neutrino telescope. The concept of using the neutrino as an astronomical messenger is as old as the neutrino itself, and the challenge to open this new window on the high-energy universe was technological in nature. We discuss how IceCube was constructed and how the detector operates, including some detail on the 5,484 optical sensors that comprise the array. We highlight some of the primary results of the experiment, including the discovery of a diffuse flux of high-energy neutrinos reaching us from the cosmos, the observation of the first high-energy neutrino sources in the sky, and the observation of our Galaxy in neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Boosting Photon-Number-Resolved Detection Rates of Transition-Edge Sensors by Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition-Edge Sensors (TESs) are very effective photon-number-resolving (PNR) detectors that have enabled many photonic quantum technologies. However, their relatively slow thermal recovery time severely limits their operation rate in experimental scenarios compared to leading non-PNR detectors. In this work, we develop an algorithmic approach that enables TESs to detect and accurately classify photon pulses without waiting for a full recovery time between detection events. We propose two machine-learning-based signal processing methods: one supervised learning method and one unsupervised clustering method. By benchmarking against data obtained using coherent states and squeezed states, we show that the methods extend the TES operation rate to 800 kHz, achieving at least a four-fold improvement, whilst maintaining accurate photon-number assignment up to at least five photons. Our algorithms will find utility in applications where high rates of PNR detection are required and in technologies which demand fast active feed-forward of PNR detection outcomes.</description>

      <title>Electronic Trap Detection with Carrier-Resolved Photo-Hall Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic trap states are a critical yet unavoidable aspect of semiconductor devices, impacting performance of various electronic devices such as transistors, memory devices, solar cells, and LEDs. The density, energy level, and position of these trap states often enable or constrain device functionality, making their measurement crucial in materials science and device fabrication. Most methods for measuring trap states involve fabricating a junction, which can inadvertently introduce or alter traps, highlighting the need for alternative, less-invasive techniques. Here, we present a unique photo-Hall-based method to detect and characterize trap density and energy level while concurrently extracting key carrier properties, including mobility, photocarrier density, recombination lifetime, and diffusion length. This technique relies on analyzing the photo-Hall data in terms of "photo-Hall conductivity" vs. electrical conductivity under varying light intensities and temperatures. We show that the photo-Hall effect, in the presence of traps, follows an $\textit{astonishingly simple}$ relationship - $\textit{a hyperbola equation}$ - that reveals detailed insights into charge transport and trap occupation. We have successfully applied this technique to P and N-type silicon as a benchmark and to high-performance halide perovskite photovoltaic films. This technique substantially expands the capability of Hall effect-based measurements by integrating the effects of the four most common excitations in nature - electric field, magnetic field, photon, and phonon in solids - into a single equation and enabling unparalleled extraction of charge carrier and trap properties in semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Steerable dual-trap optical tweezers with confocal position detection using back-scattered light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical tweezers has emerged as a powerful tool in manipulating microscopic particles and in measuring weak forces of the order of a pico-Newton. As a result, it has found wide applications ranging from material science to biology. Dual-trap optical tweezers (DTOT) are of particular importance as they allow for two point correlation measurements as in molecular force spectroscopy, two-point active micro-rheology, etc. Here we report a novel design for a steerable DTOT setup which uses back-scattered light from the two traps for position detection. This is performed using a confocal scheme where the two detectors are placed at the conjugate points to the respective traps. This offers several significant advantages over current designs, such as, zero cross-talk between signals, single module assembly and robustness to thermal drift. Moreover, our design can be very easily integrated with standard microscopy techniques like Phase contrast and Differential Interference Contrast, without modifying the microscope illumination unit.</description>

      <title>Impact of gas background on XFEL single-particle imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-particle imaging (SPI) using X-ray free-electron Lasers (XFELs) offers the potential to determine protein structures at high spatial and temporal resolutions without the need for crystallization or vitrification. However, the technique faces challenges due to weak diffraction signals from single proteins and significant background scattering from gases used for sample delivery. A recent observation of a diffraction pattern from an isolated GroEL protein complex had similar numbers of signal and background photons. Ongoing efforts aim to reduce the background created by sample delivery, with one approach replacing most of the used gas with helium. In this study, we investigate the effects of a potentially reduced background on the resolution limits for SPI of isolated proteins under different experiment conditions. As a test case, we used GroEL, and we used experimentally measured parameters for our simulations. We observe that background significantly impacts the achievable resolution, particularly when the signal strength is comparable to the background, and a background reduction would lead to a significant improvement in resolution.</description>

      <title>In-situ biological ozone detection by measuring electrochemical impedances of plant tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work demonstrates biological detection of a low concentration of O3 by measuring electrochemical impedances of tissues in tobacco and tomato plants located indoor and outdoor. The lower range of generated ozone in the O3-air mix is about 30 ug/m3 over the atmospheric level, which allows phytosensors to be considered as biodetectors of environmental pollutants. The ozone stress affects stomatal regulation that in turn influences the hydrodynamics of fluid transport system in plants. Sensors utilize electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to measure ionic fluid content at several positions on the plant stem and calculate a variation of fluid distribution in control and experimental cases indoors. Outdoor setup uses the same methodology and sensors but different analysis due to uncontrolled nature of ozone pollution and the overlap of various stressors. The measurement results indicate a qualitative and quantitative reaction of hydrodynamic system to changes in O3 concentration in the upper part of stem with a delay of 10-20 minutes between the onset of exposure and biological response. The probability of false-negative responses from a single plant is about 0.15 +/-0.06. Pooling data from at least three plants allows for 92% confidence in detecting excess O3. Measurements on days with low and high ozone levels of 80 ug/m3 to 130 ug/m3 result in a 2.33-fold difference in sensor values and thus demonstrate biological detection of high O3 also outdoors. Statistically significant data include 948 sensor-plant attempts during 51 days with 9 plants and about 10E7 samples collected in automated experiments. Long-term measurements have demonstrated the high reliability of electrochemical sensors, especially in harsh outdoor conditions with rain, heat and UV/IR radiations. The described approach has applications in environmental monitoring, biological pollution detection and biosensing.</description>

      <title>Methods for energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy with photon-counting and deconvolution techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectroscopic techniques are essential for studying material properties, but the small cross-sections of some methods may result in low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) in the collected spectra. In this article we present methods, based on combining Bragg spectroscopy with photon counting and deconvolution algorithms, which increase the SNRs, making the spectra better suited to further analysis. We aim to provide a comprehensive guide for constructing spectra from camera images. The efficacy of these methods is validated on synthetic and experimental data, the latter coming from the field of high-energy density (HED) science, where x-ray spectroscopy is essential for the understanding of materials under extreme thermodynamic conditions.</description>

      <title>Impact of mechanical disturbances to the placement of reference light in Fourier transform interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fourier transform interferometers usually need a dedicated reference light to precisely track optical path difference changes. There are a few different ways to incorporate the reference light into the optical system. This paper conducted experiments to give a test of how different ways of incorporating reference light are affected by mechanical disturbances. It found that placing the reference light in different path than the test light can be very sensitive to mechanical disturbance errors while propagating the reference light together with the test light can be very robust against mechanical vibrations of optical components.</description>

      <title>Interpretable machine learning approach for electron antineutrino selection in a large liquid scintillator detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several neutrino detectors, KamLAND, Daya Bay, Double Chooz, RENO, and the forthcoming large-scale JUNO, rely on liquid scintillator to detect reactor antineutrino interactions. In this context, inverse beta decay represents the golden channel for antineutrino detection, providing a pair of correlated events, thus a strong experimental signature to distinguish the signal from a variety of backgrounds. However, given the low cross-section of antineutrino interactions, the development of a powerful event selection algorithm becomes imperative to achieve effective discrimination between signal and backgrounds. In this study, we introduce a machine learning (ML) model to achieve this goal: a fully connected neural network as a powerful signal-background discriminator for a large liquid scintillator detector. We demonstrate, using the JUNO detector as an example, that, despite the already high efficiency of a cut-based approach, the presented ML model can further improve the overall event selection efficiency. Moreover, it allows for the retention of signal events at the detector edges that would otherwise be rejected because of the overwhelming amount of background events in that region. We also present the first interpretable analysis of the ML approach for event selection in reactor neutrino experiments. This method provides insights into the decision-making process of the model and offers valuable information for improving and updating traditional event selection approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radon is a common background source for underground astroparticle physics experiments and its removal is essential. In this study, we fabricated several prototype silver-ion exchanged zeolites, measured their radon adsorption properties, and evaluated their applicability for radon removal in underground experiments. As a result, we succeeded in producing a prototype silver-ion exchanged zeolite that showed better radon adsorption properties than preceding studies.</description>

      <title>Performance of the CMS high-level trigger during LHC Run 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The CERN LHC provided proton and heavy ion collisions during its Run 2 operation period from 2015 to 2018. Proton-proton collisions reached a peak instantaneous luminosity of 2.1 $\times$ 10$^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, twice the initial design value, at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV. The CMS experiment records a subset of the collisions for further processing as part of its online selection of data for physics analyses, using a two-level trigger system: the Level-1 trigger, implemented in custom-designed electronics, and the high-level trigger, a streamlined version of the offline reconstruction software running on a large computer farm. This paper presents the performance of the CMS high-level trigger system during LHC Run 2 for physics objects, such as leptons, jets, and missing transverse momentum, which meet the broad needs of the CMS physics program and the challenge of the evolving LHC and detector conditions. Sophisticated algorithms that were originally used in offline reconstruction were deployed online. Highlights include a machine-learning b tagging algorithm and a reconstruction algorithm for tau leptons that decay hadronically.</description>

      <title>The SABRE South Technical Design Report Executive Summary</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Technical Design Report (TDR) we describe the SABRE South detector to be built at the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory (SUPL). The SABRE South detector is designed to test the long-standing DAMA/LIBRA signal of an annually modulating rate consistent with dark matter by using the same target material. SABRE South uses seven ultra-high purity NaI(Tl) crystals (with a total target mass of either 35 kg or 50 kg), hermetically sealed in copper enclosures that are suspended within a liquid scintillator active veto. High quantum efficiency and low background Hamamatsu R11065 photomultiplier tubes are directly coupled to both ends of the crystal, and enclosed with the crystal in an oxygen free high thermal conductivity copper enclosure. The active veto system consists of 11.6 kL of linear alkylbenzene (LAB) doped with a mixture of fluorophores and contained in a steel vessel, which is instrumented with at least 18 Hamamatsu R5912 photomultipliers. The active veto tags key radiogenic backgrounds intrinsic to the crystals, such as ${^{40}}$K, and is expected to suppress the total background by 27% in the 1-6 keV region of interest. In addition to the liquid scintillator veto, a muon veto is positioned above the detector shielding. This muon veto consists of eight EJ-200 scintillator modules, with Hamamatsu R13089 photomultipliers coupled to both ends. With an expected total background of 0.72 cpd/kg/keV, SABRE South can test the DAMA/LIBRA signal with 5$\sigma$ discovery or 3$\sigma$ exclusion after two years of data taking.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Reactor Safeguarding with Neutrino Detection for MOX Loading Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The resurgence of interest in nuclear power around the world highlights the importance of effective methods to safeguard against nuclear proliferation. Many powerful safeguarding techniques have been developed and are currently employed, but new approaches are needed to address proliferation challenges from emerging advanced reactor designs and fuel cycles. Building on prior work that demonstrated monitoring of nuclear reactor operation using neutrino detectors, we develop and present a simple quantitative statistical test suitable for analysis of measured reactor neutrino data and demonstrate its efficacy in a semi-cooperative reactor monitoring scenario. In this approach, a moderate-sized neutrino detector is placed near the reactor site to help monitor possible MOX fuel diversion independent of inspection-based monitoring. We take advantage of differing time-dependent neutrino count rates during the operating cycle of a reactor core to monitor any deviations of measurements from expectations given a declared fuel composition. For a five-ton idealized detector placed 25m away from a hypothetical 3565 MWth reactor, the statistical test is capable of detecting the diversion of ~80kg plutonium at the 95% confidence level 90% of the time over a 540-day observation period.</description>

      <title>First operation of a multi-channel Q-Pix prototype: measuring transverse electron diffusion in a gas time projection chamber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05734v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report measurements of the transverse diffusion of electrons in P-10 gas (90% Ar, 10% CH4) in a laboratory-scale time projection chamber (TPC) utilizing a novel pixelated signal capture and digitization technique known as Q-Pix. The Q-Pix method incorporates a precision switched integrating transimpedance amplifier whose output is compared to a threshold voltage. Upon reaching the threshold, a comparator sends a 'reset' signal, initiating a discharge of the integrating capacitor. The time difference between successive resets is inversely proportional to the average current at the pixel in that time interval, and the number of resets is directly proportional to the total collected charge. We developed a 16-channel Q-Pix prototype fabricated from commercial off-the-shelf components and coupled them to 16 concentric annular anode electrodes to measure the spatial extent of the electron swarm that reaches the anode after drifting through the uniform field of the TPC. The swarm is produced at a gold photocathode using pulsed UV light. The measured transverse diffusion agrees with simulations in PyBoltz across a range of operating pressures (200-1500 Torr). These results demonstrate that a Q-Pix readout can successfully reconstruct the ionization topology in a TPC.</description>

      <title>First Indication of Solar $^8$B Neutrinos via Coherent Elastic Neutrino-Nucleus Scattering with XENONnT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first measurement of nuclear recoils from solar $^8$B neutrinos via coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering with the XENONnT dark matter experiment. The central detector of XENONnT is a low-background, two-phase time projection chamber with a 5.9 t sensitive liquid xenon target. A blind analysis with an exposure of 3.51 t$\times$yr resulted in 37 observed events above 0.5 keV, with ($26.4^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$) events expected from backgrounds. The background-only hypothesis is rejected with a statistical significance of 2.73 $\sigma$. The measured $^8$B solar neutrino flux of $(4.7_{-2.3}^{+3.6})\times 10^6 \mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is consistent with results from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory. The measured neutrino flux-weighted CE$\nu$NS cross section on Xe of $(1.1^{+0.8}_{-0.5})\times10^{-39} \mathrm{cm}^2$ is consistent with the Standard Model prediction. This is the first direct measurement of nuclear recoils from solar neutrinos with a dark matter detector.</description>
