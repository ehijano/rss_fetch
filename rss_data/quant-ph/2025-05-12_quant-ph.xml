      <title>Schrodinger's Field Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intrinsic and dynamic kinetic energies, and the potential energies of electron states in the hydrogen atom, were determined using the operator formalism in the Schrodinger nonrelativistic equation. Intrinsic energies were determined using the momentum operator, while the additional dynamic energies of the spinning fields were determined using the angular momentum operator. All 10 states up to the principal quantum number n = 3 and all m states of n = 7, l = 3 were analyzed. The two forms of kinetic energy can only be explained with an electron field representation. All total kinetic and potential energies conformed with the well known 1/n^2 rule. Angular momentum analysis of the 2P1/2 states provided a field spinning rate; in addition, the dynamic kinetic energy of the spinning field determined by both operator analysis and explicit calculation based on the spinning rate gave the same energy results.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Measurement-Device-Independent Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In theory, quantum key distribution (QKD) promises unconditional secure generation of the key between two remote participants, based on the laws of quantum physics. However, because of the imperfections in the real-life implementation of QKD, this promise fails. To fill the gap between the theory and implementation of QKD, different protocols have been proposed. One of them is measurement device independent (MDI) QKD, which can be implemented using present-day technology and generates a reasonable key rate. The protocol works perfectly fine for intracity communication. However, the transmission distance is not enough, so that it can replace intercity communication. For that, adaptive measurement device-independent (AMDI) QKD has been proposed. So, the present-day classical communication network such as the internet can be replaced with its quantum version. Till the date, AMDI-QKD has been implemented with threshold detectors. In this paper, we replaced threshold detectors with photon-number resolving detectors, thus making the protocol more realistic. We calculated the secret key rate for the case and discussed its dependence on transmission distance. We also discussed the dependence of the sifted key rate and quantum bit error rate (QBER) on the transmission distance.</description>

      <title>A Circuit-QED Lattice System with Flexible Connectivity and Gapped Flat Bands for Photon-Mediated Spin Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin models are ubiquitous in solid-state physics, but classical simulation of them remains extremely challenging. Experimental testbed systems with a variety of spin-spin interactions and measurement channels are therefore needed. One promising potential route to such testbeds is provided by microwave-photon-mediated interactions between superconducting qubits, where native strong light-matter coupling enables significant interactions even for virtual-photon-mediated processes. In this approach, the spin-model connectivity is set by the photonic mode structure, rather than the spatial structure of the qubit. Lattices of coplanar-waveguide (CPW) resonators have been demonstrated to allow extremely flexible connectivities and can therefore host a huge variety of photon-mediated spin models. However, large-scale CPW lattices have never before been successfully combined with superconducting qubits. Here we present the first such device featuring a quasi-1D CPW lattice with a non-trivial band structure and multiple transmon qubits. We demonstrate that superconducting-qubit readout and diagnostic techniques can be generalized to this highly multimode environment and observe the effective qubit-qubit interaction mediated by the bands of the resonator lattice. This device completes the toolkit needed to realize CPW lattices with qubits in one or two Euclidean dimensions, or negatively-curved hyperbolic space, and paves the way to driven-dissipative spin models with a large variety of connectivities.</description>

      <title>Efficient calculation of Green's functions on quantum computers via simultaneous circuit perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel, ancilla-free algorithm to compute Retarded Green's Functions (RGFs) on quantum computers. Our proposal is based on real-time evolution and specifically designed circuit components, which we refer to as circuit perturbations, acting as a direct representation of the external perturbative force within the quantum circuit in a linear response framework. First, we establish a direct analytical connection between the evaluation of circuit derivatives and the computation of RGFs. We then build on this connection to devise a new approach involving multiple simultaneous time perturbations. Our method does not require long-range connections and is efficient in terms of circuit calls, allowing us to compute the RGFs at different times simultaneously. We benchmark the protocol on the one-dimensional Heisenberg and Fermi-Hubbard models, comparing the resulting dynamical correlations and spectral functions with exact diagonalization. The results demonstrate good quantitative agreement with the predicted solutions even under realistic noise models, highlighting the practical potential of our method for studying complex dynamical phenomena on near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Bridging Classical and Quantum Information Scrambling with the Operator Entanglement Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05575v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal features of chaotic quantum dynamics underlie our understanding of thermalization in closed quantum systems and the complexity of quantum computations. Reversible automaton circuits, comprised of classical logic gates, have emerged as a tractable means to study such dynamics. Despite generating no entanglement in the computational basis, these circuits nevertheless capture many features expected from fully quantum evolutions. In this work, we demonstrate that the differences between automaton dynamics and fully quantum dynamics are revealed by the operator entanglement spectrum, much like the entanglement spectrum of a quantum state distinguishes between the dynamics of states under Clifford and Haar random circuits. While the operator entanglement spectrum under random unitary dynamics is governed by the eigenvalue statistics of random Gaussian matrices, we show evidence that under random automaton dynamics it is described by the statistics of Bernoulli random matrices, whose entries are random variables taking values $0$ or $1$. We study the crossover between automaton and generic unitary operator dynamics as the automaton circuit is doped with gates that introduce superpositions, namely Hadamard or $R_x = e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}X}$ gates. We find that a constant number of superposition-generating gates is sufficient to drive the operator dynamics to the random-circuit universality class, similar to earlier results on Clifford circuits doped with $T$ gates. This establishes the operator entanglement spectrum as a useful tool for probing the chaoticity and universality class of quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum-network nodes with real-time noise mitigation using spectator qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum networks might enable quantum communication and distributed quantum computation. Solid-state defects are promising platforms for such networks, because they provide an optical interface for remote entanglement distribution and a nuclear-spin register to store and process quantum information. A key challenge towards larger networks is to improve the storage of previously generated entangled states during new entanglement generation. Here, we introduce a method that uses `spectator' qubits combined with real-time decision making and feedforward to mitigate dephasing of stored quantum states during remote entanglement sequences. We implement the protocol using a single NV center in diamond and demonstrate improved memory fidelity. Our results show that spectator qubits can improve quantum network memory using minimal overhead and naturally present resources, making them a promising addition for near-term testbeds for quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Prospects of Quantum Error Mitigation for Quantum Signal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error mitigation (QEM) protocols have provably exponential bounds on the cost scaling; however, exploring which regimes QEM can recover usable results is still of sizable interest. The expected absence of complete error correction for near-term and intermediate-term quantum devices means that QEM protocols will remain relevant for devices with low enough error rates to attempt small examples of fault-tolerant algorithms.
  Herein, we are interested in the performance of QEM with a template for quantum algorithms, quantum signal processing (QSP). QSP-based algorithms are designed with an especially simple relation between the circuit depths and the algorithm's parameters, including the required precision. Hence, they may be a useful playground for exploring QEM's practical performance and costs for a range of controlled parameters. As a preliminary step in this direction, this work explores the performance of zero-noise-extrapolation (ZNE) on a Hamiltonian simulation algorithm designed within QSP under local depolarizing noise.
  We design a QSP-based Hamiltonian simulation of a modified Ising model under depolarizing noise for low precision and varying simulation times. We quantify for which noise and depth regimes our ZNE protocol can recover an approximation of the noiseless expectation value.
  We discuss existing bounds on the sample budget, eventually using a fixed number of shots. While this does not guarantee the success of QEM, it gives us usable results in relevant cases. Finally, we briefly discuss and present a numerical study on the region where ZNE is unusable, even given an unlimited sample budget.</description>

      <title>L\'evy Light Cones and Critical Causality in Fractional Multiscale Quantum Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study causality and criticality in a one-dimensional fractional multiscale transverse-field Ising model, where fractional derivatives generate long range interactions beyond the scope of standard power laws. Such fractional responses are common in classical systems including the anomalous stress-strain behaviour of viscoelastic polymers, L\'evy-like contaminant transport in heterogeneous porous media, and the non-Debye dielectric relaxation of glassy dielectrics. Furthermore, these unique interactions can be implemented in current quantum information architectures, with intriguing consequences for the many-body dynamics. Using a truncated Jordan-Wigner approach, we show that in the long wavelength limit of the mean field, the dynamical critical exponent is set by the fractional order q as $z=q/2$. To probe genuine many-body dynamics, we apply matrix-product-state simulations with the time-dependent variational principle adapted to nonlocal couplings. Tracking the entanglement-entropy light cone and performing finite-size scaling of the many-body gap for $0&lt;q&lt;2.5$, we confirm a continuously tunable exponent $z(q)$: for $q&lt;2$ the entanglement front broadens with a sublinear light cone; for $2&lt;q&lt;2.5$ we observe a faint superlinear cone indicative of $z&lt;1$; and for $q \gtrsim 2.5$ the system reverts to the ballistic nearest-neighbour regime with $z=1$. The correspondence between quantum entanglement fronts that spread as $t^{1/z}$ and classical L\'evy flights whose mean-square displacement grows as $t^{2/q}$ provides a direct physical link between fractional interactions and L\'evy statistics. Fractional derivatives therefore offer a unified framework in which short-range, power-law, and frustrated long-range interactions emerge as limiting cases, enabling controlled exploration of nonlocal causality bounds and exotic entanglement dynamics within current quantum information platforms.</description>

      <title>A near-quantum-limited diamond maser amplifier operating at millikelvin temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microwave quantum technologies require amplification of weak signals with minimal added noise at millikelvin temperatures. This stringent demand has been met with superconducting parametric amplifiers. While masers offer another fundamental approach, their dependence on cryogenic operation has historically posed challenges for classical communication technologies -- a barrier that does not apply to microwave quantum technologies. In this work, we demonstrate an ultra-low-noise maser amplifier utilizing impurity spins in diamond at millikelvin temperatures. We achieve power gains exceeding $\mathrm{30\,dB}$, a minimum noise temperature of $\mathrm{0.86\,K}$ (corresponding to $2.2$ noise photons), and a maximum $\mathrm{1\,\text{dB}}$ output compression point of $\mathrm{-63\,dBm}$ at $\mathrm{6.595\,\text{GHz}}$. Our results establish masers as viable components of microwave quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Teleportation in Non-equilibrium Environments and Fixed-point Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum teleportation, a fundamental protocol in quantum information science, enables the transfer of quantum states through entangled particle pairs and classical communication channels. While ideal quantum teleportation requires maximally entangled states as resources, real-world implementations inevitably face environmental noise and decoherence effects. In this work, we investigate quantum teleportation in non-equilibrium environments with different temperatures or chemical potentials. We apply the Bloch-Redfield equation to characterize the non-equilibrium dynamics. In both bosonic and fermionic setups, the fidelity can be enhanced beyond the equilibrium values. Under specific non-equilibrium conditions, the fidelities of all input states are identical. We call it teleportation with a fixed-point fidelity. Notably, at the fixed-point, fidelity can also be enhanced by combining the two detuned qubits and non-equilibrium environments. These findings provide important guidance for implementing quantum communication protocols in realistic environments, while the fixed-point mechanism offers a promising pathway toward simplifying practical quantum teleportation schemes.</description>

      <title>Towards secondary structure prediction of longer mRNA sequences using a quantum-centric optimization scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of mRNA secondary structure is critical for understanding gene expression, translation efficiency, and advancing mRNA-based therapeutics. However, the combinatorial complexity of possible foldings, especially in long sequences, poses significant computational challenges for classical algorithms. In this work, we propose a scalable, quantum-centric optimization framework that integrates quantum sampling with classical post-processing to tackle this problem. Building on a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation of the mRNA folding task, we develop two complementary workflows: a Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)-based variational quantum algorithm enhanced with gauge transformations and local search, and an Instantaneous Quantum Polynomial (IQP) circuit-based scheme where training is done classically and sampling is delegated to quantum hardware. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches using IBM quantum processors, solving problem instances with up to 156 qubits and circuits containing up to 950 nonlocal gates, corresponding to mRNA sequences of up to 60 nucleotides. Additionally, we validate scalability of the CVaR algorithm on a tensor network simulator, reaching up to 354 qubits in noiseless settings. These results demonstrate the growing practical capabilities of hybrid quantum-classical methods for tackling large-scale biological optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Quantitative calibration of a TWPA applied to an optomechanical platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade, the microwave quantum electronics toolbox has been enriched with quantum limited detection devices such as Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers (TWPAs). The extreme sensitivity they provide is not only mandatory for some physics applications within quantum information processing, but is also the key element that will determine the detection limit of quantum sensing setups. In the framework of microwave optomechanical systems, an unprecedented range of small motions and forces is accessible, for which a specific quantitative calibration becomes necessary. We report on near quantum-limited measurements performed with an aluminum drumhead mechanical device within the temperature range 4 mK - 400 mK. The whole setup is carefully calibrated, especially taking into account the power-dependence of microwave absorption in the superconducting optomechanical cavity. This effect is commonly attributed to Two-Level-Systems (TLSs) present in the metal oxide. We demonstrate that a similar feature exists in the TWPA, and can be phenomenologically fit with adapted expressions. The power and temperature dependence is studied over the full parameter range, leading to an absolute definition of phonon population (i.e. Brownian motion amplitude), with an uncertainty +-20 %.</description>

      <title>Dynamical multipartite entanglement in a generalized Tavis-Cummings model with XY spin interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement is a long-term pursuit in the resource theory, offering a potential resource for quantum metrology. Here, we present the dynamical multipartite entanglement, which is in terms of the quantum Fisher information, of a generalized Tavis-Cummings (TC) model introducing the XY spin interaction. Since our model cannot be solved exactly, we theoretically derive and numerically examine the effective description of our model. By the Holstein-Primakoff transformation, we show the bridge from the generalized TC model to the central spin model. Furthermore, the reduced density matrix of the central spins is presented, which is the prerequisite for calculating multipartite entanglement. We also discuss the effect of the temperature, the coupling constant, and the magnetic field on the dynamical multipartite entanglement in the central spin model, where the central spin is initially unentangled. Strong coupling and low temperature are necessary conditions for a genuine multipartite entanglement in the XY model, and together with the magnetic field, they govern the modulation of both the entanglement period and amplitude. Our results unveil the deep link between the TC model and the central spin model, allowing for a better comprehension of their dynamical multipartite entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With resonances treated as eigenstates of a non-Hermitian quantum Hamiltonian, the task of localization of the complex energy eigenvalues is considered. The paper is devoted to the reduced version of this task in which one only computes the real quantities called singular values. It is shown that in such an approach (and under suitable constraints including the tridiagonality of the Hamiltdonian) the singular values can be sought as poles of an auxiliary Green's function expressible in terms of a doublet of matrix continued fractions. A family of multi-bosonic Bose-Hubbard-like complex Hamiltonians is recalled for illustration purposes.</description>

      <title>TTNOpt: Tree tensor network package for high-rank tensor compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed TTNOpt, a software package that utilizes tree tensor networks (TTNs) for quantum spin systems and high-dimensional data analysis. TTNOpt provides efficient and powerful TTN computations by locally optimizing the network structure, guided by the entanglement pattern of the target tensors. For quantum spin systems, TTNOpt searches for the ground state of Hamiltonians with bilinear spin interactions and magnetic fields, and computes physical properties of these states, including the variational energy, bipartite entanglement entropy (EE), single-site expectation values, and two-site correlation functions. Additionally, TTNOpt can target the lowest-energy state within a specified subspace, provided that the Hamiltonian conserves total magnetization. For high-dimensional data analysis, TTNOpt factorizes complex tensors into TTN states that maximize fidelity to the original tensors by optimizing the tensors and the network. When a TTN is provided as input, TTNOpt reconstructs the network based on the EE without referencing the fidelity of the original state. We present three demonstrations of TTNOpt: (1) Ground-state search for the hierarchical chain model with a system size of $256$. The entanglement patterns of the ground state manifest themselves in a tree structure, and TTNOpt successfully identifies the tree. (2) Factorization of a quantic tensor of the $2^{24}$ dimensions representing a three-variable function where each variant has a weak bit-wise correlation. The optimized TTN shows that its structure isolates the variables from each other. (3) Reconstruction of the matrix product network representing a $16$-variable normal distribution characterized by a tree-like correlation structure. TTNOpt can reveal hidden correlation structures of the covariance matrix.</description>

      <title>Subjective nature of path information in quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05930v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Common sense suggests that a particle must have a definite origin if its full path information is available. In quantum mechanics, the knowledge of path information is captured through the well-established duality relation between path distinguishability and interference visibility. If visibility is zero, a high path distinguishability can be obtained, which enables one with high predictive power to know where the particle comes from. Here we show that this perception of path information is problematic. We demonstrate the simultaneous observation of zero interference visibility and the complete absence of which-path information using a three-crystal interference setup. With a contradictory argument by grouping the crystals in different ways, we show that it is impossible to ascribe a definite physical origin to the photon pair even if the emission probability of one individual source is zero and full path information is available. Our findings shed new light on the physical interpretation of probability assignment and path information beyond its mathematical meaning and reshape our understanding of the whole and part in the context of distinguishability.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Classification: Overcoming Hardware Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While classical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized image classification, the emergence of quantum computing presents new opportunities for enhancing neural network architectures. Quantum CNNs (QCNNs) leverage quantum mechanical properties and hold potential to outperform classical approaches. However, their implementation on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices remains challenging due to hardware limitations. In our research, we address this challenge by introducing an encoding scheme that significantly reduces the input dimensionality. We demonstrate that a primitive QCNN architecture with 49 qubits is sufficient to directly process $28\times 28$ pixel MNIST images, eliminating the need for classical dimensionality reduction pre-processing. Additionally, we propose an automated framework based on expressibility, entanglement, and complexity characteristics to identify the building blocks of QCNNs, parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). Our approach demonstrates advantages in accuracy and convergence speed with a similar parameter count compared to both hybrid QCNNs and classical CNNs. We validated our experiments on IBM's Heron r2 quantum processor, achieving $96.08\%$ classification accuracy, surpassing the $71.74\%$ benchmark of traditional approaches under identical training conditions. These results represent one of the first implementations of image classifications on real quantum hardware and validate the potential of quantum computing in this area.</description>

      <title>Catalytic entanglement transformations with noisy hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The availability of certain entangled resource states (catalyst states) can enhance the rate of converting several less entangled states into fewer highly entangled states in a process known as catalytic entanglement concentration (EC). Here, we extend catalytic EC from pure states to mixed states and numerically benchmark it against non-catalytic EC and distillation in the presence of state-preparation errors and operational errors. Furthermore, we analyse the re-usability of catalysts in the presence of such errors. To do this, we introduce a novel recipe for determining the positive-operator valued measurements (POVM) required for EC transformations, which allows for making tradeoffs between the number of communication rounds and the number of auxiliary qubits required. We find that in the presence of low operational errors and depolarising noise, catalytic EC can provide better rates than distillation and non-catalytic EC.</description>

      <title>Observation of Perfect Absorption in Hyperfine Levels of Molecular Spins with Hermitian Subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ideal effective parity-time (PT)-symmetry can be achieved in a passive open system by accurately balancing feeding and absorption processes. Such PT-symmetric systems display Hermitian subspaces which enable perfect absorption (PA) of radiation, i.e., all the incoming energy is absorbed by the system. In this work, we consider a passive open quantum system obtained by coupling molecular spin centers to a planar microwave resonator operating at milliKelvin temperatures and at few-photon power level. We experimentally demonstrate that Hermitian subspaces and thus PA can be implemented even in the absence of PT-symmetry, by exploiting the spin detuning to control the photon and spin content of a polariton mode. In such a way, the required balance between the feeding and the loss rates is effectively recovered. We show that Hermitian subspaces influence the overall aspect of coherent spectra of cavity QED systems and significantly enlarge the possibility to explore non-Hermitian effects in open quantum systems. We finally discuss how Hermitian subspaces can be potentially exploited for the development of efficient switches and modulators with high modulation depths over a broad spectral range.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum algorithms for permutation-based combinatorial problems: Optimal ansatz generation with applications to quadratic assignment problems and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum variational algorithm based on a novel circuit that generates all permutations that can be spanned by one- and two-qubits permutation gates. The construction of the circuits follows from group-theoretical results, most importantly the Bruhat decomposition of the group generated by the \(\mathtt{cx}\) gates. These circuits require a number of qubits that scale logarithmically with the permutation dimension, and are therefore employable in near-term applications. We further augment the circuits with ancilla qubits to enlarge their span, and with these we build ansatze to tackle permutation-based optimization problems such as quadratic assignment problems, and graph isomorphisms. The resulting quantum algorithm, \textsc{QuPer}, is competitive with respect to classical heuristics and we could simulate its behavior up to a problem with $256$ variables, requiring $20$ qubits.</description>

      <title>Lifting the maximally-entangledness assumption in robust self-testing for synchronous games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust self-testing in non-local games allows a classical referee to certify that two untrustworthy players are able to perform a specific quantum strategy up to high precision. Proving robust self-testing results becomes significantly easier when one restricts the allowed strategies to symmetric projective maximally entangled (PME) strategies, which allow natural descriptions in terms of tracial von Neumann algebras. This has been exploited in the celebrated MIP*=RE paper and related articles to prove robust self-testing results for synchronous games when restricting to PME strategies. However, the PME assumptions are not physical, so these results need to be upgraded to make them physically relevant. In this work, we do just that: we prove that any perfect synchronous game which is a robust self-test when restricted to PME strategies, is in fact a robust self-test for all strategies. We then apply our result to the Quantum Low Degree Test to find an efficient $n$-qubit test.</description>

      <title>Genuine Multipartite Entanglement Measure Based on $\alpha$-concurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying genuine entanglement is a crucial task in quantum information theory. Based on the geometric mean of bipartite $\alpha$-concurrences among all bipartitions, we present a class of well-defined genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) measures G$\alpha$C with one parameter $\alpha$ for arbitrary multipartite states. We show that the G$\alpha$C is of continuity for any multipartite pure states. By utilizing the related symmetry, analytical results of G$\alpha$C are derived for any $n$-qubit GHZ states and W states, which show that the GHZ states are more genuinely entangled than the W states. With explicit examples, we demonstrate that the G$\alpha$C can distinguish different GME states that other GME measures fail to. These results justify the potential applications of G$\alpha$C in characterizing genuine multipartite entanglements.</description>

      <title>Exact S-matrices for higher dimensional representations of generalized Landau-Zener Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore integrable Landau-Zener-type Hamiltonians through the framework of Lie algebraic structures. By reformulating the classic two-level Landau-Zener model as a Lax equation, we show that higher-spin generalizations lead to exactly solvable scattering matrices, which can be computed efficiently for any higher-spin representation. We further extend this approach to generalized bow-tie Landau-Zener Hamiltonians, employing non-Abelian gauge fields that satisfy a zero-curvature condition to derive their scattering matrices algebraically. This method enables the systematic construction of new exactly solvable multi-level models; as a result, we present previously unknown six-dimensional and eight-dimensional Landau-Zener models.</description>

      <title>Strong converse Exponents of Partially Smoothed Information Measures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially smoothed information measures are fundamental tools in one-shot quantum information theory. In this work, we determine the exact strong converse exponents of these measures for both pure quantum states and classical states. Notably, we find that the strong converse exponents based on trace distance takes different forms between pure and classical states, indicating that they are not uniform across all quantum states. Leveraging these findings, we derive the strong converse exponents for quantum data compression, intrinsic randomness extraction, and classical state splitting. A key technical step in our analysis is the determination of the strong converse exponent for classical privacy amplification, which is of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Sublinear Classical-to-Quantum Data Encoding using $n$-Toffoli Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation, also known as encoding or embedding, is a crucial initial step in many quantum algorithms and often constrains theoretical quantum speedup in fields such as quantum machine learning and linear equation solvers. One common strategy is amplitude encoding, which embeds a classical input vector of size N=2\textsuperscript{n} in the amplitudes of an n-qubit register. For arbitrary vectors, the circuit depth typically scales linearly with the input size N, rapidly becoming unfeasible on near-term hardware. We propose a general-purpose procedure with sublinear average depth in N, increasing the window of utility.
  Our amplitude encoding method encodes arbitrary complex vectors of size N=2\textsuperscript{n} at any desired binary precision using a register with n qubits plus 2 ancillas and a sublinear number of multi-controlled NOT (MCX) gates, at the cost of a probabilistic success rate proportional to the sparsity of the encoded data. The core idea of our procedure is to construct an isomorphism between target states and hypercube graphs, in which specific reflections correspond to MCX gates. This reformulates the state preparation problem in terms of permutations and \emph{binary addition}. The use of MCX gates as fundamental operations makes this approach particularly suitable for quantum platforms such as \emph{ion traps} and \emph{neutral atom devices}. This geometrical perspective paves the way for more gate-efficient algorithms suitable for near-term hardware applications.</description>

      <title>Achieving Heisenberg limit of metrology via measurement on ancillary qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a measurement-based quantum metrology protocol by coupling the probe (a spin ensemble) to an ancillary qubit. The key element is to use the optimized joint evolution time and the unconditional measurement on the ancillary qubit to bring the probe system from an eigenstate of a collective angular momentum operator $|j,m\rangle$ to a superposed state $(|j,m\rangle+|j,-m\rangle)/\sqrt2$. With synchronous parametric encoding and unconditional measurement, the quantum Fisher information about the phase encoded in the probe system can exactly attains the Heisenberg scaling $N^2$ with respect to the probe size (spin number) $N$ upon optimized initial states. The quadratic scaling behavior is not sensitive to the imprecise control over the joint evolution time and the time delay between encoding and measurement. The classical Fisher information of the spin ensemble is found to saturate with its quantum counterpart, irrespective of the idle evolution time after the parametric encoding. We suggest that both GHZ-like state and nonlinear Hamiltonian are not necessary resources for metrology precision since in our protocol even thermal states hold an asymptotic quadratic scaling.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Topology Principles behind Topological Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is crucial for numerous quantum applications, including fault-tolerant quantum computation, which is of great scientific and industrial interest. Among various QEC paradigms, topological quantum error correction (TQEC) has attained the most experimental successes by far. In this paper, we build upon existing knowledge of TQEC by developing a generalized theoretical framework of TQEC. We begin by formally defining TQEC codes and exploring the algebraic topological principles underlying these quantum codes, including deriving the conditions for any topological manifold to serve as a quantum memory. We show that TQEC for qubits works for both orientable and non-orientable manifolds. Moreover, we extend the construction of TQEC to higher-dimensional manifolds and provide examples for higher-dimensional TQEC codes. Finally, we apply these principles to construct new codes on 2-dimensional manifolds that have received limited attention in prior literature. As a case study, we simulate the performance of TQEC codes on the Klein bottle $K$ and evaluate their efficacy for quantum error correction. This work contributes to the advancement of TQEC by proposing a broader class of codes and demonstrating their theoretical and practical potential. By addressing previously unexplored topological structures, our findings represent a step forward in achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation and communication.</description>

      <title>Quantum sensing and metrology with free electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum properties of matter and radiation can be leveraged to surpass classical limits of sensing and detection. Quantum optics does so by creating and measuring nonclassical light. However, better performance requires higher photon-number states, which are challenging to generate and detect. Here, we combine photons and free electrons to solve the problem of generating and detecting high-number states well beyond those reachable with light alone and further show that an unprecedented level of sensitivity and resolution is gained based on the measurement of free-electron currents after suitably designed electron-light interaction events. Our enabling ingredient is the strong electron-light coupling produced by aloof electron reflection on an optical waveguide, leading to the emission or absorption of a high number of guided photons by every single electron. We theoretically demonstrate that, by combining electron-beam splitters with two electron-waveguide interactions, the sensitivity to detect optical-phase changes can be enhanced tenfold using currently attainable technology. We further show that waveguided NOON states comprising tens of photons can be generated at megahertz rates based on electron post-selection after electron-waveguide interaction. These results inaugurate a disruptive quantum technology relying on free electrons and their strong interaction with waveguided light.</description>

      <title>Coherent Generation and Protection of Anticoherent Spin States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first protocol specifically designed to generate anticoherent spin-$j$ states at various orders. The protocol consists of cycles involving a rotation pulse about one axis, followed by a squeezing pulse along a perpendicular direction. To protect these states from decoherence, we develop dynamical decoupling techniques based on group-theoretic sequence design and the dynamically corrected gate formalism. We analyze key sources of dephasing, disorder, and dipole-dipole interactions, and evaluate the effectiveness of our methods in preserving coherence. Potential applications of the generated anticoherent spin states include quantum sensing and studies of quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Non-degenerate pumping of superconducting resonator parametric amplifier with evidence of phase-sensitive amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers are potentially important components for a wide variety of fundamental physics experiments and utilitarian applications. We propose and realise an operation scheme that achieves amplification through the use of non-degenerate pumps, which addresses two key challenges in the design of parametric amplifiers: non-continuous gain across the band over which amplification is possible, and pump-tone removal. We have experimentally demonstrated the non-degenerate pumping scheme using a half-wave resonator amplifier based on NbN thin-film, and measured peak gain of 26 dB and 3-dB bandwidth of 0.5 MHz. The two non-degenerate pump tones were positioned ~10 bandwidths above and below the frequency at which peak gain occurs. We have found the non-degenerate pumping scheme to be more stable compared to the usual degenerate pumping scheme in terms of gain drift against time, by a factor of 4. This scheme also retains the usual flexibility of NbN resonator parametric amplifiers in terms of reliable amplification in a ~4 K environment, and is suitable for cross-harmonic amplification. The use of pump at different frequencies allows phase-sensitive amplification when the signal tone is degenerate with the idler tone. A gain of 23 dB and squeezing ratio of 6 dB have been measured.</description>

      <title>Advancing Finite-Length Quantum Error Correction Using Generalized Bicycle Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized bicycle (GB) codes have emerged as a promising class of quantum error-correcting codes with practical decoding capabilities. While numerous asymptotically good quantum codes and quantum low-density parity-check code constructions have been proposed, their finite block-length performance often remains unquantified. In this work, we demonstrate that GB codes exhibit comparable or superior error correction performance in finite-length settings, particularly when designed with higher or unrestricted row weights. Leveraging their flexible construction, GB codes can be tailored to achieve high rates while maintaining efficient decoding. We evaluate GB codes against other leading quantum code families, such as quantum Tanner codes and single-parity-check product codes, highlighting their versatility in practical finite-length applications.</description>

      <title>Compilation strategies for quantum network programs using Qoala</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Execution of quantum network applications requires a software stack for nodes. Recently, the first designs and demonstrations have been proposed for such software stacks, including QNodeOS and its extension, Qoala. The latter enables compilation strategies previously not possible in QNodeOS. Here, we show how the extensions provided by Qoala can be used by a compiler to improve the performance of quantum network applications. We define new compilation strategies that allow the compiler to influence the scheduling and execution of quantum programs on a quantum network node. Through simulation, we demonstrate that our compilation strategies can reduce the execution time by up to 29.53% and increase the success probability by up to 25.12%. Our work highlights the potential of compiler optimizations for quantum network programs.</description>

      <title>Optimization of Quantum Error Correcting Code under Temporal Variation of Qubit Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Error rates in current noisy quantum hardware are not static; they vary over time and across qubits. This temporal and spatial variation challenges the effectiveness of fixed-distance quantum error correction (QEC) codes. In this paper, we analyze 12 days of calibration data from IBM's 127-qubit device (ibm_kyiv), showing the fluctuation of Pauli-X and CNOT gate error rates. We demonstrate that fixed-distance QEC can either underperform or lead to excessive overhead, depending on the selected qubit and the error rate of the day. We then propose a simple adaptive QEC approach that selects an appropriate code distance per qubit, based on daily error rates. Using logical error rate modeling, we identify qubits that cannot be used and qubits that can be recovered with minimal resources. Our method avoids unnecessary resource overhead by excluding outlier qubits and tailoring code distances. Across 12 calibration days on ibm_kyiv, our adaptive strategy reduces physical qubit overhead by over 50% per logical qubit while maintaining access to 85-100% of usable qubits. To further validate the method, we repeat the experiment on two additional 127-qubit devices, ibm_brisbane and ibm_sherbrooke, where the overhead savings reach up to 71% while still preserving over 80% qubit usability. This approach offers a practical and efficient path forward for Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ)-era QEC strategies.</description>

      <title>From Fermions to Qubits: A ZX-Calculus Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mapping fermionic systems to qubits on a quantum computer is often the first step for algorithms in quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. However, it is difficult to reconcile the many different approaches that have been proposed, such as those based on binary matrices, ternary trees, and stabilizer codes. This challenge is further exacerbated by the many ways to describe them -- transformation of Majorana operators, action on Fock states, encoder circuits, and stabilizers of local encodings -- making it challenging to know when the mappings are equivalent. In this work, we present a graphical framework for fermion-to-qubit mappings that streamlines and unifies various representations through the ZX-calculus.
  To start, we present the correspondence between linear encodings of the Fock basis and phase-free ZX-diagrams. The commutation rules of scalable ZX-calculus allows us to convert the fermionic operators to Pauli operators under any linear encoding. Next, we give a translation from ternary tree mappings to scalable ZX-diagrams, which not only directly represents the encoder map as a CNOT circuit, but also retains the same structure as the tree. Consequently, we graphically prove that ternary tree transformations are equivalent to linear encodings, a recent result by Chiew et al. The scalable ZX representation moreover enables us to construct an algorithm to directly compute the binary matrix for any ternary tree mapping. Lastly, we present the graphical representation of local fermion-to-qubit encodings. Its encoder ZX-diagram has the same connectivity as the interaction graph of the fermionic Hamiltonian and also allows us to easily identify stabilizers of the encoding.</description>

      <title>Optimal statistical ensembles for quantum thermal state preparation within the quantum singular value transformation framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preparing thermal equilibrium states is an essential task for finite-temperature quantum simulations. In statistical mechanics, microstates in thermal equilibrium can be obtained from statistical ensembles. To date, a variety of ensembles have been devised, including not only the Gibbs ensembles, such as the canonical and microcanonical ensembles, but also various generalized ensembles. Since these ensembles yield equivalent thermodynamic predictions, one can freely choose an ensemble for computational convenience. In this paper, we exploit this flexibility to develop an efficient quantum algorithm for preparing thermal equilibrium states. We first present a quantum algorithm for implementing generalized ensembles within the framework of quantum singular value transformation. We then perform a detailed analysis of the computational cost and elucidate its dependence on the choice of the ensemble. We show that selecting an appropriate ensemble can significantly mitigate ensemble-dependent overhead and yield improved scaling of the computational cost with system size compared to existing methods based on the canonical ensemble. Moreover, we numerically demonstrate that our approach achieves a significant reduction in the computational cost even for finite-size systems. Our algorithm applies to arbitrary thermodynamic systems at any temperature and is thus expected to offer a practical and versatile method for computing finite-temperature properties of quantum many-body systems. These results highlight the potential of ensemble design as a powerful tool for enhancing the efficiency of a broad class of quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Modular Debiasing: A Robust Method for Quantum Randomness Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18585v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel modular debiasing technique applicable to any discrete random source, addressing the fundamental challenge of reliably extracting high-quality randomness from inherently imperfect physical processes. The method involves summing the outcomes of multiple independent trials from a biased source and reducing the sum modulo the number of possible outcomes, $m$. We provide a rigorous theoretical framework, utilizing probability generating functions and roots of unity, demonstrating that this simple operation guarantees the exponential convergence of the output distribution to the ideal uniform distribution over $\{0, 1, \dots, m-1\}$. A key theoretical result is the method's remarkable robustness: convergence is proven for any initial bias (provided all outcomes have non-zero probability) and, crucially, is maintained even under non-stationary conditions or time-dependent noise, which are common in physical systems. Analytical bounds quantify this exponential rate of convergence, and are empirically validated by numerical simulations. This technique's simplicity, strong theoretical guarantees, robustness, and data efficiency make it particularly well-suited for practical implementation in quantum settings, such as spatial photon-detection-based Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs), offering an efficient method for extracting high-quality randomness resilient to experimental imperfections. This work contributes a valuable tool to the field of Quantum Information Science.</description>

Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) promise revolutionary control over quantum light-matter interactions. Here, we experimentally demonstrate flexible and reversible engineering of quantum vacuum fluctuation in an integrated microcavity supporting chiral Eps. We develop a hybrid lithium niobate (LN)-GaAs quantum photonic platform, seamlessly combining high-quality quantum emitters, a low-loss photonic circuit, efficient electro-optic (EO) effect, and local strain actuator in a single device. Chiral EPs are implemented by dynamically tuning the coupling between the modes associated with a micro-ring resonator, resulting in anomalous spontaneous emission dynamic with a 7-fold modulation of the lifetime (120 ps to 850 ps). Meanwhile, we reshape single-photon spectra via cavity local density of states (LDOS) engineering and generate non-Lorentzian spectral profiles: squared-Lorentzian, Fano-like, and EP-induced transparency (EPIT), a suppression of emission at zero detuning. This work unveils exotic cavity quantum electrodynamics (cQED) effects unique to EPs and establishes a universal paradigm for non-Hermitian quantum photonics.</description>

Abstract: Quantum cognition has made it possible to model human cognitive processes very effectively, revealing numerous parallels between the properties of conceptual entities tested by the human mind and those of microscopic entities tested by measurement apparatuses. The success of quantum cognition has also made it possible to formulate an interpretation of quantum mechanics, called the conceptuality interpretation, which ascribes to quantum entities a conceptual nature similar to that of human concepts. The present work fits into these lines of research by analyzing a cognitive version of single, double, and triple-slit experiments. The data clearly show the formation of the typical interference fringes between the slits as well as the embryos of secondary fringes. Our analysis also shows that while quantum entities and human concepts may share a same conceptual nature, the way they manifest it in specific contexts can be quite different. This is also evident from the significant deviation from zero observed for the Sorkin parameter, indicating the presence of strong irreducible third-order interference contributions in human decision.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of a Bipartite Quench in a 1D Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long wavelength dynamics of 1D Bose gases with repulsive contact interactions can be captured by Generalized HydroDynamics (GHD) which predicts the evolution of the local rapidity distribution. The latter corresponds to the momentum distribution of quasiparticles, which have infinite lifetime owing to the integrability of the system. Here we experimentally investigate the dynamics for an initial situation that is the junction of two semi-infinite systems in different stationary states, a protocol referred to as "bipartite quench" protocol. More precisely we realise the particular case where one half of the system is the vacuum state. We show that the evolution of the boundary density profile exhibits ballistic dynamics obeying the Euler hydrodynamic scaling. The boundary profiles are similar to the ones predicted with zero-temperature GHD in the quasi-BEC regime, with deviations due to non-zero entropy effects. We show that this protocol, provided the boundary profile is measured with infinite precision, permits to reconstruct the rapidity distribution of the initial state. For our data, we extract the initial rapidity distribution by fitting the boundary profile and we use a 3-parameter ansatz that goes beyond the thermal assumption. Finally, we investigate the local rapidity distribution inside the boundary profile, which, according to GHD, presents, on one side, features of zero-entropy states. The measured distribution shows the asymmetry predicted by GHD, although unelucidated deviations remain.</description>

Abstract: We investigate low-frequency noise in a spin-qubit device made in isotopically purified Si/Si-Ge. Observing sizable cross-correlations among energy fluctuations of different qubits, we conclude that these fluctuations are dominated by charge noise. At low frequencies, the noise spectra do not fit well a power law; rather, we can recognize a few individual two-level fluctuators (TLFs). We demonstrate that the noise cross-correlations allow one to get information on the spatial location of such individual TLFs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo study of the quasiparticle effective mass of the two-dimensional uniform electron liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The real-space variation quantum Monte Carlo (VMC) and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) are used to calculate the quasiparticle energy bands and the quasiparticle effective mass of the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic two-dimensional uniform electron liquid (2D-UEL)\@. The many-body finite-size errors are minimized by performing simulations for three system sizes with the number of electrons $N=146$, 218, and 302 for paramagnetic and $N=151$ for ferromagnetic systems. We consider 2D-UEL to be within the metallic density range $1\leq r_s \leq 5$. The VMC and DMC results predict that the quasiparticle effective mass $m^*$ of the paramagnetic 2D-UEL at high density $r_s=1$ is very close to 1, suggesting that effective mass renormalization due to electron-electron interaction is negligible. We find that $m^*$ of the paramagnetic 2D-UEL obtained by the VMC and DMC methods increases by $r_s$ but with different slopes. Our VMC and DMC results for ferromagnetic 2D-UEL indicate that $m^*$ decreases rapidly by reducing the density due to the strong suppression of the electron-electron interaction.</description>

      <title>Algorithm for finding local integrals of motion in quantum lattice models in the thermodynamic limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local integrals of motion (LIOMs) play a key role in understanding the stationary states of closed macroscopic systems. They were found for selected integrable systems via complex analytical calculations. The existence of LIOMs and their structure can also be studied via numerical methods, which, however, involve exact diagonalization of Hamiltonians, posing a bottleneck for such studies. We show that finding LIOMs in translationally invariant lattice models or unitary quantum circuits can be reduced to a problem for which one may numerically find an exact solution also in the thermodynamic limit. We develop and implement a simple algorithm and demonstrate the efficiency of this method by calculating LIOMs and the Mazur bounds for infinite integrable spin chains and unitary circuits. Finally, we demonstrate that this approach correctly identifies approximate LIOMs in nearly integrable spin ladders.</description>

      <title>Quantum Monte Carlo description of correlated electrons in two-dimensional FeSe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic correlation effects on the structural properties of double-layer FeSe are studied using variation and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo methods. The Slater-Jastrow many-body wavefunction with two different forms for the homogeneous two-body pair-correlation term is used. The ground-state energy of the system is obtained at the thermodynamic limit using two different trial wave functions called JDFT and JSD. Only the Jastrow factor is fully optimized in the JDFT wave function, while the Slater determinant comes from the density functional approximation. In the JSD trial wave function, the Slater determinant and the Jastrow factor are fully optimized simultaneously. We calculated the VMC and DMC energies as a function of interlayer separation for two different in-plane iron-iron bond lengths. Our QMC results indicate that the optimized interlayer separation decreases with increasing iron-iron bond length, driven by stretch. We found that a three- to two-dimensional phase transition increases the electron-electron correlation effects and shifts the system from moderately correlated to strongly correlated. The value of correlation energy implies that the Hubbard $U$ value, which is widely used in DFT+U calculations, for two-dimensional FeSe is larger than its value in bulk.</description>

Abstract: In [Bal18] a new method of constructing simplex designs based on cyclic group on $n$ elements has been proposed. One of the claims put forward therein is existence of 3-point simplex 3-design in dimension $d = 3$. In this manuscript we present explicit counterarguments and suggest a manner to rectify the existing proofs. By doing this, we show that the results presented in [Bal18] can be utilised to construct simplex 3-designs scaling as $d^2$, which suggest a general scaling of $d^{t-1}$. Finally, we put forward a notion that encompasses the objects conforming with bounds given in [Bal18], which we refer to as symmetry-restricted simplex $t$-designs.</description>

      <title>An Extension of the Adiabatic Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the validity of a potential extension of the adiabatic theorem to quantum quenches, i.e., non-adiabatic changes. In particular, the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) and the Axial Next Nearest Neighbour Ising (ANNNI) model are studied. The proposed extension of the adiabatic theorem is stated as follows: Consider the overlap between the initial ground state and the post-quench Hamiltonian eigenstates for quenches within the same phase. This overlap is largest for the post-quench ground state. In the case of the TFIM, this conjecture is confirmed for both the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases numerically and analytically. In the ANNNI model, the conjecture could be analytically proven for a special case. Numerical methods were employed to investigate the conjecture's validity beyond this special case.</description>

      <title>Rydberg atomic spectrum analyzer with microwave-dressed-state-locking and multimode Floquet theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Rydberg atomic spectrum analyzer (RASA) utilizing microwave-dressed-state-locking (MWDSL) in conjunction with multimode Floquet theory (MFT). By leveraging a strong local microwave (MW) field resonant with Rydberg states to implement MWDSL, we analyze the second-order effect of MFT induced by the interplay of controllable bias and signal MW fields. This effect facilitates the coupling of locked dressed states, providing a pathway for measuring the signal MW field. We demonstrate that the RASA can simultaneously characterize multiple MW fields across distinct frequencies, with both the frequency and strength of each MW field discernible in the spectral response. This capability renders RASA suitable for measuring unknown-frequency MW fields, thereby expanding the utility of Rydberg atom-based electrometers in complex spectral analysis scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the category OS of operator spaces, with complete contractions as morphisms, is locally countably presentable and a model of Intuitionistic Linear Logic in the sense of Lafont. We then describe a model of Classical Linear Logic, based on OS, whose duality is compatible with the Heisenberg-Schr\"odinger duality of quantum theory. We also show that OS provides a good setting for studying pure state and mixed state quantum information, the interaction between the two, and even higher-order quantum maps such as the quantum switch.</description>

      <title>Distributed Tensor Network Library for Quantum Computing Emulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks offer an adaptable and efficient approach to emulation of quantum computers. Their usage relies on partitioning circuits into small tensors, which are contracted together to form the final result. While this approach intends to minimise the problem size, exceeding the locally available memory is sometimes unavoidable due to the exponential nature of quantum systems. Most HPC tensor network packages tackle this issue with a procedure called circuit slicing, which distributes the entire network onto multiple ranks, recombining it back when necessary. In this study, we present a novel alternative approach, where individual tensors are both broadcast and scattered to harness multiple levels of parallelism. The technique is abstracted behind a fixed distribution pattern, and actualised in a new portable tensor network library, QTNH, built on top of MPI and ScaLAPACK. We showcase its capabilities on ARCHER2, by emulating two well-known algorithms - the Quantum Fourier Transform and Random Circuit Sampling. This is accomplished by leveraging the implemented operations to realise various contraction strategies, including a unique distributed MPS tensor factorisation approach. We thus demonstrate that our library can be used to advance the accuracy of quantum emulation, while offering a simple and flexible interface to tensor distribution.</description>

      <title>Mechanical form factors and densities of non-relativistic fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hadron physics community has been actively debating the interpretation of so-called mechanical properties of hadrons. Non-relativistic quantum-mechanical systems like the hydrogen atom have been appealed to in these debates as analogies. Since such appeals are likely to continue, it is important to have Galilei-covariant expressions for matrix elements of the energy-momentum tensor. In this work, I obtain Galilei-covariant breakdowns of such matrix elements into mechanical form factors, with a special focus on spin-half states. I additionally study the spatial densities associated with these form factors, using the pilot wave interpretation to guide their breakdown into contributions from internal structure and from quantum-mechanical effects such as wave packet dispersion. For completeness, I also obtain non-relativistic Breit frame densities.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics and Page curves in random permutation circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The characterization of ensembles of many-qubit random states and their realization via quantum circuits are crucial tasks in quantum-information theory. In this work, we study the ensembles generated by quantum circuits that randomly permute the computational basis, thus acting classically on the corresponding states. We focus on the averaged entanglement and present two main results. First, we derive generically tight upper bounds on the entanglement that can be generated by applying permutation circuits to arbitrary initial states. We show that the late-time ``entanglement Page curves'' are bounded in terms of the initial state participation entropies and its overlap with the ``maximally antilocalized'' state. Second, comparing the averaged R\'enyi-$2$ entropies generated by $(i)$ an infinitely deep random circuit of two-qubit gates and $(ii)$ global random permutations, we show that the two quantities are different for finite $N$ but the corresponding Page curves coincide in the thermodynamic limit. We also discuss how these conclusions are modified by additional random phases or considering circuits of $k$-local gates with $k\geq 3$. Our results are exact and highlight the implications of classical features on entanglement generation in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Fragile systems: A hidden-variable Bayesian framework leading to quantum theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:1609.01972v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An understanding of quantum theory in terms of new, underlying descriptions capable of explaining the existence of non-classical correlations, non-commutativity of measurements and other unique and counter-intuitive phenomena remains still a challenge at the foundations of our description of physical phenomena. Among some proposals, the idea that quantum states are essentially states of knowledge in a Bayesian framework is an intriguing possibility due to its explanatory power. In this work, the formalism of quantum theory is derived from the application of Bayesian probability theory to "fragile" systems, that is, systems that are perturbed by the measurement. Complex Hilbert spaces, non-commuting operators and the trace rule for expectations all arise naturally from the use of linear algebra to solve integral equations involving classical probabilities over hidden variables. The non-fragile limit of the theory, where all measurements are commutative and the theory becomes analogous to classical statistical theory is discussed as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optomechanical sensors are capable of transducing external perturbations to resolvable optical signals. A particular regime of interest is that of high-bandwidth force detection, where an impulse is delivered to the system over a short period of time. Exceedingly sensitive impulse detection has been proposed to observe very weak signals like those due to long range interactions with dark matter that require much higher sensitivities than current sensors can provide. Quantum resources to go beyond the traditional standard quantum limit of these sensors include squeezing of the light used to transduce the signal, backaction evasion by measuring the optimal quadrature, and quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements that reduce backaction directly. These methods have been developed in the context of gravitational wave detection for target frequencies in the audio band range. Here, we provide the theoretical limits to quantum noise reduction for higher and broader frequency targets, such as those from dark matter signals, while combining quantum enhanced readout techniques based on squeezed light and QND measurements with optomechanical sensors. We demonstrate that backaction evasion through QND techniques dramatically reduces the technical challenges presented when using squeezed light for broadband force detection, paving the way for combining multiple quantum noise reduction techniques for enhanced sensitivity in the context of impulse metrology.</description>

      <title>Robust design under uncertainty in quantum error mitigation</title>

Abstract: Error mitigation techniques are crucial to achieving near-term quantum advantage. Classical post-processing of quantum computation outcomes is a popular approach for error mitigation, which includes methods such as Zero Noise Extrapolation, Virtual Distillation, and learning-based error mitigation. However, these techniques have limitations due to the propagation of uncertainty resulting from a finite shot number of the quantum measurement. In this work, we introduce general and unbiased methods for quantifying the uncertainty and error of error-mitigated observables, based on the strategic sampling of error mitigation outcomes. We then extend our approach to demonstrate the optimization of performance and robustness of error mitigation under uncertainty. To illustrate our methods, we apply them to Clifford Data Regression and Zero Noise Extrapolation in the ground state of the XY model simulated using IBM's Toronto and depolarizing noise models, respectively. In particular, we optimize the distribution of the training circuits for Clifford Data Regression, while for Zero Noise Extrapolation we optimize the choice of the noise levels and the allocation of shots. While our methods are readily applicable to any post-processing-based error mitigation approach, in practice they must not be prohibitively expensive - even though they perform optimizations of the error mitigation hyperparameters requiring sampling of a statistical distribution of error mitigation outcomes. By leveraging surrogate-based optimization, we show our methods can efficiently perform optimal design for a Zero Noise Extrapolation implementation. We then further demonstrate the transferability of learned Zero Noise Extrapolation hyperparameters to other similar circuits.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian and Liouvillian skin effects in magnetic systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) has emerged as a hallmark of non-Hermitian physics, with far-reaching implications for transport, topology, and sensing. While recent works have uncovered the NHSE in magnetic systems, these analyses rely on effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, thereby leaving open critical questions regarding their applicability and predictive power in experimentally feasible platforms. Here, we address this gap by exploring both the non-Hermitian and Liouvillian dynamics of a spin chain coupled to a shared bosonic reservoir. We identify the parameter regime in which these frameworks yield congruent predictions, while showing that the non-Hermitian approach fails to capture essential dynamical features -- such as relevant timescales and conditions for experimental observability. Our analysis also reveals that the NHSE stems from the interplay between chiral spin couplings and reciprocal nonlocal dissipation -- two interactions that can naturally occur in magnetic crystals and be easily engineered in magnetic heterostructures. Focusing on a concrete example of such heterostructures, we establish an explicit connection between their Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) dynamics and our microscopic model, providing a tangible route toward realizing the NHSE in an experimentally relevant spintronics setup.</description>

      <title>Unveiling quantum steering by quantum-classical uncertainty complementarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01055v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the remarkable aspects of quantum steering is its ability to violate local uncertainty complementarity relations. In this vein of study, various steering witnesses have been developed. Here, we introduce a novel complementarity relation between system's quantum and classical uncertainties corresponding to the distillable coherence and the von-Neumann entropy, respectively. We show that the proposed complementarity relation is tighter than the entropic uncertainty relation (EUR). Leveraging this result, we propose a steering witness that is more efficient than the EUR. From the operational perspective, the steering witness quantifies the amount of extra distillable coherence facilitated by quantum steerability. Notably, the proposed steering witness serves as a full entanglement measure for pure bipartite states--an ability that the EUR lacks. We also experimentally validate such a property through a photonic system. Furthermore, a deeper connection to the uncertainty principle is revealed by showcasing the steering-induced distillable coherence can quantifies measurement incompatibility and quantum steerability under genuine incoherent operations. Our work establishes a clear quantitative and operational link between coherence and steering, which are vital resources of quantum technologies, and underscores our efforts in bridging the uncertainty principle with quantum coherence.</description>

Abstract: We propose hybrid digital-analog learning algorithms on Rydberg atom arrays, combining the potentially practical utility and near-term realizability of quantum learning with the rapidly scaling architectures of neutral atoms. Our construction requires only single-qubit operations in the digital setting and global driving according to the Rydberg Hamiltonian in the analog setting. We perform a comprehensive numerical study of our algorithm on both classical and quantum data, given respectively by handwritten digit classification and unsupervised quantum phase boundary learning. We show in the two representative problems that digital-analog learning is not only feasible in the near term, but also requires shorter circuit depths and is more robust to realistic error models as compared to digital learning schemes. Our results suggest that digital-analog learning opens a promising path towards improved variational quantum learning experiments in the near term.</description>

      <title>On noise in swap ASAP repeater chains: exact analytics, distributions and tight approximations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07146v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Losses are one of the main bottlenecks for the distribution of entanglement in quantum networks, which can be overcome by the implementation of quantum repeaters. The most basic form of a quantum repeater chain is the swap ASAP repeater chain. In such a repeater chain, elementary links are probabilistically generated and deterministically swapped as soon as two adjacent links have been generated. As each entangled state is waiting to be swapped, decoherence is experienced, turning the fidelity of the entangled state between the end nodes of the chain into a random variable. Fully characterizing the (average) fidelity as the repeater chain grows is still an open problem. Here, we analytically investigate the case of equally-spaced repeaters, where we find exact analytic formulae for all moments of the fidelity up to 25 segments. We obtain these formulae by providing a general solution in terms of a generating function; a function whose n'th term in its Maclaurin series yields the moments of the fidelity for n segments. We generalize this approach as well to a global cut-off policy -- a method for increasing fidelity at the cost of longer entanglement delivery times -- allowing for fast optimization of the cut-off parameter by eliminating the need for Monte Carlo simulation. We furthermore find simple approximations of the average fidelity that are exponentially tight, and, for up to 10 segments, the full distribution of the delivered fidelity. We use this to analytically calculate the secret-key rate, both with and without binning methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum amplitude estimation from classical signal processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the problem of amplitude estimation, a core subroutine used in many quantum algorithms, can be mapped directly to a problem in signal processing called direction of arrival (DOA) estimation. The DOA task is to determine the direction of arrival of an incoming wave with the fewest possible measurements. The connection between amplitude estimation and DOA allows us to make use of the vast amount of signal processing algorithms to post-process the measurements of the Grover iterator at predefined depths. Using an off-the-shelf DOA algorithm called ESPRIT together with a compressed-sensing based sampling approach, we create a phase-estimation free, parallel quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) algorithm with a worst-case sequential query complexity of $\sim 4.3/\varepsilon$ and a parallel query complexity of $\sim 0.26/\varepsilon$ at 95% confidence. This performance is statistically equivalent and a $16\times$ improvement over Rall and Fuller [Quantum 7, 937 (2023)], for sequential and parallel query complexity respectively, which to our knowledge is the best published result for amplitude estimation. The approach presented here provides a simple, robust, parallel method to performing QAE, with many possible avenues for improvement borrowing ideas from the wealth of literature in classical signal processing.</description>

Abstract: Adaptive variational quantum algorithms arguably offer the best prospects for quantum advantage in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum era. Since the inception of the first such algorithm, the Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Problem-Tailored Variational Quantum Eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE), many improvements have appeared in the literature. We combine the key improvements along with a novel operator pool -- which we term Coupled Exchange Operator (CEO) pool -- to assess the cost of running state-of-the-art ADAPT-VQE on hardware in terms of measurement counts and circuit depth. We show a dramatic reduction of these quantum computational resources compared to the early versions of the algorithm: CNOT count, CNOT depth and measurement costs are reduced by up to 88%, 96% and 99.6%, respectively, for molecules represented by 12 to 14 qubits (LiH, H6 and BeH2). We also find that our state-of-the-art CEO-ADAPT-VQE outperforms the Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles ansatz, the most widely used static VQE ansatz, in all relevant metrics, and offers a five order of magnitude decrease in measurement costs as compared to other static ans\"atze with competitive CNOT counts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have established the method of characterizing the unitary design generated by a symmetric local random circuit. Concretely, we have shown that the necessary and sufficient condition for the circuit asymptotically forming a t-design is given by simple integer optimization for general symmetry and locality. By using the result, we explicitly give the maximal order of unitary design under the $\mathbb{Z}_2$, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries for general locality. This work reveals the relation between the fundamental notions of symmetry and locality in terms of randomness.</description>

Abstract: In the accompanying paper of arXiv:2408.13472, we have established the method of characterizing the maximal order of asymptotic unitary designs generated by symmetric local random circuits, and have explicitly specified the order in the cases of $\mathbb{Z}_2$, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries.

      <title>Time-Convolutionless Master Equation Applied to Adiabatic Elimination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In open quantum systems theory, reduced models are invaluable for conceptual understanding and computational efficiency. Adiabatic elimination is a useful model reduction method for systems with separated timescales, where a reduced model is derived by discarding rapidly decaying degrees of freedom. So far, adiabatic elimination has been formulated using a geometric approach, which provides a versatile and general framework. This article introduces a reformulation of adiabatic elimination through the framework of the time-convolutionless (TCL) master equation, a widely recognized tool for computing projected time evolution in open quantum systems. We show that the TCL master equation formulation yields results equivalent to those obtained from the geometric formulation. By applying the TCL master equation formulation to typical examples, we demonstrate a practical methodology for performing adiabatic elimination calculation. This study not only bridges two previously independent approaches, thereby making the adiabatic elimination method accessible to a broader audience, but also enables the analysis of complex cases that are challenging within the geometric formulation. Additionally, it reveals a geometric interpretation of the TCL master equation formalism.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Logical Clifford Gates from Code Automorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the implementation of fault-tolerant logical Clifford gates on stabilizer quantum error correcting codes based on their symmetries. Our approach is to map the stabilizer code to a binary linear code, compute its automorphism group, and impose constraints based on the Clifford operators permitted. We provide a rigorous formulation of the method for finding automorphisms of stabilizer codes and generalize ZX-dualities to non-CSS codes. We provide a Python package implementing our algorithms which uses the computational algebra system MAGMA. Our algorithms map automorphism group generators to physical circuits, calculate Pauli corrections based on the destabilizers of the code, and determine their logical action. We discuss the fault tolerance of the circuits and include examples of gates through automorphisms for the [[4,2,2]] and perfect [[5,1,3]] codes, bivariate bicycle codes, and the best known distance codes.</description>

      <title>Stochastic resetting in discrete-time quantum dynamics: steady states and correlations in few-qubit systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time evolution in several classes of quantum devices is generated through the application of quantum gates. Resetting is a critical technological feature in these systems allowing for mid-circuit measurement and complete or partial qubit reset. The possibility of realizing discrete-time reset dynamics on quantum computers makes it important to investigate the steady-state properties of such dynamics. Here, we explore the behavior of generic discrete-time unitary dynamics interspersed by random reset events. For Poissonian resets, we compute the stationary state of the process and demonstrate, by taking a weak-reset limit, the existence of "resonances" in the quantum gates, allowing for the emergence of steady state density matrices which are not diagonal in the eigenbasis of the generator of the unitary gate. Such resonances are a genuine discrete-time feature and impact on quantum and classical correlations even beyond the weak-reset limit. Furthermore, we consider non-Poissonian reset processes and explore conditions for the existence of a steady state. We show that, when the reset probability vanishes sufficiently rapidly with time, the system does not approach a steady state. Our results highlight key differences between continuous-time and discrete-time stochastic resetting and may be useful to engineer states with controllable correlations on existing devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe an experiment demonstrating the generation of three independent square-ladder continuous-variable cluster states with up to 94 qumodes of a microwave frequency comb. This entanglement structure at a large scale is realized by injecting vacuum fluctuations into a Josephson Parametric Amplifier pumped by three coherent signals around twice its resonance frequency, each having a particular well-defined phase relation. We reach up to 1.4 dB of squeezing of the nullifier which verifies the cluster state on the square ladder graph. Our results are consistent with a more familiar measure of two-mode squeezing, where we find up to 5.42 dB for one pump, and up to 1 dB for three pumps.</description>

      <title>Universal approximation of continuous functions with minimal quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional paradigm of quantum computing is discrete: it utilizes discrete sets of gates to realize bitstring-to-bitstring mappings, some of them arguably intractable for classical computers. In parameterized quantum approaches, widely used in quantum optimization and quantum machine learning, the input becomes continuous and the output represents real-valued functions. Various strategies exist to encode the input into a quantum circuit. While the bitstring-to-bitstring universality of quantum computers is quite well understood, basic questions remained open in the continuous case. For example, it was proven that full multivariate function universality requires either (i) a fixed encoding procedure with a number of qubits scaling as the dimension of the input or (ii) a tunable encoding procedure in single-qubit circuits. This reveals a trade-off between the complexity of the data encoding and the qubit requirements. The question of whether universality can be reached with a fixed encoding and constantly many qubits has been open for the last five years. In this paper, we answer this remaining fundamental question in the affirmative. We provide a constructive method to approximate arbitrary multivariate functions using just a single qubit and a fixed-generator parametrization, at the expense of increasing the depth. We also prove universality for a few of alternative fixed encoding strategies which may have independent interest. Our results rely on a combination of techniques from harmonic analysis and quantum signal processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multivariate (MTV) porous materials exhibit unique structural complexities based on diverse spatial arrangements of multiple building block combinations. These materials possess potential synergistic functionalities that exceed the sum of their individual components. However, the exponentially increasing design complexity of these materials poses challenges for accurate ground-state configuration prediction and design. To address this, a Hamiltonian model was developed for quantum computing that integrates compositional, structural, and balance constraints, enabling efficient optimization of the MTV configurations. The model employs a graph-based representation to encode linkers as qubits. To validate our model, a variational quantum circuit was constructed and executed using the Sampling VQE algorithm. Simulations on experimentally known MTV porous materials successfully reproduced their ground-state configurations, demonstrating the validity of our model. Furthermore, VQE calculations were performed on real quantum hardware for validation purposes, signaling a first step toward a practical quantum algorithm for the rational design of porous materials.</description>

      <title>Diversity of Superradiant Phase Transitions in the Bose-Fermi System under Tight-Binding Model in the Weak-Coupling Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic diversity associated with superradiant phase transitions within a one-dimensional tight-binding electronic chain that is intrinsically coupled to a single-mode optical cavity. By employing the quantized electromagnetic vector potential through the Peierls substitution, the gauge-invariant coupled Bose-Fermi system facilitates momentum-dependent superradiant transitions and effectively avoids the second-order spurious phase transitions typically observed in Dicke-like models. The quantum phase transitions in this system are characterized by stable dynamics, including the displacement and squeezing of the cavity mode and the redistribution of electronic momentum in the solid chain. Distinct from multimode cavity QED systems with atomic gases, this single-mode optical configuration unveils a range of nonlinear phenomena, including multistability and diversity of spontaneous symmetry breaking. The setup allows for precise manipulation of superradiant phases in the weak coupling regime, effectively mitigating the adverse effects of quantum fluctuation divergences. The diverse attributes of these quantum phase transitions enhance our understanding of tunable quantum solid devices and underscore their potential applications in quantum information processing and metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the action of a finite group $G$ by locality preserving automorphisms (quantum cellular automata) on quantum spin chains. We refer to such group actions as ``symmetries''. The natural notion of equivalence for such symmetries is \emph{stable equivalence}, which allows for stacking with factorized group actions. Stacking also endows the set of equivalence classes with a group structure. We prove that the anomaly of such symmetries provides an isomorphism between the group of stable equivalence classes of symmetries with the cohomology group $H^3(G,U(1))$, consistent with previous conjectures. This amounts to a complete classification of locality preserving symmetries on spin chains. We further show that a locality preserving symmetry is stably equivalent to one that can be presented by finite depth quantum circuits with covariant gates if and only if the slant product of its anomaly is trivial in $H^2(G, U(1)[G])$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03192v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Transformers combine quantum computing with the powerful Transformer model, offering new possibilities for machine learning by leveraging quantum features like superposition and entanglement. The surge in research since 2022, marked by diverse approaches and evolving trajectories, underscores the need for a cohesive synthesis of this interdisciplinary field. This paper presents the first comprehensive, systematic survey of quantum Transformer models. We define the research scope, focusing on quantum enhancements to Transformer components, and introduce key concepts in classical Transformers and quantum machine learning. Existing studies are categorized into Parameterized Quantum Circuits (PQC)-based and Quantum Linear Algebra (QLA)-based paradigms. PQC-based approaches are further divided into QKV-only Quantum Mapping, Quantum Pairwise Attention, Quantum Global Attention, and Quantum-assisted Acceleration, with analysis of core concepts and techniques. We evaluate computational complexity and performance, highlighting challenges such as scalability, generalization, and the barren plateau problem in PQC-based methods, and parameter trainability in QLA-based ones. Finally, we suggest future directions including low-complexity quantum Transformer variants, enhanced scalability, standardized evaluation, robust PQC architectures, and hybrid PQC-QLA designs. This survey should help researchers and practitioners quickly grasp the overall landscape of current quantum Transformer research and promote future developments in this emerging field.</description>

Abstract: We investigate quantum superposition effects in two-dimensional quantum walks of identical particles with different statistics under particle exchange, starting from various different initial configurations. To characterize interparticle correlation dynamics, we focus on joint properties such as two-particle coincidence probabilities and the spread velocity of the interparticle distance. Regarding spatial modes as an environment for the particles internal degrees of freedom, we study the role played by the particle statistics using standard entanglement witnesses, showing that particles possessing fermionic statistics are more resistant to thermalize with their environment. We analyze the presence of multipartite entanglement in the system's degrees of freedom through the Quantum Fisher Information, revealing that fermionic states generated during the walk are better suited to perform quantum metrology tasks. Finally, we discuss the potential for implementing this model using integrated photonic circuits by exploiting $N$-partite entanglement between individual photons.</description>

Abstract: We use a support vector regressor based on a projected quantum kernel method to predict the density structure of 1D fermionic systems of interest in quantum chemistry and quantum matter. The kernel is built on with the observables of a quantum reservoir implementable with interacting Rydberg atoms. Training and test data of the fermionic system are generated using a Density Functional Theory approach. We test the performance of the method for several Hamiltonian parameters, finding a general common behavior of the error as a function of measurement time. At sufficiently large measurement times, we find that the method outperforms the classical linear kernel method and can be competitive with the radial basis function method.</description>

Abstract: Laser phase noise is one of the main sources of decoherence in driven Rydberg systems with neutral atoms in tweezer arrays. While the effect of phase noise in the regimes of isolated qubits and few-qubit gate protocols has been studied extensively, there are open questions about the effects of this noise on many-body systems. In many scenarios, the effects of noise cannot simply be described by an increase in the energy or temperature of the system, leading to non-trivial changes in the state and relevant correlations. In this work, we use stochastic sampling to simulate laser phase noise based on experimentally relevant spectral densities. We explore the impact of this noise on adiabatic state preparation in a one-dimensional system, discussing the interplay between heating and interactions during dynamics. We find that for certain adiabatic processes, the noise can be seen to approximately thermalize in terms of its effects on relevant correlation functions.</description>

Abstract: To realize a quantum internet, the distribution of quantum states via quantum teleportation with quantum memories is a key ingredient. Being compatible with existing fiber networks, entangled photons and quantum memories at telecom-wavelength are of central interest for such a scalable quantum network. Here, we demonstrate quantum teleportation from a telecom-wavelength photonic qubit to a solid-state quantum memory based on erbium-ion ensembles, which have a native optical transition at 1.5 $\mu$m telecom C-band. To accomplish this, we use chip-scale silicon nitride micro-resonators to generate entangled photons with narrow linewidth, compatible with the quantum memory. We confirm the quality of the quantum teleportation procedure using quantum state and process tomography techniques, in which both the quantum state and process fidelities exceeds the classical limit.

      <title>Local Non-Hermitian Hamiltonian Formalism for Dissipative Fermionic Systems and Loss-Induced Population Increase in Fermi Superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine a standard scheme to obtain the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian (NHH) from the Lindblad master equation by neglecting its jump term, and propose an alternative approach to address the limitations of the former. It is shown that the NHH obtained by the conventional scheme fails to provide a good approximation for fermionic many-body systems, even on short timescales. To resolve this issue, we present a framework called the local NHH formalism, which describes the loss process in each individual mode locally. This formalism is applicable to general dissipative fermionic systems and remains consistent with the underlying Lindblad master equation at the level of the equations of motion of local observables. The local NHH formalism also provides a convenient framework for studying non-Hermitian physics in dissipative fermionic systems, especially for spectral analysis, compared to the Lindblad master equation. As an illustration, we consider a fermionic superfluid subjected to one-body loss and find the population increase induced by the loss, resulting from the locking of the relative phase between the pairing gap and the anomalous field. The conventional NHH fails to capture these unique phenomena.</description>

      <title>Towards near-unity $\beta$ factor and collection efficiency in single-photon sources: employing dielectric rings to suppress the emission into radiation modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that a few-period circular Bragg reflector around an infinite nanowire can increase the $\beta$ factor of the fundamental mode up to 0.999 due to further suppression of the emission into radiation modes caused by a photonic band gap effect. We then apply this strategy in the practically relevant case of the finite-sized SPS based on tapered nanowires and demonstrate that the collection efficiency can be further increased. Additionally, we also show the beneficial effects of adding optimized high-index rings around the micropillar SPS.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised machine learning for detecting mutual independence among eigenstate regimes in interacting quasiperiodic chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body eigenstates that are neither thermal nor many-body-localized (MBL) were numerically found in certain interacting chains with moderate quasiperiodic potentials. The energy regime consisting of these non-ergodic but extended (NEE) eigenstates has been extensively studied for being a possible many-body mobility edge between the energy-resolved MBL and thermal phases. Recently, the NEE regime was further proposed to be a prethermal phenomenon that generally occurs when different operators spread at sizably different timescales. Here, we numerically examine the mutual independence among the NEE, MBL, and thermal regimes in the lens of eigenstate entanglement spectra (ES). Given the complexity and rich information embedded in ES, we develop an unsupervised learning approach that is designed to quantify the mutual independence among general phases. Our method is first demonstrated on an illustrative toy example that uses RGB color data to represent phases, then applied to the ES of an interacting generalized Aubry Andre model from weak to strong potential strength. We find that while the MBL and thermal regimes are mutually independent, the NEE regime is dependent on the former two and smoothly appears as the potential strength decreases. We attribute our numerically finding to the fact that the ES data in the NEE regime exhibits both an MBL-like fast decay and a thermal-like long tail.</description>

      <title>Tunneling Spectroscopy in Superconducting Circuit Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate tunneling spectroscopy of synthetic quantum matter in superconducting circuit lattices. We measure site-resolved excitation spectra by coupling the lattice to engineered driven-dissipative particle baths that serve as local tunneling probes. Using incoherent particle source and drain, we independently extract quasi-particle and quasi-hole spectra and reconstruct the spatial structure of collective excitations. We perform spectroscopy of a strongly interacting Bose-Hubbard lattice at different densities, observing changes in energy gaps across the superfluid to Mott-insulator transition and the effects of three-body interactions. Our results provide a new toolset for characterizing many-body states in analog quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Linearization (in)stabilities and crossed products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19931v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modular crossed product algebras have recently assumed an important role in perturbative quantum gravity as they lead to an intrinsic regularization of entanglement entropies by introducing quantum reference frames (QRFs) in place of explicit regulators. This is achieved by imposing certain boost constraints on gravitons, QRFs and other fields. Here, we revisit the question of how these constraints should be understood through the lens of perturbation theory and particularly the study of linearization (in)stabilities, exploring when linearized solutions can be integrated to exact ones. Our aim is to provide some clarity about the status of justification, under various conditions, for imposing such constraints on the linearized theory in the $G_N\to0$ limit as they turn out to be of second-order. While for spatially closed spacetimes there is an essentially unambiguous justification, in the presence of boundaries or the absence of isometries this depends on whether one is also interested in second-order observables. Linearization (in)stabilities occur in any gauge-covariant field theory with non-linear equations and to address this in a unified framework, we translate the subject from the usual canonical formulation into a systematic covariant phase space language. This overcomes theory-specific arguments, exhibiting the universal structure behind (in)stabilities, and permits us to cover arbitrary generally covariant theories. We comment on the relation to modular flow and illustrate our findings in several gravity and gauge theory examples.</description>

      <title>Critical behavior of the Schwinger model via gauge-invariant VUMPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the lattice Schwinger model by combining the variational uniform matrix product state (VUMPS) algorithm with a gauge-invariant matrix product ansatz that locally enforces the Gauss law constraint. Both the continuum and lattice versions of the Schwinger model with $\theta=\pi$ are known to exhibit first-order phase transitions for the values of the fermion mass above a critical value, where a second-order phase transition occurs. Our algorithm enables a precise determination of the critical endpoint in the continuum theory. We further analyze the scaling in the simultaneous critical and continuum limits and confirm that the data collapse aligns with the Ising universality class to remarkable precision.</description>

      <title>Optical Switching of $\chi^{(2)}$ in Diamond Photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diamond's unique physical properties make it a versatile materials for a wide range of nonlinear and quantum photonic technologies. However, unlocking diamond's full potential as a nonlinear photonic material with non-zero second-order susceptibility $\chi^{(2)}\neq0$ requires symmetry breaking. In this work, we use a nanoscale cavity to demonstrate second-harmonic generation (SHG) in diamond, and demonstrate, for the first time, that the magnitude of the diamond's effective $\chi^{(2)}$ strongly depends on the electronic configuration of defects in the diamond crystal, such as nitrogen vacancy centres. The modification of $\chi^{(2)}$ arises from photoionisation from the negative to neutral charge state, and is manifested by quenching of SHG upon green illumination. Toggling the green illumination allows for optical switching of the device's $\chi^{(2)}$. Optical control of $\chi^{(2)}$ by defect engineering opens the door for second-order nonlinear processes in diamond.</description>

      <title>Generalised Process Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Process theories provide a powerful framework for describing compositional structures across diverse fields, from quantum mechanics to computational linguistics. Traditionally, they have been formalized using symmetric monoidal categories (SMCs). However, various generalizations, including time-neutral, higher-order, and enriched process theories, do not naturally conform to this structure. In this work, we propose an alternative formalization using operad algebras, motivated by recent results connecting SMCs to operadic structures, which captures a broader class of process theories. By leveraging the string-diagrammatic language, we provide an accessible yet rigorous formulation that unifies and extends traditional process-theoretic approaches. Our operadic framework not only recovers standard process theories as a special case but also enables new insights into quantum foundations and compositional structures. This work paves the way for further investigations into the algebraic and operational properties of generalised process theories within an operadic setting.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling for trapped-ion thermometry using dark resonances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate simulation of vibrational energy transport and quantum thermodynamics with trapped ions requires good methods for the estimation of temperatures. One valuable tool with this purpose is based on the fit of dark resonances in the fluorescence spectrum. However, the reliability of the procedure is still unclear. Here, we discuss several techniques with simplified dynamical equations for the numerical simulation of the spectrum of a trapped ion undergoing thermal motion, identifying advantages and limitations of each method. We start with a simplified three-level model to provide a better insight into the approximations involved and then move on to tackle the experimentally relevant case of an eight-level calcium ion. We observe that mimicking the effect of thermal motion by means of additional dephasing is computationally very convenient but can lead to significant errors in the estimation of the temperature. However, this can be counteracted by a proper calibration, supporting the use of dark resonances as a practical thermometer.</description>
