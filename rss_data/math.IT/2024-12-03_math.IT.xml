      <title>Fine Grained Analysis and Optimization of Large Scale Automotive Radar Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) enabled by automotive radars have significantly enhanced vehicle safety and driver experience. However, the extensive use of radars in dense road conditions introduces mutual interference, which degrades detection accuracy and reliability. Traditional interference models are limited to simple highway scenarios and cannot characterize the performance of automotive radars in dense urban environments. In our prior work, we employed stochastic geometry (SG) to develop two automotive radar network models: the Poisson line Cox process (PLCP) for dense city centers and smaller urban zones and the binomial line Cox process (BLCP) to encompass both urban cores and suburban areas. In this work, we introduce the meta-distribution (MD) framework upon these two models to distinguish the sources of variability in radar detection metrics. Additionally, we optimize the radar beamwidth and transmission probability to maximize the number of successful detections of a radar node in the network. Further, we employ a computationally efficient Chebyshev-Markov (CM) bound method for reconstructing MDs, achieving higher accuracy than the conventional Gil-Pelaez theorem. Using the framework, we analyze the specific impacts of beamwidth, detection range, and interference on radar detection performance and offer practical insights for developing adaptive radar systems tailored to diverse traffic and environmental conditions.</description>

      <title>A Probably Approximately Correct Analysis of Group Testing Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying the defectives from a population of items via a non-adaptive group testing framework with a random pooling-matrix design. We analyze the sufficient number of tests needed for approximate set identification, i.e., for identifying almost all the defective and non-defective items with high confidence. To this end, we view the group testing problem as a function learning problem and develop our analysis using the probably approximately correct (PAC) framework. Using this formulation, we derive sufficiency bounds on the number of tests for three popular binary group testing algorithms: column matching, combinatorial basis pursuit, and definite defectives. We compare the derived bounds with the existing ones in the literature for exact recovery theoretically and using simulations. Finally, we contrast the three group testing algorithms under consideration in terms of the sufficient testing rate surface and the sufficient number of tests contours across the range of the approximation and confidence levels.</description>

      <title>Joint Beam Scheduling and Resource Allocation for Flexible RSMA-aided Near-Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supporting immense throughput and ubiquitous connectivity holds paramount importance for future wireless networks. To this end, this letter focuses on how the spatial beams configured for legacy near-field (NF) users can be leveraged to serve extra NF or far-field users while ensuring the rate requirements of legacy NF users. In particular, a flexible rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) scheme is proposed to efficiently manage interference, which carefully selects a subset of legacy users to decode the common stream. Beam scheduling, power allocation, common rate allocation, and user selection are jointly optimized to maximize the sum rate of additional users. To solve the formulated discrete non-convex problem, it is split into three subproblems. The accelerated bisection searching, quadratic transform, and simulated annealing approaches are developed to attack them. Simulation results reveal that the proposed transmit scheme and algorithm achieve significant gains over three competing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Flexible Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents a flexible rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) framework for near-field (NF) integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). The spatial beams configured to meet the communication rate requirements of NF users are simultaneously leveraged to sense an additional NF target. A key innovation lies in its flexibility to select a subset of users for decoding the common stream, enhancing interference management and system performance. The system is designed by minimizing the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) for joint distance and angle estimation through optimized power allocation, common rate allocation, and user selection. This leads to a discrete, non-convex optimization problem. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the preconfigured beams are sufficient for target sensing, eliminating the need for additional probing signals. To solve the optimization problem, an iterative algorithm is proposed combining the quadratic transform and simulated annealing. Simulation results indicate that the proposed scheme significantly outperforms conventional RSMA and space division multiple access (SDMA), reducing distance and angle estimation errors by approximately 100\% and 20\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Remote Estimation Games with Random Walk Processes: Stackelberg Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Remote estimation is a crucial element of real time monitoring of a stochastic process. While most of the existing works have concentrated on obtaining optimal sampling strategies, motivated by malicious attacks on cyber-physical systems, we model sensing under surveillance as a game between an attacker and a defender. This introduces strategic elements to conventional remote estimation problems. Additionally, inspired by increasing detection capabilities, we model an element of information leakage for each player. Parameterizing the game in terms of uncertainty on each side, information leakage, and cost of sampling, we consider the Stackelberg Equilibrium (SE) concept where one of the players acts as the leader and the other one as the follower. By focusing our attention on stationary probabilistic sampling policies, we characterize the SE of this game and provide simulations to show the efficacy of our results.</description>

      <title>A Memory-Based Reinforcement Learning Approach to Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a point-to-point integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where a transmitter conveys a message to a receiver over a channel with memory and simultaneously estimates the state of the channel through the backscattered signals from the emitted waveform. Using Massey's concept of directed information for channels with memory, we formulate the capacity-distortion tradeoff for the ISAC problem when sensing is performed in an online fashion. Optimizing the transmit waveform for this system to simultaneously achieve good communication and sensing performance is a complicated task, and thus we propose a deep reinforcement learning (RL) approach to find a solution. The proposed approach enables the agent to optimize the ISAC performance by learning a reward that reflects the difference between the communication gain and the sensing loss. Since the state-space in our RL model is \`a priori unbounded, we employ deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm (DDPG). Our numerical results suggest a significant performance improvement when one considers unbounded state-space as opposed to a simpler RL problem with reduced state-space. In the extreme case of degenerate state-space only memoryless signaling strategies are possible. Our results thus emphasize the necessity of well exploiting the memory inherent in ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Double-Directional V2V Channel Measurement using ReRoMA at 60 GHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coordination of vehicles is a crucial element of autonomous driving, as it enhances the efficiency, convenience, and safety of road traffic. In order to fully exploit the capabilities of such coordination, communication with high data rate and low latency is required. It can be reasonably argued that millimeter-wave (mm-wave) vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) systems are capable of fulfilling the aforementioned requirements. Nevertheless, in order to develop a system that can be deployed in real-world scenarios and to gain an understanding of the various effects of mm-wave propagation, it is necessary to perform radio propagation measurements and to derive radio channel models from them across a range of scenarios and environments. To this end, we have conducted measurement campaigns at 60\,GHz in a variety of situations, including driving in a convoy, driving in opposite direction on a six-lane road, and overtaking. These measurements employ a channel sounder based on ReRoMA, a recently introduced concept that enables the real-time measurement of dynamic double-directional radio channels. The evaluations presented herein encompass key channel parameters, including the path loss (path loss coefficient of approximately 1.9), the root mean square (RMS) delay spread (within a range of 5\,ns to 110\,ns), the angular spreads (in a range of 0.05 to 0.4), the power distribution among multipath components, and the channel stationarity time (multiple seconds).</description>

      <title>Assessing GPT Model Uncertainty in Mathematical OCR Tasks via Entropy Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the uncertainty of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models in extracting mathematical equations from images of varying resolutions and converting them into LaTeX code. We employ concepts of entropy and mutual information to examine the recognition process and assess the model's uncertainty in this Optical Character Recognition (OCR) task. By analyzing the conditional entropy of the output token sequences, we provide both theoretical insights and practical measurements of the GPT model's performance given different image qualities.
  Our experimental results, obtained using a Python implementation available on GitHub, demonstrate a clear relationship between image resolution and GPT model uncertainty. Higher-resolution images lead to lower entropy values, indicating reduced uncertainty and improved accuracy in the recognized LaTeX code. Conversely, lower-resolution images result in increased entropy, reflecting higher uncertainty and a higher likelihood of recognition errors. These findings highlight the practical importance of considering image quality in GPT-based mathematical OCR applications and demonstrate how entropy analysis, grounded in information-theoretic concepts, can effectively quantify model uncertainty in real-world tasks.</description>

      <title>6DMA-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a six-dimensional movable antenna (6DMA)-aided cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system to fully exploit its macro spatial diversity, where a set of distributed access points (APs), each equipped with multiple 6DMA surfaces, cooperatively serve all users in a given area. Connected to a central processing unit (CPU) via fronthaul links, 6DMA-APs can optimize their combining vectors for decoding the users' information based on either local channel state information (CSI) or global CSI shared among them. We aim to maximize the average achievable sum-rate via jointly optimizing the rotation angles of all 6DMA surfaces at all APs, based on the users' spatial distribution. Since the formulated problem is non-convex and highly non-linear, we propose a Bayesian optimization-based algorithm to solve it efficiently. Simulation results show that, by enhancing signal power and mitigating interference through reduced channel cross-correlation among users, 6DMA-APs with optimized rotations can significantly improve the average sum-rate, as compared to the conventional cell-free network with fixed-position antennas and that with only a single centralized AP with optimally rotated 6DMAs, especially when the user distribution is more spatially diverse.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widely and commonly adopted upper bound on the set size of aperiodic Z-complementary sets (ZCSs) in the literature has been a conjecture. In this letter, we provide detailed derivations for this conjectured bound. A ZCS is optimal when its set size reaches the upper bound. Furthermore, we propose a new construction of ZCSs based on extended generalized Boolean functions (EGBFs). The proposed method introduces optimal ZCSs with new parameters.</description>

      <title>Many-User Multiple Access with Random User Activity: Achievability Bounds and Efficient Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Gaussian multiple access channel with random user activity, in the regime where the number of users is proportional to the code length. The receiver may know some statistics about the number of active users, but does not know the exact number nor the identities of the active users. We derive two achievability bounds on the probabilities of misdetection, false alarm, and active user error, and propose an efficient CDMA-type scheme whose performance can be compared against these bounds. The first bound is a finite-length result based on Gaussian random codebooks and maximum-likelihood decoding. The second is an asymptotic bound, established using spatially coupled Gaussian codebooks and approximate message passing (AMP) decoding. These bounds can be used to compute an achievable trade-off between the active user density and energy-per-bit, for a fixed user payload and target error rate. The efficient CDMA scheme uses a spatially coupled signature matrix and AMP decoding, and we give rigorous asymptotic guarantees on its error performance. Our analysis provides the first state evolution result for spatially coupled AMP with matrix-valued iterates, which may be of independent interest. Numerical experiments demonstrate the promising error performance of the CDMA scheme for both small and large user payloads, when compared with the two achievability bounds.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Geometry and Dynamical System Analysis of Walker Constellation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In practice, low Earth orbit (LEO) and medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellite networks consist of multiple orbits, each populated with many satellites. A widely used spatial architecture for satellites is the Walker constellation, where the longitudes of orbits are equally spaced and the satellites are periodically distributed along the orbits. In this paper, we develop a stochastic geometry model for Walker constellations by constructing orbits that are invariant with respect to (w.r.t.) Earth's spin and satellites that are invariant w.r.t. orbit-wise rotation. This model enables an analysis based on dynamical systems, which allows one to address structural properties such as periodicity and ergodicity. It also enables a stochastic geometry analysis where, for a typical user at a given latitude, we derive the performance of downlink communications as a function of key constellation parameters, including orbit inclination and altitude, the number of orbits, the number of satellites, and the user latitude.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty-Aware Dimensionality Reduction for Channel Charting with Geodesic Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel Charting is a dimensionality reduction technique that learns to reconstruct a low-dimensional, physically interpretable map of the radio environment by taking advantage of similarity relationships found in high-dimensional channel state information. One particular family of Channel Charting methods relies on pseudo-distances between measured CSI datapoints, computed using dissimilarity metrics. We suggest several techniques to improve the performance of dissimilarity metric-based Channel Charting. For one, we address an issue related to a discrepancy between Euclidean distances and geodesic distances that occurs when applying dissimilarity metric-based Channel Charting to datasets with nonconvex low-dimensional structure. Furthermore, we incorporate the uncertainty of dissimilarities into the learning process by modeling dissimilarities not as deterministic quantities, but as probability distributions. Our framework facilitates the combination of multiple dissimilarity metrics in a consistent manner. Additionally, latent space dynamics like constrained acceleration due to physical inertia are easily taken into account thanks to changes in the training procedure. We demonstrate the achieved performance improvements for localization applications on a measured channel dataset</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multivariate multiplicity codes (Kopparty, Saraf, and Yekhanin, J. ACM 2014) are linear codes where the codewords are described by evaluations of multivariate polynomials (with a degree bound) and their derivatives up to a fixed order, on a suitably chosen affine point set. While good list decoding algorithms for multivariate multiplicity codes were known in some special cases of point sets by a reduction to univariate multiplicity codes, a general list decoding algorithm up to the distance of the code when the point set is an arbitrary finite grid, was obtained only recently (Bhandari et al., IEEE TIT 2023). This required the characteristic of the field to be zero or larger than the degree bound, and this requirement is somewhat necessary, since list decoding this code up to distance with small output list size is not possible when the characteristic is significantly smaller than the degree.
  In this work, we present an alternate construction, based on divided differences, that closely resembles the classical multiplicity codes but is `insensitive to the field characteristic'. We obtain an efficient algorithm that list decodes this code up to distance, for arbitrary finite grids and over all finite fields. Notably, our construction can be interpreted as a `folded Reed-Muller code', which might be of independent interest. The upshot of our result is that a good `Taylor-like expansion' can be expressed in terms of a good `derivative-like operator' (a divided difference), and this implies that the corresponding code admits good algorithmic list decoding.</description>

      <title>A generalization of Burmester-Desmedt GKE based on a non-abelian finite group action</title>

Abstract: The advent of large-scale quantum computers implies that our existing public-key cryptography infrastructure has become insecure. That means that the privacy of many mobile applications involving dynamic peer groups, such as multicast messaging or pay-per-view, could be compromised. In this work we propose a generalization of the well known group key exchange protocol proposed by Burmester and Desmedt to the non-abelian case by the use of finite group actions and we prove that the presented protocol is secure in Katz and Yung's model.</description>

      <title>Pessimistic Cardinality Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cardinality Estimation is to estimate the size of the output of a query without computing it, by using only statistics on the input relations. Existing estimators try to return an unbiased estimate of the cardinality: this is notoriously difficult. A new class of estimators have been proposed recently, called "pessimistic estimators", which compute a guaranteed upper bound on the query output. Two recent advances have made pessimistic estimators practical. The first is the recent observation that degree sequences of the input relations can be used to compute query upper bounds. The second is a long line of theoretical results that have developed the use of information theoretic inequalities for query upper bounds. This paper is a short overview of pessimistic cardinality estimators, contrasting them with traditional estimators.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Trace Reconstruction Problem: Recovering a String of Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the following natural generalization of trace reconstruction, parameterized by a deletion probability $\delta \in (0,1)$ and length $n$: There is a length $n$ string of probabilities, $S=p_1,\ldots,p_n,$ and each "trace" is obtained by 1) sampling a length $n$ binary string whose $i$th coordinate is independently set to 1 with probability $p_i$ and 0 otherwise, and then 2) deleting each of the binary values independently with probability $\delta$, and returning the corresponding binary string of length $\le n$. The goal is to recover an estimate of $S$ from a set of independently drawn traces. In the case that all $p_i \in \{0,1\}$ this is the standard trace reconstruction problem. We show two complementary results. First, for worst-case strings $S$ and any deletion probability at least order $1/\sqrt{n}$, no algorithm can approximate $S$ to constant $\ell_\infty$ distance or $\ell_1$ distance $o(\sqrt n)$ using fewer than $2^{\Omega(\sqrt{n})}$ traces. Second -- as in the case for standard trace reconstruction -- reconstruction is easy for random $S$: for any sufficiently small constant deletion probability, and any $\epsilon&gt;0$, drawing each $p_i$ independently from the uniform distribution over $[0,1]$, with high probability $S$ can be recovered to $\ell_1$ error $\epsilon$ using $\mathrm{poly}(n,1/\epsilon)$ traces and computation time. We show indistinguishability in our lower bound by regarding a complicated alternating sum (comparing two distributions) as the Fourier transformation of some function evaluated at $\pm \pi,$ and then showing that the Fourier transform decays rapidly away from zero by analyzing its moment generating function.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Interference Suppression for Radar and Communication Cohabitation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the joint dynamic power allocation and multi-relay selection for the cohabitation of high-priority military radar and low-priority commercial 5G communication. To improve the 5G network performance, we design the full-duplex underlay cognitive radio network for the low-priority commercial 5G network, where multiple relays are selected for concurrently receive the signal from the source and send it to the destination. Then, we propose the interference suppression at the high-priority radar system by using both non-coherent and coherent relay cases. In particular, we formulate the optimization problem for maximizing the system rate, with the consideration of the power constraints at the 5G users and the interference constraint at the radar system. Then, we propose the mathematical analysis model to evaluate the rate performance, considering the impacts of self-interference at the relays and derive the algorithms of joint power allocation and relay selection. Our numerical results demonstrate the characteristic of the optimal configuration and the significant performance gain of coherent case with respect to the non-coherent case and the existing algorithms with single relay selections.</description>

      <title>Non-Terrestrial Networking for 6G: Evolution, Opportunities, and Future Directions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From 5G onwards, Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) have emerged as a key component of future network architectures. Leveraging Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations, NTNs are capable of building a space Internet and present a paradigm shift in delivering mobile services to even the most remote regions on Earth. However, the extensive coverage and rapid movement of LEO satellites pose unique challenges for NTN networking, including user equipment (UE) access and inter-satellite delivery, which directly impact the quality of service (QoS) and data transmission continuity. This paper offers an in-depth review of advanced NTN management technologies in the context of 6G evolution, focusing on radio resource management, mobility management, and dynamic network slicing. Building on this foundation and considering the latest trends in NTN development, we then present some innovative perspectives to emerging challenges in satellite beamforming, handover mechanisms, and inter-satellite transmissions. Lastly, we identify open research issues and propose future directions aimed at advancing satellite Internet deployment and enhancing NTN performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent advances in quantum information processing, sensing and communications are surveyed with the objective of identifying the associated knowledge gaps and formulating a roadmap for their future evolution. Since the operation of quantum systems is prone to the deleterious effects of decoherence, which manifests itself in terms of bit-flips, phase-flips or both, the pivotal subject of quantum error mitigation is reviewed both in the presence and absence of quantum coding. The state-of-the-art, knowledge gaps and future evolution of quantum machine learning are also discussed, followed by a discourse on quantum radar systems and briefly hypothesizing about the feasibility of integrated sensing and communications in the quantum domain. Finally, we conclude with a set of promising future research ideas in the field of ultimately secure quantum communications with the objective of harnessing ideas from the classical communications field.</description>

      <title>Mutual Coupling in Dynamic Metasurface Antennas: Foe, but also Friend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs), surfaces patterned with reconfigurable metamaterial elements (meta-atoms) that couple waves from waveguides or cavities to free space, are a promising technology to realize 6G wireless base stations and access points with low cost and power consumption. Mutual coupling between the DMA's meta-atoms results in a non-linear dependence of the radiation pattern on the DMA configuration, significantly complicating modeling and optimization. Therefore, mutual coupling has to date been considered a vexing nuance that is frequently neglected in theoretical studies and deliberately mitigated in experimental prototypes. Here, we demonstrate the overlooked property of mutual coupling to boost the control over the DMA's radiation pattern. Based on a physics-compliant DMA model, we demonstrate that the radiation pattern's sensitivity to the DMA configuration significantly depends on the mutual coupling strength. We further evidence how the enhanced sensitivity under strong mutual coupling translates into a higher fidelity in radiation pattern synthesis, benefiting applications ranging from dynamic beamforming to end-to-end optimized sensing and imaging. Our insights suggest that DMA design should be fundamentally rethought to embrace the benefits of mutual coupling. We also discuss ensuing future research directions related to the frugal characterization of DMAs based on compact physics-compliant models.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning Based Near-Field User Localization with Beam Squint in Wideband XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is gaining attention as a prominent technology for enabling the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. However, the vast antenna array and the huge bandwidth introduce a non-negligible beam squint effect, causing beams of different frequencies to focus at different locations. One approach to cope with this is to employ true-time-delay lines (TTDs)-based beamforming to control the range and trajectory of near-field beam squint, known as the near-field controllable beam squint (CBS) effect. In this paper, we investigate the user localization in near-field wideband XL-MIMO systems under the beam squint effect and spatial non-stationary properties. Firstly, we derive the expressions for Cram\'er-Rao Bounds (CRBs) for characterizing the performance of estimating both angle and distance. This analysis aims to assess the potential of leveraging CBS for precise user localization. Secondly, a user localization scheme combining CBS and beam training is proposed. Specifically, we organize multiple subcarriers into groups, directing beams from different groups to distinct angles or distances through the CBS to obtain the estimates of users' angles and distances. Furthermore, we design a user localization scheme based on a convolutional neural network model, namely ConvNeXt. This scheme utilizes the inputs and outputs of the CBS-based scheme to generate high-precision estimates of angle and distance. More importantly, our proposed ConvNeXt-based user localization scheme achieves centimeter-level accuracy in localization estimates.</description>

      <title>Graph Community Augmentation with GMM-based Modeling in Latent Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the issue of graph generation with generative models. In particular, we are concerned with graph community augmentation problem, which refers to the problem of generating unseen or unfamiliar graphs with a new community out of the probability distribution estimated with a given graph dataset. The graph community augmentation means that the generated graphs have a new community. There is a chance of discovering an unseen but important structure of graphs with a new community, for example, in a social network such as a purchaser network. Graph community augmentation may also be helpful for generalization of data mining models in a case where it is difficult to collect real graph data enough. In fact, there are many ways to generate a new community in an existing graph. It is desirable to discover a new graph with a new community beyond the given graph while we keep the structure of the original graphs to some extent for the generated graphs to be realistic. To this end, we propose an algorithm called the graph community augmentation (GCA). The key ideas of GCA are (i) to fit Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to data points in the latent space into which the nodes in the original graph are embedded, and (ii) to add data points in the new cluster in the latent space for generating a new community based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of GCA for generating graphs with a new community structure on synthetic and real datasets.</description>

      <title>Coded Distributed (Batch) Matrix Multiplication over Galois Ring via RMFE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coded Distributed Matrix Multiplication (CDMM) is a distributed matrix multiplication (DMM) for large-scale matrices through a coding scheme such that any $R$ worker node among all $N$ worker nodes can recover the final product, where $N$ corresponds to the length of the code and $R\leq N$ is called the recovery threshold. The state-of-art CDMM schemes, such as EP codes for Single DMM and GCAS codes for batch DMM, are defined over a Galois field $\mathsf{GF}(q)$ of size $q\geq N$. These are inefficient for small Galois fields such as $\mathsf{GF}(2)$ and the integer residue ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^{e}}$ due to the lack of invertible elements for interpolation. DMM over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^{e}}$ (such as $\mathbb{Z}_{2^{64}}$ ) is well-motivated in practice due to their direct compatibility with hardware. In this work, we construct efficient CDMM over the Galois ring $\mathsf{GR}(p^e,d)$ which is an extension ring over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^{e}}$ of degree $d$, particularly, $\mathsf{GR}(p,d)=\mathsf{GF}(p^d)$ is the Galois field and $\mathsf{GR}(p^e,1)=\mathbb{Z}_{p^e}$. We first give a general CDMM framework for the batch of $n$ matrix multiplications via the famous RMFE (Cascudo et al. Crypto'18). Compared with GCSA, our construction has a smaller recovery threshold by a factor of $1/n$. Next, we optimize EP codes via batch preprocessing of the input matrices. We give two types of Single CDMM, which can achieve almost the same performance as EP codes over a Galois field with size $q\geq N$. Finally, we present the experimental analysis of our CDMM on Galois rings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for constructing Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithms for rotationally-invariant models. By employing a general iterative algorithm template and reducing it to long-memory Orthogonal AMP (OAMP), we systematically derive the correct Onsager terms of AMP algorithms. This approach allows us to rederive an AMP algorithm introduced by Fan and Opper et al., while shedding new light on the role of free cumulants of the spectral law. The free cumulants arise naturally from a recursive centering operation, potentially of independent interest beyond the scope of AMP. To illustrate the flexibility of our framework, we introduce two novel AMP variants and apply them to estimation in spiked models.</description>

Abstract: At present, in lattice-based linearly homomorphic signature schemes, especially under the standard model, there are very few schemes with tight security. This paper constructs the first lattice-based linearly homomorphic signature scheme that achieves tight security against existential unforgeability under chosen-message attacks (EUF-CMA) in the standard model. Furthermore, among existing schemes, the scheme proposed in this paper also offers certain advantages in terms of public key size, signature length, and computational cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers, known for their attention mechanisms, have proven highly effective in focusing on critical elements within complex data. This feature can effectively be used to address the time-varying channels in wireless communication systems. In this work, we introduce a channel-aware adaptive framework for semantic communication, where different regions of the image are encoded and compressed based on their semantic content. By employing vision transformers, we interpret the attention mask as a measure of the semantic contents of the patches and dynamically categorize the patches to be compressed at various rates as a function of the instantaneous channel bandwidth. Our method enhances communication efficiency by adapting the encoding resolution to the content's relevance, ensuring that even in highly constrained environments, critical information is preserved. We evaluate the proposed adaptive transmission framework using the TinyImageNet dataset, measuring both reconstruction quality and accuracy. The results demonstrate that our approach maintains high semantic fidelity while optimizing bandwidth, providing an effective solution for transmitting multi-resolution data in limited bandwidth conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1611.06487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyclic codes over finite fields are widely implemented in data storage systems, communication systems, and consumer electronics, as they have very efficient encoding and decoding algorithms. They are also important in theory, as they are closely connected to several areas in mathematics. There are a few fundamental ways of constructing all cyclic codes over finite fields, including the generator matrix approach, the generator polynomial approach, the generating idempotent approach, and the $q$-polynomial approach. Another one is a sequence approach, which has been intensively investigated in the past decade. The objective of this paper is to survey the progress in the past decade in this direction.</description>

      <title>Factoring Perfect Reconstruction Filter Banks into Causal Lifting Matrices: A Diophantine Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:1902.09040v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The elementary theory of bivariate linear Diophantine equations over polynomial rings is used to construct causal lifting factorizations (elementary matrix decompositions) for causal two-channel FIR perfect reconstruction transfer matrices and wavelet transforms. The Diophantine approach generates causal factorizations satisfying certain polynomial degree-reducing inequalities, enabling a new factorization strategy called the Causal Complementation Algorithm. This provides a causal (i.e., polynomial, hence realizable) alternative to the noncausal lifting scheme developed by Daubechies and Sweldens using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm for Laurent polynomials. The new approach replaces the Euclidean Algorithm with Gaussian elimination employing a slight generalization of polynomial division that ensures existence and uniqueness of quotients whose remainders satisfy user-specified divisibility constraints. The Causal Complementation Algorithm is shown to be more general than the causal version of the Euclidean Algorithm approach by generating additional causal lifting factorizations beyond those obtainable using the polynomial Euclidean Algorithm.</description>

      <title>Task-aware Distributed Source Coding under Dynamic Bandwidth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.15523v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient compression of correlated data is essential to minimize communication overload in multi-sensor networks. In such networks, each sensor independently compresses the data and transmits them to a central node due to limited communication bandwidth. A decoder at the central node decompresses and passes the data to a pre-trained machine learning-based task to generate the final output. Thus, it is important to compress the features that are relevant to the task. Additionally, the final performance depends heavily on the total available bandwidth. In practice, it is common to encounter varying availability in bandwidth, and higher bandwidth results in better performance of the task. We design a novel distributed compression framework composed of independent encoders and a joint decoder, which we call neural distributed principal component analysis (NDPCA). NDPCA flexibly compresses data from multiple sources to any available bandwidth with a single model, reducing computing and storage overhead. NDPCA achieves this by learning low-rank task representations and efficiently distributing bandwidth among sensors, thus providing a graceful trade-off between performance and bandwidth. Experiments show that NDPCA improves the success rate of multi-view robotic arm manipulation by 9% and the accuracy of object detection tasks on satellite imagery by 14% compared to an autoencoder with uniform bandwidth allocation.</description>

      <title>Geometric constellation shaping for wireless optical intensity channels: An information-theoretic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A simple geometric shaping method is proposed for optical wireless communication systems based on intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) from an information-theoretic perspective. Constellations consisting of equiprobable levels with exponential-like distribution are obtained, which possesses asymptotic optimality in the sense that the high-SNR capacity of average-intensity constrained optical intensity channel can be approached by such constellations with increasing size. All $2^b$ levels ($b\in\mathbb N$) of the obtained constellation can be represented by a basic level and $b+2$ bits, thereby reducing the required resolution of the digital-to-analog converter (DAC) without affecting the asymptotic optimality. Achievable information rate evaluations verify the asymptotic optimality. As an example, error performance results of a simple $16$-level LDPC coded modulation scheme show that a shaping gain of $0.65$ dB can be obtained by applying the proposed constellation design. This method can also be applied to more specific IM/DD channel models, since it only requires a near-optimal continuous input distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We enhance coarsely quantized LDPC decoding by reusing computed check node messages from previous iterations. Typically, variable and check nodes update and replace old messages every iteration. We show that, under coarse quantization, discarding old messages entails a significant loss of mutual information. The loss is avoided with additional memory, improving performance by up to 0.23 dB. We optimize quantization with a modified information bottleneck algorithm that considers the statistics of old messages. A simple merge operation reduces memory requirements. Depending on channel conditions and code rate, memory assistance enables up to 32 % better area efficiency for 2-bit decoding.</description>

      <title>Large Sets of Quasi-Complementary Sequences From Polynomials over Finite Fields and Gaussian Sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perfect complementary sequence sets (PCSSs) are widely used in multi-carrier code-division multiple-access (MC-CDMA) communication systems. However, the set size of a PCSS is upper bounded by the number of row sequences of each two-dimensional matrix in the PCSS. Then quasi-complementary sequence sets (QCSSs) were proposed to support more users in MC-CDMA communications. For practical applications, it is desirable to construct an $(M,K,N,\vartheta_{\max})$-QCSS with $M$ as large as possible and $\vartheta_{max}$ as small as possible, where $M$ is the number of matrices with $K$ rows and $N$ columns in the set and $\vartheta_{\max}$ denotes its periodic tolerance. There exists a tradeoff among these parameters. Constructing QCSSs achieving or nearly achieving the known correlation lower bound has been an interesting research topic. Up to now, only a few constructions of asymptotically optimal or near-optimal periodic QCSSs have been reported in the literature. In this paper, based on polynomials over finite fields and Gaussian sums, we construct five new families of asymptotically optimal or near-optimal periodic QCSSs with large set sizes and low periodic tolerances. These families of QCSSs have set size $\Theta(K^2)$ or $\Theta(K^3)$ and flock size $K$. To the best of our knowledge, only a small amount of known families of periodic QCSSs with set size $\Theta(K^2)$ have been constructed and most of other known periodic QCSSs have set sizes much smaller than $\Theta(K^2)$. Our new constructed periodic QCSSs with set size $\Theta(K^2)$ and flock size $K$ have the best parameters among all known ones. They have larger set sizes or lower periodic tolerances. The periodic QCSSs with set size $\Theta(K^3)$ and flock size $K$ constructed in this paper have the largest set size among all known families of asymptotically optimal or near-optimal periodic QCSSs.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Blocking in mmWave Cellular Systems: Application to Relay Positioning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2002.01733v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of 5G, blockage effects occurring in the mmWave band are critical. Previous works describe the effects of blockages in isolated and multiple links for simple blocking objects, modeled with mathematical tools such as stochastic geometry and random shape theory. Our study uses these tools to characterize a scenario with $N$ links, including the possible correlation among them in terms of blocking for several models of blocking objects. We include numerical evaluations highlighting that assuming independence among the links' blocking elements is a too-brief simplification and does not accurately describe the real scenario. This paper also applies the formulation developed for the case of $N$ links to optimize the relay positioning in mmWave cells for coverage enhancement, that is, to minimize the communication failure probability. We also show that both link budget and blockages affect the optimum positioning of the relays as they are both essential for successful transmission.</description>

      <title>The Mathematical Syntax of Architectures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2004.03719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite several (accepted) standards, core notions typically employed in information technology or system engineering architectures lack the precise and exact foundations encountered in logic, algebra, and other branches of mathematics.
  In this contribution we define the syntactical aspects of the term architecture in a mathematically rigorous way. We motivate our particular choice by demonstrating (i) how commonly understood and expected properties of an architecture -- as defined by various standards -- can be suitably identified or derived within our formalization, (ii) how our concept is fully compatible with real life (business) architectures, and (iii) how our definition complements recent foundational work in this area (Wilkinson 2018, Dickersen 2020, Efatmaneshnik 2020).
  We furthermore develop a rigorous notion of architectural similarity based on the notion of homomorphisms allowing the class of architectures to be regarded as a category, Arch. We demonstrate the applicability of our concepts to theory by deriving theorems on the classification of certain types of architectures. Inter alia, we derive a no go theorem proving that, in contrast to n-tier architectures, one cannot sensibly define generic architectural modularity on the syntactical level alone.</description>

Abstract: We show that much of the theory of finite tight frames can be generalised to vector spaces over the quaternions. This includes the variational characterisation, group frames, and the characterisations of projective and unitary equivalence. We are particularly interested in sets of equiangular lines (equi-isoclinic subspaces) and the groups associated with them, and how to move them between the spaces $\Rd$, $\Cd$ and $\Hd$. We discuss what the analogue of Zauner's conjecture for equiangular lines in $\Hd$ might be.</description>

      <title>Rotation Invariant Quantization for Model Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Post-training Neural Network (NN) model compression is an attractive approach for deploying large, memory-consuming models on devices with limited memory resources. In this study, we investigate the rate-distortion tradeoff for NN model compression. First, we suggest a Rotation-Invariant Quantization (RIQ) technique that utilizes a single parameter to quantize the entire NN model, yielding a different rate at each layer, i.e., mixed-precision quantization. Then, we prove that our rotation-invariant approach is optimal in terms of compression. We rigorously evaluate RIQ and demonstrate its capabilities on various models and tasks. For example, RIQ facilitates $\times 19.4$ and $\times 52.9$ compression ratios on pre-trained VGG dense and pruned models, respectively, with $&lt;0.4\%$ accuracy degradation. Code is available in \href{https://github.com/ehaleva/RIQ}{github.com/ehaleva/RIQ}.</description>

      <title>On the existence of powerful p-values and e-values for composite hypotheses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16539v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a composite null $ \mathcal P$ and composite alternative $ \mathcal Q$, when and how can we construct a p-value whose distribution is exactly uniform under the null, and stochastically smaller than uniform under the alternative? Similarly, when and how can we construct an e-value whose expectation exactly equals one under the null, but its expected logarithm under the alternative is positive? We answer these basic questions, and other related ones, when $ \mathcal P$ and $ \mathcal Q$ are convex polytopes (in the space of probability measures). We prove that such constructions are possible if and only if $ \mathcal Q$ does not intersect the span of $ \mathcal P$. If the p-value is allowed to be stochastically larger than uniform under $P\in \mathcal P$, and the e-value can have expectation at most one under $P\in \mathcal P$, then it is achievable whenever $ \mathcal P$ and $ \mathcal Q$ are disjoint. More generally, even when $ \mathcal P$ and $ \mathcal Q$ are not polytopes, we characterize the existence of a bounded nontrivial e-variable whose expectation exactly equals one under any $P \in \mathcal P$. The proofs utilize recently developed techniques in simultaneous optimal transport. A key role is played by coarsening the filtration: sometimes, no such p-value or e-value exists in the richest data filtration, but it does exist in some reduced filtration, and our work provides the first general characterization of this phenomenon. We also provide an iterative construction that explicitly constructs such processes, and under certain conditions it finds the one that grows fastest under a specific alternative $Q$. We discuss implications for the construction of composite nonnegative (super)martingales, and end with some conjectures and open problems.</description>

Abstract: G\'acs' coarse-grained algorithmic entropy leverages universal computation to quantify the information content of any given physical state. Unlike the Boltzmann and Gibbs-Shannon entropies, it requires no prior commitment to macrovariables or probabilistic ensembles, rendering it applicable to settings arbitrarily far from equilibrium. For measure-preserving dynamical systems equipped with a Markovian coarse-graining, we prove a number of fluctuation inequalities. These include algorithmic versions of Jarzynski's equality, Landauer's principle, and the second law of thermodynamics. In general, the algorithmic entropy determines a system's actual capacity to do work from an individual state, whereas the Gibbs-Shannon entropy only gives the mean capacity to do work from a state ensemble that is known a priori.</description>

      <title>Unified framework for continuity of sandwiched R\'enyi divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we prove uniform continuity bounds for entropic quantities related to the sandwiched R\'enyi divergences such as the sandwiched R\'enyi conditional entropy. We follow three different approaches: The first one is the "almost additive approach", which exploits the sub-/ superadditivity and joint concavity/ convexity of the exponential of the divergence. In our second approach, termed the "operator space approach", we express the entropic measures as norms and utilize their properties for establishing the bounds. These norms draw inspiration from interpolation space norms. We not only demonstrate the norm properties solely relying on matrix analysis tools but also extend their applicability to a context that holds relevance in resource theories. By this, we extend the strategies of Marwah and Dupuis as well as Beigi and Goodarzi employed in the sandwiched R\'enyi conditional entropy context. Finally, we merge the approaches into a mixed approach that has some advantageous properties and then discuss in which regimes each bound performs best. Our results improve over the previous best continuity bounds or sometimes even give the first continuity bounds available. In a separate contribution, we use the ALAFF method, developed in a previous article by some of the authors, to study the stability of approximate quantum Markov chains.</description>

      <title>A Truly Concurrent Semantics for Reversible CCS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.14011v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reversible CCS (RCCS) is a well-established, formal model for reversible communicating systems, which has been built on top of the classical Calculus of Communicating Systems (CCS). In its original formulation, each CCS process is equipped with a memory that records its performed actions, which is then used to reverse computations. More recently, abstract models for RCCS have been proposed in the literature, basically, by directly associating RCCS processes with (reversible versions of) event structures. In this paper we propose a different abstract model: starting from one of the well-known encoding of CCS into Petri nets we apply a recently proposed approach to incorporate causally-consistent reversibility to Petri nets, obtaining as result the (reversible) net counterpart of every RCCS term.</description>

      <title>Provable Privacy Advantages of Decentralized Federated Learning via Distributed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) emerged as a paradigm designed to improve data privacy by enabling data to reside at its source, thus embedding privacy as a core consideration in FL architectures, whether centralized or decentralized. Contrasting with recent findings by Pasquini et al., which suggest that decentralized FL does not empirically offer any additional privacy or security benefits over centralized models, our study provides compelling evidence to the contrary. We demonstrate that decentralized FL, when deploying distributed optimization, provides enhanced privacy protection - both theoretically and empirically - compared to centralized approaches. The challenge of quantifying privacy loss through iterative processes has traditionally constrained the theoretical exploration of FL protocols. We overcome this by conducting a pioneering in-depth information-theoretical privacy analysis for both frameworks. Our analysis, considering both eavesdropping and passive adversary models, successfully establishes bounds on privacy leakage. We show information theoretically that the privacy loss in decentralized FL is upper bounded by the loss in centralized FL. Compared to the centralized case where local gradients of individual participants are directly revealed, a key distinction of optimization-based decentralized FL is that the relevant information includes differences of local gradients over successive iterations and the aggregated sum of different nodes' gradients over the network. This information complicates the adversary's attempt to infer private data. To bridge our theoretical insights with practical applications, we present detailed case studies involving logistic regression and deep neural networks. These examples demonstrate that while privacy leakage remains comparable in simpler models, complex models like deep neural networks exhibit lower privacy risks under decentralized FL.</description>

      <title>Optimal Strategies for Winning Certain Coset-Guessing Quantum Games</title>

Abstract: In a recently introduced coset guessing game, Alice plays against Bob and Charlie, aiming to meet a joint winning condition. Bob and Charlie can only communicate before the game starts to devise a joint strategy. The game we consider begins with Alice preparing a 2m-qubit quantum state based on a random selection of three parameters. She sends the first m qubits to Bob and the rest to Charlie and then reveals to them her choice for one of the parameters. Bob is supposed to guess one of the hidden parameters, Charlie the other, and they win if both guesses are correct. From previous work, we know that the probability of Bob's and Charlie's guesses being simultaneously correct goes to zero exponentially as m increases. We derive a tight upper bound on this probability and show how Bob and Charlie can achieve it. While developing the optimal strategy, we devised an encoding circuit using only CNOT and Hadamard gates, which could be relevant for building efficient CSS-coded systems. We found that the role of quantum information that Alice communicates to Bob and Charlie is to make their responses correlated rather than improve their individual (marginal) correct guessing rates.</description>
