      <title>Adaptive Variation-Resilient Random Number Generator for Embedded Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a growing interest in securing user data within the internet-of-things (IoT), embedded encryption has become of paramount importance, requiring light-weight high-quality Random Number Generators (RNGs). Emerging stochastic device technologies produce random numbers from stochastic physical processes at high quality, however, their generated random number streams are adversely affected by process and supply voltage variations, which can lead to bias in the generated streams. In this work, we present an adaptive variation-resilient RNG capable of extracting unbiased encryption-grade random number streams from physically driven entropy sources, for embedded cryptography applications. As a proof of concept, we employ a stochastic magnetic tunnel junction (sMTJ) device as an entropy source. The impact of variations in the sMTJ is mitigated by employing an adaptive digitizer with an adaptive voltage reference that dynamically tracks any stochastic signal drift or deviation, leading to unbiased random bit stream generation. The generated unbiased bit streams, due to their higher entropy, then only need to undergo simplified post-processing. Statistical randomness tests based on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) test suite are conducted on bit streams obtained using simulations and FPGA entropy source emulation experiments, validating encryption-grade randomness at a significantly reduced hardware cost, and across a wide range of process-induced device variations and supply voltage fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Practical design and performance of physical reservoir computing using hysteresis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing is an innovative idea for using physical phenomena as computational resources. Recent research has revealed that information processing techniques can improve the performance, but for practical applications, it is equally important to study the level of performance with a simple design that is easy to construct experimentally. We focus on a reservoir composed of independent hysteretic systems as a model suitable for the practical implementation of physical reservoir computing. In this paper, we discuss the appropriate design of this reservoir, its performance, and its limitations. This research will serve as a practical guideline for constructing hysteresis-based reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Hedge Funds on a Swamp: Analyzing Patterns, Vulnerabilities, and Defense Measures in Blockchain Bridges [Experiment, Analysis \&amp; Benchmark]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain bridges have become essential infrastructure for enabling interoperability across different blockchain networks, with more than $24B monthly bridge transaction volume. However, their growing adoption has been accompanied by a disproportionate rise in security breaches, making them the single largest source of financial loss in Web3. For cross-chain ecosystems to be robust and sustainable, it is essential to understand and address these vulnerabilities. In this study, we present a comprehensive systematization of blockchain bridge design and security. We define three bridge security priors, formalize the architectural structure of 13 prominent bridges, and identify 23 attack vectors grounded in real-world blockchain exploits. Using this foundation, we evaluate 43 representative attack scenarios and introduce a layered threat model that captures security failures across source chain, off-chain, and destination chain components.
  Our analysis at the static code and transaction network levels reveals recurring design flaws, particularly in access control, validator trust assumptions, and verification logic, and identifies key patterns in adversarial behavior based on transaction-level traces. To support future development, we propose a decision framework for bridge architecture design, along with defense mechanisms such as layered validation and circuit breakers. This work provides a data-driven foundation for evaluating bridge security and lays the groundwork for standardizing resilient cross-chain infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Simulating Refractive Distortions and Weather-Induced Artifacts for Resource-Constrained Autonomous Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scarcity of autonomous vehicle datasets from developing regions, particularly across Africa's diverse urban, rural, and unpaved roads, remains a key obstacle to robust perception in low-resource settings. We present a procedural augmentation pipeline that enhances low-cost monocular dashcam footage with realistic refractive distortions and weather-induced artifacts tailored to challenging African driving scenarios. Our refractive module simulates optical effects from low-quality lenses and air turbulence, including lens distortion, Perlin noise, Thin-Plate Spline (TPS), and divergence-free (incompressible) warps. The weather module adds homogeneous fog, heterogeneous fog, and lens flare. To establish a benchmark, we provide baseline performance using three image restoration models. To support perception research in underrepresented African contexts, without costly data collection, labeling, or simulation, we release our distortion toolkit, augmented dataset splits, and benchmark results.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Communication Through Exploiting RIS, SSK, and CIM for Improved Reliability and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel communication system model that integrates reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), spatial shift keying (SSK), and code index modulation (CIM) based on Hadamard coding called RIS based transmit SSK-CIM (RIS-CIM-TSSK). By leveraging RIS, the system adapts rapidly to dynamic environments, enhancing error rates and overall reliability. SSK facilitates the transmission of additional passive information while eliminating the need for multiple radio frequency (RF) chains, thereby reducing complexity. CIM enhances passive information transmission through frequency domain spreading, which may increase signal obfuscation. This proposed scheme not only improves energy efficiency but also offers a robust solution for reliable communication in modern wireless networks, paving the way for smarter and more adaptable implementations. We consider a suboptimal, low-complexity detector for the proposed scheme and also address the blind case for phase adjustment of the RIS. Finally, we present the simulation results for the proposed system model across various configurations, including different numbers of receive and transmit antennas, varying reflecting elements of the RIS, and different code lengths.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic weighted sums with magnetic skyrmions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Integrating magnetic skyrmions into neuromorphic computing could help improve hardware efficiency and computational power. However, developing a scalable implementation of the weighted sum of neuron signals - a core operation in neural networks - has remained a challenge. Here, we show that weighted sum operations can be performed in a compact, biologically-inspired manner by using the non-volatile and particle-like characteristics of magnetic skyrmions that make them easily countable and summable. The skyrmions are electrically generated in numbers proportional to an input with an efficiency given by a non-volatile weight. The chiral particles are then directed using localized current injections to a location where their presence is quantified through non-perturbative electrical measurements. Our experimental demonstration, which currently has two inputs, can be scaled to accommodate multiple inputs and outputs using a crossbar array design, potentially nearing the energy efficiency observed in biological systems.</description>

      <title>The Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA): An Integrated Framework for AI-Enabled Government</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08725v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence transforms public sector operations, governments struggle to integrate technological innovations into coherent systems for effective service delivery. This paper introduces the Algorithmic State Architecture (ASA), a novel four-layer framework conceptualising how Digital Public Infrastructure, Data-for-Policy, Algorithmic Government/Governance, and GovTech interact as an integrated system in AI-enabled states. Unlike approaches that treat these as parallel developments, ASA positions them as interdependent layers with specific enabling relationships and feedback mechanisms. Through comparative analysis of implementations in Estonia, Singapore, India, and the UK, we demonstrate how foundational digital infrastructure enables systematic data collection, which powers algorithmic decision-making processes, ultimately manifesting in user-facing services. Our analysis reveals that successful implementations require balanced development across all layers, with particular attention to integration mechanisms between them. The framework contributes to both theory and practice by bridging previously disconnected domains of digital government research, identifying critical dependencies that influence implementation success, and providing a structured approach for analysing the maturity and development pathways of AI-enabled government systems.</description>

      <title>When Federated Learning Meets Quantum Computing: Survey and Research Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08814v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Federated Learning (QFL) is an emerging field that harnesses advances in Quantum Computing (QC) to improve the scalability and efficiency of decentralized Federated Learning (FL) models. This paper provides a systematic and comprehensive survey of the emerging problems and solutions when FL meets QC, from research protocol to a novel taxonomy, particularly focusing on both quantum and federated limitations, such as their architectures, Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, and privacy preservation, so on. This work explores key developments and integration strategies, along with the impact of quantum computing on FL, keeping a sharp focus on hybrid quantum-classical approaches. The paper offers an in-depth understanding of how the strengths of QC, such as gradient hiding, state entanglement, quantum key distribution, quantum security, and quantum-enhanced differential privacy, have been integrated into FL to ensure the privacy of participants in an enhanced, fast, and secure framework. Finally, this study proposes potential future directions to address the identified research gaps and challenges, aiming to inspire faster and more secure QFL models for practical use.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing and Cybersecurity in Accounting and Finance: Current and Future Challenges and the Opportunities for Securing Accounting and Finance Systems in the Post-Quantum World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing is transforming the world profoundly, affecting businesses, organisations, technologies, and human beings' information systems, and will have a profound impact on accounting and finance, particularly in the realm of cybersecurity. It presents both opportunities and risks in ensuring confidentiality and protecting financial data. The purpose of this article is to show the application of quantum technologies in accounting cybersecurity, utilising quantum algorithms and QKD to overcome the limitations of classical computing.
  The literature review reveals the vulnerabilities of the current accounting cybersecurity to quantum attacks and the need for quantum-resistant cryptographic mechanisms. It elaborates on the risks associated with conventional encryption in the context of quantum capabilities. This study contributes to the understanding of how quantum computing can transform accounting cybersecurity by enhancing quantum-resistant algorithms and using QKD in accounting.
  The study employs PSALSAR systematic review methodology to ensure rigour and depth. The analysis shows that quantum computing enhances encryption techniques to superior possibilities than classical ones. Using quantum technologies in accounting minimises data breaches and unauthorised access. The study concludes that quantum-resistant algorithms and quantum key distribution (QKD) are necessary for securing the accounting and finance systems of the future.
