      <title>A.E. Convergence vs Boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend Stein's maximal theorem to the bilinear setting. Let $M$ be a homogeneous space with a transitive action of a compact abelian group, and let $1 \le p,q \le 2$ and $1/2 \le r \le 1$ satisfy $1/p + 1/q = 1/r$. For a family of translation-invariant bilinear operators \[ T_m : L^p(M) \times L^q(M) \to L^r(M), \qquad m \in \mathbb{N}, \] that converge almost everywhere, we prove that the associated maximal operator \[ T^*(f,g) = \sup_m |T_m(f,g)| \] is of weak type $L^p(M) \times L^q(M) \to L^{r,\infty}(M)$. The proof relies on probabilistic methods and a bilinear extension of Stein's lemma for double Rademacher series.
  We also establish a bilinear analogue of Sawyer's extension of Stein's theorem for positive bilinear operators commuting with a mixing family of measure-preserving transformations. Applications include strong-type boundedness of maximal bilinear tail operators associated with ergodic transformations in the natural exponent range $r = (1/p + 1/q)^{-1}$ for $p,q &gt; 1$, as well as almost everywhere convergence results for bilinear Bochner--Riesz means and other bilinear ergodic averages on the torus.</description>

      <title>Remarks on the inverse Littlewood conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Littlewood conjecture, proven by Konyagin and McGehee-Pigno-Smith in the 1980s, states that if $A\subset \mathbb{Z}$ is a finite set of integers with $\lvert A\rvert=N$ then $\| \widehat{1_A}\|_1\geq c\log N$ for some absolute constant $c &gt; 0$. We explore what structure $A$ must have if $\| \widehat{1_A}\|_1\leq K\log N$ for some constant $K$. Under such an assumption we prove, for instance, that $A$ contains a subset $A'\subseteq A$ with $\lvert A\rvert \geq N^{0.99}$ such that $\lvert A'+A'\rvert \ll K^{O(1)}\lvert A'\rvert$. As a consequence, for any $k\geq 3$, if $N$ is sufficiently large depending on $k$ and $K$, then $A$ must contain an arithmetic progression of length $k$. A byproduct of our analysis is a (slightly) improved bound for the constant $c$.</description>

      <title>Cantor sets in higher dimensions II: Optimal dimension constraint for stable intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that a pair of compact sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d \in \mathbb{N}$) can be separated by small deformations if the sum of their Hausdorff dimensions is less than $d$. In this paper, we demonstrate that this dimension constraint is optimal for regular Cantor sets. Specifically, for any prescribed Hausdorff dimensions whose sum is greater than $d$, we construct classes of pairs of regular Cantor sets that exhibit $C^{1+\alpha}$-stable intersections.
  Our method is geometrically flexible, enabling the construction of examples with arbitrarily small thickness in both projectively hyperbolic and nearly conformal regimes. These results also extend to the complex setting for holomorphic Cantor sets in $\mathbb{C}^d$. The proof relies on the ``covering criterion" for stable intersection introduced in the first part of this series \cite{NZ1}, which generalizes the ``recurrent compact set criterion" of Moreira-Yoccoz to higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Balayage of measures: behavior near a corner</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the balayage of a measure $\mu$ defined on a domain $\Omega$ onto its boundary $\partial \Omega$. Assuming that $\Omega$ has a corner of opening $\pi \alpha$ at a point $z_0 \in \partial \Omega$ for some $0 &lt; \alpha \leq 2$ and that $d\mu(z) \asymp |z-z_{0}|^{2b-2}d^{2}z$ as $z\to z_0$ for some $b &gt; 0$, we obtain the precise rate of vanishing of the balayage of $\mu$ near $z_{0}$. The rate of vanishing is universal in the sense that it only depends on $\alpha$ and $b$. We also treat the case when the domain has multiple corners at the same point. Moreover, when $2b\leq \frac{1}{\alpha}$, we provide explicit constants for the upper and lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Cantor sets in higher dimension I: Criterion for stable intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry of dynamically defined Cantor sets in arbitrary dimensions, introducing a criterion for $\mathcal{C}^{1+\alpha}$ stable intersections of such Cantor sets, under a mild bunching condition. This condition is naturally satisfied for perturbations of conformal Cantor sets and, in particular, always holds in dimension one. Our work extends the celebrated recurrent compact set criterion of Moreira and Yoccoz for stable intersection of Cantor sets in the real line to higher-dimensional spaces. Based on this criterion, we develop a method for constructing explicit examples of stably intersecting Cantor sets in any dimension. This construction operates in the most fragile and critical regimes, where the Hausdorff dimension of one of the Cantor sets is arbitrarily small and both Cantor sets are nearly homothetical. All results and examples are provided in both real and complex settings.</description>

      <title>A refined variant of Hartley convolution: algebraic structures, spectral radius and related issues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17529v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel convolution product associated with the $\mathscr{H}$-transform, denoted by $\underset{\mathscr{H}}{\ast}$, and explore its fundamental properties. Here, the $\mathscr{H}$-transform may be regarded as a refined variant of the classical Fourier, Hartley transform, with kernel function depending on two parameters $a,b$. Our first contribution shows that the space of integrable functions, equipped with multiplication given by the $\underset{\mathscr{H}}{\ast}$-convolution, constitutes the commutative Banach algebra over the complex field, albeit without an identity element. Second, establishes the Wiener--L\'evy type invertibility criterion for $\mathscr{H}$-algebras, obtained through the density property and process of unitarization, which serves as a key step toward the proof of Gelfand's spectral radius theorem. Third, provides an explicit upper-bound of Young's inequality for $\underset{\mathscr{H}}{\ast}$-convolution and its direct corollary. Finally, all of these theoretical findings are applied to analyze specific classes of the Fredholm integral equations and heat source problems, yielding a priori estimates under the established assumptions.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Functions can Exactly Quantify Rate Performance of Nonlinear Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pointwise-in-time stability notions for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) provide quantitative metrics for system performance by establishing bounds on the rate of decay of the system state in terms of initial condition -- allowing stability to be quantified by e.g. the maximum provable decay rate. Such bounds may be obtained by finding suitable Lyapunov functions using, e.g. Sum-of-Squares (SOS) optimization. While Lyapunov tests have been proposed for numerous pointwise-in-time stability notions, including exponential, rational, and finite-time stability, it is unclear whether these characterizations are able to provide accurate bounds on system performance.
  In this paper, we start by proposing a generalized notion of rate performance -- with exponential, rational, and finite-time decay rates being special cases. Then, for any such notion and rate, we associate a Lyapunov condition which is shown to be necessary and sufficient for a system to achieve that rate. Finally, we show how the proposed conditions can be enforced using SOS programming in the case of exponential, rational, and finite-time stability. Numerical examples in each case demonstrate that the corresponding SOS test can achieve tight bounds on the rate performance with accurate inner bounds on the associated regions of performance.</description>
