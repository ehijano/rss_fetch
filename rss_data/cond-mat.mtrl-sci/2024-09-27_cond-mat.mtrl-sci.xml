      <title>A finite deformation theory of dislocation thermomechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A geometrically nonlinear theory for field dislocation thermomechanics based entirely on measurable state variables is proposed. Instead of starting from an ordering-dependent multiplicative decomposition of the total deformation gradient tensor, the additive decomposition of the velocity gradient into elastic, plastic and thermal distortion rates is obtained as a natural consequence of the conservation of the Burgers vector. Based on this equation, the theory consistently captures the contribution of transient heterogeneous temperature fields on the evolution of the (polar) dislocation density. The governing equations of the model are obtained from the conservation of Burgers vector, mass, linear and angular momenta, and the First Law. The Second Law is used to deduce the thermodynamical driving forces for dislocation velocity. An evolution equation for temperature is obtained from the First Law and the Helmholtz free energy density, which is taken as a function of the following measurable quantities: elastic distortion, temperature and the dislocation density (the theory allows prescribing additional measurable quantities as internal state variables if needed). Furthermore, the theory allows one to compute the Taylor-Quinney factor, which is material and strain rate dependent. Accounting for the polar dislocation density as a state variable in the Helmholtz free energy of the system allows for temperature solutions in the form of dispersive waves with finite propagation speed, despite using Fourier's law of heat conduction as the constitutive assumption for the heat flux vector.</description>

      <title>Semiconducting Electrides Derived From Sodalite: A First-principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrides are ionic crystals with electrons acting as anions occupying well-defined lattice sites. These exotic materials have attracted considerable attention in recent years for potential applications in catalysis, rechargeable batteries, and display technology. Among this class of materials, electride semiconductors can further expand the horizon of potential applications due to the presence of a band gap. However, there are only limited reports on semiconducting electrides, hindering the understanding of their physical and chemical properties. In a recent work, we initiated an approach to derive potential electrides via selective removal of symmetric Wyckoff sites of anions from existing complex minerals. Herein, we present a follow-up effort to design the semiconducting electrides from parental complex sodalites. Among four candidate compounds, we found that a cubic Ca$_4$Al$_6$O$_{12}$ structure with the $I$-43$m$ space group symmetry exhibits perfect electron localization at the sodalite cages, with a narrow electronic band gap of 1.2 eV, making it suitable for use in photocatalysis. Analysis of the electronic structures reveals that a lower electronegativity of surrounding cations drives greater electron localization and promotes the formation of an electride band near the Fermi level. Our work proposes an alternative approach for designing new semiconducting electrides under ambient conditions and offers guidelines for further experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Reduction of Electrical Resistivity in Ultrathin Non-Crystalline NbP Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical resistivity of conventional metals, such as copper, is known to increase in thinner films due to electron-surface scattering, limiting the performance of metals in nanoscale electronics. Here, we uncover an exceptional reduction of resistivity with decreasing film thickness in NbP semimetal, deposited at relatively low temperatures of 400 {\deg}C. In sub-5 nm thin films, we find a significantly lower resistivity (~34 uOhm.cm for 1.5 nm thin NbP, at room temperature) than in the bulk form, and lower than conventional metals at similar thickness. Remarkably, the NbP films are not crystalline, but display local nanocrystalline, short-range order within an amorphous matrix. Our analysis suggests that the lower resistivity is due to conduction through surface channels, together with high surface carrier density and sufficiently good mobility, as the film thickness is reduced. These results and the fundamental insights obtained here could enable ultrathin, low-resistivity wires for nanoelectronics, beyond the limitations of conventional metals.</description>

      <title>Revealing the phonon bottleneck limit in negatively charged CdS quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capture of photoexcited hot electrons in semiconductors before they lose their excess energy to cooling is a long-standing goal in photon energy conversion. Semiconductor nanocrystals have large electron energy spacings that are expected to slow down electron relaxation by phonon emission, but hot electrons in photoexcited nanocrystals nevertheless cool rapidly by energy transfer to holes. This makes the intrinsic phonon-bottleneck limited electron lifetime in nanocrystals elusive. We used a combination of theory and experiments to probe the hot electron dynamics of negatively charged Cadmium Sulfide (CdS) colloidal quantum dots (QDs) in the absence of holes. Experiments found that these hot electrons cooled on a 100 ps timescale. Theoretical simulations predicted that pure phonon-bottleneck limited electron cooling occurs on a similar timescale. This similarity suggests that the experimental measurements reflect the upper limit on hot electron lifetimes in these CdS QDs and the lower limit on the rates of processes that can harvest those hot electrons.</description>

      <title>Linear dichroism of the optical properties of SnS and SnSe van der Waals crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tin monochalcogendies SnS and SnSe, belonging to a familiy of van der Waals crystals isoelectronic to black phosphorus, are know as enivornmetally-friendly materials promisng for thermoelecric conversion applications. However, they exhibit other desired functionalities, such as intrisic linear dichroism of the optical and electronic properties originating from strongly anisotropic orthorhombic crystal structure. This property makes them perfect candidats for polarization-sensitive photodetectors working in near infrared spectral range. We present a comprehensive study of the SnS and SnSe crystals by means of optical spectroscopy and photoemission spectroscopy, supported by ab initio calcualtions. The studies revealed the high sensitivity of the optical response of both materials to the incident light polarization, which we interpret in terms of the electronic band dispersion and orbital composition of the electronic bands, dictating the selection rules. From the photoemission investigation we determine the ionization potential, electron affinity and work function, which are parameters crucial for the design of devices based on semiconductor heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Preparation and Characterization of High Quality Bi1-xSbx Thin Films: A Sputtering Deposition Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bi1-xSbx was the first 3D topological insulator found in nature. It presents a complex electronic structure with topological to trivial transition and a semimetallic to semiconductor transition, both achieved by changing the x fraction of Sb. The complex nature of this system may lead to several electronic and topological phases in matter, making it a promising quantum material. Here, we focused on preparing very high-quality thin films samples of Bi1-xSbx with varying fraction of x using the Co-deposition Magnetron Sputtering technique. Our results demonstrate that high-quality samples, with compact and uniform morphology, presenting a preferential direction of growth, can be obtained over SiO2 substrate. Our findings suggest a dependence between the thin films crystalline texture and the composition of the samples, as well as the deposition temperature.</description>

      <title>Wavelength-dependent anisotropic light-matter interaction in 2D ferroelectric In2Se3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anisotropic light-matter interactions in 2D materials have garnered significant attention for their potential to develop futuristic polarization-based optoelectronic devices, such as photodetectors and photo-actuators. In this study, we investigate the polarization-dependent interactions in ferroelectric 3R alpha-In2Se3 using Angle-Resolved Polarized Raman Spectroscopy (ARPRS) with different excitation lasers. Our experimental findings supported by complementary Density Functional Theory calculations demonstrate that the light-matter interactions depend not only on the crystallographic orientation but also on the excitation energy. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) confirms the highly anisotropic 3R crystal structure of alpha-In2Se3. This anisotropy in crystal structure facilitates significant optical anisotropy, driven by a complex interplay of electron-photon and electron-phonon interactions, which is reflected in the complex nature of the Raman tensor elements. These anisotropy interactions extend to the materials electrical response under light illumination. Remarkably, the anisotropic photo-response can be tuned by both polarization and wavelength of the incident light, making In2Se3 a promising material for advanced polarization-sensitive photodetection applications.</description>

      <title>Core-hole induced misalignment between Van-Hove singularities and K-edge fine structure in carbon nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between the K-edge fine structure of isolated single-wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and the Van Hove singularities (VHSs) in the conduction band density of states. To this end, we model X-ray absorption spectra of SWCNTs using the final-state approximation and the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) method. Both methods can reproduce the experimental fine structure, where the BSE results improve on peak positions and amplitude rations compared to the final-state approximation. When the fine structure in the modeled spectra is related to the VHSs significant differences are found. We suggest that these differences arise due to modifications of the core exciton wavefunctions induced by the confinement along the circumference. Additionally, we analyze the character of core excitons in SWCNTs and find that the first bright excitons are Frenkel excitons while higher-lying excitons are charge resonance states. Finally, we suggest that the qualitative picture based on VHSs in the density of states holds when there is a large energy gap between successive VHSs.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional nanoscale control of magnetism in crystalline Yttrium Iron Garnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exceptional magnetic, optical and phononic properties of Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) make it unique for spin-wave based and photonic applications. Yet, nanostructuring crystalline YIG and manipulating its magnetism in a non-destructive way is an outstanding challenge, and so far mostly limited to two-dimensional capabilities. Here, we show that irradiation of single-crystal YIG films with a focused UV laser drives a stable, giant enhancement of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, preserving the crystalline quality. This modulation is highly confined at the nanoscale in both the lateral and vertical directions, and its extension within the volume can be finely tuned with a continuous depth-control. By harnessing these three-dimensional anisotropy profiles, we demonstrate a large tuning of the spin-wave band structure, volume spatial localization, and non-reciprocity, realizing proof-of-principle 3D magnonic crystals. This straightforward, single-step, laser nanofabrication of three-dimensional magnetic systems based on crystalline YIG thin films opens the way to design novel functions in magnonic and magneto-optic devices.</description>

      <title>Excited States Band Mapping and Ultrafast Nonequilibrium Dynamics in Topological Dirac Semimetal 1T-ZrTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed time- and polarization-resolved extreme ultraviolet momentum microscopy on topological Dirac semimetal candidate 1T-ZrTe$_2$. Excited states band mapping uncovers the previously inaccessible linear dispersion of the Dirac cone above the Fermi level. We study the orbital texture of bands using linear dichroism in photoelectron angular distributions. These observations provide hints on the topological character of 1T-ZrTe$_2$. Time-, energy- and momentum-resolved nonequilibrium carrier dynamics reveal that intra- and inter-band scattering processes play a capital role in the relaxation mechanism, leading to multivalley electron-hole accumulation near the Fermi level. We also show that electrons' inverse lifetime has a linear dependence on their binding energy. Our time- and polarization-resolved XUV photoemission results shed light on the excited state electronic structure of 1T-ZrTe$_2$ and provide valuable insights into the relatively unexplored field of quantum-state-resolved ultrafast dynamics in 3D topological Dirac semimetals.</description>

      <title>Interplay between surface Dirac and Rashba states specific for topologically nontrivial van der Waals superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we show that, in contrast to the observed surface states in well studied pnictogen chalcogenide van der Waals (vdW) topological insulators (TIs) with quintuple layer (QL) or septuple layer~(SL) structure, in superlattices, comprising the alternating QL and SL vdW blocks, the Dirac state becomes accompanied by emergent spin-polarized states of the Rashba type. This specific feature is caused by an inequivalence of the surface and subsurface structural blocks and an electrostatic potential bending near the surface. Within density functional theory~(DFT) and $\emph{ab-initio}$ tight-binding~(TB) calculations we analyze peculiarities of these states depending on the surface termination, structural parameters and chemical composition. It is found that their possible hybridization with the Dirac state significantly affects its dispersion and spatial localization. We analyze the influence of intrinsic magnetism on behavior of the termination-dependent surface states for magnetic QL/SL superlattices. These findings provide a better understanding of the existing experimental observations of such QL/SL alternating superlattices.</description>

      <title>Phase glides and self-organization of atomically abrupt interfaces out of stochastic disorder in $\alpha$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder-induced ordering and unprecedentedly high radiation tolerance in $\gamma$-phase of gallium oxide is a recent spectacular discovery at the intersection of the fundamental physics and electronic applications. Importantly, by far, these data were collected with initial samples in form of the thermodynamically stable $\beta$-phase of this material. Here, we investigate these phenomena starting instead from already metastable $\alpha$-phase and explain radically new trend occurring in the system. We argue that in contrast to that in $\beta$-to-$\gamma$ disorder-induced transitions, the O sublattice in $\alpha$-phase exhibits hexagonal close-packed structure, so that to activate $\alpha$-to-$\gamma$ transformation significant structural rearrangements are required in both Ga and O sublattices. Moreover, consistently with theoretical predictions, $\alpha$-to-$\gamma$ phase transformation requires accumulation of the substantial tensile strain to initiate otherwise impossible lattice glides. Thus, we explain the experimentally observed trends in term of the combination of disorder and strain governing the process. Finally, and perhaps most amazingly, we demonstrate atomically abrupt $\alpha$/$\gamma$ interfaces paradoxically self-organized out of the stochastic disorder.</description>

      <title>Interplay of metallicity, ferroelectricity and layer charges in SmNiO$_3$/BaTiO$_3$ superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using density-functional theory, we demonstrate that the formal layer charges of the metallic samarium nickelate electrode influence the spontaneous ferroelectric polarization of the barium titanate in SmNiO$_3$/BaTiO$_3$ capacitors. We find that, despite the metallic screening of SmNiO$_3$, the spontaneous polarization of BaTiO$_3$ always aligns with the layer polarization of the SmNiO$_3$ formal charges. We also find zero critical thickness for the ferroelectricity in BaTiO$_3$ in this orientation. The opposite polarization direction is highly disfavored for thin BaTiO$_3$ slabs but becomes less unstable with increasing slab thickness. We construct a simple electrostatic model that allows us both to study the behavior for thicker BaTiO$_3$ and SmNiO$_3$ slabs and to extract the influence of various material parameters on the behavior. We mimic a metal-insulator transition in the SmNiO$_3$ by varying the metallic screening length, which we find greatly influences the stability of the ferroelectric polarization. Our results show that the layer charges in the metal electrodes strongly influence the properties in ferroelectric capacitors and in fact can provide new ways to control the ferroelectric properties.</description>

      <title>Material-realistic modelling of quantum many-body effects in a monolayer TMDC nanolaser device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient light-matter interaction in combination with the small volume occupied by monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) makes this material class a notable option as gain layer in future opto-electronic devices. Many-body effects of excited carriers influence the emission dynamics due to the introduction of optical non-linearities following excitation, but the exact mechanisms remain unexamined from a theoretical point of view. In this paper, we present a material-realistic microscopic theory of a device based on an MoS2-monolayer, which demonstrates stimulated emission activity at room temperature. The modelling procedure combines Coulomb and light-matter interaction matrix elements with doublet-level Quantum Laser Equations (QLEs). These give access to the dynamics of the photon-assisted polarisation, populations, and photon number while allowing the solution of a multi-scale problem ranging from femto- to nanoseconds.

      <title>Best Practices for Fitting Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Molten Salts: A Case Study Using NaCl-MgCl2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we developed a compositionally transferable machine learning interatomic potential using atomic cluster expansion potential and PBE-D3 method for (NaCl)1-x(MgCl2)x molten salt and we showed that it is possible to fit a robust potential for this pseudo-binary system by only including data from x={0, 1/3, 2/3, 1}. We also assessed the performance of several DFT methods including PBE-D3, PBE-D4, R2SCAN-D4, and R2SCAN-rVV10 on unary NaCl and MgCl2 salts. Our results show that the R2SCAN-D4 method calculates the thermophysical properties of NaCl and MgCl2 with an overall modestly better accuracy compared to the other three methods.</description>

      <title>Interionic distance distributions between $Er^{3+}$ and $Yb^{3+}$ as dopants in some crystal matrix hosts used for upconversion luminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The upconversion process for the $Er^{3+}$ ion, when irradiated with IR photons at 980 nm, strongly depends upon the presence of the sensitizer $Yb^{3+}$ ions. There is a good correlation between the relative and absolute concentrations of the activator and sensitizer species and the intensities of the emission lines of the resulted visible spectrum. The ratios between emission intensities in the green band (510-580 nm) and red band (640-700 nm) (i.e., the spectral content) show similarities between different host crystals in which $Er^{3+}$ and $Yb^{3+}$ are embedded, which is an indication that, regardless of the crystalline medium of embedding, the dopant ions interact in some specific and similar ways. In order to reveal the mechanisms for the energy transfer between activator and sensitizer ions, one needs a model for the spatial distribution of these relative to one another, from which some statistical data, like crystal matrix average surrounding radii, could be inferred. Some models of cubic neighboring are presented for the relative concentration ratios of $Er^{3+}:Yb^{3+}$, respectively of 1:2, 1:4, and 1:8.</description>

      <title>Competing Ordinary and Hanle Magnetoresistance in Pt and Ti Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key elements in spintronics research is the spin Hall effect, allowing to generate spin currents from charge currents. A large spin Hall effect is observed in materials with strong spin orbit coupling, e.g., Pt. Recent research suggests the existence of an orbital Hall effect, the orbital analogue to the spin Hall effect, which also arises in weakly spin orbit coupled materials like Ti, Mn or Cr. In Pt both effects are predicted to coexist. In any of these materials, a magnetic field perpendicular to the spin or orbital accumulation leads to additional Hanle dephasing and thereby the Hanle magnetoresistance (MR). To reveal the MR behavior of a material with both spin and orbital Hall effect, we thus study the MR of Pt thin films over a wide range of thicknesses. Careful evaluation shows that the MR of our textured samples is dominated by the ordinary MR rather than by the Hanle effect. We analyze the intrinsic properties of Pt films deposited by different groups and show that next to the resistivity also the structural properties of the film influence which MR dominates. We further show that this correlation can be found in both spin Hall active materials like Pt and orbital Hall active materials, like Ti. For both materials, the crystalline samples shows a MR attributed to the ordinary MR, whereas we find a large Hanle MR for the samples without apparent structural order. We then provide a set of rules to distinguish between the ordinary and the Hanle MR. We conclude that in all materials with a spin or orbital Hall effect the Hanle MR and the ordinary MR coexist and the purity and crystallinity of the thin film determine the dominating effect.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics simulations of interaction between a super edge dislocation and interstitial dislocation loops in irradiated L12-Ni3Al</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study employed MD simulations to investigate the interactions between a &lt;110&gt; super-edge dislocation, consisting of the four Shockley partials, and interstitial dislocation loops (IDLs) in irradiated L12-Ni3Al. Accounting for symmetry breakage in the L12 lattice, the superlattice planar faults with four distinct fault vectors have been considered for different IDL configurations. The detailed dislocation reactions and structural evolution events were identified as the four partials interacted with various IDL configurations. The slipping characteristics of Shockley partials within the IDLs and the resultant shearing and looping mechanisms were also clarified, revealing distinct energetic transition states determined by the fault vectors after the Shockley partials sweeping the IDL. Furthermore, significant variations in critical resolved shear stress (CRSS) required for the super-edge dislocation to move past the IDL were observed, attributed to various sizes and faulted vectors of enclosed superlattice planar faults in the IDLs. The current study extends the existing dislocation-IDL interaction theory from pristine FCC to L12 lattice, advances the understanding of irradiation hardening effects in L12-Ni3Al, and suggests potential applicability to other L12 systems.</description>

      <title>Detecting axion dynamics on the surface of magnetic topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axions, initially proposed to solve the strong CP problem, have recently gained attention in condensed matter physics, particularly in topological insulators. However, detecting axion dynamics has proven challenging, with no experimental confirmations to date. In this study, we identify the surface of magnetic topological insulators as an ideal platform for observing axion dynamics. The vanishing bulk gap at the surface allows for order $O(1)$ variations in the axion field, making the detection of axion-like phenomena more feasible. In contrast, these phenomena are strongly suppressed in the bulk due to the small magnetic exchange gap. We investigate two-photon decay as a signature of axion dynamics and calculate the branching ratio using a perturbative approach. Our findings reveal that the photon flux emitted from the surface is in-plane and orders of magnitude larger than that from the bulk, making it detectable with modern microwave technology. We also discuss potential material platforms for detecting axion two-photon decay and strategies to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>LiV2O4: Hund-Assisted Orbital-Selective Mottness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the remarkably small Fermi-liquid coherence scale and large effective mass observed in LiV$_2$O$_4$ are due to the proximity of a Hund-assisted orbital-selective Mott state. Our work is based on an ab initio dynamical mean-field approach, combining several quantum impurity solvers to capture the physics from high to very low temperature. We find that the Hund coupling plays a crucial role in rearranging the orbital populations and in generating the heavy mass and low coherence scale. The latter is found to be approximately 1-2 Kelvin, even though the most correlated orbital is found to be significantly doped ~10% away from half-filling. A flat quasiparticle band appears near the Fermi level as a result of the strong electronic correlations. Finally, we discuss our results in comparison to experiments.</description>

      <title>Universality of Dynamic and Thermodynamic Behavior of Polymers near their Glass Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Describing the dynamics and thermodynamics of amorphous materials near the glass transition is a major challenge in soft-matter physics and polymer engineering. The relaxation time changes many orders of magnitude as the temperature approaches the glass transition, Tg. The glass transition, in turn, depends on the cooling rate (in DSC or dilatometry experiments) and the pressure. While there are several empirical rules relating the thermal expansion, density, relaxation time, temperature, and pressure (Boyer-Spencer, Simha-Boyer, and the Casalini-Roland thermodynamical scaling), there has been no unified theoretical model linking them together. Here, we apply the principle of corresponding states within the dynamic Sanchez-Lacombe two-state, two-(time)scale (SL-TS2) theory to derive a universal polymer equation of state (EoS). The proposed EoS describes the alpha-relaxation time (dynamic EoS) and specific volume of amorphous polymers (volume EoS) using five material parameters - dynamic fragility (m), glass transition temperature, elementary relaxation time, bulk modulus, and specific volume at the glass transition point. The model is compared to experimental data for nine amorphous polymers with varying values of Tg and m, and a good qualitative and quantitative agreement is found. The new EoS could serve as a bridge to connect experimental data (measured at low cooling rates) with computer simulations (done at very high cooling rates).</description>

      <title>Machine learning analysis of structural data to predict electronic properties in near-surface InAs quantum wells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semiconductor crosshatch patterns in thin film heterostructures form as a result of strain relaxation processes and dislocation pile-ups during growth of lattice mismatched materials. Due to their connection with the internal misfit dislocation network, these crosshatch patterns are a complex fingerprint of internal strain relaxation and growth anisotropy. Therefore, this mesoscopic fingerprint not only describes the residual strain state of a near-surface quantum well, but also could provide an indicator of the quality of electron transport through the material. Here, we present a method utilizing computer vision and machine learning to analyze AFM crosshatch patterns that exhibits this correlation. Our analysis reveals optimized electron transport for moderate values of $\lambda$ (crosshatch wavelength) and $\epsilon$ (crosshatch height), roughly 1 $\mu$m and 4 nm, respectively, that define the average waveform of the pattern. Simulated 2D AFM crosshatch patterns are used to train a machine learning model to correlate the crosshatch patterns to dislocation density. Furthermore, this model is used to evaluate the experimental AFM images and predict a dislocation density based on the crosshatch waveform. Predicted dislocation density, experimental AFM crosshatch data, and experimental transport characterization are used to train a final model to predict 2D electron gas mean free path. This model shows electron scattering is strongly correlated with elastic effects (e.g. dislocation scattering) below 200 nm $\lambda_{MFP}$.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure, spin-orbit interaction and electron-phonon coupling of triangular adatom lattices on semiconductor substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A one-third monolayer of the heavy metals Sn and Pb deposited on semiconductor substrates can lead to a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ surface reconstruction, constituting an exciting triangular lattice material platform. A long history of experiments identified charge-ordered and magnetic ground states. These discoveries were accompanied by a decades-long debate of whether electron correlations or other effects involving phonons are the driving force of the symmetry-broken states. The most recent discovery of superconductivity in boron-doped Sn/Si(111) with a $T_c$ between 5K and 9K led to a renewed excitement. Here we revisit the electronic and phononic properties of Sn and Pb adatom triangular lattices on Si(111) and SiC(0001). For all materials we compute relativistic bandstructures using DFT+$U$ where $U$ is only applied to the substrate atoms in order to adjust the band gap to match the experimental value; as a consequence, some of the resulting tight-binding parameters of the metallic surface band differ substantially compared to previous studies. Remarkably, for Pb/SiC(0001) we predict Rashba spin-orbit coupling as large as 45% of the nearest-neighbor hopping energy. In addition, we compute the phonon spectra and electron-phonon coupling constants for all materials, and for Pb/Si(111) even relativistically although the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling has surprisingly little effect on the electron-phonon coupling constant. We conclude that the resulting couplings are too weak to account for electron-phonon mediated superconductivity in any of these materials.</description>

      <title>Observation of Transient Trion Induced by Ultrafast Charge Transfer in Graphene/MoS2 Heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (Vdw) heterostructures constructed from TMDCs provide an ideal platform for exploring various quasiparticle behaviors, with trion-composed of neutral exciton and charged carrier-being a notable example. There are typically three methods to generate trion: electrical doping, chemical doping, and direct optical doping. The first two methods generate static trion, while the last gives rise to transient trion. Here, we present an indirect optical doping approach to generate transient trion via ultrafast charge transfer (CT) and achieve control over the trion-to-exciton ratio by adjusting CT in Gr/MoS2 heterostructure. Furthermore, we demonstrated that dynamics of the transient trion generated with this method, which shows slightly longer lifetime than that of exciton accounted for the Coulomb interactions between trion and charged defect. This study provides fresh perspectives on the construction of new quasiparticles, dynamical characterization and the control of the many-body interaction in two-dimensional structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the magnetic ground state and properties of a frustrated two-dimensional classical Heisenberg model of interacting hexagonal clusters of spins. The energy of the ground states is found exactly for arbitrary values of $J_1$ (intra-cluster couplings) and $J_2$ (inter-cluster couplings). Our main results concern a frustrated region of the phase diagram, where we show that the set of ground states has a degeneracy larger than that due to global rotation symmetry. Furthermore, the ground state manifold does not have a fixed total magnetization~: there is a range of allowed values. At finite temperature, our Monte-Carlo simulations show that the entropy selects the most probable value of the total magnetization, while the histogram of the Monte-Carlo time series is non-trivial. This model is a first step towards modelling properties of a class of frustrated magnetic structures composed of coupled spin clusters.</description>

Abstract: Identifying ordered structures hidden in the packings of particles is a common scientific question in multiple fields. In this work, we investigate the dynamical organizations of a large number of initially randomly packed repulsive particles confined on a disk under the Hamiltonian dynamics by the recently developed algorithm called the random batch method. This algorithm is specifically designed for reducing the computational complexity of long-range interacting particle systems. We highlight the revealed intrinsic statistical regularity of topological charges that is otherwise unattainable by the continuum analysis of particle density. We also identify distinct collective dynamics of the interacting particles under short- and long-range repulsive forces. This work shows the robustness and effectiveness of the concept of topological charge for characterizing the convoluted particle dynamics, and demonstrates the promising potential of the random batch method for exploring fundamental scientific questions arising in a variety of long-range interacting particle systems in soft matter physics and other relevant fields.</description>

Abstract: Fe-based shape memory alloys (Fe-SMAs) belong to smart metallic materials that can memorize or restore their preset shape after experiencing a substantial amount of deformation under heat, stress, or magnetic stimuli. Fe-SMAs have remarkable thermomechanical properties and have attracted significant interest because of their potential merits, such as cost-effective alloying elements, superior workability, weldability, a stable superelastic response, and low-temperature dependence of critical stress required for stress-induced martensitic transformation. Therefore, Fe-SMAs can be an intriguing and economical alternative to other SMAs. The recent advancements in fabrication methods of conventional metals and SMAs are helping the production of customized powder composition and then customized geometries by additive manufacturing (AM). The technology in these areas, i.e., fabrication techniques, experimental characterization, and theoretical formulations of Fe-SMAs for conventional and AM has been rapidly advancing and is lacking a comprehensive review. This paper provides a critical review of the recent developments in Fe-SMAs-related research. The conventional and AM-based methods of producing Fe-SMAs are discussed, and a detailed review of the current research trends on Fe-SMAs including 4-D printing of Fe-SMAs are comprehensively documented. The presented review provides a comprehensive review of experimental methods and processes used to determine the material characteristics and features of Fe-SMAs. In addition, the work provides a review of the reported computational modeling of Fe-SMAs to help design new Fe-SMA composition and geometry. Finally, different Fe-SMAs-based applications such as sensing and damping systems, tube coupling, and reinforced concrete are also discussed.</description>

Abstract: Below its Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T_\mathrm{JT}$, NaNiO$_2$ has a monoclinic layered structure consisting of alternating layers of edge-sharing NaO$_6$ and Jahn-Teller-distorted NiO$_6$ octahedra. Above $T_\mathrm{JT}$ where NaNiO$_2$ is rhombohedral, diffraction measurements show the absence of a cooperative Jahn-Teller distortion, accompanied by an increase in the unit cell volume. Using neutron total scattering, solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) experiments as local probes of the structure we find direct evidence for a displacive, as opposed to order-disorder Jahn-Teller transition at $T_\mathrm{JT}$. This is supported by \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. To our knowledge this study is the first to show a displacive Jahn-Teller transition in any material using direct observations with local probe techniques.</description>

      <title>Emergent Multifunctionality in Two-Dimensional Janus VSBrI Monolayer: A Study of Multiferroicity, Magnetoelectricity, and Piezoelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02407v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Janus VSBrI monolayer, identified by first-principles calculations, emerges as a promising semiconducting material with desirable ferromagnetic and ferroelectric properties. It's in-plane magnetic anisotropic energy is up to 460 $\mu$eV/V , and in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric strain coefficients are larger than many other known two-dimensional materials. The energy variations among different magnetic states show a strong correlate with polarization. Interestingly, the stability of the ferroelectric phase can be further enhanced by the application of biaxial tensile strain. These intriguing properties make the Janus VSBrI monolayer highly desirable for practical applications in piezoelectronic devices, and a promising candidate for multifunctional spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy, Crystal-Field, and Transition Intensity Analyses of the C$_{\rm 3v}$(O$^{2-}$) Centre in Er$^{3+}$ Doped CaF$_{2}$ Crystals</title>

Abstract: Erbium ions in crystals show considerable promise for the technologies that will form the backbone of future networked quantum information technology. Despite advances in leveraging erbium's fibre-compatible infrared transition for classical and quantum applications, the transitions are, in general, not well understood. We present detailed absorption and laser site-selective spectroscopy of the C$_{\rm 3v}$(O$^{2-}$) centre in CaF$_2$:Er$^{3+}$ as an interesting erbium site case study. The $^{4}$I$_{15/2}$Z$_1 \rightarrow {^{4}}$I$_{13/2}$Y$_1$ transition has a low-temperature inhomogeneous linewidth of 1 GHz with hyperfine structure observable from the $^{167}$Er isotope. A parametrized crystal-field Hamiltonian is fitted to 34 energy levels and the two ground state magnetic splitting factors. The wavefunctions are used to perform a transition intensity analysis and electric-dipole parameters are fitted to absorption oscillator strengths. Simulated spectra for the $^{4}$I$_{11/2}\rightarrow {^{4}}$I$_{15/2}$ and $^{4}$I$_{13/2} \rightarrow {^{4}}$I$_{15/2}$ inter-multiplet transitions are in excellent agreement with the experimentally measured spectra. The $^{4}$I$_{13/2}$ excited state lifetime is 25.0\,ms and the intensity calculation is in excellent agreement with this value.</description>

      <title>Laser Site-Selective Spectroscopy and Magnetic Hyperfine Splittings of Ho$^{3+}$ doped Y$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser site-selective spectroscopy and high-resolution absorption measurements have been used to determine 51 crystal-field energy levels for one of the Ho$^{3+}$ centres in Y$_{2}$SiO$_{5}$. This centre is denoted as Site 2 and has been tentatively assigned as the seven-fold coordinated centre. High resolution absorption measurements reveal complex hyperfine patterns that obey and approximate selection rule. The application of a magnetic field along the three optical axes reveals the presence of avoided crossings below 0.5 Tesla, in both the ground and excited states.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy and Crystal-Field Analysis of Low -Symmetry Er$^{3+}$ Centres in K$_2$YF$_5$ Microparticles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: K$_2$YF$_5$ crystals doped with lanthanide ions have a variety of possible optical applications. Owing to the low symmetry of the system, the crystal structure cannot be unambiguously determined by x-ray diffraction. However, electron-paramagnetic resonance studies have demonstrated that lanthanide ions substitute for yttrium in sites of C$_{\rm s}$ local symmetry. In this work, we use high-resolution absorption and laser spectroscopy to determine electronic energy levels for Er$^{3+}$ ions in K$_2$YF$_5$ microparticles. A total of 39 crystal-field energy levels, distributed among 7 multiplets of the Er$^{3+}$ ion, have been assigned. This optical data is used for crystal-field modelling of the electronic structure of Er$^{3+}$ in K$_2$YF$_5$. Our model is fitted not only to the electronic energy levels, but also to the ground-state g-tensor. This magnetic-splitting data defines the axis system of the calculation, avoiding ambiguities associated with low-symmetry crystal-field fits.</description>

      <title>Leveraging both faces of polar semiconductor wafers for functional devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unlike non-polar semiconductors such as silicon, the broken inversion symmetry of the wide bandgap semiconductor gallium nitride leads to a large electronic polarization along a unique crystal axis. This makes the two surfaces of the semiconductor wafer perpendicular to the polar axis dramatically different in their physical and chemical properties. In the last three decades, the cation (gallium) face of gallium nitride has been used for photonic devices such as LEDs and lasers. Though the cation face has also been predominantly used for electronic devices, the anion (nitrogen) face has recently shown promise for high electron mobility transistors due to favorable polarization discontinuities. In this work we introduce dualtronics, showing that it is possible to make photonic devices on the cation face, and electronic devices on the anion face, of the same semiconductor wafer. This opens the possibility for leveraging both faces of polar semiconductors in a single structure, where electronic, photonic, and acoustic properties can be implemented on opposite faces of the same wafer, dramatically enhancing the functional capabilities of this revolutionary semiconductor family.</description>

      <title>Laser Printing of Silver and Silver Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09340v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that direct laser writing (DLW) in aqueous silver nitrate with a 1030 nm femtosecond (fs) laser results in deposition of a mixture of silver oxide and silver, in contrast to the pure silver deposition previously reported with 780 nm fs DLW. However, adding photoinitiator prevents silver oxide formation in a concentration-dependent manner. As a result, the resistivity of the material can also be controlled by photoinitiator concentration with resistivity being reduced from approximately 9e-3 $\Omega m$ to 3e-7 $\Omega m$. Silver oxide peaks dominate the X-ray diffraction spectra when no photoinitiator is present, while the peaks disappear with photoinitiator concentrations above 0.05wt%. While femtosecond pulses are needed to initiate deposition, a continues-wave laser when well overlapped with the previously written material and supplying enough average power can lead to further printing, suggesting thermal deposition can also occur where the photoinitiator molecule also acts as a general reducing agent that prevents oxide formation. We also compare the surface quality of printed lines for different photoinitiator concentrations and laser printing conditions. A THz polarizer and metamaterial are printed as a demonstration of silver oxide printing.</description>

Abstract: A previously unexplained background called the Low Energy Excess (LEE) has negatively impacted the reach of a variety of low threshold calorimeters including light dark matter direct detection and coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering experiments. The relaxation of stressed aluminium films as mediated by the motion of dislocations may account for these observations.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Response Theory with Relativistic Corrections: Selfconsistency and Validity of Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger-Pauli equation (SP-eq) derived from weakly relativistic approximation (WRA) of Dirac eq, combined with Electromagnetic (EM) field Lagrangian for variational principle, is expected to give a new level of EM response theory. A complete process of this formulation within the second order WRA is given, with explicit forms of charge and current densities, $\rho , \vec{J}$, and electric and magnetic polarizations, $\vec{P}$, $\vec{M}$ containing correction terms. They fulfill, not only the continuity equation, but also the relations $\nabla \cdot \vec{P}=-\rho, \ \partial \vec{P}/\partial t + c \nabla \times \vec{M} = \vec{J}$, known in the classical EM theory for the corresponding macroscopic variables. This theory should be able to describe all the EM responses within the second order WRA, and the least necessary variables are ${\phi, \vec{A}, \rho, \vec{J}}$ (six independent components). From this viewpoint, there emerges a problem about the use of "spin current" popularly discussed in spintronics, because it does not belong to the group of least necessary variables.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic QED and noise currents in time-varying media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Macroscopic QED (MQED) is the field theory for computing quantum electromagnetic effects in dispersive media. Here we extend MQD to treat time-varying, dispersive media. For a time dependent Drude model, we find that the expected replacement ${\epsilon}({\omega}) {\to} {\epsilon}(t,{\omega})$ within standard MQED leads to nonphysical polarization currents, becoming singular in the limit of a step change in the carrier density. We show this singular behaviour can be removed through modifying the reservoir dynamics, quantizing the resulting theory and finding the non-equilibrium, time-varying noise currents, which exhibit extra correlations due to temporal reflections within the material dynamics.</description>

      <title>A multi-scale probabilistic methodology to predict high-cycle fatigue lifetime for alloys with process-induced pores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A multi-scale methodology is developed in conjunction with a probabilistic fatigue lifetime model for structures with pores whose exact distribution, i.e. geometries and locations, is unknown. The method takes into account uncertainty in fatigue lifetimes in structures due to defects at two scales: micro-scale heterogeneity &amp; meso-scale pores. An element-wise probabilistic strain-life model with its criterion modified for taking into account multiaxial loading is developed for taking into account the effect of micro-scale defects on the lifetime. Meso-scale pores in the structure are taken into account via statistical modelling of the expected pore populations via a finite element method, based on tomographic scans of a small region of porous material used to make the structure. A previously implemented Neuber-type plastic correction algorithm is used for fast full-field approximation of the strain-life criterion around the statistically generated pore fields. The probability of failure of a porous structure is obtained via a weakest link assumption at the level of its constituent finite elements. The fatigue model can be identified via a maximum likelihood estimate on experimental fatigue data of structures containing different types of pore populations. The proposed method is tested on an existing high-cycle fatigue data-set of an aluminium alloy with two levels of porosity. The model requires lesser data for identification than traditional models that consider porous media as a homogeneous material, as the same base material is considered for the two grades of porous material. Numerical studies on synthetically generated data show that the method is capable of taking into account the statistical size effect in fatigue, and demonstrate that fatigue properties of subsurface porous material are lower than that of core porous material, which makes homogenisation of the method non-trivial.</description>
