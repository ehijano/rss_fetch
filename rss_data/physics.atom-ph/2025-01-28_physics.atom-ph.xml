      <title>Comment on "Revisiting the divergent multipole expansion of atom-surface interactions: Hydrogen and positronium, $\alpha$-quartz, and physisorption" (arXiv:2308.04656v3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently U. D. Jentschura [Phys. Rev. A $\bf 109$, 012802 (2024)] rederived the multipole corrections to the dipole part of the atom-wall interaction described by the Lifshitz theory using the concept of volume dielectric permittivity. These corrections were computed for the hydrogen and positronium atoms in close proximity to the $\alpha$-quartz wall and claimed to be numerically significant within the short-range regime. Here, it is shown that the application areas of the obtained expressions both in the short-and long-range asymptotic regimes are indicated incorrectly, in contradiction with those dictated by the Lifshitz theory. As a result, within the valid application areas, all multipole corrections to the Casimir-Polder dipole part of the atom-wall interaction turned out to be negligibly small.</description>

      <title>Optical clock based on two-photon spectroscopy of the nuclear transition in ion 229Th in a monochromatic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the isotope $^{229}$Th we investigate the possibility of two-photon laser spectroscopy of the nuclear clock transition (148.38 nm) using intense monochromatic laser field at twice the wavelength (296.76 nm). Our estimates show that due to the electron bridge process in the doubly ionized ion $^{229}$Th$^{2+}$ the sufficient intensity of a continuous laser field is about 10-100\,kW/cm$^2$, which is within the reach of modern laser systems. This unique possibility is an result of the presence in the electronic spectrum of the ion $^{229}$Th$^{2+}$ of an exceptionally close intermediate (for the two-photon transition) energy level, forming a strong dipole ($E1$) transition with the ground state at the wavelength of 297.86~nm, which differs from the probe field wavelength (296.76 nm) by only 1.1 nm. The obtained results can be used for the practical creation of ultra-precise nuclear optical clocks based on thorium-229 ions. In addition, we develop an alternative approach to the description of the electron bridge phenomenon in an isolated ion (atom) using the hyperfine interaction operator, that is important for the general quantum theory of an atom. In particular, this approach shows that the contribution to the electron bridge from the nuclear quadrupole moment can be comparable to the contribution from the nuclear magnetic moment.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine structure and collisions in three-photon Rydberg electromagnetically induced transparency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-photon electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) of atomic vapors involves several intermediate atomic levels. The sub-structure of these levels and their collisional interactions can drastically alter experimental EIT signals. Here, we report on hyperfine structure and collision effects in three-photon Rydberg EIT on the cascade $5S_{1/2} \rightarrow$ $5P_{1/2} \rightarrow 5D_{3/2}$ $\rightarrow 25F_{5/2}$ in a room temperature $^{85}$Rb vapor cell. In our measurements of EIT spectra, we identify two types of EIT signatures that correspond with distinct excitation pathways and atomic velocity classes in the atomic vapor. The $5D_{3/2}$ hyperfine structure and Autler-Townes splittings lead to complex patterns in the EIT spectra, which we analyze with the aid of 10-level EIT simulations. Adding 50~mTorr of Ar gas alters the EIT spectra and induces an additional, third EIT mode. Based on our simulation results, we attribute these changes to hyperfine collisions in the Rb $5D_{3/2}$ level. Our study may become useful in quantum technologies involving Rydberg EIT and hyperfine collisions in vapor cells, including non-invasive spatio-temporally resolved electric-field sensing of electric fields in low-pressure plasmas.</description>

      <title>Laser cooled 137BaF molecules for measuring nuclear-spin-dependent parity violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate optical cycling and transverse laser cooling of a beam of fermionic 137BaF molecules. Their high masses and nuclear spins make these molecules sensitive probes for parity violation and properties of the weak interaction. However, the nuclear spins also lead to a quasi-closed cycling transition currently involving up to 112 levels, which significantly exceeds the complexity in other laser-cooled molecules. Optical cycling and cooling are facilitated through carefully designed optical spectra tailored to this molecular structure. Our results pave the way for efficient state preparation, detection, and cooling in precision measurements using this species and other similar species.</description>

      <title>Molecular dynamics with time dependent quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we propose an ab initio method to solve quantum many-body problems of molecular dynamics where both the electronic and the nuclear degrees are represented by ensembles of trajectories and guiding waves in physical space. Both electrons and nuclei can be treated quantum mechanically where the guiding waves obey a set of coupled Schrodinger equations (quantum-quantum description) or, alternatively, coupled Schroedinger-Newtonian equations are solved for the quantum-classical approximation. The method takes into account local and non-local quantum correlation effects in a self consistent manner. The general formalism is applied to one- and two-dimensional hydrogen molecule subjected to a strong ultashort optical pulse. Comparison is made with the results from the 'exact' Ehrenfest molecular dynamics for the molecular ionization and for the evolution of the inter-nuclear distance as the molecule dissociates.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-time-scaling quantum dynamics with time-dependent quantum Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we study the dynamics of many-body quantum systems using time dependent quantum Monte Carlo method where the evolution is described by ensembles of particles and guide waves. The exponential-time scaling inherent to the quantum many-body problem is reduced to polynomial-time computation by solving concurrently a set of coupled Schroedinger equations for the guide waves in physical space and a set first order equations for the Monte Carlo walkers. We use effective potentials to accounts for the local and nonlocal quantum correlations in time-varying fields, where for fermionic states an exchange 'hole' is introduced explicitly through screened Coulomb potentials. The walker distributions for the ground states of para- and ortho-helium reproduce well the statistical properties, such as the electron-pair density function, of the real atoms. Our predictions for the dipole response and the ionization of an atom exposed to strong ultrashort optical pulse are in good agreement with the exact results.</description>

      <title>Velocity-comb modulation transfer spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sub-Doppler laser spectroscopy is a crucial technique for laser frequency stabilization, playing a significant role in atomic physics, precision measurement, and quantum communication. However, recent efforts to improve frequency stability appear to have reached a bottleneck, as they primarily focus on external technical approaches while neglecting the fundamental issue of low atomic utilization (&lt; 1%), caused by only near-zero transverse velocity atoms involved in the transition. Here, we propose a velocity-comb modulation transfer spectroscopy (MTS) solution that takes advantage of the velocity-selective resonance effect of multi-frequency comb lasers to enhance the utilization of non-zero-velocity atoms. In the probe-pump configuration, each pair of counter-propagating lasers interacts with atoms from different transverse velocity-comb groups, independently contributing to the spectral amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio. Preliminary proof-of-principle results show that the frequency stability of the triple-frequency laser is optimized by nearly a factor of \sqrt{3} compared to the single-frequency laser, consistent with theoretical expectations. With more frequency comb components, MTS-stabilized lasers are expected to achieve order-of-magnitude breakthroughs in frequency stability, taking an important step toward next-generation compact optical clocks. This unique method can also be widely applied to any quantum system with a wide velocity distribution, inspiring innovative advances in numerous fields with a fresh perspective.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Effects in Thin Dielectric Layers: Long-Range Dicke Superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization and control of collective effects in quantum emitter ensembles have predominantly focused on small, ordered systems, leaving their extension to larger, more complex configurations as a significant challenge. Quantum photonic platforms, with their engineered Green's functions and integration of advanced solid-state quantum emitters, provide opportunities to explore new regimes of light-matter interaction beyond the scope of atomic systems. In this study, we examine the interaction of quantum emitters embedded within a thin dielectric layer. Our results reveal that the guided optical modes of the dielectric layer mediate extended-range interactions between emitters, enabling both total and directional superradiance in arrays spanning several wavelengths. Additionally, the extended interaction range facilitated by the dielectric layer supports Dicke superradiance in regimes where collective effects cannot be obtained in a homogeneous environment. This work uncovers a distinctive interplay between environmental dimensionality and collective quantum dynamics, paving the way for exploring novel many-body quantum optical phenomena in engineered photonic environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali (ADD) model with n extra compactified dimensions, the gravitational potential scales as 1/r^{n+1} and becomes significantly stronger at short distances. We investigate the possibility of forming small-sized composite systems of Standard Model particles bound by this potential. Such bound states, composed of quarks, neutrinos, axions, or other particles, exhibit a small cross-section-to-mass ratio, making them viable candidates for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Gauge Field for Ultracold Atoms Induced by Vector Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector beams (VBs) with spatially varying polarization have broad applications across various fields of optics. We introduce a novel use of VBs to generate synthetic gauge fields for ultracold atoms. By leveraging VBs' rich tunability, this scheme enables the emergence of angular stripe phases over a significantly expanded parameter range, achieving a three-orders-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and thereby making experimental observation feasible. It also allows for the creation of topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology controlled by VB parameters and without requiring rotation. Our work opens new avenues for utilizing VBs in quantum control of ultracold atoms and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Quantum Many-body Chaos in Non-Hermitian Quantum Spin Chain via Krylov Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phase transitions from chaotic to non-chaotic dynamics in a quantum spin chain with a local non-Hermitian disorder, which can be realized with a Rydberg atom array setting. As the disorder strength increases, the emergence of non-chaotic dynamics is qualitatively captured through the suppressed growth of Krylov complexity, and quantitatively identified through the reciprocity breaking of Krylov space. We further find that the localization in Krylov space generates another transition in the weak disorder regime, suggesting a weak ergodicity breaking. Our results closely align with conventional methods, such as the entanglement entropy and complex level spacing statistics, and pave the way to explore non-Hermitian phase transitions using Krylov complexity and associated metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that matter-wave diffraction off a single standing laser wave can be used as an accurate measurement scheme for photophysical molecular parameters. These include state-dependent optical polarizabilities and photon-absorption cross sections, the relaxation rates for fluorescence, internal conversion, and intersystem crossing, as well as ionization or cleavage probabilities. We discuss how the different photophysical processes manifest as features of the interference pattern, and we determine the accuracy of molecular parameters estimated from a realistic measurement with finite particle numbers. The analysis is based on an analytic calculation in Wigner representation, which accounts for the laser-induced coherent and incoherent dynamics, for the finite longitudinal and transverse coherence in the matter-wave beam, the gravitational and Coriolis acceleration, and an imperfect standing laser wave.</description>

      <title>Role of intermediate resonances in attosecond photoelectron interferometry in neon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond photoelectron interferometry based on the combination of an attosecond pulse train and a synchronized infrared field is a fundamental technique for the temporal characterization of attosecond waveforms and for the investigation of electron dynamics in the photoionization process. In this approach, the comb of extreme ultraviolet harmonics typically lies above the ionization threshold of the target under investigation, thus releasing a photoelectron by single-photon absorption. The interaction of the outgoing photoelectron with the infrared pulse results in the absorption or emission of infrared photons, thereby creating additional peaks in the photoelectron spectrum, referred to as sidebands. While, in the absence of resonances in the first ionization step, the phases imparted on the photoionization process evolve smoothly with the photon energy, the presence of intermediate resonances imprints a large additional phase on the outgoing photoelectron wave packet. In this work, using a comb of harmonics below and above the ionization threshold of neon, we investigate the effect of intermediate bound excited states on attosecond photoelectron interferometry. We show that the phase of the oscillations of the sidebands and their angular distributions are strongly affected by such resonances. By slightly tuning the photon energies of the extreme ultraviolet harmonics, we show how the contributions of selected resonances can be enhanced or suppressed.</description>

Abstract: An enhanced mechanism is proposed for the large-amplitude-motion-induced parity-violating frequency by integrating the exact quantum dynamics method with the relativistic electronic structure theory. The torsional wavefunctions and PV frequency shifts are obtained by the exact quantum dynamics method. The potential energy curve and PV energy along the torsional coordinates are calculated using the extended atomic mean-field two-component Hamiltonian. The predicted PV frequency shift for the torsional transition of CFClBrOH is approximately 100 times larger than that of the conventional C-F stretching mode of CHFClBr. The maximum PV frequency shift (3.1 Hz) is obtained in the CHBrIOH molecule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.13293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum rotor is one of the simplest model systems in quantum mechanics, but only in recent years has theoretical work revealed general fundamental scaling laws for its decoherence. For example, a superposition of orientations decoheres at a rate proportional to the sine squared of the angle between them. Here we observe scaling laws for rotational decoherence dynamics for the first time, using a 4-micrometer diameter planar rotor composed of two Paul-trapped ions. We prepare the rotational motion of the ion crystal into superpositions of angular momentum with well-defined differences ranging from 1-3 $\hbar$, and measure the rate of decoherence. We also tune the system-environment interaction strength by introducing resonant electric field noise. The observed scaling relationships for decoherence are in excellent agreement with recent theoretical work, and are directly relevant to the growing development of rotor-based quantum applications.</description>

      <title>Production and Loss Processes of Hydrogen Energetic Neutral Atoms in the Heliosphere from 5 eV to 500 keV</title>

Abstract: Energetic Neutral Atom (ENA) observations provide valuable insights into the plasma conditions in the heliosphere and the surrounding interstellar medium. Unlike plasma detectors, which measure charged particles tied to the magnetic fields at their location, ENA detectors capture former ions that were neutralized in distant regions and traverse the heliosphere in straight trajectories. ENA fluxes near the Sun represent line-of-sight integrals of parent ion fluxes multiplied by neutralization (production) rates and reduced by the probability of ENA reionization (loss) processes. So far, most ENA analyses have focused on charge exchange between hydrogen atoms and protons as the primary source of ENAs. Here, we examine various ENA production and loss processes throughout the heliosphere in the broad energy range (5 eV to 500 keV) encompassing the next-generation ENA instruments aboard the Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) mission. Our study considers binary collisions involving the most abundant species: protons, electrons, {\alpha}-particles, He+ ions, photons, as well as hydrogen and helium atoms. Our findings indicate that, in addition to ENAs produced by charge exchange of energetic protons with hydrogen atoms, a significant portion of high-energy ENAs originate from the charge exchange with helium atoms. Below 10 keV, the dominant ENA loss processes are charge exchange collisions with protons and photoionization. However, stripping ionization processes, e.g., from collisions with ambient interstellar neutral hydrogen, become the main loss mechanism for higher energies because the charge exchange rate rapidly decreases.</description>

      <title>On-the-Spot Loading of Single-Atom Traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06162</link>

Abstract: Reconfigurable arrays of trapped single atoms are an excellent platform for the simulation of many-body physics and the realisation of high-fidelity quantum gates. The confinement of atoms is often achieved with focussed laser beams acting as optical dipole-force traps that allow for both static and dynamic positioning of atoms. In these traps, light-assisted collisions -- enhancing the two-atom loss rate -- ensure that single atom occupation of traps can be realised. However, the time-averaged probability of trapping a single atom is limited to $0.5$ when loading directly from a surrounding cloud of laser-cooled atoms, preventing deterministic filling of large arrays. In this work, we demonstrate that increasing the depth of a static, optical dipole trap enables the transition from fast loading on a timescale of $2.1\,$s to an extended trap lifetime of $7.9\,$s. This method demonstrates an achievable filling ratio of $(79\pm2)\,\%$ without the need of rearranging atoms to fill vacant traps.</description>
