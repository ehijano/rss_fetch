      <title>ACT: Automated Constraint Targeting for Multi-Objective Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems often must maximize a primary objective while ensuring secondary ones satisfy minimum thresholds, or "guardrails." This is critical for maintaining a consistent user experience and platform ecosystem, but enforcing these guardrails despite orthogonal system changes is challenging and often requires manual hyperparameter tuning. We introduce the Automated Constraint Targeting (ACT) framework, which automatically finds the minimal set of hyperparameter changes needed to satisfy these guardrails. ACT uses an offline pairwise evaluation on unbiased data to find solutions and continuously retrains to adapt to system and user behavior changes. We empirically demonstrate its efficacy and describe its deployment in a large-scale production environment.</description>

      <title>lifeXplore at the Lifelog Search Challenge 2021</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its first iteration in 2018, the Lifelog Search Challenge (LSC) continues to rise in popularity as an interactive lifelog data retrieval competition, co-located at the ACM International Conference on Multimedia Retrieval (ICMR). The goal of this annual live event is to search a large corpus of lifelogging data for specifically announced memories using a purposefully developed tool within a limited amount of time. As long-standing participants, we present our improved lifeXplore - a retrieval system combining chronologic day summary browsing with interactive combinable concept filtering. Compared to previous versions, the tool is improved by incorporating temporal queries, advanced day summary features as well as usability improvements.</description>

      <title>LLMs for estimating positional bias in logged interaction data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender and search systems commonly rely on Learning To Rank models trained on logged user interactions to order items by predicted relevance. However, such interaction data is often subject to position bias, as users are more likely to click on items that appear higher in the ranking, regardless of their actual relevance. As a result, newly trained models may inherit and reinforce the biases of prior ranking models rather than genuinely improving relevance. A standard approach to mitigate position bias is Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS), where the model's loss is weighted by the inverse of a propensity function, an estimate of the probability that an item at a given position is examined. However, accurate propensity estimation is challenging, especially in interfaces with complex non-linear layouts. In this paper, we propose a novel method for estimating position bias using Large Language Models (LLMs) applied to logged user interaction data. This approach offers a cost-effective alternative to online experimentation. Our experiments show that propensities estimated with our LLM-as-a-judge approach are stable across score buckets and reveal the row-column effects of Viator's grid layout that simpler heuristics overlook. An IPS-weighted reranker trained with these propensities matches the production model on standard NDCG@10 while improving weighted NDCG@10 by roughly 2%. We will verify these offline gains in forthcoming live-traffic experiments.</description>

      <title>Efficient Item ID Generation for Large-Scale LLM-based Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating product catalogs and user behavior into LLMs can enhance recommendations with broad world knowledge, but the scale of real-world item catalogs, often containing millions of discrete item identifiers (Item IDs), poses a significant challenge. This contrasts with the smaller, tokenized text vocabularies typically used in LLMs. The predominant view within the LLM-based recommendation literature is that it is infeasible to treat item ids as a first class citizen in the LLM and instead some sort of tokenization of an item into multiple tokens is required. However, this creates a key practical bottleneck in serving these models for real-time low-latency applications.
  Our paper challenges this predominant practice and integrates item ids as first class citizens into the LLM. We provide simple, yet highly effective, novel training and inference modifications that enable single-token representations of items and single-step decoding. Our method shows improvements in recommendation quality (Recall and NDCG) over existing techniques on the Amazon shopping datasets while significantly improving inference efficiency by 5x-14x. Our work offers an efficiency perspective distinct from that of other popular approaches within LLM-based recommendation, potentially inspiring further research and opening up a new direction for integrating IDs into LLMs. Our code is available here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cUMj37rV0Z1bCWMdhQ6i4q4eTRQLURtC</description>

      <title>LLM-based Relevance Assessment for Web-Scale Search Evaluation at Pinterest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relevance evaluation plays a crucial role in personalized search systems to ensure that search results align with a user's queries and intent. While human annotation is the traditional method for relevance evaluation, its high cost and long turnaround time limit its scalability. In this work, we present our approach at Pinterest Search to automate relevance evaluation for online experiments using fine-tuned LLMs. We rigorously validate the alignment between LLM-generated judgments and human annotations, demonstrating that LLMs can provide reliable relevance measurement for experiments while greatly improving the evaluation efficiency. Leveraging LLM-based labeling further unlocks the opportunities to expand the query set, optimize sampling design, and efficiently assess a wider range of search experiences at scale. This approach leads to higher-quality relevance metrics and significantly reduces the Minimum Detectable Effect (MDE) in online experiment measurements.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation to Adversarial Evidence in the Health Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually grounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved evidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can reduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer questions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design introduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce misinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if retrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to promulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG robustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs and ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential for harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of evidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We conduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the type and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and adversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent, neutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents substantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful evidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable insights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting the need for retrieval safeguards. To enable reproducibility and facilitate future research, all experimental results are publicly available in our github repository.

      <title>NER Retriever: Zero-Shot Named Entity Retrieval with Type-Aware Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NER Retriever, a zero-shot retrieval framework for ad-hoc Named Entity Retrieval, a variant of Named Entity Recognition (NER), where the types of interest are not provided in advance, and a user-defined type description is used to retrieve documents mentioning entities of that type. Instead of relying on fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal representations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions and user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We show that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from mid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more effectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these representations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that aligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types. The resulting entity embeddings are compact, type-aware, and well-suited for nearest-neighbor search. Evaluated on three benchmarks, NER Retriever significantly outperforms both lexical and dense sentence-level retrieval baselines. Our findings provide empirical support for representation selection within LLMs and demonstrate a practical solution for scalable, schema-free entity retrieval. The NER Retriever Codebase is publicly available at https://github.com/ShacharOr100/ner_retriever</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-generated health misinformation poses unprecedented threats to patient safety and healthcare system trust globally. This white paper presents an explainable AI framework developed through the EPSRC INDICATE project to combat medical misinformation while enhancing evidence-based healthcare delivery. Our systematic review of 17 studies reveals the urgent need for transparent AI systems in healthcare. The proposed solution demonstrates 95% recall in clinical evidence retrieval and integrates novel trustworthiness classifiers achieving 76% F1 score in detecting biomedical misinformation. Results show that explainable AI can transform traditional 6-month expert review processes into real-time, automated evidence synthesis while maintaining clinical rigor. This approach offers a critical intervention to preserve healthcare integrity in the AI era.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Technical Documents Retrieval for RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Technical-Embeddings, a novel framework designed to optimize semantic retrieval in technical documentation, with applications in both hardware and software development. Our approach addresses the challenges of understanding and retrieving complex technical content by leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). First, we enhance user queries by generating expanded representations that better capture user intent and improve dataset diversity, thereby enriching the fine-tuning process for embedding models. Second, we apply summary extraction techniques to encode essential contextual information, refining the representation of technical documents. To further enhance retrieval performance, we fine-tune a bi-encoder BERT model using soft prompting, incorporating separate learning parameters for queries and document context to capture fine-grained semantic nuances. We evaluate our approach on two public datasets, RAG-EDA and Rust-Docs-QA, demonstrating that Technical-Embeddings significantly outperforms baseline models in both precision and recall. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating query expansion and contextual summarization to enhance information access and comprehension in technical domains. This work advances the state of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering new avenues for efficient and accurate technical document retrieval in engineering and product development workflows.</description>

      <title>Temporal Interest-Driven Multimodal Personalized Content Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the dynamic evolution of user interests and the increasing multimodal demands in internet applications, personalized content generation strategies based on static interest preferences struggle to meet practical application requirements. The proposed TIMGen (Temporal Interest-driven Multimodal Generation) model addresses this challenge by modeling the long-term temporal evolution of users' interests and capturing dynamic interest representations with strong temporal dependencies. This model also supports the fusion of multimodal features, such as text, images, video, and audio, and delivers customized content based on multimodal preferences. TIMGen jointly learns temporal dependencies and modal preferences to obtain a unified interest representation, which it then generates to meet users' personalized content needs. TIMGen overcomes the shortcomings of personalized content recommendation methods based on static preferences, enabling flexible and dynamic modeling of users' multimodal interests, better understanding and capturing their interests and preferences. It can be extended to a variety of practical application scenarios, including e-commerce, advertising, online education, and precision medicine, providing insights for future research.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Entity Representation Learning for Pinterest Ads Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel framework following an upstream-downstream paradigm to construct user and item (Pin) embeddings from diverse data sources, which are essential for Pinterest to deliver personalized Pins and ads effectively. Our upstream models are trained on extensive data sources featuring varied signals, utilizing complex architectures to capture intricate relationships between users and Pins on Pinterest. To ensure scalability of the upstream models, entity embeddings are learned, and regularly refreshed, rather than real-time computation, allowing for asynchronous interaction between the upstream and downstream models. These embeddings are then integrated as input features in numerous downstream tasks, including ad retrieval and ranking models for CTR and CVR predictions. We demonstrate that our framework achieves notable performance improvements in both offline and online settings across various downstream tasks. This framework has been deployed in Pinterest's production ad ranking systems, resulting in significant gains in online metrics.</description>

      <title>Global-to-Local or Local-to-Global? Enhancing Image Retrieval with Efficient Local Search and Effective Global Re-ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dominant paradigm in image retrieval systems today is to search large databases using global image features, and re-rank those initial results with local image feature matching techniques. This design, dubbed global-to-local, stems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only be afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient local feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular enabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are often missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based re-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency. In this work, we leverage these building blocks to introduce a local-to-global retrieval paradigm, where efficient local feature search meets effective global feature re-ranking. Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global features are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval similarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional scaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities obtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost. Experimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new state-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.</description>

      <title>PianoBind: A Multimodal Joint Embedding Model for Pop-piano Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solo piano music, despite being a single-instrument medium, possesses significant expressive capabilities, conveying rich semantic information across genres, moods, and styles. However, current general-purpose music representation models, predominantly trained on large-scale datasets, often struggle to captures subtle semantic distinctions within homogeneous solo piano music. Furthermore, existing piano-specific representation models are typically unimodal, failing to capture the inherently multimodal nature of piano music, expressed through audio, symbolic, and textual modalities. To address these limitations, we propose PianoBind, a piano-specific multimodal joint embedding model. We systematically investigate strategies for multi-source training and modality utilization within a joint embedding framework optimized for capturing fine-grained semantic distinctions in (1) small-scale and (2) homogeneous piano datasets. Our experimental results demonstrate that PianoBind learns multimodal representations that effectively capture subtle nuances of piano music, achieving superior text-to-music retrieval performance on in-domain and out-of-domain piano datasets compared to general-purpose music joint embedding models. Moreover, our design choices offer reusable insights for multimodal representation learning with homogeneous datasets beyond piano music.</description>

      <title>How many patients could we save with LLM priors?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imagine a world where clinical trials need far fewer patients to achieve the same statistical power, thanks to the knowledge encoded in large language models (LLMs). We present a novel framework for hierarchical Bayesian modeling of adverse events in multi-center clinical trials, leveraging LLM-informed prior distributions. Unlike data augmentation approaches that generate synthetic data points, our methodology directly obtains parametric priors from the model. Our approach systematically elicits informative priors for hyperparameters in hierarchical Bayesian models using a pre-trained LLM, enabling the incorporation of external clinical expertise directly into Bayesian safety modeling. Through comprehensive temperature sensitivity analysis and rigorous cross-validation on real-world clinical trial data, we demonstrate that LLM-derived priors consistently improve predictive performance compared to traditional meta-analytical approaches. This methodology paves the way for more efficient and expert-informed clinical trial design, enabling substantial reductions in the number of patients required to achieve robust safety assessment and with the potential to transform drug safety monitoring and regulatory decision making.</description>

      <title>Delta Activations: A Representation for Finetuned Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of powerful open source Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled the community to create a vast collection of post-trained models adapted to specific tasks and domains. However, navigating and understanding these models remains challenging due to inconsistent metadata and unstructured repositories. We introduce Delta Activations, a method to represent finetuned models as vector embeddings by measuring shifts in their internal activations relative to a base model. This representation allows for effective clustering by domain and task, revealing structure in the model landscape. Delta Activations also demonstrate desirable properties: it is robust across finetuning settings and exhibits an additive property when finetuning datasets are mixed. In addition, we show that Delta Activations can embed tasks via few-shot finetuning, and further explore its use for model selection and merging. We hope Delta Activations can facilitate the practice of reusing publicly available models. Code is available at https://github.com/OscarXZQ/delta_activations.</description>

      <title>Emancipatory Information Retrieval</title>

Abstract: Our world today is facing a confluence of several mutually reinforcing crises each of which intersects with concerns of social justice and emancipation. This paper is a provocation for the role of computer-mediated information access in our emancipatory struggles. We define emancipatory information retrieval as the study and development of information access methods that challenge various forms of human oppression, and situates its activities within broader collective emancipatory praxis. The term "emancipatory" here signifies the moral concerns of universal humanization of all peoples and the elimination of oppression to create the conditions under which we can collectively flourish. To develop an emancipatory research agenda for information retrieval (IR), in this paper we speculate about the practices that the community can adopt, enumerate some of the projects that the field should undertake, and discuss provocations to spark new ideas and directions for research. We challenge the field of IR research to embrace humanistic values and commit to universal emancipation and social justice. We also invite scholars from fields such as human-computer interaction, information sciences, media studies, design, science and technology studies, social and political sciences, philosophy, law, environmental sciences, public health, educational sciences, as well as legal and policy experts, civil rights advocates, social justice activists and movement organizers, and artists to join us in realizing this transformation. In this process, we must both imagine post-oppressive worlds, and reimagine the role of IR in that world and in the journey that leads us there.</description>

      <title>MultiConIR: Towards multi-condition Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08046v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-condition information retrieval (IR) presents a significant, yet underexplored challenge for existing systems. This paper introduces MultiConIR, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate retrieval and reranking models under nuanced multi-condition query scenarios across five diverse domains. We systematically assess model capabilities through three critical tasks: complexity robustness, relevance monotonicity, and query format sensitivity. Our extensive experiments on 15 models reveal a critical vulnerability: most retrievers and rerankers exhibit severe performance degradation as query complexity increases. Key deficiencies include widespread failure to maintain relevance monotonicity, and high sensitivity to query style and condition placement. The superior performance of GPT-4o reveals the performance gap between IR systems and advanced LLM for handling sophisticated natural language queries. Furthermore, this work delves into the factors contributing to reranker performance deterioration and examines how condition positioning within queries affects similarity assessment, providing crucial insights for advancing IR systems towards complex search scenarios. The code and datasets are available at https://github.com/EIT-NLP/MultiConIR</description>

      <title>OneSearch: A Preliminary Exploration of the Unified End-to-End Generative Framework for E-commerce Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional e-commerce search systems employ multi-stage cascading architectures (MCA) that progressively filter items through recall, pre-ranking, and ranking stages. While effective at balancing computational efficiency with business conversion, these systems suffer from fragmented computation and optimization objective collisions across stages, which ultimately limit their performance ceiling. To address these, we propose \textbf{OneSearch}, the first industrial-deployed end-to-end generative framework for e-commerce search. This framework introduces three key innovations: (1) a Keyword-enhanced Hierarchical Quantization Encoding (KHQE) module, to preserve both hierarchical semantics and distinctive item attributes while maintaining strong query-item relevance constraints; (2) a multi-view user behavior sequence injection strategy that constructs behavior-driven user IDs and incorporates both explicit short-term and implicit long-term sequences to model user preferences comprehensively; and (3) a Preference-Aware Reward System (PARS) featuring multi-stage supervised fine-tuning and adaptive reward-weighted ranking to capture fine-grained user preferences. Extensive offline evaluations on large-scale industry datasets demonstrate OneSearch's superior performance for high-quality recall and ranking. The rigorous online A/B tests confirm its ability to enhance relevance in the same exposure position, achieving statistically significant improvements: +1.67\% item CTR, +2.40\% buyer, and +3.22\% order volume. Furthermore, OneSearch reduces operational expenditure by 75.40\% and improves Model FLOPs Utilization from 3.26\% to 27.32\%. The system has been successfully deployed across multiple search scenarios in Kuaishou, serving millions of users, generating tens of millions of PVs daily.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04228v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing influence of data science in statistics education requires tools that make key concepts accessible through real-world applications. We introduce "Data Science Looks At Discrimination" (dsld), an R package that provides a comprehensive set of analytical and graphical methods for examining issues of discrimination involving attributes such as race, gender, and age. By positioning fairness analysis as a teaching tool, the package enables instructors to demonstrate confounder effects, model bias, and related topics through applied examples. An accompanying 80-page Quarto book guides students and legal professionals in understanding these principles and applying them to real data. We describe the implementation of the package functions and illustrate their use with examples. Python interfaces are also available.</description>

      <title>Enhancing FKG.in: automating Indian food composition analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05248v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to compute food composition data for Indian recipes using a knowledge graph for Indian food (FKG[.]in) and LLMs. The primary focus is to provide a broad overview of an automated food composition analysis workflow and describe its core functionalities: nutrition data aggregation, food composition analysis, and LLM-augmented information resolution. This workflow aims to complement FKG[.]in and iteratively supplement food composition data from verified knowledge bases. Additionally, this paper highlights the challenges of representing Indian food and accessing food composition data digitally. It also reviews three key sources of food composition data: the Indian Food Composition Tables, the Indian Nutrient Databank, and the Nutritionix API. Furthermore, it briefly outlines how users can interact with the workflow to obtain diet-based health recommendations and detailed food composition information for numerous recipes. We then explore the complex challenges of analyzing Indian recipe information across dimensions such as structure, multilingualism, and uncertainty as well as present our ongoing work on LLM-based solutions to address these issues. The methods proposed in this workshop paper for AI-driven knowledge curation and information resolution are application-agnostic, generalizable, and replicable for any domain.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Customized Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of tasks, yet their application to specialized domains remains challenging due to the need for deep expertise. Retrieval-Augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to customize LLMs for professional fields by seamlessly integrating external knowledge bases, enabling real-time access to domain-specific expertise during inference. Despite its potential, traditional RAG systems, based on flat text retrieval, face three critical challenges: (i) complex query understanding in professional contexts, (ii) difficulties in knowledge integration across distributed sources, and (iii) system efficiency bottlenecks at scale. This survey presents a systematic analysis of Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG), a new paradigm that revolutionizes domain-specific LLM applications. GraphRAG addresses traditional RAG limitations through three key innovations: (i) graph-structured knowledge representation that explicitly captures entity relationships and domain hierarchies, (ii) efficient graph-based retrieval techniques that enable context-preserving knowledge retrieval with multihop reasoning ability, and (iii) structure-aware knowledge integration algorithms that leverage retrieved knowledge for accurate and logical coherent generation of LLMs. In this survey, we systematically analyze the technical foundations of GraphRAG and examine current implementations across various professional domains, identifying key technical challenges and promising research directions. All the related resources of GraphRAG, including research papers, open-source data, and projects, are collected for the community in https://github.com/DEEP-PolyU/Awesome-GraphRAG.</description>

      <title>DAPFAM: A Domain-Aware Family-level Dataset to benchmark cross domain patent retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Patent prior-art retrieval becomes especially challenging when relevant disclosures cross technological boundaries. Existing benchmarks lack explicit domain partitions, making it difficult to assess how retrieval systems cope with such shifts. We introduce DAPFAM, a family-level benchmark with explicit IN-domain and OUT-domain partitions defined by a new IPC3 overlap scheme. The dataset contains 1,247 query families and 45,336 target families aggregated at the family level to reduce international redundancy, with citation based relevance judgments. We conduct 249 controlled experiments spanning lexical (BM25) and dense (transformer) backends, document and passage level retrieval, multiple query and document representations, aggregation strategies, and hybrid fusion via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Results reveal a pronounced domain gap: OUT-domain performance remains roughly five times lower than IN-domain across all configurations. Passage-level retrieval consistently outperforms document-level, and dense methods provide modest gains over BM25, but none close the OUT-domain gap. Document-level RRF yields strong effectiveness efficiency trade-offs with minimal overhead. By exposing the persistent challenge of cross-domain retrieval, DAPFAM provides a reproducible, compute-aware testbed for developing more robust patent IR systems. The dataset is publicly available on huggingface at https://huggingface.co/datasets/datalyes/DAPFAM_patent.</description>

      <title>Two-Stage Quranic QA via Ensemble Retrieval and Instruction-Tuned Answer Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quranic Question Answering presents unique challenges due to the linguistic complexity of Classical Arabic and the semantic richness of religious texts. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework that addresses both passage retrieval and answer extraction. For passage retrieval, we ensemble fine-tuned Arabic language models to achieve superior ranking performance. For answer extraction, we employ instruction-tuned large language models with few-shot prompting to overcome the limitations of fine-tuning on small datasets. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the Quran QA 2023 Shared Task, with a MAP@10 of 0.3128 and MRR@10 of 0.5763 for retrieval, and a pAP@10 of 0.669 for extraction, substantially outperforming previous methods. These results demonstrate that combining model ensembling and instruction-tuned language models effectively addresses the challenges of low-resource question answering in specialized domains.</description>

      <title>Extending FKG.in: Towards a Food Claim Traceability Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network (FCN) as an extension of FKG[.]in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of concept of FKG[.]in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers, policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world saturated with dietary assertions.</description>

      <title>Training LLMs to be Better Text Embedders through Bidirectional Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text embedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the embedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS]. However, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the semantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings, especially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training stage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token embedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks, namely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based Document-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and reconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM performance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new state-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.</description>
