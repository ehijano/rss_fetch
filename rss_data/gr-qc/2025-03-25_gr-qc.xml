      <title>Nonlinear Magnetically Charged Black Holes with Phantom Global Monopoles: Thermodynamics, Geodesics, Gravitational Lensing, Quasinormal Modes, and Grey-Body Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the properties of a nonlinear magnetic-charged black hole in the presence of a phantom global monopole. By incorporating nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) and exotic scalar fields, we derive an exact black hole solution and analyze its geometric structure, causal properties, and thermodynamic behavior. We examine how the presence of a phantom global monopole modifies the black hole's Hawking temperature, entropy, and stability conditions, revealing significant changes in its phase structure. Additionally, we investigate the geodesic motion of test particles, focusing on its impact on gravitational lensing and black hole shadows. The quasinormal mode (QNM) spectrum is computed using the WKB approximation and P\"oschl-Teller potential method, providing insights into the perturbative stability of the system. Furthermore, we analyze the grey-body factors that characterize radiation emission, highlighting their dependence on black hole parameters. Our findings indicate that the interplay between phantom energy, NED, and global monopoles introduces observable deviations in strong-field astrophysical phenomena. These results offer potential signatures for testing modified gravity theories and contribute to a deeper understanding of black hole physics in exotic field environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Validating the results of [A.M. Abrahams and C.R. Evans, Phys. Rev. Lett. 70, 2980] poses a numerical challenge and has been inspiring a lot of research. We join these efforts and present our first steps to achieve this goal: we discuss a formulation of Einstein equations for a vacuum axisymmetric spacetime with vanishing twist in spherical-polar coordinates, its linearised approximation, and identify some problems in achieving numerically stable evolution at the threshold of a black hole formation.</description>

      <title>A numerical framework for studying asymptotic quantities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution we present an overview of our work on the numerical simulation of the perturbation of a black hole space-time by incoming gravitational waves. The formulation we use is based on Friedrich's general conformal equations which have the unique property that they allow access to the asymptotic region of an asymptotically regular space-time. In our approach we set up an initial boundary value problem on a finite boundary, which cleanly separates the initial conditions, a static black hole, from the perturbation, an incoming gravitational wave specified by a spin-2 function on the time-like boundary. The main advantage of this approach is that the finite boundary expands fast enough to reach null-infinity where the asymptotic properties can be studied. This provides, for the first time, a direct relationship between finite initial and boundary data and asymptotic quantities within one simulation. We discuss the possibilities and limitations of this approach.</description>

      <title>Stochastic origin of primordial fluctuations in the Sky</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a study of the effects of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalisation of stochastic inflation on the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) in a model-independent single-field context. We demonstrate how the scalar perturbations' Infra-Red (IR) contributions and the emerging Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution characterise the Langevin equations for the ``soft" modes in the quasi-de Sitter background. Both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion-dominated regimes undergo a specific analysis of the distribution function using the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism, which helps us to evade a no-go theorem on the PBH mass. Using the EFT-induced alterations, we evaluate the local non-Gaussian parameters in the drift-dominated limit.</description>

      <title>Possible Existence of Ghost Stars in the context of Electromagnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the existence of ghost star models in the Einstein-Maxwell framework. In order to explore these objects, we put forward the idea of Zeldovich and Novikov by keeping in mind that the energy density of such models lie in the negative range in some regions of the spacetime geometry. We proceed by taking into account a static sphere and develop the field equations for a charged anisotropic fluid configuration. The two generating functions are then considered and we rewrite the field equations in terms of the mass and these physical quantities. Afterwards, we formulate two different models using the conformally flatness condition along with the considered generating functions. Further, we adopt the vanishing complexity constraint as well as null active gravitational mass to find two more solutions. The energy density for all developed models is also graphically shown. We conclude that the ghost stars exist in the presence of charge as the energy density for all the resulting solutions lie in the negative region for a particular range of the radial coordinate.</description>

      <title>Momentum-Resolved Probing of Lorentz-Violating Dispersion Relations via Unruh-DeWitt Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by quantum gravity frameworks predicting Planck-scale deviations from Lorentz invariance, we probe Lorentz symmetry violation via modified dispersion relations $\omega_{|\textbf{k}|}$. Departing from conventional approaches, we employ an Unruh-DeWitt detector to probe energy-dependent modifications to the dispersion relations. Two key methodological advances are introduced: (i) a generalized formulation for detector acceleration without assuming specific dispersion relations, and (ii) a momentum-resolved detection paradigm enabling spectral decomposition of $\omega_{|\textbf{k}|}$ through localized momentum-shell integration. By restricting detector-field interactions to narrow spectral windows and performing iterative Taylor expansions around reference momenta $|\textbf{k}_0|$, we derive coefficients encoding derivatives of $\omega_{|\textbf{k}|}$, reconstructing its global profile via momentum-space tomography. The analysis reveals how deviations from linear dispersion relations disrupt the thermal character of the Unruh effect, while perturbative modifications preserve thermality at low energies. This approach offers a scalable method to test Lorentz symmetry violation across energy scales, and establishes a foundation for experimental verification of Planck-scale relics through high-precision spectral measurements.</description>

      <title>Non-commutativity in Hayward spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new black hole solution, namely, a Hayward-like metric incorporating corrections due to non-commutativity. We begin by deriving this solution using the non-commutative gauge theory framework. The general properties of the metric are then analyzed, including the event horizon structure and the Kretschmann scalar. Analogous to the standard Hayward solution, the modified black hole remains regular, provided that additional conditions must be satisfied, specifically $\theta \in \mathbb{R} \setminus \left\{ \frac{\pi}{2} + n\pi \;\middle|\; n \in \mathbb{Z} \right\}$. Next, we examine the thermodynamic properties, computing the Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. The temperature profile suggests the existence of a remnant mass when $T^{(\Theta,l)} \to 0$. Quantum radiation is analyzed by considering both bosonic and fermionic particle modes, with an estimation of the particle creation density provided for each case. The effective potential is evaluated perturbatively to accomplish the analysis of quasinormal modes and the time-domain response for scalar perturbations. The study of null geodesics is explored to enable the characterization of the photon sphere and black hole shadows. Additionally, constraints on the shadows are estimated based on EHT (Event Horizon Telescope) data. Furthermore, the Gaussian curvature is determined to assess the stability of critical orbits, followed by an analysis of gravitational lensing using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Finally, the constraints (bounds) on the parameters $\Theta$ (non-commutativity) and $l$ (``Hayward parameter'') are derived based on solar system tests, including the perihelion precession of Mercury, light deflection, and the Shapiro time delay effect.</description>

      <title>Rescaled Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Gravity Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the inflationary phenomenology of a rescaled Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity. In this framework, the gravitational constant of the Einstein-Hilbert term is rescaled due to effective terms active in the high curvature era. Basically, the total theory is an $F(R,G,\phi)$ theory with the Gauss-Bonnet part contributing only a non-minimal coupling to the scalar field, so it is a theory with string theory origins and with a non-trivial $F(R)$ gravity part. The $F(R)$ gravity part in the high curvature regime contributes only a rescaled Einstein-Hilbert term and thus the resulting theory is effectively a rescaled version of a standard Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory. We develop the formalism of rescaled Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, taking in account the GW170817 constraints on the gravitational wave speed. We show explicitly how the rescaled theory affects directly the primordial scalar and tensor perturbations, and how the slow-roll and observational indices of inflation are affected by the rescaling of the theory. We perform a thorough phenomenological analysis of several models of interest and we show that is it possible to obtain viable inflationary theories compatible with the latest Planck data. Also among the studied models there are cases that yield a relatively large blue tilted tensor spectral index and we demonstrate that these models can lead to detectable primordial gravitational waves in the future gravitational wave experiments. Some of the scenarios examined, for specific values of the reheating temperature may be detectable by SKA, LISA, BBO, DECIGO and the Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>Non-Commutative fluid: an alternative source of cosmic acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a Hubble function based on Newtonian Cosmology using non-commutative fluid equations. Our Hubble function contains cosmic fluids with the signature of a new cosmological parameter $\sigma$, motivated by a non-commutative Poisson bracket structure. Interestingly, this Hubble function does not include any external fluid content related to dark energy or the Cosmological constant; the parameter $\sigma$ acts as the source of accelerated expansion. In this work, we aim to explain the phenomenon of the accelerating expansion of the universe without "dark energy". Additionally, we have verified the observational bounds for $\sigma$ to assess its potential in explaining the accelerated expansion.</description>

      <title>Nonseparability of multipartite systems in dilaton black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonseparability of N-partite quantum systems by employing the Abe-Rajagopal (AR) $q$-conditional entropy for both free bosonic and fermionic fields in the background of a Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger (GHS) dilaton black hole. An intriguing finding is that the Hawking effect of the black hole can generate a net nonseparability of W state for fermionic field. Notably, we observe that fermionic nonseparability exhibits a stronger robustness than its bosonic counterpart, while fermionic coherence is found to be weaker than bosonic coherence within the dilaton black hole background. Additionally, our analysis reveals that the nonseparability of GHZ state is more pronounced than that of W state, yet quantum coherence of GHZ state is comparatively weaker than that of W state in dilaton spacetime. These results suggest that choosing the appropriate quantum resources for different particle types and quantum state configurations is essential for effectively tackling relativistic quantum information tasks.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet Cosmology Confronted with Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several models within the framework of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravities are considered with regard their late-time phenomenological viability. The models contain a non-minimally coupled scalar field and satisfy a constraint on the scalar field Gauss-Bonnet coupling, that guarantees that the speed of the tensor perturbations is equal to the speed of light. The late-time cosmological evolution of these Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet models is confronted with the observational data including the Pantheon plus Type Ia supernovae catalogue, the Hubble parameter measurements (cosmic chronometers), data from cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) including the latest measurements from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). Among the considered class of models some of them do not fit the CMB and BAO data. However, there exists some models that generate a viable Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet scenario with well-behaved late-time cosmological evolution that fits the observational data essentially better in comparison to the standard $\Lambda$-Cold-Dark-Matter model.</description>

      <title>Causality of brane universe with the general bulk-based formalism with the non-zero Schwarzschild mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In brane world scenarios, it is generally accepted that electromagnetic waves (EMWs) are confined to propagate along the brane, while gravitational waves (GWs) are free to travel through the bulk. This distinction has been utilized in various studies addressing the cosmological horizon problem in the literature. In this paper, we employ general bulk-based formalisms to re-examine this problem, specifically focusing on the influence of non-zero Schwarzschild mass on the geodesics. We begin with the Lagrangian of test particles and employ the method of variation of action to derive the equations of motion. Our findings reveal that the Schwarzschild mass significantly affects the ratio of the gravitational horizon to the photon horizon. In the low-energy regime, we can obtain a constraint on the constant curvature radius of anti-de Sitter, i.e. $l H_0 \lesssim 10^{-29}$. This finding is consistent with existing literature. However, in the high-energy regime the ratio $r_g/r_\gamma$ increases by thirty orders of magnitude, reaching up to $10^{33}$. Furthermore, when we take into account the nucleosynthesis constraint $\sigma^{1/4} &lt; 1 MeV$, the ratio is further enhanced to $10^{40}$. Our results indicate that a non-zero Schwarzschild mass significantly influences the gravity of the brane world. Some of these effects may be leveraged to address or mitigate the standard problems that encountered in the conventional universe.</description>

      <title>Shadow properties and orbital dynamics around an effective quantum-modified black hole surrounded by quintessential dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate black holes (BHs) surrounded by a quintessence field (QF) within the framework of effective quantum gravity (EQG). We analyze the spacetime metric characterized by quantum correction parameter $\xi$ and quintessence parameters $(c,w)$, revealing a rich three-horizon structure whose properties depend on both quantum effects and dark energy. Our main focus is on understanding the observational signatures and dynamical behavior of these modified BHs. We derive analytical expressions for the photon sphere and shadow radius for various values of the state parameter, finding that quintessence fields increase the shadow radius while quantum corrections decrease it-a distinctive interplay that creates potentially observable effects. Using Event Horizon Telescope data from M87*, we establish constraints on the quantum correction parameter, showing that the allowable range for $\xi$ increases with the quintessence parameter $c$. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of null and timelike geodesics, demonstrating how quantum corrections enhance interactions between photons and the gravitational field while modifying the energy, angular momentum, and stability properties of massive particle orbits. Our investigation extends to periodic orbits characterized by zoom-whirl behavior, finding that quintessence allows such orbits to occur at lower energies compared to purely quantum-corrected BHs. We further analyze scalar perturbations and their effective potentials, which reveal how both quantum and quintessence effects shape the response characteristics of these BHs. Throughout our study, we find that quantum corrections and quintessence frequently produce counteracting effects on observables that could provide simultaneous tests of quantum gravity theories and dark energy models through future high-precision astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>Accretion disk luminosity around rotating naked singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore circular geodesics of neutral test particles in the gravitational field of a rotating deformed mass. The geometry around this source is described by the Quevedo-Mashhoon solution, which corresponds to a naked singularity. To this end, we compute the orbital parameters of test particles in the equatorial plane, such as the angular velocity $\Omega$, energy $E$ and angular momentum $L$, per unit mass. We also numerically estimate the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit $r_{ISCO}$. In addition, we consider a simple model for the disk's radiative flux, differential luminosity, and spectral luminosity, employing the well-known Novikov-Page-Thorne model. We mainly focus on the flux of the accretion disk around several rotating naked singularities possessing the same mass and quadrupole moment but different rotation and deformation parameters. We analyze the possibility of distinguishing Kerr black holes from rotating naked singularities. The astrophysical implications of the results obtained are discussed.</description>

Abstract: In Ref. arXiv:2502.08816, Hawking radiation was analyzed through a statistical mechanics framework, revealing a structured microstate description of black hole horizons and information transfer into the radiation background. This study extends that approach by formulating Hawking radiation and black hole evaporation in the language of stochastic mechanics, employing an analytical Langevin framework and a numerical Euler iteration scheme. Both methods confirm that small black holes behave as thermal systems with Gaussian noise, while larger black holes develop a structured noise spectrum that aligns with the gradual contraction of the horizon. This suggests an alternative interpretation of Hawking radiation as an effective surface fuzziness, encoding horizon-scale fluctuations. The appendix provides a Wolfram Mathematica blueprint for numerical simulations, open to heuristic modifications for further exploration of black hole noise spectra.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic and shadow radius analysis of the charged Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the thermodynamic and shadow radius analysis of an electrically charged black hole (EC) with electric charge $q$ and coupling constant $\mu$ obtained from the Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electodynamics. For $\mu=0.03$, we have four solution branches of the horizon including low, hot, negative, and cold ones, while for $\mu=0.3,3$ there exist single branches without limitation on $q$. The shadow radius for the low branch is the nearly same as that for the Reissner-Norstr\"om black hole for $q&lt;1$ case, while one finds the $q&gt;1$ negative branch which is constrained by the EHT observation.</description>

      <title>Physical Properties of Black Hole Solution in Einstein-Bel-Robinson Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the different properties of static spherically symmetric black hole solutions of Einstein-Bel-Robinson gravity (EBR), a modified four-dimensional theory of gravity quartic in curvature. We look at the orbit of massless and massive test bodies near a black hole, specifically computing the innermost stable circular orbit and photon sphere and finding them smaller than their Einstein counterparts in general relativity. Next, we obtain the deflection angle and shadow by an EBR black hole and find that both decreased compared to a non-rotating black hole in general relativity. We obtain a bound value for the coupling constant using the Shapiro time delay. Then, we explore the EBR black hole's lifetime and find that it decreases to Einstein's gravity. Quasinormal modes (QNMs) are computed using Pad\'e averaged 6th order WKB method showing that increasing the coupling constant lowers the damping rate of ring-down gravitational waves (GWs). The oscillation frequency of scalar QNMs decreases with the coupling constant, whereas it increases for electromagnetic QNMs. We also provide analytical rigorous bound of greybody factor. We show that the coupling constant has a small effect on the greybody factor. Finally, correspondence between greybody factor and quasinormal modes is also considered.</description>

      <title>Geometric properties versus particle motion in the Fang-Wang spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we explore general relativistic effects and geometric properties of the Fan-Wang spacetime, one of the simplest regular solutions that can be obtained in nonlinear electrodynamics. In particular, we investigate the motion of test particles, the capture cross-section of neutral massive and massless particles, such as neutrinos and photons, and the gravitational redshift. Additionally, using a perturbative approach, we derive analytical expressions for the perihelion shift and gravitational deflection of massless particles. By identifying the one-parameter corrections to the Schwarzschild spacetime, induced by the magnetic charge contained in the Fang-Wang metric, we show that this spacetime can be falsified, since it modifies classical general relativity predictions even at the local level. Moreover, we argue that these modifications could be experimentally tested with advanced observational instrumentation.</description>

Abstract: In this study, the geodesic motion of a test particle along with its confinement is investigated within Cylindrically Symmetric Wormhole spacetime admitting to Closed Timelike Curves. The confinement of particles with or without angular momentum is also investigated. It is found that particles with positive angular momentum that co-rotates with the spacetime can only pass through the causality violating region. Particles with only non-zero angular momentum are present in the vicinity of the Closed Timelike Curves.</description>

Abstract: Modern cosmological theories invoke the idea that all structure in the Universe originates from quantum fluctuations. Understanding the quantum-to-classical transition for these fluctuations is of central importance not only for the foundations of quantum theory, but also for observational astronomy. In my contribution, I review the essential features of this transition, emphasizing in particular the role of Alexei Starobinsky.</description>

      <title>Multimodal signatures of asymptotic (A)dS Kalb-Ramond black holes: Constraints through the shadow, weak deflection angle, and topological photon spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores novel static, neutral black hole solutions within Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity in asymptotically (anti-)de Sitter [(A)dS] spacetimes, incorporating spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking via an antisymmetric tensor field. Focusing on two metric configurations, we derive general analytical expressions for the horizon radius, photon sphere, shadow radius, and weak gravitational deflection angle. The universality of these expressions enables their applicability to a broad class of non-rotating spacetimes beyond KR gravity. By confronting these models with empirical data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) and Solar System experiments, the work yields tight constraints on the Lorentz-violating parameter $\ell$, demonstrating that certain parameterizations - particularly Case B - yield observationally viable and physically consistent outcomes. Additionally, we employ topological methods to analyze black hole thermodynamics and photon sphere stability, uncovering critical geometrical structures in both thermodynamic and optical contexts. These multimodal signatures collectively offer a powerful framework for testing Lorentz-violating extensions of General Relativity and highlight the potential of topological diagnostics in gravitational physics.</description>

      <title>Fast Radio Bursts and Electromagnetic Transition Radiation on Gravitational Shockwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a gravitational shockwave hits a magnetar it creates perturbations of the magnetar magnetic field in a form of a transition radiation. We argue that this radiation can be a novel candidate to explain the origin of fast radio bursts (FRB). A unique feature of the transition radiation on the shockwaves is that normal components of its Maxwell strength `remember' only the spatial `profile' of the shock, not the form of the signal. This fact allows us to determine completely a characteristic initial problem for the perturbations with Cauchy data defined on a null hypersurface just behind the shockwave front. The computations are carried by modeling magnetar as a magnetic dipole. As an illustration we consider shockwaves created by ultrarelativistic objects of two types, by compact sources or by cosmic strings. In the both cases the duration of the engine pulse is determined by an impact distance between the magnetar and the source. We present the angular distribution of the transition radiation flux and show that it is consistent with properties of the FRB engine.</description>

      <title>Modeling matter(s) in SEOBNRv5THM: Generating fast and accurate effective-one-body waveforms for spin-aligned binary neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SEOBNRv5THM, an accurate and fast gravitational-waveform model for quasi-circular, spinning, non-precessing binary neutron stars (BNS) within the effective-one-body (EOB) formalism. It builds on the binary-black-hole approximant SEOBNRv5HM and, compared to its predecessor SEOBNRv4T, it i) incorporates recent high-order post-Newtonian results in the inspiral, including higher-order adiabatic tidal contributions, spin-induced multipoles and dynamical tides for spin-aligned neutron stars, ii) includes the gravitational modes $(\ell, |m|)=(2,2),(3,3),(2,1),(4,4),(5,5),(3,2),$ and $(4,3)$, iii) has a time of merger calibrated to BNS numerical-relativity (NR) simulations, iv) accurately models the pre-merger $(2,2)$ mode through a novel phenomenological ansatz, and v) is 100 to 1000 times faster than its predecessor model for BNS systems with total mass $M \geq 2\, M_\odot$. Thus, SEOBNRv5THM can be used in Bayesian parameter estimation, which we perform for two BNS events observed by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration, GW170817 and GW190425. The model accurately reproduces BAM and SACRA NR waveforms with errors comparable to or lower than the intrinsic NR uncertainty. We validate the model against the other state-of-the-art BNS waveform models NRTidalv3 and TEOBResumS and find differences only for highly spinning and highly tidally deformable BNS, where there is no NR coverage and the models employ different spin prescriptions. Our model serves as a foundation for the development of subsequent SEOBNR waveform models with matter that incorporate further effects, such as spin-precession and eccentricity, to be employed for upcoming observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration and future facilities on the ground.</description>

      <title>Thermal effective actions from conformal boundary conditions in gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has studied the thermodynamics of gravity subjected to conformal boundary conditions, where the trace of the extrinsic curvature $K$ and the conformal class of metrics are kept fixed. The case $K &lt; 0$ seems tied to solutions with cosmic horizons. To study this situation further, we analyze Einstein-Maxwell theory, where we find solutions with cosmic horizons corresponding to patches inside the inner horizon of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. We find that these solutions are $\it{necessary}$ for consistency with the thermal effective action in the putative boundary dual at $O(1)$ chemical potential. Furthermore, we introduce a (positive or negative) cosmological constant and find more cases where solutions with cosmic horizons dominate the ensemble. Transitions between solutions with cosmic horizons and solutions with black hole horizons are mediated by "extremal" solutions that correspond to patches of (A)dS$_2 \times \Sigma^{d-1}$, for which we discuss an effective JT gravity description with dimensionally reduced conformal boundary conditions. Finally, we introduce rotation in some simple cases and find that the bulk theory reproduces the universal velocity-dependent modification of the free energy predicted by the thermal effective action.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, multiplicative renormalization \cite{dixon} for Yang-Mills theories is reviewed. While this subject is not new, it is suggested that a clear understanding of these methods leads to a systematic way for interpreting the counter terms needed for non multiplicative renormalization of quantum gravity, for models such as \cite{dewitt}-\cite{stelle2}. These models are renormalizable but contain apparent instabilities leading to possible unitarity loss, an earlier analog is \cite{pais}. This systematic may be interesting, especially in the modern context, since there are efforts for avoiding with those apparent instabilities by employing variants of the standard quantization methods \cite{mannheim1}-\cite{salve}.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Sectors in Inflation: Gapless Theories and Unparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute correlation functions of the primordial density perturbations when they couple to a gapless, strongly coupled sector of spectator fields -- ``unparticles" -- during inflation. We first derive a four-point function of conformally coupled scalars for all kinematic configurations in de Sitter, which exchanges an unparticle at tree-level, by performing direct integration using the Mellin-Barnes method. To obtain inflationary bispectra and trispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled scalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations determined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator. Based on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the spinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the currents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the help of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the resulting shape functions. Depending on the value of the unparticle scaling dimension, we classify three characteristic shapes for the inflationary bispectra, including near-equilateral, near-orthogonal, and a novel shape which appears when the scaling dimensions are close to half-integers. More generally, we find that the leading order squeezed limits are insufficient to conclusively determine the detection of a light particle or unparticle. Only the full shapes of bispectra and trispectra can break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Non-orbital particle trapping in binary black holes through dynamic stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an interdisciplinary comparison between binary black hole systems and Radio Frequency (RF) Paul Traps, modeling the gravitational binary system as a rotating saddle near its center. This analogy connects these seemingly unrelated systems through the concept of dynamic stability. The rotating saddle potential is analytically tractable, allowing us to prove the existence of bounded charged particle trajectories under certain conditions. By focusing on stellar-mass black holes with a weak electric charge-a feature consistent with specific astrophysical conditions that leaves the spacetime metric largely unaffected but can influence nearby particle interactions-we can neglect complicating factors such as magnetic fields from large accretion disks of heavier black holes or stellar winds. Our simulation results demonstrate that charged particles can exhibit stable, non-orbital trajectories near the center of a binary system with charged stellar-mass black holes, providing unique three-dimensional trapping primarily through gravity. This system is distinctive in the literature for its non-orbital trapping mechanism. While theoretically intriguing, this trapping relies on specific conditions, including nearly identical black hole masses. These types of non-orbital trapping mechanisms could potentially allow for longer-lived plasma configurations, enhancing our ability to detect electromagnetic signatures from these systems. The significance of this work lies in the novel comparison between a laboratory-scale quantum system and a larger astrophysical one, opening new avenues for exploring parallels between microscopic and cosmic phenomena across fourteen orders of magnitude in distance.</description>

      <title>Possible binary neutron star merger history of the primary of GW230529</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black holes (BHs) with masses between $\sim 3-5M_{\odot}$, produced by a binary neutron star (BNS) merger, can further pair up with a neutron star or BH and merge again within a Hubble time. However, the astrophysical environments in which this can happen and the rate of such mergers are open questions in astrophysics. Gravitational waves may play an important role in answering these questions. In this context, we discuss the possibility that the primary of the recent LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA binary GW230529_181500 (GW230529, in short) is the product of a previous BNS merger. Invoking numerical relativity (NR)-based fitting formulas that map the binary constituents' masses and tidal deformabilities to the mass, spin, and kick velocity of the remnant BH, we investigate the potential parents of GW230529's primary. Our calculations using NR fits based on BNS simulations reveal that the remnant of a high-mass BNS merger similar to GW190425 is consistent with the primary of GW230529. This argument is further strengthened by the gravitational wave-based merger rate estimation of GW190425-like and GW230529-like populations. We show that around 18% (median) of the GW190425-like remnants could become the primary component in GW230529-like mergers. The dimensionless tidal deformability parameter of the heavier neutron star in the parent binary is constrained to $67^{+163}_{-61}$ at 90% credibility. Using estimates of the gravitational-wave kick imparted to the remnant, we also discuss the astrophysical environments in which these types of mergers can take place and the implications for their future observations.</description>

Abstract: We consider a path integral representation of the time evolution $\exp(-\frac{i}{\hbar}tH)$ for Lagrangians of the variable $A$ which can be represented in the form (quadratic in $Q$) ${\cal L}(A)=Q(A){\cal M}Q(A)+\partial_{\mu}L^{\mu}$. We show that $\exp(-\frac{i}{\hbar}tH)\exp(\frac{i}{\hbar}\int d{\bf x}L^{0}) =\exp(\frac{i}{\hbar}\int d{\bf x}L^{0})$ up to an $A$-independent factor. We discuss examples of the states $\exp(\frac{i}{\hbar}\int d{\bf x}L^{0})$ in quantum mechanics and in quantum field theory (analogs of the Kodama states in quantum gravity). We show the relevance of these states for a determination of the dynamics in terms of stochastic differential equations. We discuss applications to gauge theory on a Lorentzian manifold and gauge theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Resonant Transitions of Tidally Perturbed Gravitational Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light bosons can form gravitational atoms (GA) around spinning black holes through the superradiance process.Considering the black hole to be part of a binary system,the tidal potential of the companion periodically perturbs the GA such that an atomic transition occurs between two of its energy eigenstates.The resonant transition is modeled by the Landau-Zener system,where the orbital frequency of the companion determines the relevant transition.In this work, we study a novel gravitational wave signal originating directly from the atomic transition of the GA in a binary system.We derive the analytical formulae of both the strain waveform and frequency spectrum of the signal.We further present the GA-binary systems that can have a large signal-to-noise ratio in LISA's frequency band.Finally, we discuss the implications of detection of the signal:inferring model parameters,including the boson mass and black hole spin,and computing the phase shift and Doppler shift of the gravitational wave signal for equal mass binaries.</description>

      <title>Generalized Nonextensive Entropy Holographic Dark Energy Models Verified by Cosmological Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general formalism for studying generalized Holographic Dark Energy (HDE) models in which we use a dimensionless form of the area-entropy of cosmological horizons. The future event horizon is applied though the formalism can also be applied to any other type of the horizon, too. Then, we use our formalism for nonextensive horizon entropies of standard HDE (i.e. Bekenstein-Hawking), and generalized such as Barrow/Tsallis-Cirto, R\'enyi, Sharma-Mittal, and Kaniadakis as dark energy models of the universe and test them by cosmological data.
  We find the bounds on the specific entropy model parameters and also apply statistical comparison tool such as the Bayesian evidence criterion in order to favour or disfavour the models against standard $\Lambda$CDM.
  The main data test results are that all the HDE models under study are statistically disfavoured with respect to $\Lambda$CDM, though at some different levels. The standard HDE seem to be on the same footing as R\'enyi, Sharma-Mittal, and Kaniadakis HDE models since the latter include only small deviations from HDE model resulting from the series expansion of their extra nonextensivity parameters. However, Barrow and Tsallis-Cirto models, though still disfavoured against $\Lambda$CDM, seem to point out observationally to fulfil an important physical property of extensivity (though still remaining nonadditive) which is in agreement with our previous results of Refs. \cite{Dabrowski:2020atl,PhysRevD.108.103533} and recent claims of Ref. \cite{TSALLIS2025139238}. Finally, the Tsallis-Cirto model parameter is pointing towards the $\Lambda$CDM limit which is singular also at the expense of having much larger value of the holographic dark energy dimensionless parameter $k$ value higher than other models.</description>

      <title>New Tests on Lorentz Invariance Violation Using Energy-Resolved Polarimetry of Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the manifestations of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) is vacuum birefringence, which leads to an energy-dependent rotation of the polarization plane of linearly polarized photons arising from an astrophysical source. Here we use the energy-resolved polarization measurements in the prompt $\gamma$-ray emission of five bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to constrain this vacuum birefringent effect. Our results show that at the 95\% confidence level, the birefringent parameter $\eta$ characterizing the broken degree of Lorentz invariance can be constrained to be $|\eta|&lt;\mathcal{O}(10^{-15}-10^{-16})$, which represent an improvement of at least eight orders of magnitude over existing limits from multi-band optical polarization observations. Moreover, our constraints are competitive with previous best bounds from the single $\gamma$-ray polarimetry of other GRBs. We emphasize that, thanks to the adoption of the energy-resolved polarimetric data set, our results on $\eta$ are statistically more robust. Future polarization measurements of GRBs at higher energies and larger distances would further improve LIV limits through the birefringent effect.</description>

      <title>Environmental Effects on Hubble Constant Measurements from Gravitational Wave Observations: A Case Study of the GW190514-GW190521 Hierarchical Triple Merger inside AGN J124942.3+344929</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of environmental effects on the measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$) from gravitational wave (GW) observations of binary black hole mergers residing in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) near the central supermassive black hole. Using the potential hierarchical triple merger candidate GW190514-GW190521 in AGN J124942.3+344929 with its electromagnetic counterpart ZTF19abanrhr as a multimessenger case study, we demonstrate that environmental effects can be negligible for mergers at approximately tens to hundreds of Schwarzschild radii from the supermassive black hole. We find $H_0=40.9_{-8.9}^{+19.3}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ (median and 68\% credible interval) under a flat prior and flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. Incorporating GW170817 prior information improves constraints to $H_0=68.8_{-6.0}^{+7.7}\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$. We suggest that in general, AGN environments could serve as viable laboratories for cosmological studies from GW observations where environmental effects remain below detection thresholds.</description>

      <title>Loops in inflation with strongly non-geodesic motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study loop corrections in the effective field theory of inflation with imaginary speed of sound, which has been shown to provide an effective description of multi-field inflationary models characterized by strongly non-geodesic motion and heavy entropic perturbations. We focus on the one-loop corrections to the scalar and tensor power spectra, taking into account all relevant vertices at leading order in derivatives and in slow-roll. We find a power-law dependence of the scalar two-point function on the scale that defines the range of validity of the effective theory, analogous to the enhancement observed in tree-level correlation functions. Even more dramatic, the relative correction to the tensor spectrum is exponentially enhanced, albeit also suppressed in the slow-roll limit. In spite of these large effects, our results show that this class of models can satisfy the requirement of perturbative control and a consistent loop expansion within a range of parameters of phenomenological interest. On the other hand, models predicting large values of the power spectrum on small scales are found to be under strong tension. As a technical bonus, we carefully explain the prescription for the regularization and manipulation of loop integrals in this set-up, where one has a non-trivial domain of integration for time and momentum integrals owing to the regime of validity of the effective field theory. This procedure is general enough to be of potential applicability in other contexts.</description>

Abstract: We apply an ADM deparametrization strategy to radial canonical $\Lambda &lt; 0$ gravity in three dimensions. It gives rise to a concise notation for previous holographic interpretations in terms of an identified radial 'volume time' and 'true' ADM degrees of freedom. We further discuss York time and conformal boundary conditions in this context, and construct a BTZ wavepacket solution to the radial WdW equation.</description>

      <title>No-scale Brans-Dicke Gravity -- ultralight scalar boson &amp; heavy inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is very much intriguing if the Planck scale $M_{\rm{Pl}}$ is not a fundamental parameter. The Brans-Dicke gravity is nothing but the theory where the Planck scale $M_{\rm{Pl}}$ is indeed an illusional parameter. The theory predicts a massless scalar boson whose exchanges between matters induce unwanted long range forces. We solve this problem imposing there is no dimensionful parameter in the theory, even at the quantum level. We further extend the theory by including a $R^2$ term and a non-minimal coupling of the Standard Model Higgs to gravity, as their coefficients are dimensionless. This extension provides a heavy inflaton field that is consistent with all cosmological observations, with a potential very similar to that of the Starobinsky model. The inflaton necessarily decays into the massless scalar bosons, resulting in a non-negligible amount of dark radiation in the present universe. We demonstrate that the inflation model yields a sufficiently high reheating temperature for successful leptogenesis, and we also discuss a possible candidate for dark matter.</description>

      <title>AdS$_3$ Carroll gravity: asymptotic symmetries and C-thermal configurations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The asymptotic structure of three-dimensional Carroll gravity with negative cosmological constant is studied. We formulate a consistent set of boundary conditions preserved by an infinite-dimensional extension of the AdS$_3$ Carroll algebra, which turns out to be isomorphic to a precise generalized BMS$_3$ algebra. This is described by four independent functions of the circle at infinity, generating spatial superrotations, Carroll superboosts, spatial supertranslations and time supertranslations. Remarkably, this asymptotic symmetry algebra contains as subalgebras to BMS$_3$ (generated by spatial superrotations and time supertranslations) and the two-dimensional conformal algebra (spanned by spatial superrotations and spatial supertranslations). We also introduce a new solution - endowed with a Carroll extremal surface - that fulfills this set of asymptotic conditions. By taking advantage of the Chern-Simons formulation of the theory, Carroll thermal properties, obtained from regularity conditions, and entropy of the configuration are also addressed.</description>

      <title>Multimodality in the search for new physics in pulsar timing data and the case of kination-amplified gravitational-wave background from inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the kination-amplified inflationary gravitational-wave background (GWB) interpretation of the signal recently reported by various pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments. Kination is a post-inflationary phase in the expansion history dominated by the kinetic energy of some scalar field, characterized by a stiff equation of state $w=1$. Within the inflationary GWB model, we identify two modes which can fit the current data sets (NANOGrav and EPTA) with equal likelihood: the kination-amplification (KA) mode and the ordinary, non-kination-amplification (no-KA) mode. The multimodality of the likelihood motivates a Bayesian analysis with nested sampling. We analyze the free spectra of current PTA data and mock free spectra constructed with higher signal-to-noise ratios, using nested sampling. The analysis of the mock spectrum designed to be consistent with the best fit to the NANOGrav 15 yr (NG15) data successfully reveals the expected bimodal posterior for the first time while excluding the reheating mode that appears in the fit to the current NG15 data, making a case for our correct treatment of potential multimodal posteriors arising from future PTA data sets. The resultant Bayes factor is $B\equiv Z_\mathrm{no-KA}/Z_\mathrm{KA}=2.9\pm1.9$, indicating comparable statistical significance between the two modes. Given the theoretical model-building challenges of producing highly blue-tilted primordial tensor spectra, the KA mode has the advantage of requiring a less blue primordial spectrum, compared with the no-KA mode. The synergy between future cosmic microwave background polarization, pulsar timing and laser interferometer measurements of gravitational waves will help resolve the ambiguity implied by the multimodal posterior in PTA-only searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.03464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum massive particle and antiparticle pair production and oscillation during reheating result in a holographic and massive pair plasma state. Perturbations in the densities of particles and antiparticles within this plasma form acoustic waves, characterized by symmetric and asymmetric density contrasts. By deriving the acoustic wave equations and identifying the frequencies of the lowest-lying perturbation modes (with zero wave number), the study shows that the wavelengths of these modes, when compared with the horizon size, suggest the possibility of superhorizon crossing during reheating. This crossing leads to particle-antiparticle asymmetry observable by an observer inside the horizon. The decay of massive particles and antiparticles into baryons generates a net baryon number, potentially explaining baryogenesis. The calculated baryon number-to-entropy ratio aligns with observational data. This crossing also accounts for dark matter particle-antiparticle asymmetry in the present Universe. The study also explores perturbation modes with nonzero wave numbers, representing dark-matter acoustic waves. These modes exited the horizon and re-entered after recombination, potentially imprinting on the matter power spectrum at large length scales and influencing the formation of large-scale structures and galaxies.</description>

Abstract: We consider gedanken experiments to destroy Kerr black holes by means of absorbing matter with sufficient energy and angular momentum. It is shown that extremal and near-extremal Kerr black holes cannot be destroyed in a process that includes a second order contribution to its final mass, and matter sources satisfy the null energy condition. Such contribution is calculated using hypersurface integration on the event horizon, and it traces similarities with terms related to matter-black hole interactions and a rotational self-energy lower bound suggested in previous works.</description>

      <title>Rainbow gravity effects on quantum dynamics of scalar and oscillator fields in a topological defect cosmological space-time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.13718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quantum dynamics of scalar and oscillator fields in a topological defect space-time background under the influence of rainbow gravity's. The rainbow gravity's are introduced into the considered cosmological space-time geometry by replacing the temporal part $dt \to \frac{dt}{\mathcal{F}(\chi)}$ and the spatial part $dx^i \to \frac{dx^i}{\mathcal{H} (\chi)}$, where $\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{H}$ are the rainbow functions and $\chi=E/E_p$. We derived the radial equation of the Klein-Gordon equation and its oscillator equation under rainbow gravity's in topological space-time. To obtain eigenvalue of the quantum systems under investigations, we set the rainbow functions $\mathcal{F}(\chi)=1$ and $\mathcal{H}(\chi)=\sqrt{1-\beta\,\chi^p}$, where $p=1,2$. We solve the radial equations through special functions using these rainbow functions and analyze the results. In fact, it is shown that the presence of cosmological constant, the topological defect parameter $\alpha$, and the rainbow parameter $\beta$ modified the energy spectrum of scalar and oscillator fields in comparison to the results obtained in flat space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the tunneling phenomenon of a charged Dirac particle emerging from a thermal horizon of a hot NUT-Kerr-Newman-Kasuya-Anti-de Sitter (HNKNK-AdS) black hole. Considering the tunneling formalism, we report the Hawking temperature of the charged Dirac particle through the horizon and the heat capacity of the HNKNK-AdS black hole. It is found that the effective Hawking temperature for the black hole depends on the black hole's parameters, such as electric and magnetic charges, magnetic mass, the cosmological constant, and the angular momentum of the black hole. The Hawking radiation for the Kerr-Newman black hole is reduced. It is shown that there is a small correction to the Hawking thermal spectrum. The heat capacity for the HNKNK-AdS black hole is found different from the previous work, and for the Kerr-Newman black hole is also reduced.</description>

      <title>Validating Prior-informed Fisher-matrix Analyses against GWTC Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fisher-matrix methods are widely used to predict how accurately parameters can be estimated. Being computationally efficient, this approach is prompted by the large number of signals simulated in forecast studies for future gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, for which adequate analysis tools and computational resources are still unavailable to the scientific community. However, approximating the full likelihood function with a Gaussian may lead to inaccuracies, which we investigate in this work. To assess the accuracy of the Fisher approximation, we compare the results of the Fisher code GWFish against real data from the Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogs (GWTCs) provided by the Virgo/LIGO Bayesian analyses. Additionally, we present a sampling algorithm to include priors in GWFish, not only to ensure a fair comparison between GWFish results and the Virgo/LIGO posteriors but also to investigate the role of prior information and to assess the need to include it in standard Fisher analyses. We find that the impact of priors depends mostly on the level of signal-dependent degeneracy of the waveform parameterization, and priors are generally more important when the level of degeneracy is high. Our findings imply that Fisher-matrix methods are a valid tool for ET science-case studies.</description>

      <title>Efficient Massive Black Hole Binary parameter estimation for LISA using Sequential Neural Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inspiral, merger, and ringdown of Massive Black Hole Binaries (MBHBs) is one the main sources of Gravitational Waves (GWs) for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), an ESA-led mission in the implementation phase. It is expected that LISA will detect these systems throughout the entire observable universe. Robust and efficient data analysis algorithms are necessary to detect and estimate physical parameters for these systems. In this work, we explore the application of Sequential Neural Likelihood, a simulation-based inference algorithm, to detect and characterize MBHB GW signals in synthetic LISA data. We describe in detail the different elements of the method, their performance and possible alternatives that can be used to enhance the performance. Instead of sampling from the conventional likelihood function, which requires a forward simulation for each evaluation, this method constructs a surrogate likelihood that is ultimately described by a neural network trained from a dataset of simulations of the MBHB signals and noise. One important advantage of this method is that, given that the likelihood is independent of the priors, we can iteratively train models that target specific observations in a fraction of the time and computational cost that other traditional and machine learning-based strategies would require. Because of the iterative nature of the method, we are able to train models to obtain qualitatively similar posteriors with less than 2\% of the simulator calls that Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods would require. We compare these posteriors with those obtained from Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques and discuss the differences that appear, in particular in relation with the important role that data compression has in the modular implementation of the method that we present. We also discuss different strategies to improve the performance of the algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16256v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational echoes can be used to probe the structure of spacetime. In this paper, we investigate the gravitational echoes in different braneworld models in five-dimensional spacetime. We derive the gravitational perturbation equations of these models, and obtain the time-dependent evolution equations of the extra-dimensional and radial components. Using a Gaussian wave packet as initial data, we study the time evolution of the gravitational perturbation. By monitoring the evolution of the Gaussian wave packet, the gravitational echoes are observed whether the wave packet is generated from inside or outside the braneworld. Furthermore, we can restrict the parameters of the braneworld by calculating the strength of the first gravitational echo and using the current gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Shadow and quasinormal modes of the rotating Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg (EEH) black hole model is an extension of classical black hole solutions in general relativity, incorporating quantum electrodynamics (QED) effects via the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian. The Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian describes the nonlinear corrections to Maxwell's equations due to virtual electron-positron pair production in a strong electromagnetic field. When this Lagrangian is coupled with Einstein's field equations, it leads to modified black hole solutions that take into account these quantum corrections. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the black hole charge $Q_e$ on the properties of the rotating and electrically charged Einstein-Euler-Heisenberg black holes (EEH). To this aim, we analyzed and discussed findings as to how the black hole charge $Q_e$ affects certain black hole properties such as null regions, shadow cast and its observables, and quasinormal modes (QNMs) relative to the Kerr and Kerr-Newman cases. We find that the presence of a screened charge due to the associated QED effects in this screened Maxwell theory might noticeably alter the properties of black holes, offering insights into the interplay between gravity and quantum field effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present charged spherically symmetric black hole solutions and slowly rotating charged solutions in bumblebee gravity with and without a cosmological constant. The static spherically symmetric solutions describe the Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like black hole and ReissnerNordstr\"om-(anti) de Sitter-like black hole, while the stationary and axially symmetric soltuions describe Kerr-Newman-like black hole and Kerr-Newman-(anti) de Sitter-like black hole. We utilize the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism to study the shadows of the black holes. Additionally, we investigate the effect of the electric charge and Lorentz-violating parameters on the radius of the shadow reference circle and the distortion parameter. We find that the radius of the reference circle decreases with the Lorentz-violating parameter and charge parameter, while the distortion parameter increases with the Lorentz-violating parameter and the charge parameter.</description>

Abstract: The corrections to the cosmological models induced by non-minimal coupling between scalar field and torsion are considered. To determine these corrections in explicit form, the power-law parametrization of these corrections are proposed. The estimates of possible influence of non-minimal coupling between scalar field and torsion on cosmological parameters for inflationary models implying linear relation between tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral index of scalar perturbations are obtained. A procedure for verifying these inflationary models due to the observational constraints on the values of cosmological perturbation parameters is also considered.</description>

      <title>Resonance Locking of Anharmonic $g$-Modes in Coalescing Neutron Star Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutron stars in coalescing binaries deform due to the tidal gravitational fields generated by their companions. During the inspiral phase, the tidal deformation is dominated by the fundamental oscillation ($f$-) mode of the stars. The tide also has sub-dominant gravity ($g$-) modes that are resonantly excited when the linear tidal forcing sweeps through their eigenfrequencies. Beyond the linear order in perturbed fluid displacement, the $g$-modes are anharmonic, i.e., their oscillation frequencies depend on the mode energy. For the lowest-order $g$-mode, we show that when the tidal forcing reaches its linear eigenfrequency, the mode starts to dynamically adjust its energy so that its nonlinearly shifted oscillation frequency always matches that of the driving field. This phenomenon, which we term `resonance locking', persists through the rest of the inspiral, and hence, the mode grows to substantially larger energies than in the linear theory. Using a $1.4$--$1.4\, M_{\odot}$ binary neutron star system with the SLy4 equation of state, we find this results in an extra correction to the frequency-domain gravitational wave (GW) phase of $|\Delta \Psi|\approx 3\,{\rm rad}$ accumulated from the onset of resonance locking at the GW frequency of $94\,{\rm Hz}$ to the merger at $1.05\,{\rm kHz}$. This effect probes details of the internal structure of merging neutron stars beyond their bulk properties such as tidal deformability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate traversable wormholes inspired by the Kiselev framework, which extends classical black hole solutions by incorporating anisotropic fluids. These exotic fluids play a crucial role in cosmology, particularly in explaining phenomena such as the accelerated expansion of the universe. We generalize the Kiselev framework to static, spherically symmetric traversable wormholes and analyze their properties under two distinct models of the redshift function: a constant redshift function and one that varies inversely with the radial coordinate. We examine the energy conditions-specifically the Null Energy Condition (NEC), Weak Energy Condition (WEC), and Strong Energy Condition (SEC)-for these models, demonstrating that only certain exotic fluids can sustain the wormhole structure. Furthermore, we quantify the amount of exotic matter required to maintain these wormholes using the volume integral quantifier and compare our results with other wormhole models. Additionally, we compute the effective potential for photons in Kiselev-inspired wormholes under both redshift function models and analyze their implications for weak gravitational lensing. Our findings suggest that Kiselev-inspired wormholes could serve as viable candidates for exotic geometries, potentially paving the way for future observational verification.</description>

      <title>Estimating the strength of Lorentzian distribution in non-commutative geometry by solar system tests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06628v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study four classical tests of Schwarzschild space-time with Lorentzian distribution in non-commutative geometry. We performed detailed calculations of the first-order corrections induced by the non-commutative parameter on planetary orbital precession, light deflection, radar wave delay, and gravitational redshift. The study showed that the impact of the non-commutative parameter on the time-like geodesics is significantly greater than its effect on the null geodesics. By using a series of precise experimental observations, the allowable range for the non-commutative parameter is ultimately constrained within $\Theta\leq0.067579~\mathrm{m}^{2}$, which is given by Mercury's orbital precession. This result aligns with the view that $\sqrt{\Theta}$ is of the order of the Planck length. Moreover, this constrained parameter range exceeds the Planck scale by a significant margin.</description>

      <title>Connecting Gravity and Quantum Physics: Primordial Black Holes and Accelerated Evolution of the Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a new framework to explore the fundamental relationship between gravity and quantum mechanics, with particular emphasis on the fundamental role of primordial black holes (PBHs) in cosmology. Through the concept of self-gravitating condensed light in the form of the experimentally discovered quantum photon Bose-Einstein condensate, this work examines the quantized gravitational, informational, thermodynamical, traditional, and other attributes of PBHs and their implications for early universe dynamics, baryogenesis, the very early formation of galaxies, supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and large-scale structures. Precise calculations have shown that primordial protogalaxies with supermassive black holes at their centers of gravity were formed before the recombination epoch. By solving issues like the cosmological constant problem and the information loss paradox, dark matter and dark energy, this work provides insights into Planck-scale physics and it's impact to cosmology. In such a way PBHs serve as a bridge between quantum theory and general relativity. This study ultimately posits that presented PBH physics is essential to resolving major cosmological and astrophysical issues, paradoxes and "mysteries", such as the accelerated evolution of the Universe established by JWST and other observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In metric-affine gravity, both the gravitational and matter actions depend not just on the metric, but also on the independent affine connection. Thus matter can be modeled as a hyperfluid, characterized by both the energy-momentum and hypermomentum tensors. The latter is defined as the variation of the matter action with respect to the connection and it encodes extra (micro)properties of particles. For a homogeneous and isotropic universe, it was recently shown that the generic cosmological hypermomentum possesses five degrees of freedom: one in dilation, two in shear, and two in spin part. The aim of the current work is to present the first systematic study of the implications of this perfect hyperfluid on the universe with Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric. We adopt a simple model with non-Riemannian Einstein-Hilbert gravitational action plus arbitrary hyperfluid matter, and solve analytically the cosmological equations for single and multiple component hypermomentum contributions using different assumptions about the equation of state. It is remarkable, that in a number of cases the forms of the time evolution of the Hubble function and energy density still coincide with their general relativity counterparts, only the respective indexes $\mathrm{w}_{\mathrm{eff}}$ and $\mathrm{w}_\rho$ start to differ due to the hypermomentum corrections. The results and insights we obtained are very general and can assist in constructing interesting models to resolve the issues in standard cosmology.</description>

      <title>Decoding Long-duration Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Stars with Machine Learning: Parameter Estimation and Equations of State</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) from binary neutron stars (BNSs) offer valuable understanding of the nature of compact objects and hadronic matter. However, their analysis requires substantial computational resources due to the challenges in Bayesian stochastic sampling. The third-generation (3G) GW detectors are expected to detect BNS signals with significantly increased signal duration, detection rates, and signal strength, leading to a major computational burden in the 3G era. We demonstrate a machine learning-based workflow capable of producing source parameter estimation and constraints on equations of state (EOSs) for hours-long BNS signals in seconds with minimal hardware costs. We employ efficient compressions on the GW data and EOS using neural networks, based on which we build normalizing flows for inferences. Given that full Bayesian analysis is prohibitively time-intensive, we validate our model against (semi-)analytical predictions. Additionally, we estimate the computational demands of BNS signal analysis in the 3G era, showing that the machine learning methods will be crucial for future catalog-level analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05379v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terrestrial long-baseline atom interferometer experiments are emerging as powerful tools for probing new fundamental physics, including searches for dark matter and gravitational waves. In the frequency range relevant to these signals, gravity gradient noise (GGN) poses a significant challenge. While previous studies for vertical instruments have focused on GGN induced by seismic waves, atmospheric fluctuations in pressure and temperature also lead to variations in local gravity. In this work, we advance the understanding of atmospheric GGN in vertical atom interferometers, formulating a robust characterization of its impact. We evaluate the effectiveness of underground placement of atom interferometers as a passive noise mitigation strategy. Additionally, we empirically derive global high- and low-noise models for atmospheric pressure GGN and estimate an analogous range for atmospheric temperature GGN. To highlight the variability of temperature-induced noise, we compare data from three prospective experimental sites. Our findings establish atmospheric GGN as comparable to seismic noise in its impact and underscore the importance of including these effects in site selection and active noise monitoring for future experiments.</description>

Abstract: In a brane-world context in which our universe would be a four-dimensional brane embedded into a five-dimensional spacetime or bulk, wormhole geometries are induced on branes. In this article, the Morris-Thorne wormhole and the Molina-Neves wormhole are obtained on the brane using the Nakas-Kanti approach, which starts from a regular five-dimensional spacetime to obtain known black hole and wormhole solutions on the four-dimensional brane. From the bulk perspective, these wormholes are five-dimensional solutions supported by an exotic fluid, but from the brane perspective, such objects are wormholes not supported by any fields or particles that live on the four-dimensional spacetime. Thus, the cause of these wormholes is the bulk influence on the brane.</description>

Abstract: Exact solutions describing multiple, electrically charged black holes (BHs) in a model of nonlinear electrodynamics (NLE) minimally coupled to Einstein's gravity are presented. The NLE model is ModMax theory, that has attracted much attention due to its duality and conformal invariance, features shared with standard (linear) electrodynamics. In the nonextremal case, the solution has conical singularities, similarly to the multi Reissner-Nordstr\"om solution in Einstein-Maxwell theory. In the extremal case the solution is regular on and outside the event horizon; it is isometric to the Majumdar-Papapetrou solution, although the individual BHs have a nonunitary charge to mass ratio, due to screening effects. Using the ModMax electromagnetic duality invariance, magnetically charged and dyonic generalizations are also obtained. Finally, we construct multi-BH solutions with a positive cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Black hole in the Dekel-Zhao dark matter profile</title>

Abstract: Motivated by the work of Cardoso et al. [Phys. Rev. D 105 (2022) 6, L061501, https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.L061501] on black holes in galaxies, we derive a new black hole solution surrounded by a Dekel-Zhao (DZ) dark matter profile. The derived metric, influenced by DZ profile parameters, exhibits two distinct regimes: for $r \ll r_{\rm c}$ (\textcolor{black}{$r_{\rm c}$ is a characteristic radius}), exponential corrections dominate, producing significant deviations from the Schwarzschild solution near dense cores, while for $r \gg r_{\rm c}$, these corrections vanish, restoring the Schwarzschild metric at large distances. These findings ensure consistency with general relativity in vacuum. \textcolor{black}{The black hole shadow and deflection angle are analyzed, demonstrating that the shadow radius increases with black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$), while higher central densities ($\rho_{\rm ch}$) result in smaller shadows, reflecting the environmental impact of dense dark matter halos.} Photon dynamics reveal how DZ profiles modify critical impact parameters and effective potentials, with gravitational lensing effects highly sensitive to the characteristic radius ($r_{\rm c}$). Smaller $r_{\rm c}$ values lead to larger deflection angles due to stronger gravitational effects near compact cores. This work highlights the significance dark matter profiles in shaping black hole observables, providing a theoretical foundation for future observational studies and advancing the understanding of dark matter-black hole interactions in astrophysical and cosmological contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, following our recent findings in [1], we extend our analysis to explore the generalization of spherically symmetric and static black-bounce solutions, known from General Relativity, within the framework of the $f(R)$ theory in the metric formalism. We develop a general approach to determine the sources for any model where $f(R) = R + H(R)$, provided that the corresponding source for the bounce metric in General Relativity is known. As a result, we demonstrate that black-bounce solutions can emerge from this theory when considering the coupling of $f(R)$ gravity with nonlinear electrodynamics and a partially phantom scalar field. We also analyzed the energy conditions of these solutions and found that, unlike in General Relativity, it is possible to satisfy all energy conditions in certain regions of space-time.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties and Joule-Thomson expansion of AdS black hole with Gaussian distribution in non-commutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12363v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermodynamics and Joule-Thomson expansion of anti-de Sitter black hole (AdS BH) with Gaussian distribution in non-commutative geometry is systematically studied. The metric of Gaussian-distributed BH is obtained, showing a dS geometry at the core of BH. The research indicates that the BH characterized by a Gaussian distribution exhibit thermodynamic properties that are remarkably similar to those of BH with a Lorentzian distribution in non-commutative geometry. This similarity is specifically manifested in the small BH-large BH phase transition, the corrected first law of thermodynamics, the criticality, the heat capacity, the zeroth-order phase transition and the Joule-Thomson process. Notably, the critical ratio of Gaussian-distributed BH (0.46531) is significantly larger than those observed in Van der Waals fluids (0.375), and indeed, it is also substantially exceed those of Lorentzian-distributed BH (0.36671). Moreover, compared to the case of Lorentzian source, the zeroth-order phase transition effect in Gaussian-distributed BH is exceedingly subtle (accompanied by a relative increase in the Gibbs free energy on the order of $10^{-3}\!\sim\!\!10^{-2}$) and is difficult to detect distinctly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate quasinormal modes and gray-body factors of a massive scalar field in the background of three compact objects in the Weyl gravity: Schwarzschild-like black holes, known as Mannheim-Kazanas solution, non-Schwrazschild-like black holes and traversable wormholes found recently in [P. Jizba, K. Mudru\v{n}ka, Phys.Rev.D 110 (2024) 12, 124006]. We show that the spectrum of the massive field is qualitatively different from massless one both in the frequency and time domains. While the mass term leads to much longer lifetime of the modes, the arbitrarily long-lived modes, known as quasi-resonances, are not achieved.</description>

Abstract: We propose a new formula for the entropy of a dynamical cosmological event horizon, which is valid to leading order for perturbations of a stationary asymptotically de Sitter spacetime. By introducing a nontrivial correction term, we generalize Gibbons and Hawking's first law of event horizons to non-stationary eras. We also develop the non-stationary physical process first law between two arbitrary horizon cross-sections for the cosmological event horizon.</description>

      <title>Charged Black Holes in the Kalb-Ramond Background with Lorentz Violation: Null Geodesics and Optical Appearance of a Thin Accretion Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the optical appearance of a charged black hole in the Kalb-Ramond background, incorporating a Lorentz-violating parameter $l=0.01$. By analyzing the null geodesics, we derive the photon sphere, event horizon, effective potential, and critical impact parameters. We then employ a ray-tracing technique to study the trajectories of photons surrounding a thin accretion disk. Three different emission models are considered to explore the observed intensity profiles of direct rings, lensing rings, and photon sphere. By comparing these results with those of the standard Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole ($l=0$) and the Kalb-Ramond black hole with different values of Lorentz-violating parameter (specifically, $l=0.05$ and $l=0.1$ respectively), we find that the Lorentz symmetry breaking will lead to a decrease in the radii of the photon sphere, the event horizon, and the innermost stable circular orbit. Consequently, this makes the detection of these black holes more challenging.</description>

Abstract: In the $SO(2,d)$ gauge theory formalism of AdS gravity established in arXiv:1811.05286, the dynamics of bulk gravity emerges from the vanishing of the boundary covariant anomaly for the $SO(2,d)$ conservation law. In parallel with the known results on chiral anomalies, we establish the descendent structure of the holographic $SO(2,d)$ anomaly. The corresponding anomaly characteristic class, bulk Chern-Simons like action as well as the boundary effective action are constructed systematically. The anomalous conservation law is presented both in the covariant and consistent formalisms. Due to the existence of the ruler field, not only the Bardeen-Zumino polynomial, but also the covariant and consistent currents are explicitly constructed.</description>

      <title>One-Loop Correction to the AdS/BCFT Partition Function in the Three Dimensional Pure Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.00206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the tree-level partition function of Euclidean BTZ black hole with the end of the world branes (ETW branes) for arbitrary tension and the one-loop partition function of Euclidean thermal $AdS_{3}$ in the presence of a tensionless ETW brane with the Neumann boundary condition. At the tree level, our results match with the previous ones in non-rotating cases, but at the one-loop level, our results contain unexpected terms, which contain the fluctuations of the ghost fields. However particularly in the case where the chemical potential is zero, we get a similar form as the original result in AdS/CFT case, but the exponent is slightly changed. In this case the ghost contribution looks going away and the partition function becomes physical in a sense that the coefficients of the expansion in powers of $q$ are positive, which means that the number of states at the level is always positive.</description>

      <title>LiteBIRD Science Goals and Forecasts. A Case Study of the Origin of Primordial Gravitational Waves using Large-Scale CMB Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the possibility of using the $LiteBIRD$ satellite $B$-mode survey to constrain models of inflation producing specific features in CMB angular power spectra. We explore a particular model example, i.e. spectator axion-SU(2) gauge field inflation. This model can source parity-violating gravitational waves from the amplification of gauge field fluctuations driven by a pseudoscalar "axionlike" field, rolling for a few e-folds during inflation. The sourced gravitational waves can exceed the vacuum contribution at reionization bump scales by about an order of magnitude and can be comparable to the vacuum contribution at recombination bump scales. We argue that a satellite mission with full sky coverage and access to the reionization bump scales is necessary to understand the origin of the primordial gravitational wave signal and distinguish among two production mechanisms: quantum vacuum fluctuations of spacetime and matter sources during inflation. We present the expected constraints on model parameters from $LiteBIRD$ satellite simulations, which complement and expand previous studies in the literature. We find that $LiteBIRD$ will be able to exclude with high significance standard single-field slow-roll models, such as the Starobinsky model, if the true model is the axion-SU(2) model with a feature at CMB scales. We further investigate the possibility of using the parity-violating signature of the model, such as the $TB$ and $EB$ angular power spectra, to disentangle it from the standard single-field slow-roll scenario. We find that most of the discriminating power of $LiteBIRD$ will reside in $BB$ angular power spectra rather than in $TB$ and $EB$ correlations.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM cosmology from a type-II minimally modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have successfully integrated $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, a promising model for alleviating cosmological tensions, into a theoretical framework by endowing it with a specific Lagrangian from the VCDM model, a type-II minimally modified gravity. In this theory, we demonstrate that an auxiliary scalar field with a linear potential induces an effective cosmological constant, enabling the realization of an abrupt mirror AdS-dS transition in the late universe through a piecewise linear potential. To eliminate the sudden singularity in this setup and ensure stable transitions, we smooth out this potential. Realized within the VCDM theory, the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model facilitates two types of rapid smooth mirror AdS-dS transitions: (i) the agitated transition, associated with a smooth jump in the potential, where $\Lambda_{\rm s}$, and consequently $H$, exhibits a bump around the transition's midpoint; and (ii) the quiescent transition, associated with a smooth change in the slope of the potential, where $\Lambda_{\rm s}$ transitions gracefully. These transitions are likely to leave distinct imprints on the background and perturbation dynamics, potentially allowing the observational data to distinguish between them. This novel theoretical framework propels $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM into a fully predictive model capable of exploring the evolution of the Universe including the late-time AdS-dS transition epoch, and extends the applicability of the model. We believe further research is crucial in establishing $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM as a leading candidate or guide for a new concordance cosmological model.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that, by utilizing the boundary conformal field theory (BCFT) operator algebra of the Liouville CFT, one can express its path-integral on any Riemann surface as a three dimensional path-integral with appropriate boundary conditions, generalising the recipe for rational CFTs \cite{Hung:2019bnq, Brehm:2021wev, Chen:2022wvy, Cheng:2023kxh}. This serves as a constructive method for deriving the \textit{quantum} holographic dual of the CFT, which reduces to Einstein gravity in the large central charge limit. As a byproduct, the framework provides an explicit discrete state-sum of a 3D non-chiral topological theory constructed from quantum $6j$ symbols of $\mathcal{U}_q(sl(2,\mathbb{R}))$ with non-trivial boundary conditions, representing a long-sought non-perturbative discrete formulation of 3D pure gravity with negative cosmological constant, at least within a class of three manifolds. This constitutes the first example of an exact holographic tensor network that reproduces a known irrational CFT with a precise quantum gravitational interpretation.</description>

      <title>How to define the moving frame of the Unruh-DeWitt detector on manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19160v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The physical phenomena seen by an observer are defined for a local inertial system that is subjective to the observer. Such a coordinate system is called a ``moving frame'' because it changes from time to time. However, unlike the Thomas precession, the Unruh-DeWitt detector has been discussed for a fixed frame. We discuss the Unruh-DeWitt detector by defining the vacuum for the moving frame, showing that the problem of the Stokes phenomenon can be solved by using the vierbeins and the exact WKB, to find factor 2 discrepancy from the standard result. Differential geometry is constructed in such a way that local calculations can be performed rigorously. If one expects Markov property, the calculation is expected to be local. The final piece that was missing was a local non-perturbative calculation, which is now complemented by the exact WKB. Our analysis defines a serious problem regarding the relationship between entanglement of the Unruh effect and differential geometry.</description>

      <title>Revisiting subregion holography using OPE blocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09027v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short note, we revisit the entanglement wedge representation of AdS$_3$ bulk fields in terms of CFT operator product expansion (OPE) blocks for a general class of blocks. Given a boundary interval and its associated causal diamond, the OPEs involve boundary operators with or without spin, and located either at spacelike or timelike edges of the diamond. Only for a subset of these cases, can the OPE block be dual to a geodesic bulk field. We show that when applied to de Sitter, a suitable combination of Euclidean OPE blocks can represent a dS scalar integrated over the timelike extremal surfaces, which play an important role in defining pseudo-entropy. We also work out some simple higher dimensional examples.</description>

      <title>Nanohertz gravitational waves from a quasar-based supermassive black hole binary population model as dark sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, several pulsar timing array (PTA) projects have detected evidence of the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nanohertz frequency band, providing confidence in detecting individual supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the future. Nanohertz GWs emitted by inspiraling SMBHBs encode the luminosity distances of SMBHBs. They can serve as dark sirens to explore the cosmic expansion history via a statistical method to obtain the redshift information of GW sources' host galaxies using galaxy catalogs. The theoretical analysis of the dark siren method relies on the modeling of the population of SMBHBs. Using a population model consistent with the latest SGWB observations is essential, as the SGWB provides significant information about the distribution of SMBHBs. In this work, we employ a quasar-based model, which can self-consistently account for the SGWB amplitude, to estimate the population of SMBHBs. We constrain the Hubble constant using the mock GW data from different detection cases of PTAs in the future. Our results show that a PTA consisting of 100 pulsars with a white noise level of 20 ns could measure the Hubble constant with a precision close to $1\%$ over a 10-year observation period, and a PTA with 200 pulsars may achieve this goal over a 5-year observation period. The results indicate that modeling the SMBHB population significantly influences the analysis of dark sirens, and SMBHB dark sirens have the potential to be developed as a valuable cosmological probe.</description>

Abstract: We consider trajectories of massless particles in the presence of charged black holes in asymptotically AdS spacetimes in arbitrary dimensions. We study the properties of the photon ring in the (near-)extremal limit and show that the photon ring can probe the near-horizon region in two different scenarios: in high enough number of spacetime dimensions or when the massless particle carries an electric charge. We propose a simple $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription for implementing the JWKB approximation and show its utility in various contexts. We calculate the quasi-normal modes for charged fields in the eikonal limit and show the emergence of a new time-scale of relaxation in the dual field theory side. In the near-extremal limit, we show generally that the time-scale of decay of the perturbations is governed by the chemical potential. We also verify our analytical results numerically. The $\mathrm{i} \epsilon$-prescription allows us to study the superradiant modes and the associated instabilities in the eikonal limit easily. We comment on some related aspects regarding near-extremal black holes.</description>

      <title>Induced gravitational waves for arbitrary higher orders: vertex rules and loop diagrams in cosmological perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves induced by primordial perturbations serve as crucial probes for studying the early universe, providing a significant window into potential new physics during cosmic evolution. Due to the potentially large amplitudes of primordial perturbations on small scales, the contributions of high-order cosmological perturbations are highly significant. We propose a vertex approach applicable to the study of induced gravitational waves for arbitrary higher orders. Using the vertex approach and tree diagrams, we can directly derive the explicit expressions of higher-order induced gravitational waves without involving the complex and lengthy calculations of higher-order cosmological perturbations. Correlations between different tree diagrams correspond to the loop diagrams of two-point correlation functions of induced gravitational waves. Our investigation reveals that one-particle reducible diagrams impact tensor-scalar induced gravitational waves while leaving scalar induced gravitational waves unaffected.</description>

      <title>Dual Dressed Black Holes as the end point of the Charged Superradiant instability in ${\cal N} = 4$ Yang Mills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charged Black holes in $AdS_5 \times S^5$ suffer from superradiant instabilities over a range of energies. Hairy black hole solutions (constructed within gauged supergravity) have previously been proposed as endpoints to this instability. We demonstrate that these hairy black holes are themselves unstable to the emission of large dual giant gravitons. We propose that the endpoint to this instability is given by Dual Dressed Black Holes (DDBH)s; configurations consisting of one, two, or three very large dual giant gravitons surrounding a core $AdS$ black hole with one, two, or three $SO(6)$ chemical potentials equal to unity. The dual giants each live at $AdS$ radial coordinates of order $\sqrt{N}$ and each carry charge of order $N^2$. The large separation makes DDBHs a very weakly interacting mix of their components and allows for a simple computation of their thermodynamics. We conjecture that DDBHs dominate the phase diagram of ${\cal N}=4$ Yang-Mills over a range of energies around the BPS plane, and provide an explicit construction of this phase diagram, briefly discussing the interplay with supersymmetry. We develop the quantum description of dual giants around black hole backgrounds and explicitly verify that DDBHs are stable to potential tunneling instabilities, precisely when the chemical potentials of the core black holes equal unity. We also construct the 10-dimensional DDBH bulk solutions.</description>

      <title>XTE J1814-338: A potential hybrid star candidate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18498v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent analysis on the properties of the XTE J1814-338 pulsar yielded a small radius value around ~ 7 km. Notably, this estimation is significantly lower compared to the currently inferred values for the radius of neutron stars (as they are derived from both theoretical calculations and corresponding observations). In this paper, we focus on the construction of hybrid equations of state (EOSs) for the possible reconciliation of the exotic XTE J1814-338 properties. Our analysis indicates that an equation of state involving a sufficiently strong phase transition could potentially lead to the explanation of the size and mass of such a compact object. By examining the sign of the $dM/dP_c$ slope, we found that stellar configurations compatible to XTE J1814-338 are only stable for a "stiff" low density phase. For a "soft" hadronic EOS selection the stability of the resulting configurations may not be satisfied in terms of the turning point criterion. However, a complementary analysis, for the radial oscillations of the aforementioned configurations, indicated their stability when a slow phase conversion is considered.</description>

      <title>On Chord Dynamics and Complexity Growth in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the time evolution governed by the two-sided chord Hamiltonian in the double-scaled SYK model, which induces a probability distribution over operators in the double-scaled algebra. Through the bulk-to-boundary map, this distribution translates into dynamical profiles of bulk states within the chord Hilbert space. We derive analytic expressions for such profiles, valid across a broad parameter range and all time scales. Additionally, we demonstrate how distinct semi-classical behaviors emerge by localizing within specific energy regions in the semi-classical limit. We revisit the doubled Hilbert space formalism as an isometric map between the one-particle sector of the chord Hilbert space and the doubled zero-particle sector. Utilizing this map, we obtain analytic results for correlation functions and investigate the dynamical evolution for chord operators. Specifically, we establish an equivalence between the chord number generating function in presence of matter chords and the crossed four-point correlation function, the latter is closely related to the $6j$-symbol of $U_{\sqrt{q}}(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$. We also explore finite-temperature effects, showing that operator spreading slows as temperature decreases. In the semi-classical limit, we perform a saddle point analysis and incorporate the one-loop determinant to derive the normalized time-ordered four-point correlation function at infinite temperature. The leading correction reproduces the \(1/N\) connected contribution observed in the large-\(p\) SYK model. Finally, we examine the time evolution of total chord number in presence of matter in the triple-scaled regime, linking it to the renormalized two-sided length in JT gravity with matter.</description>

      <title>Dynamical black hole entropy beyond general relativity from the Einstein frame</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00647v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently Hollands, Wald and Zhang proposed a new formula for the entropy of a dynamical black hole for an arbitrary theory of gravity obtained from a diffeomorphism covariant Lagrangian via the Noether charge method. We present an alternative, pedagogical derivation of the dynamical black hole entropy for $f(R)$ gravity as well as canonical scalar-tensor theory by means of conformal transformations. First, in general relativity we generalize Visser and Yan's pedagogical proof of the non-stationary physical process first law to black holes that may not be in vacuum, and give a pedagogical derivation of the second-order behavior of the dynamical black hole entropy for vacuum perturbations by considering the second-order variation of the Raychaudhuri equation. Second, we apply the derivation for general relativity to theories in the Einstein frames, and then recast the conclusions in their original frames. We show that the dynamical black hole entropy formulae of these theories satisfy both the non-stationary physical process first law and the non-stationary comparison first law via the Einstein frame. We further study the second-order behavior of the dynamical black hole entropy for vacuum perturbations, and observe that the second law is obeyed at second order in those theories. Using the Einstein frame, we also determine the relationship between the dynamical black hole entropy and the Wald entropy of the generalized apparent horizon in the original frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently proposed $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The slope of the potential in the inflaton direction is exponentially suppressed at large values of the inflaton field, but the slope of the potential in the axion direction is double-exponentially suppressed. Therefore, the axion field remains nearly massless and practically does not change during inflation. The inflationary trajectory in such models is stable with respect to quantum fluctuations of the axion field. We show that isocurvature perturbations do not feed into the curvature perturbations during inflation, and discuss the possibility of such transfer at the post-inflationary stage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study geometric modular flows in two-dimensional conformal field theories. We explore which states exhibit a geometric modular flow with respect to a causally complete subregion and, conversely, how to construct a state from a given geometric modular flow. Given suitable boundary conditions, we find that generic geometric modular flows in the Rindler wedge are conformally equivalent. Based on this insight, we show how conformal unitaries can be used to explicitly construct a state for each flow. We analyze these states, deriving general formulas for the energy density and entanglement entropy. We also consider geometric flows beyond the Rindler wedge setting, and in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov emission by a fast-moving uncharged Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02811v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in the presence of an external magnetic field, an uncharged classical Schwarzschild black hole moving superluminally in a dielectric with permittivity $\epsilon &gt; 1$ produces Cherenkov emission. This is a new physical effect: classical (non-quantum) emission of electromagnetic waves by a completely charge-neutral ``particle''. The governing equations (involving General Relativity, electromagnetism, and the physics of continuous media) have no external electromagnetic source - it is the distortion of the initial electromagnetic fields by the gravity of the black hole that plays the role of a superluminally moving source. The effect relies on nonzero values of both the magnetic field and the gravitational radius, as well as on the usual Cherenkov condition on the velocity, $v/c &gt; 1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$. Unlike Cherenkov emission by a point charge, the effective source in this case is spatially distributed, with emission generated along the single Cherenkov emission cone. The emitted spectrum is red-dominated, with power $\propto dk_z /|k_z|$ for wave numbers $|k_z| \leq 1/R_G$, where $R_G$ is the Schwarzschild radius. We comment on possible observability of this process during black hole -- neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Page Time of Primordial Black Holes in the Standard Model and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Page time marks the moment when the von Neumann entropy of the emitted Hawking radiation equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of an evaporating black hole, which is assumed to quantify its degrees of freedom as seen from the outside. Beyond this point, from unitarity we would expect that the entropy of the radiation begins to decrease, ensuring that information is eventually recovered. In this work, we investigate the dependence of the Page time on black hole properties and the particle content of nature. Specifically, we analyze its sensitivity to the Standard Model (SM) and potential Beyond-the-SM degrees of freedom, incorporating the effects of particle masses. We find that a Schwarzschild primordial black hole (PBH) with an initial mass of $6.23\times 10^{14}~{\rm g}$ would have a Page time equal to the age of the Universe, assuming emission of SM particles only. We further explore the impact of a non-negligible PBH angular momentum, finding that light spin-2 particles are predominantly emitted before the Page time. Specifically, for initial angular momenta values exceeding $a_\star &gt; 0.5$, approximately $70\%$ of the total graviton emission occurs prior to the Page time for PBHs with an initial mass $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{10}~{\rm g}$. Finally, we discuss the implications for PBH phenomenology, particularly regarding potential constraints from $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ measurements.</description>

Abstract: We perform fully relativistic simulations of the head-on collisions between intermediate-mass black holes and very massive stars. Such collisions are expected to occur in dense stellar clusters and may play an important role in growing the mass of the seed black hole. For the cases considered here, for which the masses of the black holes and stars are comparable, the vast majority of the stellar material is accreted onto the black hole within a stellar dynamical timescale, as expected from analytical estimates, and leads to a rapid growth of the black hole. A small amount of mass, which is shock-heated in the wake of the black hole, is ejected from the collision and will contribute to the interstellar material in the cluster.</description>

      <title>Puzzles in 3D Off-Shell Geometries via VTQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We point out a difficulty with a naive application of Virasoro TQFT methods to compute path integrals for two types of off-shell 3-dimensional geometries. Maxfield-Turiaci proposed solving the negativity problem of pure 3d gravity by summing over off-shell geometries known as Seifert manifolds. We attempt to compute Seifert manifolds using Virasoro TQFT. Our results don't match completely with Maxfield-Turiaci. We trace the discrepancies to not including the mapping class group properly. We also compute a 3-boundary torus-wormhole by extrapolating from an on-shell geometry. We encounter challenges similar to those observed in the comparison between the genuine off-shell computation of a torus-wormhole by Cotler-Jensen and the extrapolation from an on-shell configuration.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction coefficients from Amplitubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graph its set of connected subgraphs (tubes) can be defined in two ways: either by considering subsets of edges, or by considering subsets of vertices. We refer to these as binary tubes and unary tubes respectively. Both notions come with a natural compatibility condition between tubes which differ by a simple adjacency constraint. Compatible sets of tubes are refered to as tubings. By considering the set of binary tubes, and summing over all maximal binary-tubings, one is lead to an expression for the flat space wavefunction coefficients relevant for computing cosmological correlators. On the other hand, considering the set of unary tubes, and summing over all maximal unary-tubings, one is lead to expressions recently referred to as amplitubes which resemble the scattering amplitudes of $\text{tr}(\phi^3)$ theory. In this paper we study the two definitions of tubing in order to provide a new formula for the flat space wavefunction coefficient for a single graph as a sum over products of amplitubes. Motivated by our rewriting of the wavefunction coefficient we introduce a new definition of tubing which makes use of both the binary and unary tubes which we refer to as cut tubings. We explain how each cut tubing induces a decorated orientation of the underlying graph satisfying an acyclic condition and demonstrate how the set of all acyclic decorated orientations for a given graph count the number of basis functions appearing in the kinematic flow.</description>

      <title>Association of 220 PeV Neutrino KM3-230213A with Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the KM3NeT Collaboration announced the detection of a 220 PeV neutrino from the celestial coordinates RA=94.3\degree~ and Dec=-7.8\degree~ on 13 February 2023 at 01:16:47 UTC \cite{KM3NeT:2025npi}. The source for this extra-ordinary cosmic neutrino, designated KM3-230213A, is not identified yet but there has been speculation that it might be associated with a gamma-ray burst GRB~090401B \cite{Amelino-Camelia:2025lqn}. The purpose of this report is to search the association of this 220 PeV neutrino with potential GRB sources from a more general consideration of Lorentz invariance violation (LV) without predefined LV scale. We try to associate this extra-ordinary neutrino with potential GRBs within angular separation of 1\degree, 3\degree~ and 5\degree~ respectively and the results are listed in Table 1. We find the constraints $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.3\times 10^{18}$~GeV for subluminal LV violation and $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.6\times 10^{19}$~GeV for superluminal LV violation if KM3-230213A is a GRB neutrino.</description>

      <title>The wavefunction of a quantum $S^1 \times S^2$ universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum gravity corrections to the no-boundary wavefunction describing a universe with spatial topology $S^1\times S^2$. It has been suggested that quantum effects become increasingly important when the size of the circle is large relative to the sphere. In this paper, we confirm this claim by an explicit four-dimensional one-loop calculation of the gravitational path integral preparing such a state. In the process, we clarify some aspects of the gravitational path integral on complex spacetimes. These quantum corrections play a crucial role in ensuring that the norm of the wavefunction is naturally expressed in terms of a path integral over $S^2 \times S^2$ at the classical level. We extend some of the analysis to more general spatial topologies, as well as to the inclusion of fermions.</description>
