      <title>DamFormer: Generalizing Morphologies in Dam Break Simulations Using Transformer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of waves with structural barriers such as dams breaking plays a critical role in flood defense and tsunami disasters. In this work, we explore the dynamic changes in wave surfaces impacting various structural shapes, e.g., circle, triangle, and square, by using deep learning techniques. We introduce the DamFormer, a novel transformer-based model designed to learn and simulate these complex interactions. The model was trained and tested on simulated data representing the three structural forms.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Quasi-Integrable Equations from traveling-wave data using the Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are used to study vortex solutions in the 2+1 dimensional nonlinear partial differential equations. These solutions include the regularized long-wave (RLW) equation and the Zakharov-Kuznetsov (ZK) equation, which are toy models of the geostrophic shallow water model in the planetary atmosphere. PINNs successfully solve these equations in the forward process and the solutions are obtained using the mesh-free approach and automatic differentiation while accounting for conservation laws. In the inverse process, the proper equations can be successfully derived from a given training data. Since these equations have a lot in common, there are situations when substantial misidentification arises during the inverse analysis. We consider PINNs with conservation laws (referred to as cPINNs), deformations of the initial profiles, and a friction approach that provides excellent discrimination of the equations to improve the identification's resolution.</description>

      <title>Bilayer one-dimensional Convection-Diffusion-Reaction-Source problem. Analytical and numerical solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a theoretical analysis of a one-dimensional heat transfer problem in two layers involving diffusion, advection, internal heat generation or loss linearly dependent on temperature in each layer, and heat generation due to external sources. Additionally, the thermal resistance at the interface between the materials is considered. The situation of interest is modeled mathematically, explicit analytical solutions are found using Fourier techniques, and a convergent finite difference scheme is formulated to simulate specific cases. The solution is consistent with previous results. A numerical example is included that shows coherence between the obtained results and the physics of the problem. The conclusions drawn in this work expand the theoretical understanding of two-layer heat transfer and may also contribute to improving the thermal design of multilayer engineering systems.</description>

      <title>Performance characteristics and bluff-body modeling of high-blockage cross-flow turbine arrays with varying rotor geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While confinement is understood to increase the power and thrust coefficients of cross-flow turbines, how the optimal rotor geometry changes with the blockage ratio -- defined as the ratio between the array projected area and the channel cross-sectional area -- has not been systematically explored. Here, the interplay between rotor geometry and the blockage ratio on turbine performance is investigated experimentally with an array of two identical cross-flow turbines at blockage ratios from 35% to 55%. Three geometric parameters are varied -- the number of blades, the chord-to-radius ratio, and the preset pitch angle -- resulting in 180 unique combinations of rotor geometry and blockage ratio. While the optimal chord-to-radius ratio and preset pitch angle do not depend on the blockage ratio, the optimal blade count increases with the blockage ratio -- an inversion of the relationship between efficiency and blade count typically observed at lower blockage. To explore the combined effects of rotor geometry, rotation rate, and the blockage ratio on array performance, we utilize two bluff-body models: dynamic solidity (which relates thrust to the rotor geometry and kinematics) and Maskell-inspired linear momentum theory (which describes the array-channel interaction as a function of the blockage ratio and thrust). By combining these models, we demonstrate that the array time-average thrust coefficient increases with dynamic solidity in a manner that is self-similar across blockage ratios. Overall, these results highlight key design principles for cross-flow turbines in confined flow and provide insights into the similarities between the dynamics of cross-flow turbines and bluff bodies at high blockage.</description>

      <title>Modelling the influence of streamwise flow field acceleration on the aerodynamic performance of an actuator disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Streamwise acceleration of the background flow field is one of various effects occurring when wind turbines operate under non-idealized conditions, such as in complex terrain or in dense wind farms. Thus, studying this effect is essential to improve understanding of aerodynamic performance in these cases. In the present work, a simple model based on momentum theory is derived for the situation of an actuator disc (AD) operating in a background flow field with a constant velocity gradient. Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of this scenario are performed, showing that a positive acceleration yields a reduction of induction and vice versa, a negative acceleration leads to an increase of induction. The new model accurately captures this behavior and reduces the prediction error by eighty percent compared to classical momentum theory where the effect of the background flow acceleration is disregarded. Further analysis suggests that the model can be extended to a formulation in which an even higher prediction accuracy can be achieved.</description>

      <title>Laminarising turbulent pipe flow by linear and nonlinear optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been observed that flattening the mean velocity profile of pipe flow by body force can laminarise turbulence, a promising means to reduce frictional drag substantially. To explore whether there is a more efficient body force to eliminate turbulence, we consider time-independent active body forces with varying spatial dependencies. Results confirm that when using an active force, a flattened forced laminar profile is needed to eliminate turbulence, and that a purely streamwise body force is best for laminarisation. While these results required an expensive nonlinear optimisation, it was also observed that the optimal forced profile exhibits reduced linear transient growth (TG). To determine whether the reduction of linear TG alone is a sufficient target for the laminarisation of turbulence, a linear Lagrange Multiplier technique is used to minimise TG of perturbations to the forced laminar profile. The optimal velocity profiles reveal that TG for each azimuthal wavenumber strongly depends on the radial velocity gradient at some specific radial interval. The optimal velocity profile obtained by minimising TG of perturbations of azimuthal wavenumber m = 1 is shown to be able to eliminate turbulence at Re = 2400, but a more effective reduction of TG, including perturbations of higher m, is needed for laminarisation at higher Reynolds number Re = 3000. The streaks formed with the flattened forced laminar profile reveal the mechanism of laminarisation: it is found that the lift-up mechanism in the more flattened forced laminar profile creates a lower streak (i.e. closer to the wall) that is more stable, so that turbulence is harder to maintain through streak instability. Further numerical experiments by disturbing a periodic orbit validated that the breakdown of turbulence self-sustaining mechanisms is mainly caused by suppression of the formation of streaks.</description>

      <title>Self-organized homogenization of flow networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the vasculature of animals to the porous media making up batteries, transport by fluid flow within complex networks is crucial to service all cells or media with resources. Yet, living flow networks have a key advantage over porous media: they are adaptive and can self-organize their geometry to achieve a homogeneous perfusion throughout the network. Here, we show that, through erosion, artificial flow networks self-organize to a geometry where perfusion is more homogeneous. Flowing a pulse of cleaving enzyme through a network patterned into an erodible hydrogel, with initial channels disparate in width, we observe a homogenization in channel resistances. Experimental observations are matched with numerical simulations of the diffusion-advection-sorption dynamics of an eroding enzyme within a network. Analyzing transport dynamics theoretically, we show that homogenization only occurs if the pulse of eroding enzyme lasts longer than the time it takes any channel to equilibrate to the pulse concentration. The equilibration time scale derived analytically is in agreement with simulations. Lastly, we show both numerically and experimentally that erosion leads to homogenization of complex networks containing loops. Erosion being an omnipresent reaction, our results pave the way for a very versatile self-organized increase in the performance of porous media.</description>

      <title>Wavelet-based resolvent analysis of non-stationary flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a formulation of resolvent analysis that uses wavelet transforms rather than Fourier transforms in time. Under this formulation, resolvent analysis may extend to turbulent flows with non-stationary mean states; the optimal resolvent modes are augmented with a temporal dimension and are able to encode the time-transient trajectories that are most amplified by the linearised Navier-Stokes equations. We first show that the wavelet- and Fourier-based resolvent analyses give equivalent results for statistically-stationary flow by applying them to turbulent channel flow. We then use wavelet-based resolvent analysis to study the transient growth mechanism in the near-wall region of turbulent channel flow by windowing the resolvent operator in time and frequency. The computed principal resolvent response mode, i.e. the velocity field optimally amplified by the linearised dynamics of the flow, exhibits the Orr mechanism, supporting the claim that this mechanism is key to linear transient energy growth. We also apply this method to non-stationary parallel shear flows such as an oscillating boundary layer, and three-dimensional channel flow in which a sudden spanwise pressure gradient perturbs a fully-developed turbulent channel flow. In both cases, wavelet-based resolvent analysis yields modes that are sensitive to the changing mean profile of the flow. For the oscillating boundary layer, wavelet-based resolvent analysis produces oscillating principal forcing and response modes that peak at times and wall-normal locations associated with high turbulent activity. For the three-dimensional turbulent channel flow, the resolvent modes gradually realign themselves with the mean flow as it deviates.</description>

      <title>Advection of the image point in probabilistically-reconstructed phase spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Insufficient reference data is ubiquitous in data-driven computational fluid dynamics, as it is usually too expensive to compute or impossible to observe over long enough times needed for data-driven methods to properly operate out of the sampled range. Ultimately, the lack of data can significantly compromise the fidelity of results computed with data-driven methods or make the data-driven approach inapplicable. In order to challenge this problem, we propose a probabilistic reconstruction method which enriches the hyper-parameterisation approach with ideas underlying the probabilistic-evolutionary approach. We offer to use Advection of the image point (a hyper-parameterisation method) on data sampled from the joint probability distribution of the reference dataset. The idea is to blend together the simplicity of the hyper-parameterisation (HP) method with an extra source of reference data provided through sampling from the joint probability distribution.
  The HP method has been tested on the sea surface temperature and surface relative vorticity computed with the global 1/4-deg and 1/12-deg resolution NEMO model. Our results show that the HP solution (the solution computed with the HP method) in the probabilistically-reconstructed and reduced (in terms of dimensionality) phase space at 1/4-deg resolution is more accurate compared to the 1/4-deg solution computed with NEMO and it is also several orders of magnitude faster to compute than the 1/4-deg run. The proposed method shows encouraging results for the NEMO model and the potential for the use in other operational ocean and ocean-atmospheric models for both deterministic and probabilistic predictions. The method can also be used as a fast reanalysis in which the complex dynamics of a comprehensive ocean model is replaced with the HP solution, as well as a dynamic interpolation method to stitch gaps in observational data.</description>

      <title>Impact of ageostrophic dynamics on the predictability of Lagrangian trajectories in surface-ocean turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent flows at the surface of the ocean deviate from geostrophic equilibrium on scales smaller than about 10 km. These scales are associated with important vertical transport of active and passive tracers, and should play a prominent role in the heat transport at climatic scales and for plankton dynamics. Measuring velocity fields on such small scales is notoriously difficult but new, high-resolution satellite altimetry is starting to reveal them. However, the satellite-derived velocities essentially represent the geostrophic flow component, and the impact of unresolved ageostrophic motions on particle dispersion needs to be understood to properly characterize transport properties. Here, we investigate ocean fine-scale turbulence using a model that represents some of the processes due to ageostrophic dynamics. We take a Lagrangian approach and focus on the predictability of the particle dynamics, comparing trajectories advected by either the full flow or by its geostrophic component only. Our results indicate that, over long times, relative dispersion is marginally affected by the filtering of the ageostrophic component. Nevertheless, advection by the filtered flow leads to an overestimation of the typical pair-separation rate, and to a bias on trajectories (in terms of displacement from the actual ones), whose importance grows with the Rossby number. We further explore the intensity of the transient particle clustering induced by ageostrophic motions and find that it can be significant, even for small flow compressibility. Indeed, we show that clustering is here due to the interplay between compressibility and persistent flow structures that trap particles, enhancing their aggregation.</description>

      <title>The role of magnetic boundaries in kinematic and self-consistent magnetohydrodynamic simulations of precession-driven dynamo action in a closed cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically examine dynamo action generated by a flow of an electrically conducting fluid in a precessing cylindrical cavity. We compare a simplified kinematic approach based on the solution of the magnetic induction equation with a prescribed velocity field with the results from a self-consistent three-dimensional simulation of the complete set of magnetohydrodynamic equations. The different kinematic models show a strong influence of the electromagnetic properties of outer layers, which manifests itself in the existence of two different branches with dynamo action. In all cases, we observe a minimum for the onset of dynamo action in a transitional regime, within which the hydrodynamic flow undergoes a change from a large-scale to a more small-scale, turbulent behaviour. However, significant differences in the absolute values for the critical magnetic Reynolds number occur, and they can be explained by the low rotation rate in the MHD simulations achievable for technical reasons. In these models the character of the dynamo solution is small-scale and the magnetic energy remains significantly smaller than the kinetic energy of the flow. In irregular intervals, we observe dynamo bursts with a local concentration of the magnetic field, resulting in a global increase of the magnetic energy by a factor of 3 to 5. However, diffusion of the local patches caused by strong local shear is too rapid, causing these features to exist for only a short period (i.e., shorter than a rotation period) so that their dynamical impact on the dynamo remains small. As the magnetic field is small-scale and weak, the nonlinear feedback on the flow through the Lorentz force remains small and arises essentially in terms of a slight damping of the fast timescales, whereas there is no noticeable change in flow amplitude compared to the hydrodynamic case.</description>

      <title>Dissecting inertial clustering and sling dynamics in high-Reynolds number particle-laden turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14549v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we aim to deepen the understanding of inertial clustering and the role of sling events in high-Reynolds number ($Re$) particle-laden turbulence. To this end, we perform one-way coupled particle tracking in flow fields obtained from direct numerical simulations (DNS) of forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Additionally, we examine the impact of filtering utilized in large eddy simulations (LES) by applying a sharp spectral filter to the DNS fields. Our analysis reveals that while instantaneous clustering through the centrifuge mechanism explains clustering at early times, the path history effect--the sampling of fluid flow along particle trajectories--becomes important later on. The filtered fields expose small-scale fractal clustering that cannot be predicted by the instantaneous flow field. We show that there exists a filter-effective Stokes number that governs the degree of fractal clustering and preferential sampling, revealing scale-similarity in the spatial distributions and fractal dimensions. Sling events are prevalent throughout our simulations and impose prominent patterns on the particle fields. In pursuit of investigating the sling dynamics, we compute the relative velocity, ensemble-averaged over proximal neighboring particles, to identify particles undergoing caustics. As postulated in recent theories, we find that in fully resolved, high-$Re$ turbulence, sling events occur in thin sheets of high strain, situated between turbulent vortices. This behavior is driven by rare, extreme events of compressive straining, manifested by fluctuations of the flow velocity gradients that propagate back and forth the positive branch of the Vieillefosse line.</description>

      <title>Gradient-free online learning of subgrid-scale dynamics with neural emulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19385v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a generic algorithm to train machine learning-based subgrid parametrizations online, i.e., with a posteriori loss functions, but for non-differentiable numerical solvers. The proposed approach leverages a neural emulator to approximate the reduced state-space solver, which is then used to allow gradient propagation through temporal integration steps. We apply this methodology on a single layer quasi-geostrophic system with topography, known to be highly unstable in around 500 temporal iterations with offline strategies. Using our algorithm, we are able to train a parametrization that recovers most of the benefits of online strategies without having to compute the gradient of the original solver. It is demonstrated that training the neural emulator and parametrization components separately with different loss quantities is necessary in order to minimize the propagation of approximation biases. Experiments on emulator architectures with different complexities also indicates that emulator performance is key in order to learn an accurate parametrization. This work is a step towards learning parametrization with online strategies for weather models.</description>

Abstract: Flow control is key to maximize energy efficiency in a wide range of applications. However, traditional flow-control methods face significant challenges in addressing non-linear systems and high-dimensional data, limiting their application in realistic energy systems. This study advances deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) methods for flow control, particularly focusing on integrating group-invariant networks and positional encoding into DRL architectures. Our methods leverage multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to exploit policy invariance in space, in combination with group-invariant networks to ensure local symmetry invariance. Additionally, a positional encoding inspired by the transformer architecture is incorporated to provide location information to the agents, mitigating action constraints from strict invariance. The proposed methods are verified using a case study of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection, where the goal is to minimize the Nusselt number Nu. The group-invariant neural networks (GI-NNs) show faster convergence compared to the base MARL, achieving better average policy performance. The GI-NNs not only cut DRL training time in half but also notably enhance learning reproducibility. Positional encoding further enhances these results, effectively reducing the minimum Nu and stabilizing convergence. Interestingly, group invariant networks specialize in improving learning speed and positional encoding specializes in improving learning quality. These results demonstrate that choosing a suitable feature-representation method according to the purpose as well as the characteristics of each control problem is essential. We believe that the results of this study will not only inspire novel DRL methods with invariant and unique representations, but also provide useful insights for industrial applications.</description>
