      <title>Decision theory and the "almost implies near" phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to relax traditional axioms in decision theory by incorporating a measurement, or degree, of satisfaction. For example, if the independence axiom of expected utility theory is violated, we can measure the size of the violation. This measure allows us to derive an approximation guarantee for a utility representation that aligns with the unmodified version of the axiom. Almost satisfying the axiom implies, then, a utility that is near a utility representation. We develop specific examples drawn from expected utility theory under risk and uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Robust pricing for cloud computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the robust sequential screening problem of a monopolist seller of multiple cloud computing services facing a buyer who has private information about his demand distribution for these services. At the time of contracting, the buyer knows the distribution of his demand of various services and the seller simply knows the mean of the buyer's total demand. We show that a simple "committed spend mechanism" is robustly optimal: it provides the seller with the highest profit guarantee against all demand distributions that have the known total mean demand. This mechanism requires the buyer to commit to a minimum total usage and a corresponding base payment; the buyer can choose the individual quantities of each service and is free to consume additional units (over the committed total usage) at a fixed marginal price. This result provides theoretical support for prevalent cloud computing pricing practices while highlighting the robustness of simple pricing schemes in environments with complex uncertainty.</description>

      <title>A deterministic electoral system satisfying Arrow's four conditions in an easily approached limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1950 Arrow famously showed that there is no social welfare function satisfying four basic conditions. In 1976, on the other hand, Gibbard and Sonnenschein showed that there does exist a unique probabilistic social welfare method that satisfies a different set of strictly stronger conditions. In this paper we discuss a deterministic electoral method satisfying those same stronger conditions in an appropriate sense; it is not a counterexample to either of these theorems. We attach a simple reference implementation written in C with executables for Linux and Windows.</description>

      <title>Pure $\epsilon$-equilibrium in random games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for any $\epsilon&gt;0$ the probability that a randomly drawn game has a pure $\epsilon$-equilibrium goes to 1 as the number of agents gets large. This contrasts sharply with the known fact that if $\epsilon = 0$, that is, for pure Nash equilibrium, the probability is asymptotically $1- 1/e\approx 0.63$.</description>

      <title>The Economics of Large Language Models: Token Allocation, Fine-Tuning, and Optimal Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an economic framework to analyze the optimal pricing and product design of Large Language Models (LLM). Our framework captures several key features of LLMs: variable operational costs of processing input and output tokens; the ability to customize models through fine-tuning; and high-dimensional user heterogeneity in terms of task requirements and error sensitivity. In our model, a monopolistic seller offers multiple versions of LLMs through a menu of products. The optimal pricing structure depends on whether token allocation across tasks is contractible and whether users face scale constraints. Users with similar aggregate value-scale characteristics choose similar levels of fine-tuning and token consumption. The optimal mechanism can be implemented through menus of two-part tariffs, with higher markups for more intensive users. Our results rationalize observed industry practices such as tiered pricing based on model customization and usage levels.</description>

      <title>Insuperable strategies in two-player and reducible multi-player games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real populations are seldom found at the Nash equilibrium strategy. The present work focuses on how population size can be a relevant evolutionary force diverting the population from its expected Nash equilibrium. We introduce the concept of insuperable strategy, a strategy that guarantees that no other player can have a larger payoff than the player that adopts it. We show that this concept is different from the rationality assumption frequently used in game theory and that for small populations the insuperable strategy is the most probable evolutionary outcome for any dynamics that equal game payoff and reproductive fitness. We support our ideas with several examples and numerical simulations. We finally discuss how to extend the concept to multiplayer games, introducing, in a limited way, the concept of game reduction.</description>

      <title>Pareto-Nash Reversion Strategies: Three Period Dynamic Co-operative Signalling with Sticky Efficiency Wages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper uses Nash equilibrium reversion as an optimal tool for clearing dynamic prices and wages. Various exogenous competitive rigidities determine the balanced growth path of the efficiency wage and the outcome of repeated household/firm wage bargaining decisions. A location model is used to explore the extent to which a downstream spatial cooperation agreement might affect the price equilibrium. There is also an endogenous hiring function and a knowledge base that is increasing in output as is the real wage. As the article demonstrates after accounting for real rigidities in the baseline model the effect of wage growth on household utility through staggered bargaining can be best captured by adopting a policy of point scoring on the mobility of skilled labor against the model's key rigidities. Mobility point scores which serve to encourage mobility from skilled labor within the model not only increase the knowledge base but also place upward pressure on nominal wage growth.</description>

      <title>Satisficing Equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a solution concept in which each agent $i$ does not necessarily optimize but selects one of their top $k_i$ actions. Our concept accounts for heterogeneous agents' bounded rationality. We show that there exist satisficing equilibria in which all but one agent best-respond and the remaining agent plays at least a second-best action in asymptotically almost all games. Additionally, we define a class of approximate potential games in which satisficing equilibria are guaranteed to exist. Turning to foundations, we characterize satisficing equilibrium via decision theoretic axioms and we show that a simple dynamic converges to satisficing equilibria in almost all large games. Finally, we apply the satisficing lens to two classic games from the literature.</description>

      <title>Social Choice Rules with Responsibility for Individual Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines normatively acceptable criteria for evaluating social states when individuals are responsible for their skills or productivity and these factors should be accounted for. We consider social choice rules over sets of feasible utility vectors \`a la Nash's (1950) bargaining problem. First, we identify necessary and sufficient conditions for choice rules to be rationalized by welfare orderings or functions over ability-normalized utility vectors. These general results provide a foundation for exploring novel choice rules with the normalization and providing their axiomatic foundations. By adding natural axioms, we propose and axiomatize a new class of choice rules, which can be viewed as combinations of three key principles: distribution according to individuals' abilities, utilitarianism, and egalitarianism. Furthermore, we show that at the axiomatic level, this class of choice rules is closely related to the classical bargaining solution introduced by Kalai and Smorodinsky (1975).</description>

      <title>Isotonic Mechanism for Exponential Family Estimation in Machine Learning Peer Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11160v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2023, the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) required authors with multiple submissions to rank their submissions based on perceived quality. In this paper, we aim to employ these author-specified rankings to enhance peer review in machine learning and artificial intelligence conferences by extending the Isotonic Mechanism to exponential family distributions. This mechanism generates adjusted scores that closely align with the original scores while adhering to author-specified rankings. Despite its applicability to a broad spectrum of exponential family distributions, implementing this mechanism does not require knowledge of the specific distribution form. We demonstrate that an author is incentivized to provide accurate rankings when her utility takes the form of a convex additive function of the adjusted review scores. For a certain subclass of exponential family distributions, we prove that the author reports truthfully only if the question involves only pairwise comparisons between her submissions, thus indicating the optimality of ranking in truthful information elicitation. Moreover, we show that the adjusted scores improve dramatically the estimation accuracy compared to the original scores and achieve nearly minimax optimality when the ground-truth scores have bounded total variation. We conclude with a numerical analysis of the ICML 2023 ranking data, showing substantial estimation gains in approximating a proxy ground-truth quality of the papers using the Isotonic Mechanism.</description>

      <title>Paying to Do Better: Games with Payments between Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In repeated games, such as auctions, players typically use learning algorithms to choose their actions. The use of such autonomous learning agents has become widespread on online platforms. In this paper, we explore the impact of players incorporating monetary transfer policies into their agents' algorithms, aiming to influence behavior in their favor through the dynamics between the agents. Our focus is on understanding when players have incentives to make use of monetary transfers, how such payments may affect learning dynamics, and what the implications are for welfare and its distribution among the players. We propose a simple and general game-theoretic model to capture such scenarios. Our results on general games show that in a very broad class of games, self-interested players benefit from letting their learning agents make payments to other learners during the game dynamics, and that in many cases, this kind of behavior improves welfare for all players. Our results on first- and second-price auctions show that in equilibria of the ``payment policy game,'' the agents' dynamics reach strong collusive outcomes with low revenue for the auctioneer. These results raise new questions and highlight a challenge for mechanism design in systems where automated learning agents can benefit from interacting with their peers in the digital ecosystem and outside the boundaries of the mechanism.</description>

      <title>Basins of Attraction in Two-Player Random Ordinal Potential Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the class of two-person ordinal potential games where each player has the same number of actions $K$. Each game in this class admits at least one pure Nash equilibrium and the best-response dynamics converges to one of these pure Nash equilibria; which one depends on the starting point. So, each pure Nash equilibrium has a basin of attraction.
  We pick uniformly at random one game from this class and we study the joint distribution of the sizes of the basins of attraction. We provide an asymptotic exact value for the expected basin of attraction of each pure Nash equilibrium, when the number of actions $K$ goes to infinity.</description>
