      <title>Seismic noise interferometry for phase transmission fibre optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similar to Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS), phase transmission fibre optics allows for large bandwidth seismic data measurements using fibre-optic cables. However, while the application range of DAS is limited to tens of kilometres, phase transmission fibre optics has an application range that can go up to thousands of kilometres. This new method has been shown as an effective method to record earthquakes, but its ability to record ambient seismic noise that can be used for seismic imaging and tomography is still up for question, and will be analysed in this work. We provide the theoretical foundation for the interpretation of seismic noise autocorrelations and interferometry from phase transmission fibre optics. Further, we test the model on actual phase transmission data sourced from a phase-stabilised optical frequency network in Switzerland. There, the phase stabilisation scheme measures and compensates noise on the optical phase caused by distortions of the fibre. We analyse the autocorrelation of the measured phase noise correction and explore potential interpretations by comparing it with the autocorrelation of a synthetically computed phase noise correction. This comparison is challenging due to two factors: the intricate cable geometry increases the computational cost of generating synthetic data, and the precise location and geometry of the cable are uncertain. Despite these difficulties, we believe that when applied to a different dataset, this approach could enable seismic tomography with ambient noise interferometry using a long-range fibre-optic sensing device.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of hydromagnetic waves propagating over a steady, non-axisymmetric background magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent observations of rapid (interannual) signals in the geomagnetic data, and by advances in numerical simulations approaching the Earth's outer core conditions, we present a study on the dynamics of hydromagnetic waves evolving over a static base state. Under the assumption of timescales separation between the rapid waves and the slow convection, we linearise the classical magneto-hydrodynamics equations over a steady non-axisymmetric background magnetic field and a zero velocity field. The initial perturbation is a super-rotating pulse of the inner core, which sets the amplitude and length-scales of the waves in the system. The initial pulse triggers axisymmetric, outward propagating torsional Alfv\'en waves, with characteristic thickness scaling with the magnetic Ekman number as $Ek_M^{1/4}$. Because the background state is non-axisymmetric, the pulse also triggers non-axisymmetric, quasi-geostrophic Alfv\'en waves. As these latter waves propagate outwards, they turn into quasi-geostrophic, magneto-Coriolis waves (QG-MC) as the Coriolis force supersedes inertia in the force balance. The period of the initial wave packet is preserved across the shell but the QG-MC wave front disperses and a westward drift is observed after this transformation. Upon reaching the core surface, the westward drift of the QG-MC waves presents an estimated phase speed of about $1100\,km/y$. This analysis confirms the QG-MC nature of the rapid magnetic signals observed in geomagnetic field models near the equator.</description>

      <title>Retrieving snow depth distribution by downscaling ERA5 Reanalysis with ICESat-2 laser altimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the variability of seasonal snow cover, in particular snow depth in remote areas, poses significant challenges due to limited spatial and temporal data availability. This study uses snow depth measurements from the ICESat-2 satellite laser altimeter, which are sparse in both space and time, and incorporates them with climate reanalysis data into a downscaling-calibration scheme to produce monthly gridded snow depth maps at microscale (10 m). Snow surface elevation measurements from ICESat-2 along profiles are compared to a digital elevation model to determine snow depth at each point. To efficiently turn sparse measurements into snow depth maps, a regression model is fitted to establish a relationship between the retrieved snow depth and the corresponding ERA5 Land snow depth. This relationship, referred to as subgrid variability, is then applied to downscale the monthly ERA5 Land snow depth data. The method can provide timeseries of monthly snow depth maps for the entire ERA5 time range (since 1950). The validation of downscaled snow depth data was performed at an intermediate scale (100 m x 500 m) using datasets from airborne laser scanning (ALS) in the Hardangervidda region of southern Norway. Results show that snow depth prediction achieved R2 values ranging from 0.74 to 0.88 (post-calibration). The method relies on globally available data and is applicable to other snow regions above the treeline. Though requiring area-specific calibration, our approach has the potential to provide snow depth maps in areas where no such data exist and can be used to extrapolate existing snow surveys in time and over larger areas. With this, it can offer valuable input data for hydrological, ecological or permafrost modeling tasks.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the performance of machine-learning-based phase pickers when applied to ocean bottom seismic data: Blanco oceanic transform fault as a case study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning-based phase pickers have been successfully leveraged to build high-resolution earthquake catalogs using seismic data on land. However, their performance when applied to ocean bottom seismic (OBS) data remains to be evaluated. In this study, we first adopt three machine-learning-based phase pickers - EQTransformer, Pickblue, and OBSTansformer - to build three earthquake catalogs for the 350-km-long Blanco oceanic transform fault (BTF) based on a year-long OBS deployment. We then systematically compare these catalogs with an existing catalog which utilized a traditional workflow. Results indicate that the Pickblue-based catalog documents more events and/or provides better-constrained locations than the other catalogs. The different performances of the three phase pickers suggest that detailed assessment of catalogs built using automatic workflows is necessary to prevent misinterpretations, especially when applied to regions without training samples. The Pickblue-based catalog reveals seismicity gaps in three extensional segments of BTF which likely represent aseismic slip zones affected by seawater infiltration. Furthermore, most earthquakes are shallower than the 600-degree isotherm predicted by a half-space conductive cooling model, except for the Blanco Ridge segment which has hosted 80% of the Mw &gt; 6.0 earthquakes along BTF since 1976. These Blanco Ridge deep earthquake clusters can be explained by hydrothermal cooling or the serpentinization of mantle peridotite due to seawater infiltration along conduits created by the deeper ruptures of large earthquakes. Our analyses also demonstrate the importance of careful examination of automatically produced earthquake catalogs since mislocated events can lead to very different interpretations of fault slip modes from seismicity distribution.</description>

      <title>Verifying The Radiosonde Humidity Sensor Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17335v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring the performance of humidity sensors has become particularly relevant due to the lack of in-house production of humidity sensors in the Russian Federation and the logistical problems that have arisen. Humidity is subject to high spatial variability, therefore, standard methods for monitoring data quality based on the difference with the field of the first approximation are not applicable for its control. It is proposed to carry out monitoring by comparing readings on the surface and at altitude with a pressure of 850 hPa, where humidity is less than 60% in the absence of low clouds, and more than 70% in its presence. The fact of the presence/absence of low clouds is determined by the readings of a vertically oriented pyrometer. The difference between the air temperature at the surface and the temperature from the pyrometer of more than 14{\deg}K corresponds to the absence of low clouds, and less than 14{\deg}K corresponds to the presence of low clouds. Accordingly, a serviceable humidity sensor should show the appropriate values.</description>

      <title>Sealing Europa's vents by vapor deposition: An order of magnitude study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractures and vents in the ice crust of Europa, exposing the sub-surface ocean to the vacuum, might be responsible for the generation of planetary-scale water-vapor plumes. During its passage through the ice, the plume vapor is expected to partially condense on the walls, depositing until the vent is sealed. We develop a lumped-parameter model to analyze the sealing time scales. Neglecting all other possible mechanisms (water spillage, compression forces, etc.), we find shutting-off times compatible with the 7-hour plume observed in 2012 by the Hubble Space Telescope, suggesting that vapor deposition alone could have been responsible for sealing the vent. A map of sealing times vs. plume density, mass flow rate and aperture areas is given. Plume quantities from the literature are analyzed and compared to our results. For a given plume density/mass flow rate, small apertures would be sealed quickly by molecular deposition and are thus incompatible with observations.</description>

      <title>Synthesis and stability of biomolecules in C-H-O-N fluids under Earth's upper mantle conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04839</link>

Abstract: How life started on Earth is an unsolved mystery. There are various hypotheses for the location ranging from outer space to the seafloor, subseafloor or potentially deeper. Here, we applied extensive ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to study chemical reactions between NH$_3$, H$_2$O, H$_2$, and CO at pressures (P) and temperatures (T) approximating the conditions of Earth's upper mantle (i.e. 10-13 GPa, 1000-1400 K). Contrary to the previous assumptions that larger organic molecules might readily disintegrate in aqueous solutions at extreme P-T conditions, we found that many organic compounds formed without any catalysts and persisted in C-H-O-N fluids under these extreme conditions, including glycine, ribose, urea, and uracil-like molecules. Particularly, our free energy calculations showed that the C-N bond is thermodynamically stable at 10 GPa and 1400 K. Moreover, while the pyranose (six-membered-ring) form of ribose is more stable than the furanose (five-membered-ring) form at ambient conditions, we observed the predominant formation of the five-membered-ring form of ribose at extreme conditions, which is consistent with the exclusive incorporation of $\beta$-D-ribofuranose in RNA. We have uncovered a previously unexplored pathway through which the crucial biomolecules could be abiotically synthesized from geofluids in the deep interior of Earth and other planets and these formed biomolecules could potentially contribute to the early stage of the emergency of life.</description>
