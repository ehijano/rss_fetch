      <title>How chromatin interactions shed light on interpreting non-coding genomic variants: opportunities and future direc-tions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genomic variants, including copy number variants (CNVs) and genome-wide associa-tion study (GWAS) single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), represent structural alterations that influence genomic diversity and disease susceptibility. While coding region variants have been extensively studied, non-coding and regulatory variants present significant challenges due to their potential impacts on gene regulation, which are often obscured by the complexity of the ge-nome. Chromatin interactions, which organize the genome spatially and regulate gene expression through enhancer-promoter contacts, predominantly occur in non-coding regions. Notably, more than 90% of enhancers, crucial for gene regulation, reside in these non-coding regions, underscor-ing their importance in interpreting the regulatory effects of CNVs and GWAS-associated SNPs. In this study, we integrate chromatin interaction data with CNV and GWAS data to uncover the functional implications of non-coding variants. By leveraging this integrated approach, we pro-vide new insights into how structural variants and disease-associated SNPs disrupt regulatory networks, advancing our understanding of genetic complexity. These findings offer potential av-enues for personalized medicine by elucidating disease mechanisms and guiding therapeutic strategies tailored to individual genomic profiles. This research underscores the critical role of chromatin interactions in revealing the regulatory consequences of non-coding variants, bridging the gap between genetic variation and phenotypic outcomes.</description>

      <title>Single-cell Curriculum Learning-based Deep Graph Embedding Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10511v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The swift advancement of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enables the investigation of cellular-level tissue heterogeneity. Cell annotation significantly contributes to the extensive downstream analysis of scRNA-seq data. However, The analysis of scRNA-seq for biological inference presents challenges owing to its intricate and indeterminate data distribution, characterized by a substantial volume and a high frequency of dropout events. Furthermore, the quality of training samples varies greatly, and the performance of the popular scRNA-seq data clustering solution GNN could be harmed by two types of low-quality training nodes: 1) nodes on the boundary; 2) nodes that contribute little additional information to the graph. To address these problems, we propose a single-cell curriculum learning-based deep graph embedding clustering (scCLG). We first propose a Chebyshev graph convolutional autoencoder with multi-criteria (ChebAE) that combines three optimization objectives, including topology reconstruction loss of cell graphs, zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) loss, and clustering loss, to learn cell-cell topology representation. Meanwhile, we employ a selective training strategy to train GNN based on the features and entropy of nodes and prune the difficult nodes based on the difficulty scores to keep the high-quality graph. Empirical results on a variety of gene expression datasets show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods. The code of scCLG will be made publicly available at https://github.com/LFD-byte/scCLG.</description>
