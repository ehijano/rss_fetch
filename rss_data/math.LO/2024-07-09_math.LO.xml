      <title>Model theory of valued fields with an endomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish relative quantifier elimination for valued fields of residue characteristic zero enriched with a non-surjective valued field endomorphism, building on recent work of Dor and Halevi. In particular, we deduce relative quantifier elimination for the limit of the Frobenius action on separably closed valued fields of positive characteristic.</description>

      <title>Pairs of separably closed fields and exotic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We look at simple groups associated primarily with the general theory of Moufang buildings, and to analyze their relation to stability theory in the model theoretic sense. As it becomes quite technical in the details, a lengthy introduction surveys the developments at a less detailed level.
  The text, beginning from the second section, first deals with some model theoretic algebra of fields, followed by an extended study of three associated families of simple groups coming from the theory of Tits buildings, Moufang polygons, and Timmesfeld's theory of exotic analogs of SL_2.
  The field theoretic part is fundamental ({\S}2). The rest of the paper relates this to group theoretic constructions, with two sections surveying the consequences for the original Tits and Timmesfeld theory before concentrating on the more exotic groups associated with Moufang polygons.
  A good deal of the group theoretical material is expository, aimed to make the relevant structural information meaningful to those coming from the direction of model theory.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution of polynomially bounded o-minimal curves in homogeneous spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Ratner's theorem on equidistribution of individual orbits of unipotent flows on finite volume homogeneous spaces of Lie groups to trajectories of non-contracting curves definable in polynomially bounded o-minimal structures.
  To be precise, let $\varphi:[0,\infty)\to \text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)$ be a continuous map whose coordinate functions are definable in a polynomially bounded o-minimal structure; for example, rational functions. Suppose that $\varphi$ is non-contracting; that is, for any linearly independent vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ in $\mathbb R^n$, $\varphi(t).(v_1\wedge\cdots\wedge v_k)\not\to0$ as $t\to\infty$. Then, there exists a unique smallest subgroup $H_\varphi$ of $\text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)$ generated by unipotent one-parameter subgroups such that $\varphi(t)H_\varphi\to g_0H_\varphi$ in $\text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)/H_\varphi$ as $t\to\infty$ for some $g_0\in \text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)$.
  Let $G$ be a closed subgroup of $\text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)$ and $\Gamma$ be a lattice in $G$. Suppose that $\varphi([0,\infty))\subset G$. Then $H_\varphi\subset G$, and for any $x\in G/\Gamma$, the trajectory $\{\varphi(t)x:t\in [0,T]\}$ gets equidistributed with respect to the measure $g_0\mu_{Lx}$ as $T\to\infty$, where $L$ is a closed subgroup of $G$ such that $\overline{Hx}=Lx$ and $Lx$ admits a unique $L$-invariant probability measure, denoted by $\mu_{Lx}$.
  A crucial new ingredient in this work is proving that for any finite-dimensional representation $V$ of $\text{SL}(n,\mathbb R)$, there exist $T_0&gt;0$, $C&gt;0$, and $\alpha&gt;0$ such that for any $v\in G$, the map $t\mapsto \|\varphi(t)v\|$ is $(C,\alpha)$-good on $[T_0,\infty)$.</description>

      <title>Left-Linear Rewriting in Adhesive Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When can two sequential steps performed by a computing device be considered (causally) independent? This is a relevant question for concurrent and distributed systems, since independence means that they could be executed in any order, and potentially in parallel. Equivalences identifying rewriting sequences which differ only for independent steps are at the core of the theory of concurrency of many formalisms. We investigate the issue in the context of the double pushout approach to rewriting in the general setting of adhesive categories. While a consolidated theory exists for linear rules,which can consume, preserve and generate entities, this paper focuses on left-linear rules which may also "merge" parts of the state. This is an apparently minimal, yet technically hard enhancement,since a standard characterisation of independence that - in the linear case - allows one to derive a number of properties, essential in the development of a theory of concurrency, no longer holds. The paper performs an in-depth study of the notion of independence for left-linear rules: it introduces a novel characterisation of independence, identifies well-behaved classes of left-linear rewriting systems,and provides some fundamental results including a Church-Rosser property and the existence of canonical equivalence proofs for concurrent computations. These results properly extends the class of formalisms that can be modelled in the adhesive framework</description>

      <title>Recursive Analogues of Shrewdness and Subtlety, with Applications to Fine Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We share both recent and older, well-known results regarding the notions of stable ordinals and shrewd cardinals. We then argue that $\Sigma_2$-nonprojectible ordinals may be considered as recursive analogues to subtle cardinals, a highly combinatorial type of cardinal related to Jensen's fine structure, due to the latter possessing a characterisation in terms of shrewdnesss.</description>

      <title>Owings-like theorems for infinitely many colours or finite monochromatic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by Owings's problem, we investigate whether, for a given an Abelian group $G$ and cardinal numbers $\kappa,\theta$, every colouring $c:G\longrightarrow\theta$ yields a subset $X\subseteq G$ with $|X|=\kappa$ such that $X+X$ is monochromatic. (Owings's problem asks this for $G=\mathbb Z$, $\theta=2$ and $\kappa=\aleph_0$; this is known to be false for the same $G$ and $\kappa$ but $\theta=3$.) We completely settle the question for $\kappa$ and $\theta$ both finite (by obtaining sufficient and necessary conditions for a positive answer) and for $\kappa$ and $\theta$ both infinite (with a negative answer). Also, in the case where $\theta$ is infinite but $\kappa$ is finite, we obtain some sufficient conditions for a negative answer as well as an example with a positive answer.</description>

      <title>On the equational theory of finite modular lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04237v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is shown that there is $N$ such that there is no algorithm to decide for identities in at most $N$ variables validity in the class of finite modular lattices. This is based on Slobodskoi's result that the Restricted Word Problem is unsolvable for the class of finite groups and relies on Freese's technique of capturing group presentations within free modular lattices.</description>
