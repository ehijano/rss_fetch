      <title>The link between Athor and EL meteorites does not constrain the timing of the giant planet instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The asteroid Athor, residing today in the inner main asteroid belt, has been recently associated as the source of EL enstatite meteorites to Earth. It has been argued that Athor formed in the terrestrial region -- as indicated by similarity in isotopic compositions between Earth and EL meteorites -- and was implanted in the belt $\gtrsim$60 Myr after the formation of the solar system. A recently published study modelling Athor's implantation in the belt (Avdellidou et al 2024) further concluded, using an idealized set of numerical simulations, that Athor cannot have been scattered from the terrestrial region and implanted at its current location unless the giant planet dynamical instability occurred {\em after} Athor's implantation ($\gtrsim$60~Myr). In this work, we revisit this problem with a comprehensive suite of dynamical simulations of the implantation of asteroids into the belt during the terrestrial planet accretion. We find that Athor-like objects can in fact be implanted into the belt long after the giant planets' dynamical instability. The probability of implanting Athor analogs when the instability occurs at $\lesssim15$~Myr is at most a factor of $\sim$2 lower than that of an instability occurring at $\sim100$~Myr after the solar system formation. Moreover, Athor's implantation can occur up to $\gtrsim$100 Myr after the giant planet instability. We conclude that Athor's link to EL meteorites does not constrain the timing of the solar system's dynamical instability.</description>

      <title>Implantation of asteroids from the terrestrial planet region: The effect of the timing of the giant planet instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical architecture and compositional diversity of the asteroid belt strongly constrain planet formation models. Recent Solar System formation models have shown that the asteroid belt may have been born empty and later filled with objects from the inner ($&lt;$2~au) and outer regions (&gt;5 au) of the solar system. In this work, we focus on the implantation of inner solar system planetesimals into the asteroid belt - envisioned to represent S and/or E- type asteroids - during the late-stage accretion of the terrestrial planets. It is widely accepted that the solar system's giant planets formed in a more compact orbital configuration and evolved to their current dynamical state due to a planetary dynamical instability. In this work, we explore how the implantation efficiency of asteroids from the terrestrial region correlates with the timing of the giant planet instability, which has proven challenging to constrain. We carried out a suite of numerical simulations of the accretion of terrestrial planets considering different initial distributions of planetesimals in the terrestrial region and dynamical instability times. Our simulations show that a giant planet dynamical instability occurring at $t\gtrapprox5$ Myr -- relative to the time of the sun's natal disk dispersal -- is broadly consistent with the current asteroid belt, allowing the total mass carried out by S-complex type asteroids to be implanted into the belt from the terrestrial region. Finally, we conclude that an instability that occurs coincident with the gas disk dispersal is either inconsistent with the empty asteroid belt scenario, or may require that the gas disk in the inner solar system have dissipated at least a few Myr earlier than the gas in the outer disk (beyond Jupiter's orbit).</description>

      <title>Mutual Occurrence Ratio of Planets. I. New Clues to Reveal Origins of Hot- and Warm-Jupiter from the RV Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many studies have analyzed planetary occurrence rates and their dependence on the host's properties to provide clues to planet formation, but few have focused on the mutual occurrence ratio of different kinds of planets. Such relations reveal whether and how one type of planet evolves into another, e.g. from a cold Jupiter to a warm or even hot Jupiter, and demonstrate how stellar properties impact the evolution history of planetary systems. We propose a new classification of giant planets, i.e. cold Jupiter(CJ), warm Jupiter(WJ), and hot Jupiter(HJ), according to their position relative to the snow line in the system. Then, we derive their occurrence rates(${\eta}_{\rm HJ}$, ${\eta}_{\rm WJ}$, ${\eta}_{\rm CJ}$) with the detection completeness of RV(Radial Velocity) surveys(HARPS$\&amp;$ CORALIE) considered. Finally, we analyze the correlation between the mutual occurrence ratios, i.e. ${\eta}{_{\rm CJ}} / {\eta}_{\rm WJ}$, ${\eta}{_{\rm CJ}} / {\eta}_{\rm HJ}$ or ${\eta}{_{\rm WJ}}/{\eta}_{\rm HJ}$, and various stellar properties, e.g. effective temperature $T_{\rm eff}$. Our results show that the ${\eta}_{\rm HJ}$, ${\eta}_{\rm WJ}$ and ${\eta}_{\rm CJ}$ are increasing with the increasing $T_{\rm eff}$ when $T_{\rm eff}\in (4600,6600] K$. Furthermore, the mutual occurrence ratio between CJ and WJ, i.e. ${\eta}{_{\rm CJ}} /{\eta}_{\rm WJ}$, shows a decreasing trend with the increasing $T_{\rm eff}$. But, both ${\eta}{_{\rm CJ}}/{\eta}_{\rm HJ}$ and ${\eta}{_{\rm WJ}}/{\eta}_{\rm HJ}$ are increasing when the $T_{\rm eff}$ increases. Further consistency tests reveal that the formation processes of WJ and HJ may be dominated by orbital change mechanisms rather than the in-situ model. However, unlike WJ, which favors gentle disk migration, HJ favors a more violent mechanism that requires further investigation.</description>

      <title>The Radius Distribution of M dwarf-hosted Planets and its Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M dwarf stars are not only the most promising hosts for detection and characterization of small and potentially habitable planets, they provide leverage relative to solar-type stars to test models of planet formation and evolution. Using Gaia astrometry, adaptive optics imaging, and calibrated gyrochronologic relations to estimate stellar properties, filter binaries, and assign ages, we refined the radii of 179 transiting planets orbiting 119 single late K- and early M-type stars detected by the Kepler mission, and assigned stellar rotation-based ages ) to 115 of these. We constructed the radius distribution of &lt;4R$_{\oplus}$ planets and assessed its evolution with time. As for solar-type stars, the inferred distribution contains distinct populations of "super-Earths" (at ~1.3R$_{\oplus}$) and "sub-Neptunes" (at ~2.2Rearth) separated by a gap or "valley" at $\approx$1.7R$_{\oplus}$ that has a period dependence that is significantly weaker (power law index of -0.026$^{+0.026}_{-0.017}$) than for solar-type stars. Sub-Neptunes are largely absent at short periods ($&lt;$2 days) and high irradiance, a feature analogous to the "Neptune desert" observed around solar-type stars. The relative number of sub-Neptunes to super-Earths declines between the younger and older halves of the sample (median age 3.8 Gyr), although the formal significance is low ($p = 0.06$) because of the small sample size. The decline in sub-Neptunes appears to be more pronounced at long orbital periods vs. short periods; this is not due to detection bias and could indicate that these objects are inflated by a mechanism that operates at elevated irradiance, e.g. a runaway water greenhouse augmented by H/He.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of the TOI-421 planetary system using CHEOPS, TESS, and archival radial velocity data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TOI-421 planetary system contains two sub-Neptune-type planets and is a prime target to study the formation and evolution of planets and their atmospheres. The inner planet is especially interesting as the existence of a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere at its orbital separation cannot be explained by current formation models without previous orbital migration. We jointly analysed photometric data of three TESS sectors and six CHEOPS visits as well as 156 radial velocity data points to retrieve improved planetary parameters. We also searched for TTVs and modelled the interior structure of the planets. Finally, we simulated the evolution of the primordial H-He atmospheres of the planets using two different modelling frameworks. We determine the planetary radii and masses of TOI-421 b and c to be $R_{\rm b} = 2.64 \pm 0.08 \, R_{\oplus}$, $M_{\rm b} = 6.7 \pm 0.6 \, M_{\oplus}$, $R_{\rm c} = 5.09 \pm 0.07 \, R_{\oplus}$, and $M_{\rm c} = 14.1 \pm 1.4 \, M_{\oplus}$. We do not detect any statistically significant TTV signals. Assuming the presence of a hydrogen-dominated atmosphere, the interior structure modelling results in both planets having extensive envelopes. While the modelling of the atmospheric evolution predicts for TOI-421 b to have lost any primordial atmosphere that it could have accreted at its current orbital position, TOI-421 c could have started out with an initial atmospheric mass fraction somewhere between 10 and 35%. We conclude that the low observed mean density of TOI-421 b can only be explained by either a bias in the measured planetary parameters (e.g. driven by high-altitude clouds) and/or in the context of orbital migration. We also find that the results of atmospheric evolution models are strongly dependent on the employed planetary structure model.</description>

      <title>Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES). I. Astrometric Noise and Planetary Detection Efficiency due to Stellar Spots and Faculae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Closeby Habitable Exoplanet Survey (CHES) is dedicated to the astrometric exploration for habitable-zone Earth-like planets orbiting solar-type stars in close proximity, achieving unprecedented micro-arcsecond precision. Given the elevated precision, thorough consideration of photocenter jitters induced by stellar activity becomes imperative. This study endeavors to model the stellar activity of solar-type stars, compute astrometric noise, and delineate the detection limits of habitable planets within the astrometric domain. Simulations were conducted for identified primary targets of CHES, involving the generation of simulated observed data for astrometry and photometry, accounting for the impact of stellar activity. Estimation of activity levels in our samples was achieved through chromospheric activity indices, revealing that over 90% of stars exhibited photocenter jitters below 1 $\mu\mathrm{as}$. Notably, certain proximate stars, such as $\alpha$ Cen A and B, displayed more discernible noise arising from stellar activity. Subsequent tests were performed to evaluate detection performance, unveiling that stellar activity tends to have a less pronounced impact on planetary detectability for the majority of stars. Approximately 95% of targets demonstrated a detection efficiency exceeding 80%. However, for several cold stars, e.g., HD 32450 and HD 21531, with the habitable zones close to the stars, a reduction in detection efficiency was observed. These findings offer invaluable insights into the intricate interplay between stellar activity and astrometric precision, significantly advancing our understanding in the search for habitable planets.</description>

      <title>Reduction of dust radial drift by turbulence in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dust particles in protoplanetary disks, lacking support from pressure, rotate at velocities exceeding those of the surrounding gas. Consequently, they experience a head-wind from the gas that drives them toward the central star. Radial drift occurs on timescales much shorter than those inferred from disk observations or those required for dust to aggregate and form planets. Additionally, turbulence is often assumed to amplify the radial drift of dust in planet-forming disks when modeled through an effective viscous transport. However, the local interactions between turbulent eddies and particles are known to be significantly more intricate than in a viscous fluid. Our objective is to elucidate and characterize the dynamic effects of Keplerian turbulence on the mean radial and azimuthal velocities of dust particles. We employ 2D shearing-box incompressible simulations of the gas, which is maintained in a developed turbulent state while rotating at a sub-Keplerian speed. Dust is modeled as Lagrangian particles set at a Keplerian velocity, therefore experiencing a radial force toward the star through drag. Turbulent eddies are found to reduce the radial drift, while simultaneously enhancing the azimuthal velocities of small particles. This dynamic behavior arises from the modification of dust trajectories due to turbulent eddies.</description>

      <title>Generation of Low-Inclination, Neptune-Crossing TNOs by Planet Nine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar system's distant reaches exhibit a wealth of anomalous dynamical structure, hinting at the presence of a yet-undetected, massive trans-Neptunian body - Planet 9. Previous analyses have shown how orbital evolution induced by this object can explain the origins of a broad assortment of exotic orbits, ranging from those characterized by high perihelia to those with extreme inclinations. In this work, we shift the focus toward a more conventional class of TNOs, and consider the observed census of long-period, nearly planar, Neptune-crossing objects as a hitherto-unexplored probe of the Planet 9 hypothesis. To this end, we carry out comprehensive $N-$body simulations that self-consistently model gravitational perturbations from all giant planets, the Galactic tide, as well as passing stars, stemming from initial conditions that account for the primordial giant planet migration and sun's early evolution within a star cluster. Accounting for observational biases, our results reveal that the orbital architecture of this group of objects aligns closely with the predictions of the P9-inclusive model. In stark contrast, the P9-free scenario is statistically rejected at a $\sim5\,\sigma$ confidence-level. Accordingly, this work introduces a new line of evidence supporting the existence of Planet 9 and further delineates a series of observational predictions poised for near-term resolution.</description>

      <title>Biosignatures from pre-oxygen photosynthesising life on TRAPPIST-1e</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to assess observational evidence for potential atmospheric biosignatures on exoplanets, it will be essential to test whether spectral fingerprints from multiple gases can be explained by abiotic or biotic-only processes. Here, we develop and apply a coupled 1D atmosphere-ocean-ecosystem model to understand how primitive biospheres, which exploit abiotic sources of H2, CO and O2, could influence the atmospheric composition of rocky terrestrial exoplanets. We apply this to the Earth at 3.8 Ga and to TRAPPIST-1e. We focus on metabolisms that evolved before the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis, which consume H2 and CO and produce potentially detectable levels of CH4. O2-consuming metabolisms are also considered for TRAPPIST-1e, as abiotic O2 production is predicted on M-dwarf orbiting planets. We show that these biospheres can lead to high levels of surface O2 (approximately 1-5 %) as a result of \ch{CO} consumption, which could allow high O2 scenarios, by removing the main loss mechanisms of atomic oxygen. Increasing stratospheric temperatures, which increases atmospheric OH can reduce the likelihood of such a state forming. O2-consuming metabolisms could also lower O2 levels to around 10 ppm and support a productive biosphere at low reductant inputs. Using predicted transmission spectral features from CH4, CO, O2/O3 and CO2 across the hypothesis space for tectonic reductant input, we show that biotically-produced CH4 may only be detectable at high reductant inputs. CO is also likely to be a dominant feature in transmission spectra for planets orbiting M-dwarfs, which could reduce the confidence in any potential biosignature observations linked to these biospheres.</description>

      <title>Methane Emission From a Cool Brown Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond our solar system, aurorae have been inferred from radio observations of isolated brown dwarfs (e.g. Hallinan et al. 2006; Kao et al. 2023). Within our solar system, giant planets have auroral emission with signatures across the electromagnetic spectrum including infrared emission of H3+ and methane. Isolated brown dwarfs with auroral signatures in the radio have been searched for corresponding infrared features but have only had null detections (e.g. Gibbs et al. 2022). CWISEP J193518.59-154620.3. (W1935 for short) is an isolated brown dwarf with a temperature of ~482 K. Here we report JWST observations of strong methane emission from W1935 at 3.326 microns. Atmospheric modeling leads us to conclude that a temperature inversion of ~300 K centered at 1-10 millibar replicates the feature. This represents an atmospheric temperature inversion for a Jupiter-like atmosphere without irradiation from a host star. A plausible explanation for the strong inversion is heating by auroral processes, although other internal and/or external dynamical processes cannot be ruled out. The best fit model rules out the contribution of H3+ emission which is prominent in solar system gas giants however this is consistent with rapid destruction of H3+ at the higher pressure where the W1935 emission originates (e.g. Helling et al. 2019).</description>

      <title>Fresh view of the hot brown dwarf HD 984 B through high-resolution spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. High-resolution spectroscopy has the potential to drive a better understanding of the atmospheric composition, physics, and dynamics of young exoplanets and brown dwarfs, bringing clear insights into the formation channel of individual objects. Aims. Using the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC; R = 35,000), we aim to characterize a young brown dwarf HD 984 B. By measuring its C/O and 12CO/13CO ratios, we expect to gain new knowledge about its origin by confirming the difference in the formation pathways between brown dwarfs and super-Jupiters. Methods. We analysed the KPIC high-resolution spectrum (2.29-2.49 {\mu}m) of HD 984 B using an atmospheric retrieval framework based on nested sampling and petitRADTRANS, using both clear and cloudy models. Results. Using our best-fit model, we find C/O = 0.50+0.01-0.01 (0.01 is the statistical error) for HD 984 B which agrees with that of its host star within 1{\sigma} (0.40+0.20-0.20). We also retrieve an isotopolog 12CO/13CO ratio of 98+20-25 in its atmosphere, which is similar to that of the Sun. In addition, HD 984 B has a substellar metallicity with [Fe/H] = -0.62+0.02-0.02. Finally, we find that most of the retrieved parameters are independent of our choice of retrieval model. Conclusions. From our measured C/O and 12CO/13CO, the favored formation mechanism of HD 984 B seems to be via gravitational collapse or disk instability and not core accretion, which is a favored formation mechanism for giant exoplanets with m &lt; 13 MJup and semimajor axis between 10 and 100 au. However, with only a few brown dwarfs with a measured 12CO/13CO ratio, similar analyses using high-resolution spectroscopy will become essential in order to determine planet formation processes more precisely.</description>

      <title>Detection of an Atmospheric Outflow from the Young Hot Saturn TOI-1268b</title>

Abstract: Photoevaporative mass-loss rates are expected to be highest when planets are young and the host star is more active, but to date there have been relatively few measurements of mass-loss rates for young gas giant exoplanets. In this study we measure the present-day atmospheric mass-loss rate of TOI-1268b, a young (110 - 380 Myr) and low density (0.71$^{+0.17}_{-0.13}$~g~cm$^{-3}$) hot Saturn located near the upper edge of the Neptune desert. We use Palomar/WIRC to search for excess absorption in the 1083~nm helium triplet during two transits of TOI-1268b. We find that it has a larger transit depth ($0.285_{-0.050}^{+0.048}\%$ excess) in the helium bandpass than in the TESS observations, and convert this excess absorption into a mass-loss rate by modeling the outflow as a Parker wind. Our results indicate that this planet is losing mass at a rate of $\log \dot{M} = 10.2 \pm 0.3$~g~s$^{-1}$ and has a thermosphere temperature of 6900$^{+1800}_{-1200}$~K. This corresponds to a predicted atmospheric lifetime much larger than 10 Gyr. Our result suggests that photoevaporation is weak in gas giant exoplanets even at early ages.</description>

      <title>Methods for Incorporating Model Uncertainty into Exoplanet Atmospheric Analysis</title>

Abstract: A key goal of exoplanet spectroscopy is to measure atmospheric properties, such as abundances of chemical species, in order to connect them to our understanding of atmospheric physics and planet formation. In this new era of high-quality JWST data, it is paramount that these measurement methods are robust. When comparing atmospheric models to observations, multiple candidate models may produce reasonable fits to the data. Typically, conclusions are reached by selecting the best-performing model according to some metric. This ignores model uncertainty in favour of specific model assumptions, potentially leading to measured atmospheric properties that are overconfident and/or incorrect. In this paper, we compare three ensemble methods for addressing model uncertainty by combining posterior distributions from multiple analyses: Bayesian model averaging, a variant of Bayesian model averaging using leave-one-out predictive densities, and stacking of predictive distributions. We demonstrate these methods by fitting the HST+Spitzer transmission spectrum of the hot Jupiter HD 209458b using models with different cloud and haze prescriptions. All of our ensemble methods lead to uncertainties on retrieved parameters that are larger, but more realistic, and consistent with physical and chemical expectations. Since they have not typically accounted for model uncertainty, uncertainties of retrieved parameters from HST spectra have likely been underreported. We recommend stacking as the most robust model combination method. Our methods can be used to combine results from independent retrieval codes, and from different models within one code. They are also widely applicable to other exoplanet analysis processes, such as combining results from different data reductions.</description>

      <title>Evaporation of Close-in Sub-Neptunes by Cooling White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent surge in interest concerning white dwarf (WD) planets, this work presents the first numerical exploration of WD-driven atmospheric escape, whereby the high-energy radiation from a hot/young WD can trigger the outflow of the hydrogen-helium envelope for close-in planets. As a pilot investigation, we focus on two specific cases: a gas giant and a sub-Neptune-sized planet, both orbiting a rapidly cooling WD with mass $M_\ast$ = 0.6 \msun\ and separation $a$ = 0.02 AU. In both cases, the ensuing mass outflow rates exceed $10^{14}$ g sec$^{-1}$ for WD temperatures greater than $T_{\rm WD} \simeq$ 50,000 K. At $T_{\rm WD} \simeq$ 18,000 K [/22,000 K], the sub-Neptune [/gas giant] mass outflow rate approaches $10^{12}$ g sec$^{-1}$, i.e., comparable to the strongest outflows expected from close-in planets around late main-sequence stars. Whereas the gas giant remains virtually unaffected from an evolutionary standpoint, atmospheric escape may have sizable effects for the sub-Neptune, depending on its dynamical history, e.g., assuming that the hydrogen-helium envelope makes up 1 [/4] per cent of the planet mass, the entire envelope would be evaporated away so long as the planet reaches 0.02 AU within the first 230 [/130] Myr of the WD formation. We discuss how these results can be generalized to eccentric orbits with effective semi-major axis $a'=a/(1-e^2)^{1/4}$, which receive the same orbit-averaged irradiation. Extended to a much broader parameter space, this approach can be exploited to model the expected demographics of WD planets as a function of their initial mass, composition and migration history, as well as their potential for habitability.</description>

      <title>High-resolution atmospheric retrievals of WASP-76b transmission spectroscopy with ESPRESSO: Monitoring limb asymmetries across multiple transits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct atmospheric retrievals of exoplanets at high-resolution have recently allowed for a more detailed characterisation of their chemistry and dynamics from the ground. By monitoring the longitudinal distribution of species, as well as the varying vertical temperature structure and dynamics between the limbs of WASP-76b, across multiple transits, we aim to enhance our understanding of the 3D nature and chemical/dynamical evolution of such objects over the timescales of months/years. We present retrievals of three VLT/ESPRESSO observations of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-76b, including one not yet reported in the literature, from which we constrain the atmospheric abundances, vertical temperature structure, and atmospheric dynamics for both the leading and trailing limbs of the atmosphere separately, via novel rotational broadening kernels. We confirm the presence of VO recently reported in the atmosphere of WASP-76b. We find a uniform longitudinal distribution of Fe and Mg across the limbs of the atmosphere, for each of our transits, consistent with previous works as well as with stellar values. We constrain substellar Na/Fe and Cr/Fe ratios across each of our transits, consistent with previous studies of WASP-76b. Where constrained, V/Fe and VO/Fe ratios were also found to be broadly consistent between the limbs of the atmosphere for each of the transits, as well as with previous studies. However, for two of the transits, both V and VO were unconstrained in the leading limb, suggesting possible depletion due to recombination and condensation. The consistency of our constraints across multiple high-resolution observations, as well as with previous studies using varying modelling/retrieval frameworks and/or instruments, affirms the efficacy of high-resolution ground-based retrievals of exoplanetary atmospheres.</description>

      <title>The Basic Iterative Deconvolution: A fast instrumental point-spread function deconvolution method that corrects for light that is scattered out of the field of view of a detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11784v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A point-spread function describes the optics of an imaging system and can be used to correct collected images for instrumental effects. The state of the art for deconvolving images with the point-spread function is the Richardson-Lucy algorithm; however, despite its high fidelity, it is slow and cannot account for light scattered out of the field of view of the detector. We reinstate the Basic Iterative Deconvolution (BID) algorithm, a deconvolution algorithm that considers photons scattered out of the field of view of the detector, and extend it for image subregion deconvolutions. Its runtime is 1.8 to 7.1 faster than the Richardson-Lucy algorithm for 4096 x 4096 pixels images and up to an additional factor of 150 for subregions of 250 x 250 pixels. We test the extended BID algorithm for solar images taken by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), and find that the deviations between the reconstructed intensities of BID and the Richardson-Lucy algorithm are smaller than 1%.</description>
