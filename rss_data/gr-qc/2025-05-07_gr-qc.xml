      <title>The birth of a ghost star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a model of an evolving spherically symmetric dissipative self-gravitating fluid distribution which tends asymptotically to a ghost star, meaning that the end state of such a system corresponds to a static fluid distribution with vanishing total mass, and energy-density distribution which is negative in some regions of the fluid. The model is inspired in a solution representing a fluid evolving quasi-homologously and with vanishing complexity factor. However in order to satisfy the asymptotic behavior mentioned above, the starting solution has to be modified, as a consequence of which the resulting model only satisfies the two previously mentioned conditions, asymptotically. Additionally a condition on the variation of the infinitesimal proper radial distance between two neighboring points per unit of proper time is imposed, which implies the presence of a cavity surrounding the center. Putting together all these conditions we are able to obtain an analytical model depicting the emergence of a ghost star. Some potential observational consequences of this phenomenon are briefly discussed at the last section.</description>

      <title>Pre-geometric Einstein-Cartan Field Equations and Emergent Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field equations of pre-geometric theories of gravity are derived and analysed, both without and with matter. After the spontaneous symmetry breaking that reduces the gauge symmetry of these theories \`a la Yang-Mills, a metric structure for spacetime emerges and the field equations recover both the Einstein and the Cartan field equations for gravity. A first exact solution of the pre-geometric field equations is also presented. This solution can be considered as a pre-geometric de Sitter universe and provides a possible resolution for the problem of the Big Bang singularity.</description>

      <title>ECO signatures from the Weyl-induced gravitational waveform injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate gravitational wave emission from an oscillating star modeled in a static Weyl background using a modulated waveform ansatz. First, we revisit the Weyl metric and obtain a Bessel-type curvature solution with regularity and asymptotic flatness conditions compatible for an astrophysical compact object. Second, we model an oscillating star-like object with a perfect fluid as a source of gravitational radiation. A modified wave equation with curvature-induced redshifts is solved numerically leading to a waveform that produces primary components due to wave trapping. This signal is injected into real LIGO data for GW150914 and compared across detectors allowing the detectability of curvature-induced gravitational waveform in the threshold of LIGO's sensitivity, consistent with an exotic compact object (ECO).</description>

      <title>Spectral dimensionality of spacetime around a radiating Schwarzschild black-hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the spectral dimensionality of spacetime around a radiating Schwarzschild black hole using a recently introduced formalism of quantum gravity, where the alterations of the gravitational field produced by the radiation are represented on an extended manifold, and describe a non-commutative and non-linear algebra. The ration between classical and quantum perturbations of spacetime can be measured by the parameter $z \geq 0$. When $z=(1+\sqrt{3})/2\simeq 1.3660$, a relativistic observer approaching the Schwarzschild horizon perceives a spectral dimension $N(z)=4\left[\theta(z)-1\right]\simeq 2.8849$. Under these conditions, all studied Schwarzschild black holes with masses ranging from the Planck mass to $10^{46}$ times the Planck mass, present the same stability configuration which suggests the existence of an universal property of these objects under those particular conditions. The difference from the spectral dimension previously obtained at cosmological scales leads to the conclusion that the dimensionality of spacetime is scale-dependent. Another important result presented here, is the fundamental alteration of the effective gravitational potential near the horizon due to Hawking radiation. This quantum phenomenon prevents the potential from diverging to negative infinity as the observable approaches the Schwarzschild horizon.</description>

      <title>From modified Tsallis-Renyi entropy to a MOND-like force law, Bekenstein bound, and Landauer principle for black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine black hole thermodynamics within the framework of modified Renyi entropy and explore its implications in Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND), an extension of Newton second law proposed to explain galaxy rotation curves without invoking dark matter. We conjecture that Tsallis entropy provides an exact description of Bekenstein Hawking entropy, from which the modified Renyi entropy is derived. Using this formulation, we show that a MOND like force law emerges naturally from entropic considerations. We also analyze the Bekenstein bound conjecture, which imposes an upper limit on the entropy of confined quantum systems, and verify its validity under the Renyi modified framework for typical values of the deformation parameter. Furthermore, by invoking the Landauer principle, we obtain an expression for the mass loss due to black hole evaporation. These results suggest that modified Renyi statistics, originating from Tsallis entropy, provides a coherent and promising approach to gravitational dynamics and information theoretic aspects of black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Deep learning spinfoam vertex amplitudes: the Euclidean Barrett-Crane model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spinfoam theories propose a well-defined path-integral formulation for quantum gravity and are hoped to provide the dynamics of loop quantum gravity. However, it is computationally hard to calculate spinfoam amplitudes. The well-studied Euclidean Barrett-Crane model provides an excellent setting for testing analytical and numerical tools to probe spinfoam models. We explore a data-driven approach to accelerating spinfoam computations by showing that the vertex amplitude is an object that can be learned from data using deep learning. We divide the learning process into a classification and a regression task: Two networks are independently engineered to decide whether the amplitude is zero or not and to predict the precise numerical value, respectively. The trained networks are tested with several accuracy measures. The classifier in particular demonstrates robust generalisation far outside the training domain, while the regressor demonstrates high predictive accuracy in the domain it is trained on. We discuss limitations, possible improvements, and implications for future work.</description>

      <title>Generalization of Bohmian Mechanics and Quantum Gravity Effective Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the de Broglie-Bohm (dBB) formulation of quantum mechanics to the case of quantum gravity (QG) by using the effective action for a QG theory. This is done by replacing the dBB equations of motion with the effective action equations of motion, which is beneficial even in the non-gravitational case, since in this way one avoids the violations of the Heisenberg uncertainity relations and the absence of the classical trajectories for stationary bound states. Another advantage of the effective action formalism is that one can obtain the field configurations in the case of a quantum field theory (QFT). The proposed QG generalization is natural for Bohmiam mechanics because a dBB wavefunction is really a wavefunction of the Universe and in order to define the effective action for an arbitrary initial state one needs a QG path integral. The QG effective action can be constructed by using the piecewise flat quantum gravity (PFQG) theory and the PFQG effective action can be approximated by the QFT effective action for General Relativity coupled to matter, with a cutoff determined by the average edge length of the spacetime triangulation. One can then calculate the corresponding field configurations and from these field configurations one can obtain the trajectories for the corresponding elementary particles.</description>

      <title>Investigating Graviton Mass Effects on Black Hole Lensing in dRGT Massive Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we delve into the gravitational lensing and photon trajectories in the vicinity of non-asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes within the framework of dRGT massive gravity, incorporating a non-zero graviton mass. We assume that both the observer and the light source are located at a finite distance from the lens object, and calculate the gravitational deflection angle of light ray by such a black hole based on Gauss-Bonnet theorem. Furthermore, we derive the angular radius of Einstein rings associated with black holes in dRGT massive gravity, thereby facilitating a comprehensive discussion on the ramifications of the graviton mass. Notably, our findings reveal pronounced impacts of the graviton mass on both light deflection angles and Einstein ring characteristics, underscoring its significance in dRGT massive gravity and enhancing the detectability of black holes in gravitational lensing observations, thereby opening new avenues for future research.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Polarization Effects During the Reheating Epoch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum effects during the epoch of the unviverse reheating after inflation are considered. A semiclassical approach to the theory of gravity is applied in connection with the Starobinsky inflation model. Some subtleties associated with taking into account quantum effects in the one-loop approximation are clarified. An estimate of the contribution of vacuum polarization in the energy-momentum tensor of matter fields to the scalaron decay width is presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rederive the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner equations in a framework in which the zeros of the lapse are innocuous, whether with or without changes of sign. We further develop and analyse a covariantized version of the Anderson-York equations, which provide a well posed system of tensorial evolution equations with freely prescribable shift vector and densitised lapse. The causality properties of the resulting equations are explored. We show how to relate solutions of the Anderson-York equations to the maximal globally hyperbolic development of the initial data.</description>

      <title>Slowly Rotating Neutron Stars in Aether Scalar-Tensor Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aether Scalar-Tensor theory is a relativistic alternative gravity model that behaves like cold dark matter on cosmological scales while predicting the MOND force-law in astrophysical systems. The theory correctly predicts the cosmic microwave background and linear matter power spectra, and the mass discrepancies observed across the Universe. We derive and solve the equations governing neutron stars in Aether Scalar Tensor theory at first-order in slow rotation, finding that the theory predicts approximate universal relations between the moment of inertia and the compactness ($I$--$C$ relations) that differ from their general relativity counterparts. These relations may enable tests of Aether Scalar-Tensor theory using X-ray observations of pulsars and gravitational wave observations of binary neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Keeping the relation between the Starobinsky model and no-scale supergravity ACTive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a modification of the Starobinsky model in the form of an additional cubic Ricci scalar curvature term $\sim \alpha R^3$, scaled by a dimensionless parameter $\alpha$, with the resulting inflaton potential being the standard Starobinsky potential modified to first parametric order by an additive term. The resulting potential is identical to the potential obtained by a modification of the superpotential employed in the construction of the Starobinsky model in the framework of no-scale supergravity, thus, extending the correspondence between a class of no-scale supergravity models and modifications of the Starobinsky model. We analyze the inflationary predictions of the model and find that for $-4.2 \times 10^{-5} \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -1.9 \times 10^{-5}$, the modified Starobinsky model is in full agreement with the recent observational data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, for a range of $e$-folds, $N_\star = 50-60$.</description>

      <title>Consequences of non-minimal coupling for mass mixing in spontaneous baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of a non-minimal Yukawa-like coupling between curvature and inflaton field within the \emph{spontaneous baryogenesis} background. We demonstrate that this coupling leads to a significant enhancement in particle production, even for small values of the coupling constant $\xi$. Assuming a perfectly homogeneous and isotropic universe during the reheating phase, we study the inflaton decay into fermion-antifermion pairs by means of a semiclassical approach, treating fermions as quantized fields and considering the inflaton and the Ricci scalar as classical quantities. We adopt the simplest approach in which the inflaton is minimally coupled to baryons, and non-minimally with gravity. In particular, we solve the equations of motion for the inflaton to first order in perturbation theory, with $\xi$ serving as perturbative parameter. Afterwards, we compute the difference in the number densities of baryons and antibaryons produced through the inflaton decay into fermion-antifermion pairs. We show that the non-minimal coupling term \emph{de facto} increases inflaton mass, letting fermion-antifermion decays be more probable, and thus enhancing the overall baryogenesis process. As a further outcome, we find that the non-minimal Yukawa coupling also leads to a renormalization of the inflaton mass and weakly influences the bounds over the gravitational constant. Finally, since the fermionic fields appear not to be mass eigenstates, we specialize the mass-mixing between them only. To this end, we thus include the effects of mass-mixing and cosmic expansion into our calculations. Physical consequences of baryon production are therefore explored.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black hole in NGC 4649 (M60) with a dark matter halo: Impact on shadow measurements and thermodynamic properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate black hole (BH) solutions embedded in a dark matter (DM) halo, modeled as extensions of the Schwarzschild metric. The DM density profile is constrained by Hubble Space Telescope data, stellar dynamics, and globular cluster (GC) measurements of the elliptical galaxy NGC 4649 (M60). Using this profile, we construct two distinct spacetime solutions characterized by the black hole mass ($M$), critical velocity ($V_c$), and core radius ($a$), all reducing to the Schwarzschild case in the limit $V_c=0$ and $a=0$. Our results show that the DM halo modifies essential BH features, such as the event horizon radius and spacetime curvature, as reflected in the Kretschmann scalar. We also derive an approximate analytical expression for the BH shadow radius, which increases slightly due to the halo's influence. Comparisons with two observational datasets further validate the analysis. Thermodynamic properties are examined across the two models. In the first, a generalized Smarr formula is obtained via two additional variables, $\gamma$ and $a$. The second incorporates halo effects through $V_c=0$ and $a=0$. These results underscore the role of DM in shaping both geometric and thermodynamic aspects of BHs.</description>

      <title>Connecting afterglow light curves to the GRB central engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma ray burst (GRB) afterglow light curves have the potential to inform us about presently unobserved stages in the aftermath of a neutron star merger. Using numerical simulations of short GRB afterglows we obtain an approximate quantitative connection between key aspects of the emission mechanism and the shapes of the resulting light curves. Employing simple, but efficient, parameterizations of the light curve based on a broken power law in terms of physical parameters, fitted to a large dataset of synthetic light curves, we apply basic machine learning techniques to determine the approximate connection between key input parameters of the forward shock model and the light curve parameters. Solving then the inverse problem, we find that the strength of the central engine can be reasonably accurately estimated even with very limited information. In particular, merely the position of jet-break in the on-axis, respectively the maximum in the off-axis light curve determines the kinetic energy at the tens of percent level.</description>

      <title>Mock modularity at work, or black holes in a forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mock modular forms, first invented by Ramanujan, provide a beautiful generalization of the usual modular forms. In recent years, it was found that they capture generating functions of the number of microstates of BPS black holes appearing in compactifications of string theory with 8 and 16 supercharges. This review describes these results and their applications which range from the actual computation of these generating functions for both compact and non-compact compactification manifolds (encoding, respectively, Donaldson-Thomas and Vafa-Witten topological invariants) to the construction of new non-commutative structures on moduli spaces of Calabi-Yau threefolds.</description>

      <title>The Sky Remembers everything: Celestial amplitude, Shadow and OPE in quadratic EFT of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we compute the celestial amplitude arising from higher curvature corrections to Einstein gravity, incorporating phase dressing. The inclusion of such corrections leads to effective modifications of the theory's ultraviolet (UV) behaviour. In the eikonal limit, we find that, in contrast to Einstein's gravity, where the $u$ and $s$-channel contributions cancel, these contributions remain non-vanishing in the presence of higher curvature terms. We examine the analytic structure of the resulting amplitude and derive a dispersion relation for the phase-dressed eikonal amplitude in quadratic gravity. Furthermore, we investigate the celestial conformal block expansion of the Mellin-transformed conformal shadow amplitude within the framework of celestial conformal field theory (CCFT). As a consequence, we compute the corresponding operator product expansion (OPE) coefficients using the Burchnall-Chaundy expansion. In addition, we evaluate the OPE via the Euclidean OPE inversion formula across various kinematic channels and comment on its applicability and implications. Finally, we briefly explore the Carrollian amplitude associated with the corresponding quadratic EFT.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a fraction of LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA events coming from active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation channels of the gravitational-wave (GW) sources detected by LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA (LVK) remain poorly constrained. Active galactic nucleus (AGN) has been proposed as one of the potential hosts but the fraction of GW events originating from AGNs has not been quantified. Here, we constrain the AGN-origin fraction $f_{\rm agn}$ by analyzing the spatial correlation between GW source localizations ($O1\!-\!O4$a) and AGN distributions (SDSS DR16). We find evidence of an excess of low-luminosity ($L_{\rm bol} \le 10^{45}~\!\mathrm{erg~s}^{-1}$) as well as low-Eddington ratio ($\lambda_{\rm Edd} \le 0.05$) AGNs around the LVK events, the explanation of which requires $f_{\rm agn} = 0.39^{+0.41}_{-0.32}$ and $0.29^{+0.40}_{-0.25}$ (90\% confidence level) of the LVK events originating from these respective AGN populations. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that this correlation is unlikely to arise from random coincidence, further supported by anomalous variation of the error of $f_{\rm agn}$ with GW event counts. These results provide the first observational evidence for GW sources coming from either low-luminosity or low-accretion-rate AGNs, offering critical insights into the environmental dependencies of the formation of GW sources.</description>

      <title>Higgs-like inflation under ACTivated mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent analyses that combine the latest data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) with cosmic microwave background observations by BICEP/Keck and Planck, together with the DESI baryon acoustic-baryonic-oscillation (BAO) measurements, have tightened the limits on inflationary scenarios. The joint data set yields a spectral index of primordial scalar perturbations $n_s = 0.9743 \pm 0.0034$ and an upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r &lt; 0.038$. This slight upward shift in $n_s$ puts the previously favored Starobinsky model, and the conventional metric Higgs(-like) inflation--based on a quartic potential with a large non-minimal coupling in the Jordan frame--under tension with observations. In metric Higgs-like inflation the attractor behavior makes the predictions remarkably stable against higher-order operators, so modifying $n_s$ through such terms is difficult. In this paper, I show that adding a quadratic mass term to the Jordan-frame potential can raise $n_s$ and restore compatibility with the new data. I also discuss how this mass term can naturally arise from threshold effects in Higgs inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum cosmology for toroidal universes in d+1 dimensions. The Hilbert space is the space of square-integrable automorphic forms for GL(d). The Hartle-Hawking state is defined as a Poincar\'e sum over the no-boundary geometries. We obtain its representation in the Langlands spectral decomposition. This leads to an expression as a sum over the Riemann zeta zeros and implies that its near singularity dynamics is governed by the Hilbert-P\'olya Hamiltonian. It also takes the form of a M\"obius average of CFT partition functions which suggests a similar interpretation for the de Sitter entropy. We briefly discuss the relationship between quantum cosmology and the Langlands program.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Universal cosmologies are exact solutions of 10d type IIA supergravity containing a 4d Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker factor, that can also be repackaged as solutions of 4d models, i.e. as 4d consistent truncations. We extend the dynamical system analysis of universal cosmologies, beyond the case of a single exponential potential. For an open universe (negative 3d spatial curvature), these models generally possess many desirable features: parametric control of e-folds, late-time acceleration from potentials with steep exponentials (i.e. in accordance with swampland bounds), small string-loop and $\alpha'$-corrections, scale separation and/or absence of decompactification.</description>

Abstract: Improving the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors is necessary to enrich scientific outcome of gravitational wave astronomy. Birefringence in test mass mirrors of gravitational wave detectors can become an important factor for both current and next-generation gravitational wave detectors to achieve improved performance. In-situ birefringence characterization can become an essential diagnostic tool for detector performance, and needs to be established. We report a possible in-situ birefringence characterization method and its experimental results with a tabletop setup. The scheme proposed and demonstrated in this paper can be used as a diagnostic tool in large-scale gravitational wave detectors. We also discuss possible technological developments toward implementation in future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider ensembles of pure Gaussian states parametrized by single-mode marginals and (optionally) specific mode-mode correlations. Such ensembles provide a model for the final states when isolated quantum systems thermalize, as they can reproduce thermal properties locally, while being globally pure. By an analysis using real replicas and the coherent state representation of Gaussian states we show that the average entanglement entropy of a small subsystem is the same as the von Neumann entropy of a mixed Gaussian state with the same marginals, but no correlations. Finally, we discuss how these ensembles provide a model for Hawking radiation assuming unitary evolution, and discuss some of their properties in relations to the Page curve of Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Black holes, fast scrambling and the breakdown of the equivalence principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.02053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under reasonable assumptions, black holes have been argued to form firewalls, burning up anything crossing their horizons. This argument finds that a firewall would appear very late in a black hole's lifetime, when Hawking radiation has caused the horizon to shrink to one-half its original area. For stellar-mass black holes, this process surpasses the universe's current age and so no such black hole would currently possess a firewall. However, black holes have recently been conjectured to scramble their interior degrees-of-freedom, with a scrambling time scale comparable to the time it takes light to travel a Schwartzschild radius' distance. We prove that local observers will already experience a firewall from the scrambling time onwards after the black hole's formation. Here `local' means that the observer couples to fewer than one-half the black hole's total interior `qubits.' Indeed, for observers to fail to be local in this manner, it would mean that they couple to more `qubits' within such black holes than exist in all the stars of the observable universe. Therefore we find that if black holes are indeed fast scramblers, then every astrophysical black hole in the universe will already have a fully developed firewall for any local physical process.</description>

Abstract: It has been established that Black Hole (BH) spacetimes obeying some general set of assumptions always possess, at least, one light ring (per rotation sense) [arXiv:2003.06445]. This theorem was originally established for asymptotically flat, stationary, axial symmetric, 1+3 dimensional circular spacetimes harbouring a non-extremal and topologically spherical Killing horizon. Following the mantra that a theorem is only as strong as its assumptions in this work we extend this theorem to non topologically spherical (toroidal) BHs and to spacetimes harbouring more than one BH. As in [arXiv:2003.06445], we show that each BH still contributes with, at least, one LR (per rotation sense).</description>

Abstract: Recently, we introduced a non-perturbative quantization of impulsive gravitational null initial data. In this note, we investigate an immediate physical implication of the model. One of the quantum numbers is the total luminosity carried to infinity. We show that a transition happens when the luminosity reaches the Planck power $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{P}}$. Below $\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{P}}$, the spectrum of the radiated power is discrete. Above the Planck power, the spectrum is continuous and contains caustics that can spoil the semi-classical interpretation of the resulting quantum states of geometry.</description>

Abstract: Ultralight bosons can condense to form the so-called bosonic clouds around spinning black holes by superradiance instability. When quantum effects are taken into account, the classical black holes were replaced by exotic compact objects including area quantized black holes. In this work, we consider the superradiant instabilities of massive scalar fields around area quantized Kerr black hole. We introduce the reflectivity of area quantized black hole possesses the distinct discrete feature, and the scalar fields have the superradiant modes solution only within the specific mass range. In addition, the area quantization may terminate the superradiance when the black hole spins down, or even suppress the formation of the bosionic cloud.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variations in the instrumental noise of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) over time are expected as a result of e.g. scheduled satellite operations or unscheduled glitches. We demonstrate that these fluctuations can be leveraged to improve the sensitivity to stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs) compared to the stationary noise scenario. This requires optimal use of data segments with downward noise fluctuations, and thus a data analysis pipeline capable of analysing and combining shorter time segments of mission data. We propose that simulation based inference is well suited for this challenge. In an approximate, but state-of-the-art, modeling setup, we show by comparison with Fisher Information Matrix estimates that the optimal information gain can be achieved in practice.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from first-order phase transitions: from weak to strong</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the generation of gravitational waves (GWs) during a cosmological first-order phase transition (PT) using the recently introduced Higgsless approach to numerically simulate the fluid motion induced by the PT. We present for the first time GW spectra sourced by bulk fluid motion in the aftermath of strong first-order PTs ($\alpha = 0.5$), alongside weak ($\alpha = 0.0046$) and intermediate ($\alpha = 0.05$) PTs, previously considered in the literature. We find that, for intermediate and strong PTs, the kinetic energy in our simulations decays, following a power law in time. The decay is potentially determined by non-linear dynamics and hence related to the production of vorticity. We show that the assumption that the source is stationary in time, characteristic of compressional motion in the linear regime (sound waves), agrees with our numerical results for weak PTs, since in this case the kinetic energy does not decay with time. We then provide a theoretical framework that extends the stationary assumption to one that accounts for the time evolution of the source: as a result, the GW energy density is no longer linearly increasing with the source duration, but proportional to the integral over time of the squared kinetic energy fraction. This effectively reduces the linear growth rate of the GW energy density and allows to account for the period of transition from the linear to the non-linear regimes of the fluid perturbations. We validate the novel theoretical model with the results of simulations and provide templates for the GW spectrum for a broad range of PT parameters.</description>

      <title>Signatures of linearized gravity in atom interferometers: A simplified computational framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general framework for calculating the leading-order, general relativistic contributions to the gravitational phase shift in single-photon atom interferometers within the context of linearized gravity. We show that the atom gradiometer observable, which only depends on the atom interferometer propagation phase, can be written in terms of three distinct contributions: the Doppler phase shift, which accounts for the tidal displacement of atoms along the baseline, the Shapiro phase shift, which accounts for the delay in the arrival time of photons at atom-light interaction points, and the Einstein phase shift, which accounts for the gravitational redshift measured by the atoms. For specific atom gradiometer configurations, we derive the signal and response functions for two physically motivated scenarios: (i) transient gravitational waves in the transverse-traceless gauge and, for the first time, in the proper detector frame, and (ii) transient massive objects sourcing weak and slow-varying Newtonian potentials. We find that the Doppler contribution of realistic Newtonian noise sources (e.g., a freight truck or a piece of space debris) at proposed atom gradiometer experiments, such as AION, MAGIS and AEDGE, can exceed the shot noise level and thus affect physics searches if not properly subtracted.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we explore the $f(Q,T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu \nu})$ gravity theory, building upon the foundations laid by the $f(Q)$ and $f(Q,T)$ gravity theories. Here, $Q$ represents non-metricity and $T_{\mu\nu}$ stands for the energy-momentum tensor. The proposed action encompasses an arbitrary function of both non-metricity $Q$ and the square of the energy-momentum tensor, specifically $T^2=T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu \nu}$. We find the analytical solution for the barotropic fluid case $p=\omega \rho$ for the model $f(Q, T_{\mu \nu}T^{\mu \nu}) = Q + \eta(T_{\mu \nu}T^{\mu \nu}) $. We constrain parameters of the solution $H(z)$ utilizing CC, BAO, and latest Pantheon+SH0ES samples with the help of Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling technique along with Bayesian statistical analysis. Further, from the Om diagnostic test, we find that the assumed cosmological model favors the quintessence regime.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Coalescences in Dense Gaseous Environments Can Pose as ones in Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational-wave events observed by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration are attributed to compact binary coalescences happening in vacuum. However, several studies suggest that gaseous environments may play a significant role in the formation and evolution of compact binaries. Why have we not seen environmental effects in LVK signals? While matched-filtering remains the most effective technique for gravitational-wave searches, it comes with a burden: we might only observe signals that align with our (vacuum) expectations, potentially missing unexpected or unknown phenomena. Even more concerning is the possibility that environmental effects could mimic vacuum waveforms, introducing biases in parameter estimation and impacting population studies. Here, we use numerical relativity simulations of binary black hole mergers inside stellar envelopes to show that: (i) a $\texttt{GW150914}$-like event would be detected (with a false alarm rate smaller than $10^{-4}\, \mathrm{yr^{-1}}$) using a template bank of vacuum waveforms, even when immersed in a stellar envelope of density larger than $10^{7}\,\mathrm{g/cm^3}$; (ii) environmental effects can pass routinely performed tests of vacuum General Relativity, while leading to considerable biases in parameter estimation; but (iii) phenomenological environment waveforms are effectual in detecting environmental effects and can resolve systematics.</description>

      <title>On turbulence for spacetimes with stable trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by understanding the nonlinear gravitational dynamics of spacetimes admitting stably trapped null geodesics, such as ultracompact objects and black string solutions to general relativity, we explore the dynamics of nonlinear scalar waves on a simple (fixed) model geometry with stable trapping. More specifically, we consider the time evolution of solutions to the cubic (defocusing) wave equation on a four-dimensional static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat (horizonless) spacetime admitting a stable photon sphere.
  Our study shows fundamental differences between linear and nonlinear scalar dynamics. The local energy, as well as all local higher-order energies, of solutions to the linear wave equation on our model spacetime can be rigorously proven to remain uniformly bounded and to decay uniformly in time. However, due to the presence of stable trapping, the uniform decay rate is slow. To help elucidate how the slow linear decay affects solutions to the nonlinear wave equation considered, we examine numerical solutions of the latter, restricting to axisymmetric initial data in this work. In contrast to the linear dynamics, we exhibit a family of nonlinear solutions with turbulent behaviour: Within the region of stable trapping, the slow linear decay allows local higher-order energies of the nonlinear solution to grow over the time interval that we numerically evolve, with the growth being induced by a direct energy cascade.
  As a complement to the numerical analysis, we provide a heuristic argument suggesting that, if a similar behaviour occurs for gravitational wave perturbations of the motivating spacetimes in general relativity, it would likely not generically lead to black hole or singularity formation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the recently proposed stable and causal first-order relativistic hydrodynamics by Bemfica, Disconzi, and Noronha, we find the heat flow equation in the presence of gravity for a non-viscous fluid, which suffers heat dissipation. The derivation is confined to static and stationary backgrounds. We find that in the presence of gravity, the heat flux times a redshift factor is conserved. Then for radial heat flow, the temperature profiles are obtained from the heat equation when the gravity is sourced by Schwarzschild, Schwarzschild-dS, Kerr and Kerr-dS black holes, respectively. Consequently, the chemical potential profile is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In relativistic mechanics, the 4-velocity and the 4-momentum need not be parallel. This allows their norm to have a different sign. This possibility occurs in nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) models minimally coupled to Einstein's theory. Surprisingly, for a large class of NED models with a Maxwell limit, for weak fields, the causal (acausal) photons, as determined by their 4-velocity, have a spacelike (timelike) 4-momentum, leading to good tachyons and bad bradyons. Departing from weak fields, this possibility is determined solely by the concavity of the NED Lagrangian, which is consistent with the Dominant Energy Condition analysis. As a corollary, some popular regular black hole solutions sourced by NED, such as the Bardeen and Hayward solutions, are acausal.</description>

      <title>Dipolar perturbations of nonbidiagonal black holes in bigravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In bimetric gravity, nonbidiagonal solutions describing a static, spherically symmetric, and asymptotically flat black hole are given by a pair of Schwarzschild geometries, one in each metric sector. The two geometries are linked by a nontrivial diffeomorphism, which can be fully determined analytically if the two geometries possess the same isometries. This exact solution depends on four free parameters: the mass parameters of the two black holes, the ratio between the areal radii of the two metrics, and the proportionality constant between their (appropriately normalized) time-translation invariance Killing vector fields. We study the dynamics of axial dipolar perturbations on such a background and obtain general analytical solutions for their evolution. We show that, in general, the characteristic curves followed by dipolar gravitational waves are spacelike with respect to both metrics, and thus the propagation is superluminal. In fact, the velocity of a pulse, as measured by a static observer, turns out to increase with the distance to the black hole. The only exception to this general behavior corresponds to the special case where the two proportionality constants linking the areal radii and the Killing vectors coincide, for which waves travel at the speed of light. Therefore, we conclude that this is the only physically reasonable background, and thus our results restrict the class of viable black-hole solutions in bimetric gravity.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for unbounded superradiance in black hole spacetimes sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, it has been reported that black holes (BHs) sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) can trigger unbounded superradiance, i. e., the total absorption cross section -- the ratio between the absorbed flux and the incident flux of the wave -- can be negative and unbounded from below. Considering the propagation of massive charged test scalar fields in the vicinity of electrically charged BH solutions based on the NED framework, we derive sufficient conditions to have an unbounded superradiant regime. We also discuss some possible general conditions that the NED electrical source associated with the geometry has to satisfy to trigger an unbounded superradiance. Our results apply to a broad family of electrically charged BH solutions (regular and singular) derived in the framework of NED minimally coupled to general relativity.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the static solutions with rotational symmetry in the nonprojectable Ho\v{r}ava theory in 2+1 dimensions. We consider all inequivalent terms of the effective theory, including the cosmological constant. We find two distinct types of solutions: the first one corresponds to a Lifshitz solution, while the second one is obtained through a coordinate transformation of the equations of motion. This exact solution does not exhibit Lifshitz behavior and features a naked singularity.</description>

      <title>On a lower-dimensional Killing vector origin of irreducible Killing tensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering a spacetime foliated by co-dimension-2 hypersurfaces, we find the conditions under which lower-dimensional symmetries of a base space can be lifted up to irreducible Killing tensors of the full spacetime. In this construction, the key ingredient for irreducibility is the non-commutativity of the underlying Killing vectors. It gives rise to a tower of growing rank Killing tensors determined by the structure constants of the corresponding Lie algebra. A canonical example of a metric with such emergent non-trivial hidden symmetries in all dimensions is provided by rotating (off-shell) generalized Lense-Thirring spacetimes, where the irreducible Killing tensors arise from the underlying spherical symmetry of the base space. A physical on-shell realization of this construction in four dimensions is embodied by a rotating black hole in the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion theory. Further examples of equal spinning Myers-Perry spacetimes and spacetimes built on planar and Taub-NUT base metrics are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Resonant and Broadband Detection of Ultralight Dark Matter and High-Frequency Gravitational Waves via Cavities and Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12387v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electromagnetic resonant systems, such as cavities and LC circuits, are widely used to detect ultralight boson dark matter and high-frequency gravitational waves. However, the narrow bandwidth of single-mode resonators necessitates multiple scan steps to cover broad frequency ranges. By incorporating a network of auxiliary modes via beam-splitter-type and non-degenerate parametric couplings, we enable broadband detection with an effective bandwidth of each scan matching the order of the resonant frequency, while maintaining a strong signal response. In heterodyne upconversion detection, where a background cavity mode transitions into another due to a potential background source, multiple orders of the source frequency can be probed with high sensitivity without tuning the cavity frequency. Consequently, our method allows for significantly deeper exploration of the parameter space within the same integration time compared to single-mode detection.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-Wave and Gravitational-Wave Memory Signatures of Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01525v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the energy, signal-to-noise ratio, detection range, and angular anisotropy of the matter, matter memory, and neutrino memory gravitational wave (GW) signatures of 21 three-dimensional initially non-rotating core-collapse supernova (CCSN) models carried to late times. We find that inferred energy, signal-to-noise ratio, and detection range are angle-dependent quantities, and that the spread of possible energy, signal-to-noise, and detection ranges across all viewing angles generally increases with progenitor mass. When examining the low-frequency matter memory and neutrino memory components of the signal, we find that the neutrino memory is the most detectable component of a CCSN GW signal, and that DECIGO is best-equipped to detect both matter memory and neutrino memory. Moreover, we find that the polarization angle between the $h_+$ and $h_{\times}$ strains serves as a unique identifier of matter and neutrino memory. Finally, we develop a galactic density- and stellar mass-weighted formalism to calculate the rate at which we can expect to detect CCSN GW signals with Advanced LIGO. When considering only the matter component of the signal, the aLIGO detection rate is around 24$\%$ of the total galactic supernova rate, but increases to 92$\%$ when incorporating the neutrino memory component. We find that all future detectors (ET, CE, DECIGO) will be able to detect CCSN GW signals from the entire galaxy, and for the higher-mass progenitors even into the local group of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Does Gauss-Bonnet Inflationary Gravitational Waves satisfy the Pulsar Timing Arrays observations?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observations from pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), led by the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav), have provided opportunities to constrain primordial gravitational waves at low frequencies. In this paper, we analyze the best-fit parameter values for different Gauss-Bonnet Inflationary Gravitational Wave (GB-IGW) models with the PTArcade program, and we compare the results with the observations of NANOGrav, European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA), Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA), and International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA). We find the potential parameter $n$ derived from the GB-IGW model is not necessarily positive. Instead, PTA data suggest the possibility of new parameter ranges. Meanwhile, the other parameters' results, such as the spectral indices of the scalar and tensor perturbation also have differences with traditional Cosmic Microwave Background analyses from Planck 2018, showing the reason for the different phenomena of Gravitational Wave power spectra expected. Additionally, the GB-IGW models we calculated are closer to the central values of multiple PTA datasets compared to the standard inflation model, making the GB-IGW model more likely to be detected by future space-based gravitational wave observatories.</description>

      <title>Mixed 't Hooft Anomalies and the Witten Effect for AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a variety of BPS black holes in string theory, the supersymmetric index has provided a microscopic validation of the Bekenstein-Hawking formula. In the near-BPS limit, a gravitational path integral analysis previously revealed the semiclassical spectrum is modified, having a large extremal degeneracy (consistent with the index) and a mass gap up to a continuum of non-BPS black holes. Presently, we study examples in which these sharp features of the spectrum are altered due to the presence of anomalies in the form of $\vartheta$-angle terms in the action. These may appear generally, but we focus on near-BPS dyonic AdS$_4$ black holes in M-theory, dual to 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFTs of Class $R$ obtained by twisted compactification of $N$ wrapped M5 branes. Due to the Witten effect, the dyonic black holes receive quantum corrections to their charges, and when $\vartheta = \pi$ one may find a mixed `t Hooft anomaly between the $U(1)_R$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ time reversal symmetries. Using results from $\mathcal{N}=2$ JT supergravity, we find these effects result in a spectrum in which both the gap and index are reduced, and may even vanish. Surprisingly, for $\vartheta \rightarrow \pi$, neither the Bekenstein-Hawking formula nor the index correctly account for the extremal degeneracies.</description>

Abstract: Supersymmetric rotating 1/16-BPS black holes in $AdS_4 \times S^7$ are expected to capture the average degeneracy of BPS states in the dual ABJM superconformal theory for given fixed charges. This has been successfully demonstrated for the superconformal index using complexified black hole metrics, but a naive Gibbons-Hawking calculation of the actual degeneracies in the low temperature limit is invalid due to large quantum fluctuations of the near horizon $AdS_2$ metric. We argue that in a particular mixed grand/canonical ensemble, these fluctuations of the near-BPS Kerr-Newman black holes are described by a version of the $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-Schwarzian theory with $SU(1,1|1)$ symmetry. Using this description as well as properties of ABJM, we recover the large $N$ superconformal index and find a characteristic ``mass gap'' of order $N^{-3/2}$ between the 1/16-BPS states and the lightest near BPS state. We further make a prediction for the operator dimension spectrum above the gap in the large $N$, low $T$ limit. Our results are consistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking formula at large energies, random matrix theory at low energies, and the microscopic index.</description>

      <title>Search for a gravitational wave background from primordial black hole binaries using data from the first three LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing runs</title>

Abstract: Using the cross-correlation data from the first three observing runs of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration, we search for a gravitational-wave background (GWB) from primordial black holes, arising from the superposition of compact binary coalescence events. We consider both early and late binary formation mechanisms, and perform Bayesian parameter inference, investigating different prior distributions of the model parameters. From the non-detection of the GWB, we provide constraints on the fraction of primordial black holes contributing to the present dark matter energy density.</description>

      <title>Gravito-electromagnetism, Kerr-Schild and Weyl double copies; a unified perspective</title>

Abstract: Two modern programs involving analogies between general relativity and electromagnetism, gravito-electromagnetism (GEM) and the classical double copy (CDC), induce electromagnetic potentials from specific classes of spacetime metrics. We demonstrate such electromagnetic potentials are typically gauge equivalent to Killing vectors present in the spacetime, long known themselves to be analogous to electromagnetic potentials. We utilize this perspective to relate the Type D Weyl double copy to the Kerr-Schild double copy without appealing to specific coordinates. We analyze the typical assumptions taken within Kerr-Schild double copies, emphasizing the role Killing vectors play in the construction. The basis of the GEM program utilizes comparisons of tidal tensors between GR and EM; we perform a more detailed analysis of conditions necessary for equivalent tidal tensors between the theories, and note they require the same source prescription as the classical double copy. We discuss how these Killing vector potentials relate to the Weyl double copy, in particular there must a relation between the field strength formed from the Killing vector and the Weyl tensor. We consider spacetimes admitting a Killing-Yano tensor which provide a particularly insightful example of this correspondence. This includes a broad class of spacetimes, and provides an explanation for observations regarding the splitting of the Weyl tensor noted when including sources.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of effective actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17851v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the same quantum field theory distinct effective actions can be obtained by coupling sources to different choices of field variables. This is the same as considering effective actions for theories related by a change of variables and thus differ only by the values of so called inessential couplings. The effective actions will appear quite different since they generate correlation functions of different operators. Here we show that the effective actions are related by an implicit change of variables of the mean field, i.e. the argument of the effective action. Conversely, one can go the other way: by making a change of variables of the mean variable we obtain a new effective action which generates correlation functions of an implicitly defined composite field. The existence of the implicit transformations in both cases rests on the existence of solutions to initial value problems where the ``time'' parameter is an inessential coupling. Non-perturbatively the solutions may only exist for some non-zero amount of this time. However, at each order in perturbation theory one obtains linear equations which implies that unique solutions exist. We then show that scattering amplitudes are independent of inessential couplings without use of perturbation theory. For gauge theories we expect our correspondence to extend to effective actions which differ by a choice of gauge.</description>
