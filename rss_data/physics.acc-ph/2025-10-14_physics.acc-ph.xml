      <title>Fabrication, Characterization and Modeling of a High-Temperature Superconducting Double Racetrack Coil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper summarizes our work on the fabrication, characterization, and modeling of a high-temperature superconducting double racetrack (DRC) coil. Using an in-house developed winding system, a DRC was wound with ReBCO superconducting tape. The coil was first characterized under direct current to obtain its IV characteristic and its critical current. It was then characterized under alternating current (60 Hz and 120 Hz) to measure its alternating current losses (AC losses). These measurements were compared with a 3D finite element model and show reasonable agreement given the modeling assumptions. The coil exhibits good performance, did not undergo any degradation during winding, and can be used for further studies. This validates our fabrication process and our approach to superconducting coil characterization.</description>

      <title>A Beamdump Facility at Jefferson Lab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This White Paper is exploring the potential of intense secondary muon, neutrino, and (hypothetical) light dark matter beams produced in interactions of high-intensity electron beams with beam dumps. Light dark matter searches with the approved Beam Dump eXperiment (BDX) are driving the realization of a new underground vault at Jefferson Lab that could be extended to a Beamdump Facility with minimal additional installations. The paper summarizes contributions and discussions from the International Workshop on Secondary Beams at Jefferson Lab (BDX &amp; Beyond). Several possible muon physics applications and neutrino detector technologies for Jefferson Lab are highlighted. The potential of a secondary neutron beam will be addressed in a future edition.</description>

      <title>Neutron production with a 10 kW HiCANS based on SATELIT, a CEA-Saclay target with liquid lithium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-Current Accelerator-driven Neutron Sources (HiCANS) are currently under development across Europe to address the shortage of medium-scale neutron sources, as many research nuclear reactors have been decommissioned over the past several years. At CEA-Saclay, a HiCANS has been developed utilizing the IPHI accelerator, which delivers a 3 MeV proton beam with a current of up to 100 mA, and the CEA-Saclay liquid lithium target named SATELIT. In 2024-2025, a successful experimental campaign was conducted, during which a 10 kW proton beam was directed at the liquid lithium target for nearly 100 h to generate neutrons via the 7Li(p,n)7Be nuclear reaction. Throughout the experimental campaign, a total deposited beam power of 840~kW.h was accumulated, including two continuous operational days exceeding 11 h each. A polyethylene moderator coupled with SATELIT enabled the extraction of a thermal neutron beam, with a flux measured at 1.4 m from the extraction point exceeding $10^6$ n.cm$^{-2}$.s$^{-1}$, which is sufficient for numerous neutron applications. The next step for the long-term operation of this facility involves developing strategies to mitigate the radiological concerns associated with the accumulation of 7Be within the system. Overall, this work demonstrates that such facilities can play a significant role in the future of medium-scale neutron sources in Europe.</description>

      <title>Injector for dielectric laser accelerators based on an ultracold electron source and a magnet design avoiding apparent emittance growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dielectric Laser Acceleration holds the promise of extremely high acceleration gradients in laser-driven miniaturized accelerator structures. However, sub-relativistic experimental demonstration has so far been limited by bunch charges well below 1 electron per bunch due to the low acceptance of these 'accelerator-on-a-chip' devices. Here, we propose a novel design for an injector tailor made for dielectric laser acceleration, based on just-above-threshold ionization of laser-cooled atoms. The key new feature is a an innovative magnet design that avoids apparent emittance growth by using the field-free regions of an axially polarised ring of permanent magnets as source point. We optimized this design using a multi-objective optimization approach that is also applicable to the development of other sub-relativistic, high-brightness/low-emittance electron beam setups (like setups for ultrafast electron diffraction). The expected injected bunch charge of our proposed injector is 90 (60) electrons for a dielectric laser acceleration gradient of 1 GV/m (100MV/m) operating at a 10 micron driver laser wavelength, increasing the expected bunch charge by about two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Realizing the Scientific Program with Polarized Ion Beams at EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarized ion beams at the Electron Ion Collider are essential to address some of the most important open questions at the twenty-first century frontiers of understanding of the fundamental structure of matter. Here, we summarize the science case and identify polarized $^2$H, $^3$He, $^6$Li and $^7$Li ion beams as critical technology that will enable experiments which address the most important science. Further, we discuss the required ion polarimetry and spin manipulation in EIC. The current EIC accelerator design is presented. We identify a significant R\&amp;D effort involving both national laboratories and universities that is required over about a decade to realize the polarized ion beams and estimate (based on previous experience) that it will require about 20 FTE over 10 years (or a total of about 200 FTE-years) of personnel, including graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, technicians and engineers. Attracting, educating and training a new generation of physicists in experimental spin techniques will be essential for successful realization. AI/ML is seen as having significant potential for both acceleration of R\&amp;D and amplification of discovery in optimal realization of this unique quantum technology on a cutting-edge collider. The R\&amp;D effort is synergistic with research in atomic physics and fusion energy science.</description>

      <title>Impact of coherent wiggler radiation impedance in Tau-Charm factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) has long been recognized as a significant source of longitudinal impedance driving microwave instability in electron storage rings. In the pursuit of higher luminosity, next-generation circular $e^+e^-$ colliders operating in the few-GeV energy range, such as B-factories and Tau-Charm factories, are being designed with low-emittance beams and high beam currents. Damping wigglers are commonly introduced to reduce damping times and control beam emittance. In this study, we systematically investigate the impact of coherent wiggler radiation (CWR), a specific form of CSR generated within wigglers, on beam stability in Tau-Charm factories. We revisit the threshold conditions for CWR-induced microwave instability and evaluate its effects under realistic lattice configurations of collider rings. Furthermore, we examine theoretical models of longitudinal CWR impedance and identify improved formulations that better capture its influence. As an illustrative example, the developed CWR impedance models are applied to simulate beam stability in the Super Tau-Charm Facility currently under design in China.</description>

      <title>Experimental Reconstruction of Source 4D Phase Space Without Prior Knowledge of Transfer Matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a method for reconstructing the transverse 4D phase space of an electron beam at the time of emission from downstream diagnostics of the 4D phase space. This method does not rely on detailed knowledge of the beamline transport, besides assuming that linearity and symplecticity are satisfied. We apply this method to measure the transverse position and momentum phase space of electrons emitted from a spatially-structured alkali-antimonide cathode. This method can uncover local correlations between emission location and momentum spread. We formulate this method analytically and investigate resolution limits.</description>

      <title>A Living Review Pipeline for AI/ML Applications in Accelerator Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an open-source pipeline for generating a \emph{living review} of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) applications in accelerator physics and technologies. Traditional review articles provide static snapshots that are quickly outdated by the rapid pace of research. The presented system automatically harvests publications from multiple bibliographic sources (arXiv, InspireHEP, HAL, OpenAlex, Crossref, and Springer), deduplicates entries, applies semantic filtering to ensure accelerator and ML relevance, and classifies papers into thematic categories. The resulting curated dataset was exported in JSON, HTML, PDF, and Bib\TeX formats, enabling continuous updates and integration with web frameworks. We describe the methodology, including semantic similarity filtering using sentence-transformer embeddings, threshold calibration, and expert-informed classification. The results demonstrate the robust filtering of $\sim$12000 raw papers/month into a focused corpus of $\sim$2\% relevant works. The pipeline provides the basis for an evolving community-driven review of AI/ML in accelerator science.</description>
