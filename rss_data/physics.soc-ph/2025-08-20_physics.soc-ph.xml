      <title>Ideal Social Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work continues the one commenced in a previous one, where the key idea is that individual stances on a social matter can be modeled as positions of particles in physics. Here, we explore the aggregation of individual behavior as a microscopic model of social phenomena to obtain quantities characterizing a society as a whole, similar to the resulting thermodynamical quantities at the macroscopic scale. We follow the theoretical framework of statistical mechanics with a Boltzmann distribution. Notwithstanding the fact that the translation of physical concepts need to be adequately motivated, a key distinction with respect to the physical case is that a social particle has a position-dependent mass. From such a generalization we obtain a simple example to illustrate the possibilities of such an approach based on the ideal gas model in physics. As a result, we find that the social phenomena can be modeled as a gas under the assumptions considered here. We discuss how several concepts and their relations reasonably translate from physical to social phenomena.</description>

      <title>Semi-Markov random walk on complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a semi-Markov model of random walk on complex networks in discrete and continuous-time scenario. In the general setting of the semi-Markov chains, the duration of stay at given node - the sojourn time - is random, and the probability to transition to a neighbor depends on the sojourn time. Analytical formulae for the average sojourn time and the node occupation probability of infinite walk are presented and verified with Monte Carlo simulations for two examples. We propose an application of the semi-Markovian random walk for ranking web pages determined by the fraction of time that infinite random surfer spends on a web page - time rank, as an alternative to the existing PageRank that relies on the fraction of visits - visit rank.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Community Formation in Response to Extreme Weather Events through Human Mobility Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.04981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Community formation in socio-spatial human networks is one of the important mechanisms for mitigating hazard impacts of extreme weather events. Research is scarce regarding latent network characteristics shaping community formation in human mobility networks during natural disasters. Here, we examined human mobility networks in Harris County, Texas, in the context of the managed power outage forced by 2021 Winter Storm Uri to detect communities and to evaluate latent characteristics in those communities. We examined three characteristics in the communities formed within human mobility networks: hazard-exposure heterophily, socio-demographic homophily, and social-connectedness strength. The results show that population movements were shaped by socio-demographic homophily, heterophilic hazard exposure, and social connectedness strength. Our results also indicate that a community encompassing more high-impact areas would motivate population movements to areas with weaker social connectedness. Our findings reveal important characteristics shaping community formation in human mobility networks in hazard response. Specific to managed power outages, formed communities are spatially co-located, underscoring a best management practice to avoid prolonged power outages among areas within communities, thus improving hazard exposure heterophily. The findings have implications for power utility operators to account for the characteristics of socio-spatial human networks when determining the patterns of managed power outages.</description>

      <title>Edge Correlations and Link Prediction in Growing Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02386v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generative model of temporally-evolving hypergraphs in which hyperedges form via noisy copying of previous hyperedges. Our proposed model reproduces several stylized facts from many empirical hypergraphs, is learnable from data, and defines a likelihood over a complete hypergraph rather than ego-based or other sub-hypergraphs. Analyzing our model, we derive descriptions of node degree, edge size, and edge intersection size distributions in terms of the model parameters. We also show several features of empirical hypergraphs which are and are not successfully captured by our model. We provide a scalable stochastic expectation maximization algorithm with which we can fit our model to hypergraph data sets with millions of nodes and edges. Finally, we assess our model on a hypergraph link prediction task, finding that an instantiation of our model with just 11 parameters can achieve competitive predictive performance with large neural networks.</description>
