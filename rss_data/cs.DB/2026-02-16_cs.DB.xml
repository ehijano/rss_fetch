      <title>Monte Carlo Tree Search with Reasoning Path Refinement for Small Language Models in Conversational Text-to-NoSQL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: NoSQL databases have been widely adopted in big data analytics, geospatial applications, and healthcare services, due to their flexibility and scalability. However, querying NoSQL databases requires specialized technical expertise, creating a high barrier for users. While recent studies have explored text-to-NoSQL problem, they primarily focus on single-turn interactions, ignoring the conversational nature of real-world queries. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Conversational Text-to-NoSQL task, which generates NoSQL queries given a natural language question, a NoSQL database, and the dialogue history. To address this task, we propose Stage-MCTS, a framework that endows small language models (SLMs) with NoSQL-specific reasoning capabilities by formulating query generation as a search problem. The framework employs Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) guided by a rule-based reward to produce stepwise reasoning data, followed by progressive supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and self-training strategies. We further construct CoNoSQL, a cross-domain dataset with over 2,000 dialogues and 150 databases, to support evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art large reasoning models, improving execution value match (EVM) accuracy by up to 7.93%.</description>

      <title>Implicit Representation of Structural Constraints in ER-to-Relational Transformation: An Analysis of Cardinality Preservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the extent to which structural constraints specified in conceptual schemas are represented after transformation to logical schemas. Focusing on the conceptual-to-logical mapping, an Entity-Relationship (ER) model containing binary relationship types is transformed into a Relational Database Schema (RDS). The analysis is conducted under the classical transformation framework in which the logical schema is defined solely by primary key (PK) and foreign key (FK) constraints. Using generalised ER models with variable structural constraint values, the resulting RDS structures are evaluated to determine whether minimum and maximum participation constraints are represented unambiguously. The findings show that, for one-to-one and one-to-many relationships, RDSs do not unambiguously capture minimum participation constraints and do not encode exact maximum participation beyond limited cases. For many-to-many relationships, the schema indicates only that maximum cardinalities exceed one, without preserving exact values. These results clarify the representational limits of standard ER-to-relational transformations and have implications for schema design and constraint enforcement.</description>

      <title>RADAR: Exposing Unlogged NoSQL Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of NoSQL databases has made digital forensics increasingly difficult as storage formats are diverse and often opaque, and audit logs cannot be assumed trustworthy when privileged insiders, such as DevOps or administrators, can disable, suppress, or manipulate logging to conceal activity. We present RADAR (Record &amp; Artifact Detection, Alignment &amp; Reporting), a log-adversary-aware framework that derives forensic ground truth by cross-referencing low-level storage artifacts against high-level application logs. RADAR analyzes artifacts reconstructed by the Automated NoSQL Carver (ANOC), which infers layouts and carves records directly from raw disk bytes, bypassing database APIs and the management system entirely, thereby treating physical storage as the independent evidence source. RADAR then reconciles carved artifacts with the audit log to identify delta artifacts such as unlogged insertions, silent deletions, and field-level updates that exist on disk but are absent from the logical history. We evaluate RADAR across ten NoSQL engines, including BerkeleyDB, LMDB, MDBX, etcd, ZODB, Durus, LiteDB, Realm, RavenDB, and NitriteDB, spanning key-value and document stores and multiple storage designs, e.g., copy-on-write/MVCC, B/B+ tree, and append-only. Under log-evasion scenarios, such as log suppression and post-maintenance attacks, including cases where historical bytes are pruned, RADAR consistently exposes unattributed operations while sustaining 31.7-397 MB/min processing throughput, demonstrating the feasibility of log-independent, trustworthy NoSQL forensics.</description>

      <title>Direct Access for Conjunctive Queries with Negations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15800v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a conjunctive query $Q$ and a database $D$, a direct access to the answers of $Q$ over $D$ is the operation of returning, given an index $k$, the $k$-th answer for some order on its answers. While this problem is $\#\mathcal{P}$-hard in general with respect to combined complexity, many conjunctive queries have an underlying structure that allows for a direct access to their answers for some lexicographical ordering that takes polylogarithmic time in the size of the database after a polynomial time precomputation. Previous work has precisely characterised the tractable classes and given fine-grained lower bounds on the precomputation time needed depending on the structure of the query.
  In this paper, we generalise these tractability results to the case of signed conjunctive queries, that is, conjunctive queries that may contain negative atoms. Our technique is based on a class of circuits that can represent relational data. We first show that this class supports tractable direct access after a polynomial time preprocessing. We then give bounds on the size of the circuit needed to represent the answer set of signed conjunctive queries depending on their structure. Both results combined together allow us to prove the tractability of direct access for a large class of conjunctive queries. On the one hand, we recover the known tractable classes from the literature in the case of positive conjunctive queries. On the other hand, we generalise and unify known tractability results about negative conjunctive queries -- that is, queries having only negated atoms. In particular, we show that the class of $\beta$-acyclic negative conjunctive queries and the class of bounded nest set width negative conjunctive queries admit tractable direct access.</description>

      <title>RLMiner: Finding the Most Frequent k-sized Subgraph via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the most frequent induced subgraph of size $k$ in a target graph is a fundamental graph mining problem with direct implications for Web-related data mining and social network analysis. Despite its importance, finding the most frequent induced subgraph remains computationally expensive due to the NP-hard nature of the subgraph counting task. Traditional exact enumeration algorithms often suffer from high time complexity, especially for a large graph size $k$. To mitigate this, existing approaches often utilize frequency measurement with the Downward Closure Property to reduce the search space, imposing additional constraints on the task. In this paper, we first formulate this task as a Markov Decision Process and approach it using a multi-task reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we introduce RLMiner, a novel framework that integrates reinforcement learning with our proposed task-state-aware Graph Neural Network to find the most frequent induced subgraph of size $k$ with a time complexity linear to $k$. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed RLMiner effectively identifies subgraphs with frequencies closely matching the ground-truth most frequent induced subgraphs, while achieving significantly shorter and more stable running times compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>Mayfly: Private Aggregate Insights from Ephemeral Streams of On-Device User Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Mayfly, a federated analytics approach enabling aggregate queries over ephemeral on-device data streams without central persistence of sensitive user data. Mayfly minimizes data via on-device windowing and contribution bounding through SQL-programmability, anonymizes user data via streaming differential privacy (DP), and mandates immediate in-memory cross-device aggregation on the server -- ensuring only privatized aggregates are revealed to data analysts. Deployed for a sustainability use case estimating transportation carbon emissions from private location data, Mayfly computed over 4 million statistics across more than 500 million devices with a per-device, per-week DP $\varepsilon = 2$ while meeting strict data utility requirements. To achieve this, we designed a new DP mechanism for Group-By-Sum workloads leveraging statistical properties of location data, with potential applicability to other domains.</description>
