      <title>Existence and Properties of Frames of Iterations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let T be a bounded operator acting on an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a Parseval frame of iterations generated by T. Based in this result, we give a new proof of a known characterization concerning the existence of (not necessarily Parseval) frames of iterations. As a consequence of our results, we obtain that certain operators lack Parseval frames despite possessing frames of iterations. In addition, we introduce the index of a bounded operator T as the minimal number of vectors required to generate a frame via its iterations. We obtain the exact value of this index for both Parseval frames and general frames of iterations, and we give a constructive method for generating such frames. Assuming that T satisfies the conditions ensuring that both T and T^* admit frames of iterations, we show how to construct Parseval frames generated by iterations of T and also by iterations of T^*. This construction relies on universal models in vector-valued Hardy spaces and the theory of universal dilations. Furthermore, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions under which the frames generated by T and T^* are similar, in terms of the inner function of the associated model in the Hardy space of the operator T.</description>

      <title>Paradoxical decompositions of finite-dimensional non-Archimedean normed spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that any normed space $(K^n,\|\cdot\|)$, $n\ge 2$, over a field $K$ equipped with a nontrivial non-Archimedean valuation admits a paradoxical decomposition using four pieces with respect to the group of its affine isometries, provided that the norm $\|\cdot\|$ is equivalent to the maximum norm.
  It follows that any finite-dimensional normed space $(X,\|\cdot\|)$ with $\dim{X}\ge 2$ over a complete non-Archimedean nontrivially valued field $(K,|\cdot|)$ is paradoxical using four pieces with respect to the group of its affine isometries.</description>

      <title>Compact embeddings of Bessel Potential Spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bessel potential spaces have gained renewed interest due to their robust structural properties and applications in fractional partial differential equations (PDEs). These spaces, derived through complex interpolation between Lebesgue and Sobolev spaces, are closely related to the Riesz fractional gradient. Recent studies have demonstrated continuous and compact embeddings of Bessel potential spaces into Lebesgue spaces. This paper extends these findings by addressing the compactness of continuous embeddings from the perspective of abstract interpolation theory. We present three distinct proofs, leveraging compactness results, translation estimates, and the relationship between Gagliardo and Bessel spaces. Our results provide a deeper understanding of the functional analytic properties of Bessel potential spaces and their applications in fractional PDEs.</description>

      <title>The Free Functional Calculus in General</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical theory of free analysis generalizes the noncommutative (nc) polynomials and rational functions, easily providing such results as an nc analogue of the Jacobian conjecture. However, the classical theory misses out on important functions, such as the Schur complement. This paper presents a generalization of free functions, viewing them as a natural categorial structure: functors between functor categories that commute with natural transformation. We study this construction on general additive categories; we define, characterize and categorize certain sorts of free maps, such as polynomials and rational expressions, and then prove an analogue of the inverse function theorem, demonstrating a natural lifting of a proof into this broader context.
  We then provide some algebraic basis for this theory, constructing vector spaces, an additive category of free polynomials, and defining a class of products that allows us to form true ring structures on any vector space of free nc polynomials.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of parabolic problems for non-local convolution type operators under non-diffusive scaling of coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study homogenization problem for non-autonomous parabolic equations of the form $\partial_t u=L(t)u$ with an integral convolution type operator $L(t)$ that has a non-symmetric jump kernel which is periodic in spatial variables and in time. It is assumed that the space-time scaling of the environment is not diffusive. We show that asymptotically the spatial and temporal evolutions of the solutions are getting decoupled, and the homogenization result holds in a moving frame.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of invariant submodule in the theory of Hilbert C*-modules and study some basic properties of bounded adjointable operators and their generalized inverses which have nontrivial invariant submodules. We demonstrate the representation of the solution set of an operator equation on Hilbert C*-modules by taking advantage of invariant submodules. In particular, we consider the special cases of finite dimensional C*-algebras and C*-algebras of compact operators as the underling C*-algebra to simplify our results, and obtain a Lomonosov type theorem for compact operators on some Hilbert C*-modules.</description>

      <title>SVarM: Linear Support Varifold Machines for Classification and Regression on Geometric Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite progress in the rapidly developing field of geometric deep learning, performing statistical analysis on geometric data--where each observation is a shape such as a curve, graph, or surface--remains challenging due to the non-Euclidean nature of shape spaces, which are defined as equivalence classes under invariance groups. Building machine learning frameworks that incorporate such invariances, notably to shape parametrization, is often crucial to ensure generalizability of the trained models to new observations. This work proposes SVarM to exploit varifold representations of shapes as measures and their duality with test functions $h:\mathbb{R}^n \times S^{n-1} \to \mathbb{R}$. This method provides a general framework akin to linear support vector machines but operating instead over the infinite-dimensional space of varifolds. We develop classification and regression models on shape datasets by introducing a neural network-based representation of the trainable test function $h$. This approach demonstrates strong performance and robustness across various shape graph and surface datasets, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters.</description>

      <title>Fourier Frames on Salem Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For every $0&lt;s\leq 1$ we construct $s$-dimensional Salem measures in the unit interval that do not admit any Fourier frame. Our examples are generic for each $s$, including all existing types of Salem measures in the literature: random Cantor sets (convolutions, non-convolutions), random images, and deterministic constructions on Diophantine approximations. They even appear almost surely as Brownian images. We also develop different approaches to prove the nonexistence of Fourier frames on different constructions. Both the criteria and ideas behind the constructions are expected to work in higher dimensions.
  On the other hand, we observe that a weighted arc in the plane can be a $1$-dimensional Salem measure with orthonormal basis of exponentials. This leaves whether there exist Salem measures in the real line with Fourier frames or even orthonormal basis of exponentials a subtle problem.</description>

Abstract: We prove that Toeplitz operators associated with a Bernstein-Markov measure on a compact complex manifold endowed with a big line bundle form an algebra under composition. As an application, we derive a Szeg\H{o}-type spectral equidistribution result for this class of operators. A key component of our approach is the off-diagonal asymptotic analysis of the Bergman kernel, also known as the Christoffel-Darboux kernel.</description>

      <title>Higher order spectral shift of Euclidean Callias operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Dirac-Schr\"odinger operators over odd-dimensional Euclidean space. The conditions for the potential are based on those of C. Callias in his famous paper on the corresponding index problem. However, we treat the case where the potential can take values in unbounded operators of a separable Hilbert space, and crucially, we also do not assume that the potential needs to be invertible outside a compact region. Hence, the Dirac-Schr\"odinger operator is not necessarily Fredholm. In the setup we discuss, it however still admits a related trace formula in terms of the underlying potential.
  In this paper we express the trace formula for these Callias-type operators in terms of higher order spectral shift functions, leading to a functional equation which generalizes a known functional equation found first by A. Pushnitski.
  To the knowledge of the author, this paper presents the first multi-dimensional non-Fredholm extension of the Callias index theorem involving higher order spectral shift functions. More precisely, we also show that under a Lebesgue point condition on the higher order spectral shift function associated to the potential, the Callias-type operator admits a regularized index, even in non-Fredholm settings. This corresponds to a known Witten index result in the one-dimensional case shown by A. Carey et al.
  The regularized index that we introduce is a minor extension of the classical Witten index, and we present an index formula, which generalizes the classical Callias index theorem. As an example, we treat the case of $(d+1)$-massless Dirac-Schr\"odinger operators, for which we calculate the associated higher order spectral shift functions.</description>

      <title>Embeddings between generalized weighted Lorentz spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12988v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new characterization of a continuous embedding between two function spaces of type $G\Gamma$. Such spaces are governed by functionals of type \begin{equation*} \|f\|_{G\Gamma(r,q;w,\delta)} := \left(\int_{0}^{L} \left( \frac1{\Delta(t)} \int_0^t f^*(s)^r \delta(s) ds \right)^{\frac{q}{r}} w(t) dt \right)^\frac1{q}, \end{equation*} in which $f^*$ is the nonincreasing rearrangement of $f$, $L\in(0,\infty]$, $r,q \in (0, \infty)$, $w, \delta$ are weights on $(0,L)$ and $\Delta(t)=\int_{0}^{t}\delta(s)\,ds$ for $t\in(0,L)$. To characterize the embedding of such a space, say $G\Gamma(r_1,q_1;w_1,\delta_1)$, into another, $G\Gamma(r_2,q_2;w_2,\delta_2)$, means to find a balance condition on the four positive real parameters and the four weights in order that an appropriate inequality holds for every admissible function. We develop a new discretization technique which will enable us to get rid of restrictions on parameters imposed in earlier work such as the non-degeneracy conditions or certain relations between the $r$'s and $q$'s. Such restrictions were caused mainly by the use of duality techniques, which we avoid in this paper. On the other hand we consider here only the case when $q_1 \le q_2$, leaving the reverse case to future work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spectrality of infinite convolutions generated by infinitely many admissible pairs which may not be compactly supported, where the spectrality means the corresponding square integrable function space admits a family of exponential functions as an orthonormal basis.
  First, we prove that the infinite convolution exists and is a spectral measure if the sequence of admissible pairs satisfies the remainder bounded condition, and it has a subsequence consisting of general consecutive sets. Then we show that the subsequence of general consecutive sets may be replaced by a general assumption, named $\theta$-bounded condition. Finally, we investigate the infinite convolutions generated by special subsequences, and give a sufficient condition for the spectrality of such infinite convolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of a metric measure space $(X,d,\mu)$, we explore the potential-theoretic implications of having a finite-dimensional Besov space. We prove that if the dimension of the Besov space $B^\theta_{p,p}(X)$ is $k&gt;1$, then $X$ can be decomposed into $k$ number of irreducible components (Theorem 1.1). Note that $\theta$ may be bigger than $1$, as our framework includes fractals. We also provide sufficient conditions under which the dimension of the Besov space is $1$. We introduce critical exponents $\theta_p(X)$ and $\theta_p^{\ast}(X)$ for the Besov spaces. As examples illustrating Theorem 1.1, we compute these critical exponents for spaces $X$ formed by glueing copies of $n$-dimensional cubes, the Sierpi\'{n}ski gaskets, and of the Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this paper is to apply an extrapolation result without relying on convexification. We characterize ball Banach function spaces in terms of wavelets, formulated in a way that takes into account the smoothness properties of the spaces under consideration. The same technique can also be applied to prove vector-valued inequalities, for example. Furthermore, the result presented here refines a recent extension operator result by Zhu, Yang, and Yuan.</description>

      <title>The ergodicity of Orlicz sequence spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that non-Hilbertian separable Orlicz sequence spaces are ergodic, i.e., the equivalence relation $\mathbb{E}_0$ Borel reduces to the isomorphism relation between subspaces of every such space. This is done by exhibiting non-Hilbertian asymptotically Hilbertian subspaces in those spaces, and appealing to a result by Anisca. In particular, each non-Hilbertian Orlicz sequence space contains continuum many pairwise non-isomorphic subspaces.
  As a consequence, we prove that the twisted Hilbert spaces $\ell_2(\phi)$ constructed by Kalton and Peck are either Hilbertian, or ergodic. This applies in particular to all twisted Hilbert spaces generated by complex interpolation between Orlicz sequence spaces.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the structure of product systems of Hilbert spaces derived from Banach space-valued L\'evy processes. We establish conditions under which these product systems are completely spatial and show that Gaussian L\'evy processes with non-degenerate covariance always give rise to product systems of type I. Furthermore, we construct a continuum of non-isomorphic product systems of type \(\rm{II}\sb\infty\) from pure jump L\'evy processes.</description>
