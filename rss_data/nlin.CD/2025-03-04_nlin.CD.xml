      <title>On a hyperbolic Duffing oscillator with linear damping and periodic forcing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Duffing oscillator describes the dynamics of a mass suspended on a spring with position-dependent stiffness. The mass is assumed to experience a linear damping and a time-dependent external forcing. The model has been instrumental in theoretical investigations of dynamical properties of systems with parity-conserving symmetry, where a double-well substrate connects two metastable states separated by a barrier. Physical systems of interest include nonlinear feedback-controlled mass-spring-damper oscillators, active hysteresis circuits (e.g. memristors), protein chains prone to hydrogen bond-mediated conformational transitions, centro-symmetric crystals and so on. In this work we consider a Duffing-type oscillator with a double-well potential represented by a hyperbolic function of mass position. The hyperbolic double-well potential has two degenerate minima that can be smoothly tuned by varying a deformability parameter, leaving unchanged the barrier height. We investigate solutions of the equation of motion in the absence and presence of damping and forcing. In the absence of perturbations numerical solutions lead to a periodic train of anharmonic oscillations featuring a crystal of pulse solitons of sech types. However, when the hyperbolic double-well potential is inverted, analytical solutions can be obtained which turn out to be kink-soliton crystals described by Jacobi elliptic functions. When damping and forcing are taken into consideration, the system dynamics can transit from periodic to chaotic phases or vice-versa via period-doubling or period-halving bifurcations, by simply varying the deformability parameter. The Poincar\'e map of the proposed model carries the well-known characteristic signatures of chaos presursors of the standard Duffing model, which happens to be just a particular case of the bistable oscillator model with the hyperbolic double-well potential.</description>

      <title>On the behavior of the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI) method for dissipative systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of the Generalized Alignment Index (GALI) method has been extensively studied and successfully applied for the detection of chaotic motion in conservative Hamiltonian systems, yet its application to non-Hamiltonian dissipative systems remains relatively unexplored. In this work, we fill this gap by investigating the GALI's ability to identify stable fixed points, stable limit cycles, chaotic (strange) and hyperchaotic attractors in dissipative systems generated by both continuous and discrete time dynamics, and compare its performance to the analysis achieved by the computation of the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. Through a comprehensive study of three classical dissipative models, namely the 3D Lorenz system, a modified Lorenz 4D hyperchaotic system, and the 3D generalized hyperchaotic H\'enon map, we examine GALI's behavior, and possible limitations, in detecting chaotic motion, as well as the presence of different types of attractors occurring in dissipative dynamical systems. We find that the GALI successfully detects chaotic motion, as well as stable fixed points, but it faces difficulties in distinctly discriminating between stable limit cycles, chaotic attractors, and hyperchaotic motion.</description>

      <title>Modular-invariant random matrix theory and AdS${}_3$ wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a non-perturbative definition of RMT${}_2$: a generalization of random matrix theory that is compatible with the symmetries of two-dimensional conformal field theory. Given any random matrix ensemble, its $n$-point spectral correlations admit a prescribed modular-invariant lift to RMT${}_2$, which moreover reduce to the original random matrix correlators in a near-extremal limit. Central to the prescription is a presentation of random matrix theory in Mellin space, which lifts to two dimensions via the $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ spectral decomposition employed in previous work. As a demonstration we perform the explicit RMT${}_2$ lift of two-point correlations of the GUE Airy model. We propose that in AdS$_3$ pure gravity, semiclassical amplitudes for off-shell $n$-boundary torus wormholes with topology $\Sigma_{0,n} \times S^1$ are given by the RMT${}_2$ lift of JT gravity wormhole amplitudes. For the three-boundary case, we identify a gravity calculation which matches the RMT${}_2$ result.</description>

      <title>Numerical search for three-body periodic free-fall orbits with central symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A specialized high-precision numerical search for equal-mass collisionless three-body periodic free-fall orbits with central symmetry is conducted. The search is based on Newton's method with initial approximations obtained by the grid-search method. Instead of solving the standard periodicity equation on the entire period a quarter-period equation that also characterizes the periodic orbits is solved. The number of the known orbits from the class is significantly enlarged. The linear stability of the orbits is also investigated. All of them are unstable. A discussion in relation to the efficiency of Newton's method applied with grid-search initial approximations is held.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Motion of a Charged Rigid Body under the Influence of a Gyrostatic Torque</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research investigates the rotational dynamics of a charged axisymmetric spinning rigid body influenced by gyrostatic torque. The study also accounts for the effects of transverse and constant body-fixed torques and an electromagnetic force field. Euler's equations of motion are employed to formulate the governing equations for the system. Given the absence of torque along the spin axis and the nearly symmetric structure of the rigid body, the spin rate remains almost constant. By assuming small angular deviations of the spin axis from a fixed spatial direction, approximate analytical solutions in closed form are derived for the attitude, translational, and rotational motions. These solutions, expressed in a compact complex form, provide an effective tool for analyzing the maneuvers of rigid bodies spinning. The study derives analytical solutions for several variables, including angular velocities, Euler angles, transverse and axial displacements, and velocities. Graphical simulations of the solutions demonstrate their accuracy, while additional graphs illustrate the positive effects of varying body parameters on the motion. This work is significant in diverse scientific and engineering fields, offering insights that enhance the design of mechanical systems, explain celestial dynamics, and improve spacecraft performance.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamic Process of Fluvial Process Based on Theories of Chaos and Dissipative Structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of riverbed evolution is an important basis for decision-making on river improvement, flood control project construction, and water conservancy hub dispatching and application. From the perspective of river nonlinear dynamic system, this paper deeply understands the disorder and order in the evolution and development of river bed. Using the chaos theory, the phase diagram is legally used to identify the chaos of the river time series, and the fractal dimension is quantitatively calculated to calculate the characteristic quantities of chaos. Combined with the theory of dissipative structure, the orderliness in evolution and development is understood, and the internal mechanism of river self-organization is analyzed by the principle of minimum entropy generation. The river information entropy is introduced to identify the local scouring and silting pattern of the river section. The results show that the runoff and sediment transport in the three sections are chaotic, and the information entropy fluctuates with a certain range with time, and develops to a decreasing size, that is, the river section as a whole develops in an orderly direction. However, the chaos and disorder of the Sanmenxia section are the most prominent, which may be affected by the imbalance of sediment transport caused by the construction of the reservoir, and the change of beach trough scouring and silting here is significantly affected, and the situation has been improved with the development of bank protection projects.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric coupling of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons: Fractal attractors, quasimultistability, and final state sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although neuron models have been well studied for their rich dynamics and biological properties, limited research has been done on the complex geometries that emerge from the basins of attraction and basin boundaries of multistable neuron systems. In this paper, we investigate the geometrical properties of the strange attractors, four-dimensional basins, and fractal basin boundaries of an asymmetrically electrically coupled system of two identical nonchaotic Rulkov neurons. We discover a quasimultistability in the system emerging from the existence of a chaotic spiking-bursting pseudo-attractor, and we classify and quantify the system's basins of attraction, which are found to have complex fractal geometries. Using the method of uncertainty exponents, we also find that the system exhibits extreme final state sensitivity, which results in a dynamical uncertainty that could have important applications in neurobiology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2002.10863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a brief account of application of extreme value theory in dynamical systems by using perturbation techniques associated to the transfer operator. We will apply it to the baker's map and we will get a precise formula for the extremal index. We will also show that the statistics of the number of visits in small sets is compound Poisson distributed.</description>

      <title>Feigenbaum universality in subcritical Taylor-Couette flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feigenbaum universality is shown to occur in subcritical shear flows. Our testing ground is the counter-rotation regime of the Taylor-Couette flow, where numerical calculations are performed within a small periodic domain. The accurate computation of up to the seventh period doubling bifurcation, assisted by a purposely defined Poincar\'e section, has enabled us to reproduce the two Feigenbaum universal constants with unprecedented accuracy in a fluid flow problem. We have further devised a method to predict the bifurcation diagram up to the accumulation point of the cascade based on the detailed inspection of just the first few period doubling bifurcations. Remarkably, the method is applicable beyond the accumulation point, with predictions remaining valid, in a statistical sense, for the chaotic dynamics that follows.</description>
