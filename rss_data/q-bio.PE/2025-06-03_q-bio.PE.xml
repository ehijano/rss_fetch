      <title>Why is it easier to predict the epidemic curve than to reconstruct the underlying contact network?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the deterministic Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) epidemic model on weighted graphs. In their numerical study [10] van Mieghem et al. have shown that it is possible to learn an estimated network from a finite time sample of the trajectories of the dynamics that in turn can give an accurate prediction beyond the sample time range, even though the estimated network might be qualitatively far from the ground truth. We give a mathematically rigorous derivation for this phenomenon, notably that for large networks, prediction of the epidemic curves is robust, while reconstructing the underlying network is ill-conditioned. Furthermore, we also provide an explicit formula for the underlying network when reconstruction is possible. At the heart of the explanation, we rely on Szemer\'edi's weak regularity lemma.</description>

      <title>A phylogeny of biological patterns formed by nonlocal advection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From tumour invasion to cell sorting and animal territoriality, many biological systems rely on nonlocal interactions that drive complex spatial organisation. Partial differential equations (PDEs) with nonlocal advection are increasingly recognised as powerful tools for capturing such phenomena. However, most research has focused on one-dimensional domains, leaving their two-dimensional behaviour largely unexplored. Here, we present a detailed numerical study of the patterns formed by these systems on 2D domains. Depending on the underlying mechanisms, a wide variety of spatial patterns can emerge - including segregated clusters, stripes, volcanos, and polygonal mosaics - many of which have been observed in natural systems. By systematically varying model parameters, we classify the links between emergent patterns and their underlying movement mechanisms. In comparing these patterns with empirical observations, we show how this modelling framework can help reveal possible mechanisms of self-organisation in various situations within the life sciences, from ecology and developmental biology to cancer research.</description>

      <title>Not Just $N_e$ $N_e$-more: New Applications for SMC from Ecology to Phylogenies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genomes contain the mutational footprint of an organism's evolutionary history, shaped by diverse forces including ecological factors, selective pressures, and life history traits. The sequentially Markovian coalescent (SMC) is a versatile and tractable model for the genetic genealogy of a sample of genomes, which captures this shared history. Methods that utilize the SMC, such as PSMC and MSMC, have been widely used in evolution and ecology to infer demographic histories. However, these methods ignore common biological features, such as gene flow events and structural variation. Recently, there have been several advancements that widen the applicability of SMC-based methods: inclusion of an isolation with migration model, integration with the multi-species coalescent, incorporation of ecological variables (such as selfing and dormancy), inference of dispersal rates, and many computational advances in applying these models to data. We give an overview of the SMC model and its various recent extensions, discuss examples of biological discoveries through SMC-based inference, and comment on the assumptions, benefits and drawbacks of various methods.</description>

      <title>Estimating Unobservable States in Stochastic Epidemic Models with Partial Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates stochastic epidemic models with partial information and addresses the estimation of current values of not directly observable states. The latter is also called nowcasting and related to the so-called "dark figure" problem, which concerns, for example, the estimation of unknown numbers of asymptomatic and undetected infections. The study is based on Ouabo Kamkumo et al. (2025), which provides detailed information about stochastic multi-compartment epidemic models with partial information and various examples. Starting point is a description of the state dynamics by a system of nonlinear stochastic recursions resulting from a time-discretization of a diffusion approximation of the underlying counting processes. The state vector is decomposed into an observable and an unobservable component. The latter is estimated from the observations using the extended Kalman filter approach in order to take into account the nonlinearity of the state dynamics. Numerical simulations for a Covid-19 model with partial information are presented to verify the performance and accuracy of the estimation method.</description>

      <title>Inheritance of intracellular viral RNA in a multiscale model of hepatitis C infection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiscale mathematical models of hepatitis C infection have been instrumental in our understanding of direct acting antivirals. These models include the mechanisms driving intracellular viral production and explicitly model the intracellular concentration of viral RNA. Incorporating proliferation of infected hepatocytes in these models can be subtle, as infected daughter cells inherit viral RNA from the proliferating mother cell. In this note, we show how to incorporate this inheritance within a multiscale model of HCV infection. As in typical multiscale models of HCV infection, we show that this model is mathematically equivalent to a system of ordinary differential equations and perform bifurcation analysis of the resulting ODE that demonstrates that proliferation of infected hepatocytes can lead to infection persistence even if the basic repoductive number is less than one.</description>

      <title>First explore, then settle: a theoretical analysis of evolvability as a driver of adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Evolvability is defined as the ability of a population to generate heritable variation to facilitate its adaptation to new environments or selection pressures. In this article, we consider evolvability as a phenotypic trait subject to evolution and discuss its implications in the adaptation of populations of asexual individuals. We explore the evolutionary dynamics of an actively proliferating population of individuals, subject to changes in their proliferative potential and their evolvability, through mathematical simulations of a stochastic individual-based model and its deterministic continuum counterpart. We find robust adaptive trajectories that rely on individuals with high evolvability rapidly exploring the phenotypic landscape and reaching the proliferative potential with the highest fitness. The strength of selection on the proliferative potential, and the cost associated with evolvability, can alter these trajectories such that, if both are sufficiently constraining, highly evolvable populations can become extinct in our individual-based model simulations. We explore the impact of this interaction at various scales, discussing its effects in undisturbed environments and also in disrupted contexts, such as cancer.</description>

      <title>A stochastic explanation for observed local-to-global foraging states in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15174v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Abrupt changes in behavior can often be associated with changes in underlying behavioral states. When placed off food, the foraging behavior of C. elegans can be described as a change between an initial local-search behavior characterized by a high rate of reorientations, followed by a global-search behavior characterized by sparse reorientations. This is commonly observed in individual worms, but when numerous worms are characterized, only about half appear to exhibit this behavior. We propose an alternative model that predicts both abrupt and continuous changes to reorientation that does not rely on behavioral states. This model is inspired by molecular dynamics modeling that defines the foraging reorientation rate as a decaying parameter. By stochastically sampling from the probability distribution defined by this rate, both abrupt and gradual changes to reorientation rates can occur, matching experimentally observed results. Crucially, this model does not depend on behavioral states or information accumulation. Even though abrupt behavioral changes do occur, they may not necessarily be indicative of abrupt changes in behavioral states, especially when abrupt changes are not universally observed in the population.</description>

      <title>Bang-Bang Optimal Control of Vaccination in Metapopulation Epidemics with Linear Cost Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15154v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates optimal vaccination strategies in a metapopulation epidemic model. We consider a linear cost to better capture operational considerations, such as the total number of vaccines or hospitalizations, in contrast to the standard quadratic cost assumption on the control. The model incorporates state and mixed control-state constraints, and we derive necessary optimality conditions based on Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. We use Pontryagin's result to rule out the possibility of the occurrence of singular arcs and to provide a full characterization of the optimal control.</description>
