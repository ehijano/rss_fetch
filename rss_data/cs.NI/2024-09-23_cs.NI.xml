      <title>Integrating Deterministic Networking with 5G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rising prevalence of real-time applications that require deterministic communication over mobile networks necessitates the joint operation of both mobile and fixed network components. This joint operation requires designing components that interact between the two technologies to provide users with latency and packet loss guarantees. In this work, we demonstrate a fully integrated 5G-DetNet that can guarantee the end-to-end demands of different flows. Moreover, we show how such a network can be implemented using low-cost hardware and open-source software, making it accessible to many 5G testbeds. The features demonstrated in this work are a network manager that does the routing and scheduling, an application function in the 5G core that interfaces with the network manager, and a network-side translator for user-plane management and de-jittering of the real-time streams.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Assisted Joint Virtual Network Function Deployment and Maximum Flow Routing for Space Information Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network function virtualization (NFV)-enabled space information network (SIN) has emerged as a promising method to facilitate global coverage and seamless service. This paper proposes a novel NFV-enabled SIN to provide end-to-end communication and computation services for ground users. Based on the multi-functional time expanded graph (MF-TEG), we jointly optimize the user association, virtual network function (VNF) deployment, and flow routing strategy (U-VNF-R) to maximize the total processed data received by users. The original problem is a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that is intractable for classical computers. Inspired by quantum computing techniques, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical Benders' decomposition (HQCBD) algorithm. Specifically, we convert the master problem of the Benders' decomposition into the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model and solve it with quantum computers. To further accelerate the optimization, we also design a multi-cut strategy based on the quantum advantages in parallel computing. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm and U-VNF-R scheme.</description>

      <title>A Centrality Approach to Select Offloading Data Aggregation Points in Vehicular Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a centrality-based approach to identify data offloading points in a VSN. The solution presents a scheme to select vehicles used as aggregation points to collect and aggregate other vehicles' data before uploading it to processing stations. We evaluate the proposed solution in a realis tic simulation scenario derived from data traffic containing more than 700,000 individual car trips for 24 hours. We compare our approach with both a reservation-based algorithm and the optimal solution. Our results indicate an upload cost reduction of 30.92\% using the centrality-based algorithm and improving the aggregation rate by up to 10.45% when considering the centralized scenario.</description>

      <title>Efficient Entanglement Routing for Satellite-Aerial-Terrestrial Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the era of 6G and beyond, space-aerial-terrestrial quantum networks (SATQNs) are shaping the future of the global-scale quantum Internet. This paper investigates the collaboration among satellite, aerial, and terrestrial quantum networks to efficiently transmit high-fidelity quantum entanglements over long distances. We begin with a comprehensive overview of existing satellite-, aerial-, and terrestrial-based quantum networks. Subsequently, we address the entanglement routing problem with the objective of maximizing quantum network throughput by jointly optimizing path selection and entanglement generation rates (PS-EGR). Given that the original problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which is inherently intractable, we propose a Benders' decomposition (BD)-based algorithm to solve the problem efficiently. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed PS-EGR scheme, offering valuable insights into various optimizable factors within the system. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and propose promising avenues for future research in SATQNs.</description>

      <title>Quantum Game Theory meets Quantum Networks</title>

Abstract: Classical game theory is a powerful tool focusing on optimized resource distribution, allocation and sharing in classical wired and wireless networks. As quantum networks are emerging as a means of providing true connectivity between quantum computers, it is imperative and crucial to exploit game theory for addressing challenges like entanglement distribution and access, routing, topology extraction and inference for quantum networks. Quantum networks provide the promising opportunity of employing quantum games owing to their inherent capability of generating and sharing quantum states. Besides, quantum games offer enhanced payoffs and winning probabilities, new strategies and equilibria, which are unimaginable in classical games. Employing quantum game theory to solve fundamental challenges in quantum networks opens a new fundamental research direction necessitating inter-disciplinary efforts. In this article, we introduce a novel game-theoretical framework for exploiting quantum strategies to solve, as archetypal example, one of the key functionality of a quantum network, namely, the entanglement distribution. We compare the quantum strategies with classical ones by showing the quantum advantages in terms of link fidelity improvement and latency decrease in communication. In future, we will generalize our game framework to optimize entanglement distribution and access over any quantum network topology. We will also explore how quantum games can be leveraged to address other challenges like routing, optimization of quantum operations and topology design.</description>

      <title>Application-Defined Receive Side Dispatching on the NIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.04857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Application layer (L7) processing is increasingly implemented in proxies (e.g., Envoy) to simplify administration and management. However, prior work has observed that this reduces application performance and increases resource requirements. The reason is that moving logic out of the application required duplicating some computation and additional inter-process communication. This paper describes QingNiao, a system that moves L7 dispatch (a function implemented by all L7 proxies and affects all messages received by an application) to a NIC that is on the application's communication path. Unfortunately, the data formats and protocols used by modern applications pose a challenge when moving L7 dispatch to NICs. Consequently, when designing QingNiao we had to rethink not just the NIC hardware, but also how applications encode data sent over the network. We prototyped QingNiao using a 100GbE FPGA NIC, and show that for real-world applications QingNiao can achieve 6.6x to 7.15x higher throughput compared to software proxies.</description>

      <title>FASTFLOW: Flexible Adaptive Congestion Control for High-Performance Datacenters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01630v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing demand of machine learning (ML) workloads in datacenters places significant stress on current congestion control (CC) algorithms, many of which struggle to maintain performance at scale. These workloads generate bursty, synchronized traffic that requires both rapid response and fairness across flows. Unfortunately, existing CC algorithms that rely heavily on delay as a primary congestion signal often fail to react quickly enough and do not consistently ensure fairness. In this paper, we propose FASTFLOW, a streamlined sender-based CC algorithm that integrates delay, ECN signals, and optional packet trimming to achieve precise, real-time adjustments to congestion windows. Central to FASTFLOW is the QuickAdapt mechanism, which provides accurate bandwidth estimation at the receiver, enabling faster reactions to network conditions. We also show that FASTFLOW can effectively enhance receiver-based algorithms such as EQDS by improving their ability to manage in-network congestion. Our evaluation reveals that FASTFLOW outperforms cutting-edge solutions, including EQDS, Swift, BBR, and MPRDMA, delivering up to 50% performance improvements in modern datacenter networks.</description>

      <title>ARCANE: Adaptive Routing with Caching and Network Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most datacenter transport protocols traditionally depend on in-order packet delivery, a legacy design choice that prioritizes simplicity. However, technological advancements, such as RDMA, now enable the relaxation of this requirement, allowing for more efficient utilization of modern datacenter topologies like FatTree and Dragonfly. With the growing prevalence of AI/ML workloads, the demand for improved link utilization has intensified, creating challenges for single-path load balancers due to problems like ECMP collisions. In this paper, we present ARCANE, a novel, adaptive per-packet traffic load-balancing algorithm designed to work seamlessly with existing congestion control mechanisms. ARCANE dynamically routes packets to bypass congested areas and network failures, all while maintaining a lightweight footprint with minimal state requirements. Our evaluation shows that ARCANE delivers significant performance gains over traditional load-balancing methods, including packet spraying and other advanced solutions, substantially enhancing both performance and link utilization in modern datacenter networks.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Credential Status Management: A Paradigm Shift in Digital Trust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Public key infrastructures are essential for Internet security, ensuring robust certificate management and revocation mechanisms. The transition from centralized to decentralized systems presents challenges such as trust distribution and privacy-preserving credential management. The transition from centralized to decentralized systems is motivated by addressing the single points of failure inherent in centralized systems and leveraging decentralized technologies' transparency and resilience. This paper explores the evolution of certificate status management from centralized to decentralized frameworks, focusing on blockchain technology and advanced cryptography. We provide a taxonomy of the challenges of centralized systems and discuss opportunities provided by existing decentralized technologies. Our findings reveal that, although blockchain technologies enhance security and trust distribution, they represent a bottleneck for parallel computation and face inefficiencies in cryptographic computations. For this reason, we propose a framework of decentralized technology components that addresses such shortcomings to advance the paradigm shift toward decentralized credential status management.</description>

Abstract: Trust in applications is crucial, especially for fast and efficient hiring processes. Applicants must present credentials that employers can trust without delays or risk of fraudulent information. This paper introduces a framework for managing digital resum\'e credentials using Decentralized Identifiers and Verifiable Credentials. We propose a framework for the issuance and verification of Verifiable Credentials in real time without intermediaries. We showcase the integration of the European Blockchain Service Infrastructure as a trust anchor. Furthermore, we demonstrate a streamlined application process, reducing verification times and fostering a reliable credentialing ecosystem across various sectors, including recruitment and professional certification.</description>
