      <title>On the structure of envy-free orientations on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fair division is the problem of allocating a set of items among agents in a fair manner. One of the most sought-after fairness notions is envy-freeness (EF), requiring that no agent envies another's allocation. When items are indivisible, it ceases to exist, and envy-freeness up to any good (EFX) emerged as one of its strongest relaxations. The existence of EFX allocations is arguably the biggest open question within fair division. Recently, Christodoulou, Fiat, Koutsoupias, and Sgouritsa (EC 2023) introduced showed that EFX allocations exist for the case of graphical valuations where an instance is represented by a graph: nodes are agents, edges are goods, and each agent values only her incident edges. On the other hand, they showed NP-hardness for checking the existence of EFX orientation where every edge is allocated to one of its incident vertices, and asked for a characterization of graphs that exhibit EFX orientation regardless of the assigned valuations. In this paper, we make significant progress toward answering their question. We introduce the notion of strongly EFX orientable graphs -- graphs that have EFX orientations regardless of how much agents value the edges. We show a surprising connection between this property and the chromatic number of the graph, namely $\chi(G)$ for graph $G$. In particular, we show that graphs with $\chi(G)\le 2$ are strongly EFX orientable, and those with $\chi(G)&gt;3$ are not strongly EFX orientable. We provide examples of strongly EFX orientable and non-strongly EFX orientable graphs of $\chi(G)=3$ to prove tightness. Finally, we give a complete characterization of strong EFX orientability when restricted to binary valuations.</description>

      <title>Facility Location Problems with Capacity Constraints: Two Facilities and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Mechanism Design aspects of the $m$-Capacitated Facility Location Problem ($m$-CFLP) on a line. We focus on two frameworks. In the first framework, the number of facilities is arbitrary, all facilities have the same capacity, and the number of agents is equal to the total capacity of all facilities. In the second framework, we aim to place two facilities, each with a capacity of at least half of the total agents. For both of these frameworks, we propose truthful mechanisms with bounded approximation ratios with respect to the Social Cost (SC) and the Maximum Cost (MC). When $m&gt;2$, the result sharply contrasts with the impossibility results known for the classic $m$-Facility Location Problem \cite{fotakis2014power}, where capacity constraints are not considered. Furthermore, all our mechanisms are (i) optimal with respect to the MC (ii) optimal or nearly optimal with respect to the SC among anonymous mechanisms. For both frameworks, we provide a lower bound on the approximation ratio that any truthful and deterministic mechanism can achieve with respect to the SC and MC.</description>

      <title>Faster Game Solving by Fixpoint Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method for solving parity games with acyclic (DAG) sub-structures by computing nested fixpoints of a DAG attractor function that lives over the non-DAG parts of the game, thereby restricting the domain of the involved fixpoint operators. Intuitively, this corresponds to accelerating fixpoint computation by inlining cycle-free parts during the solution of parity games, leading to earlier convergence. We also present an economic later-appearence-record construction that takes Emerson-Lei games to parity games, and show that it preserves DAG sub-structures; it follows that the proposed method can be used also for the accelerated solution of Emerson-Lei games.</description>

      <title>Individual Rationality in Topological Distance Games is Surprisingly Hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the recently introduced topological distance games, strategic agents need to be assigned to a subset of vertices of a topology. In the assignment, the utility of an agent depends on both the agent's inherent utilities for other agents and its distance from them on the topology. We study the computational complexity of finding individually rational outcomes; this notion is widely assumed to be the very minimal stability requirement and requires that the utility of every agent in a solution is non-negative. We perform a comprehensive study of the problem's complexity, and we prove that even in very basic cases, deciding whether an individually rational solution exists is intractable. To reach at least some tractability, one needs to combine multiple restrictions of the input instance, including the number of agents and the topology and the influence of distant agents on the utility.</description>

      <title>Metric Distortion under Group-Fair Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a voting problem in which a set of agents have metric preferences over a set of alternatives, and are also partitioned into disjoint groups. Given information about the preferences of the agents and their groups, our goal is to decide an alternative to approximately minimize an objective function that takes the groups of agents into account. We consider two natural group-fair objectives known as Max-of-Avg and Avg-of-Max which are different combinations of the max and the average cost in and out of the groups. We show tight bounds on the best possible distortion that can be achieved by various classes of mechanisms depending on the amount of information they have access to. In particular, we consider group-oblivious full-information mechanisms that do not know the groups but have access to the exact distances between agents and alternatives in the metric space, group-oblivious ordinal-information mechanisms that again do not know the groups but are given the ordinal preferences of the agents, and group-aware mechanisms that have full knowledge of the structure of the agent groups and also ordinal information about the metric space.</description>

      <title>Learning In Reverse Causal Strategic Environments With Ramifications on Two Sided Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by equilibrium models of labor markets, we develop a formulation of causal strategic classification in which strategic agents can directly manipulate their outcomes. As an application, we compare employers that anticipate the strategic response of a labor force with employers that do not. We show through a combination of theory and experiment that employers with performatively optimal hiring policies improve employer reward, labor force skill level, and in some cases labor force equity. On the other hand, we demonstrate that performative employers harm labor force utility and fail to prevent discrimination in other cases.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Agents for Auction-based Federated Learning: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Auction-based federated learning (AFL) is an important emerging category of FL incentive mechanism design, due to its ability to fairly and efficiently motivate high-quality data owners to join data consumers' (i.e., servers') FL training tasks. To enhance the efficiency in AFL decision support for stakeholders (i.e., data consumers, data owners, and the auctioneer), intelligent agent-based techniques have emerged. However, due to the highly interdisciplinary nature of this field and the lack of a comprehensive survey providing an accessible perspective, it is a challenge for researchers to enter and contribute to this field. This paper bridges this important gap by providing a first-of-its-kind survey on the Intelligent Agents for AFL (IA-AFL) literature. We propose a unique multi-tiered taxonomy that organises existing IA-AFL works according to 1) the stakeholders served, 2) the auction mechanism adopted, and 3) the goals of the agents, to provide readers with a multi-perspective view into this field. In addition, we analyse the limitations of existing approaches, summarise the commonly adopted performance evaluation metrics, and discuss promising future directions leading towards effective and efficient stakeholder-oriented decision support in IA-AFL ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Minimizing Weighted Counterfactual Regret with Optimistic Online Mirror Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) is a family of algorithms for effectively solving imperfect-information games. It decomposes the total regret into counterfactual regrets, utilizing local regret minimization algorithms, such as Regret Matching (RM) or RM+, to minimize them. Recent research establishes a connection between Online Mirror Descent (OMD) and RM+, paving the way for an optimistic variant PRM+ and its extension PCFR+. However, PCFR+ assigns uniform weights for each iteration when determining regrets, leading to substantial regrets when facing dominated actions. This work explores minimizing weighted counterfactual regret with optimistic OMD, resulting in a novel CFR variant PDCFR+. It integrates PCFR+ and Discounted CFR (DCFR) in a principled manner, swiftly mitigating negative effects of dominated actions and consistently leveraging predictions to accelerate convergence. Theoretical analyses prove that PDCFR+ converges to a Nash equilibrium, particularly under distinct weighting schemes for regrets and average strategies. Experimental results demonstrate PDCFR+'s fast convergence in common imperfect-information games. The code is available at https://github.com/rpSebastian/PDCFRPlus.</description>

      <title>Competition and Collaboration in Crowdsourcing Communities: What happens when peers evaluate each other?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crowdsourcing has evolved as an organizational approach to distributed problem solving and innovation. As contests are embedded in online communities and evaluation rights are assigned to the crowd, community members face a tension: they find themselves exposed to both competitive motives to win the contest prize and collaborative participation motives in the community. The competitive motive suggests they may evaluate rivals strategically according to their self-interest, the collaborative motive suggests they may evaluate their peers truthfully according to mutual interest. Using field data from Threadless on 38 million peer evaluations of more than 150,000 submissions across 75,000 individuals over 10 years and two natural experiments to rule out alternative explanations, we answer the question of how community members resolve this tension. We show that as their skill level increases, they become increasingly competitive and shift from using self-promotion to sabotaging their closest competitors. However, we also find signs of collaborative behavior when high-skilled members show leniency toward those community members who do not directly threaten their chance of winning. We explain how the individual-level use of strategic evaluations translates into important organizational-level outcomes by affecting the community structure through individuals' long-term participation. While low-skill targets of sabotage are less likely to participate in future contests, high-skill targets are more likely. This suggests a feedback loop between competitive evaluation behavior and future participation. These findings have important implications for the literature on crowdsourcing design, and the evolution and sustainability of crowdsourcing communities.</description>

      <title>Maximizing Miner Revenue in Transaction Fee Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12895v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transaction fee mechanism design is a new decentralized mechanism design problem where users bid for space on the blockchain. Several recent works showed that the transaction fee mechanism design fundamentally departs from classical mechanism design. They then systematically explored the mathematical landscape of this new decentralized mechanism design problem in two settings: in the plain setting where no cryptography is employed, and in a cryptography-assisted setting where the rules of the mechanism are enforced by a multi-party computation protocol. Unfortunately, in both settings, prior works showed that if we want the mechanism to incentivize honest behavior for both users as well as miners (possibly colluding with users), then the miner revenue has to be zero. Although adopting a relaxed, approximate notion of incentive compatibility gets around this zero miner-revenue limitation, the scaling of the miner revenue is nonetheless poor.
  In this paper, we show that if we make a mildly stronger reasonable-world assumption than prior works, we can circumvent the known limitations on miner revenue, and design auctions that generate optimal miner revenue. We also systematically explore the mathematical landscape of transaction fee mechanism design under the new reasonable-world and demonstrate how such assumptions can alter the feasibility and infeasibility landscape.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Calibrated Click-Through Auction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study information design in click-through auctions, in which the bidders/advertisers bid for winning an opportunity to show their ads but only pay for realized clicks. The payment may or may not happen, and its probability is called the click-through rate (CTR). This auction format is widely used in the industry of online advertising. Bidders have private values, whereas the seller has private information about each bidder's CTRs. We are interested in the seller's problem of partially revealing CTR information to maximize revenue. Information design in click-through auctions turns out to be intriguingly different from almost all previous studies in this space since any revealed information about CTRs will never affect bidders' bidding behaviors -- they will always bid their true value per click -- but only affect the auction's allocation and payment rule. In some sense, this makes information design effectively a constrained mechanism design problem.
  Our first result is an FPTAS to compute an approximately optimal mechanism under a constant number of bidders. The design of this algorithm leverages Bayesian bidder values which help to ``smooth'' the seller's revenue function and lead to better tractability. The design of this FPTAS is complex and primarily algorithmic. Our second main result pursues the design of ``simple'' mechanisms that are approximately optimal yet more practical. We primarily focus on the two-bidder situation, which is already notoriously challenging as demonstrated in recent works. When bidders' CTR distribution is symmetric, we develop a simple prior-free signaling scheme, whose construction relies on a parameter termed optimal signal ratio. The constructed scheme provably obtains a good approximation as long as the maximum and minimum of bidders' value density functions do not differ much.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Design for Automated Market Makers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Blockchains have popularized automated market makers (AMMs). An AMM exchange is an application running on a blockchain which maintains a pool of crypto-assets and automatically trades assets with users governed by some pricing function that prices the assets based on their relative demand/supply. AMMs have created an important challenge commonly known as the Miner Extractable Value (MEV). In particular, the miners who control the contents and ordering of transactions in a block can extract value by front-running and back-running users' transactions, leading to arbitrage opportunities that guarantee them risk-free returns.
  In this paper, we consider how to design AMM mechanisms that eliminate MEV opportunities. Specifically, we propose a new AMM mechanism that processes all transactions contained within a block in a batch. We show that our new mechanism satisfies two tiers of guarantees. First, for legacy blockchains where each block is proposed by a single (possibly rotating) miner, we prove that our mechanism satisfies arbitrage resilience, i.e., a miner cannot gain risk-free profit. Moreover, we also guarantee fair treatment among all transactions within the same block, such that the miner is unable to sell off favorable positions in the block to users or arbitragers. Second, for blockchains where the block proposal process is decentralized and offers sequencing-fairness, we prove a stronger notion called incentive compatibility -- roughly speaking, we guarantee that any individual user's best response is to follow the honest strategy.</description>

      <title>Intrusion Tolerance for Networked Systems through Two-Level Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate intrusion tolerance for a system with service replicas as a two-level optimal control problem. On the local level node controllers perform intrusion recovery, and on the global level a system controller manages the replication factor. The local and global control problems can be formulated as classical problems in operations research, namely, the machine replacement problem and the inventory replenishment problem. Based on this formulation, we design TOLERANCE, a novel control architecture for intrusion-tolerant systems. We prove that the optimal control strategies on both levels have threshold structure and design efficient algorithms for computing them. We implement and evaluate TOLERANCE in an emulation environment where we run 10 types of network intrusions. The results show that TOLERANCE can improve service availability and reduce operational cost compared with state-of-the-art intrusion-tolerant systems.</description>
