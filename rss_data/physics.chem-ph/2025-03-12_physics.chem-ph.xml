      <title>Does Hessian Data Improve the Performance of Machine Learning Potentials?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating machine learning into reactive chemistry, materials discovery, and drug design is revolutionizing the development of novel molecules and materials. Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) accurately predict energies and forces at quantum chemistry levels, surpassing traditional methods. Incorporating force fitting into MLIP training significantly improves the representation of potential-energy surfaces (PES), enhancing model transferability and reliability. This study introduces and evaluates incorporating Hessian matrix training into MLIPs, capturing second-order curvature information of PES. Our analysis specifically examines MLIPs trained solely on stable molecular geometries, assessing their extrapolation capabilities to non-equilibrium configurations. We show that integrating Hessian information substantially improves MLIP performance in predicting energies, forces, and Hessians for non-equilibrium structures. Hessian-trained MLIPs notably enhance reaction pathway modeling, transition state identification, and vibrational spectra accuracy, benefiting molecular dynamics simulations and Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) calculations. By comparing models trained with various combinations of energy, force, and Hessian data on a small-molecule reactive dataset, we demonstrate Hessian inclusion leads to improved accuracy in reaction modeling and vibrational analyses while simultaneously reducing the total data needed for effective training. The primary trade-off is increased computational expense, as Hessian training demands more resources than conventional methods. Our results offer comprehensive insights into the strengths and limitations of Hessian integration in MLIP training, enabling practitioners in computational chemistry to make informed decisions aligned with their research goals and available computational resources.</description>

      <title>Construction of Chemistry Inspired Dynamic Ansatz Utilizing Generative Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative machine learning models like the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) provide a practical approach for ansatz construction within the quantum computing framework. This work introduces a method that efficiently leverages RBM and many-body perturbative measures to build a compact chemistry-inspired ansatz for determining accurate molecular energetics. By training on low-rank determinants derived from an approximate wavefunction, RBM predicts the key high-rank determinants that dominate the ground-state wavefunction. A shallow depth ansatz is constructed to explicitly incorporate these dominant determinants after dynamically decomposing them into low-rank components and applying many-body perturbative measures for further screening. The method requires no additional measurements beyond the initial training phase. Moreover, it incorporates Bayesian hyperparameter optimization for the RBM, ensuring efficient performance with minimal training data during its limited usage. This approach facilitates the efficient computation of molecular properties, paving the way for exploring new chemical phenomena with near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <title>A symmetry-preserving and transferable representation for learning the Kohn-Sham density matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kohn-Sham (KS) density matrix is one of the most essential properties in KS density functional theory (DFT), from which many other physical properties of interest can be derived. In this work, we present a parameterized representation for learning the mapping from a molecular configuration to its corresponding density matrix using the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) framework, which preserves the physical symmetries of the mapping, including isometric equivariance and Grassmannianity. Trained on several typical molecules, the proposed representation is shown to be systematically improvable with the increase of the model parameters and is transferable to molecules that are not part of and even more complex than those in the training set. The models generated by the proposed approach are illustrated as being able to generate reasonable predictions of the density matrix to either accelerate the DFT calculations or to provide approximations to some properties of the molecules.</description>

      <title>Fully numerical Hartree-Fock Calculations with Quantized Tensor Trains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully numerical framework for the optimization of molecule-specific quantum chemical basis functions within the quantics tensor train format using a finite-difference scheme. The optimization is driven by solving the Hartree-Fock equations (HF) with the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm on Cartesian grids that are iteratively refined. In contrast to the standard way of tackling the mean-field problem by expressing the molecular orbitals as linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO) our method only requires as much basis functions as there are electrons within the system. Benchmark calculations for atoms and molecules with up to ten electrons show excellent agreement with LCAO calculations with large basis sets supporting the validity of the tensor network approach. Our work therefore offers a promising alternative to well-established HF-solvers and could pave the way to define highly accurate, fully numerical, molecule-adaptive basis sets, which, in the future, could lead to benefits for post-HF calculations.</description>

      <title>Production of Spin-Polarized Molecular Beams via Microwave or Infrared Rotational Excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how small molecules in an intense and cold molecular beam can be highly nuclear-spin polarized via microwave or infrared rotational excitation schemes, followed by hyperfine-induced quantum beats. Repumping schemes can be used to achieve polarization above $90\%$ in cases where single-pumping schemes are insufficient. Projected production rates in excess of $10^{21}$ ${\text{s}^{-1}}$ allow applications including nuclear-magnetic-resonance signal enhancement, and spin-polarized nuclear fusion, where polarized nuclei are known to enhance D-T and D-$^3$He fusion cross sections by $50\%$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a combination of first principles molecular dynamics simulations (FPMD) and electronic structure calculations, we characterize the atomistic structure and vibrational properties of a photocatalytic surface of In$_2$O$_3$, a promising photoelectrode for the production of hydrogen peroxide. We then investigate the surface in contact with water and show that the electronic states of In$_2$O$_3$ are appropriately positioned in energy to facilitate the two-electron water oxidation reaction (WOR) over the competing four-electron oxygen evolution reaction. We further propose that the use of strained thin films interfaced with water is beneficial in decreasing the optical gap of In$_2$O$_3$ and thus utilizing a wider portion of the solar spectrum for the WOR.</description>

      <title>Sergeants and Soldiers in Chiral Nematic Liquid Crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the mechanisms behind the helical structures in cholesteric liquid crystalline (CLC) phases using molecular dynamics simulations. By adding chiral agents to the nematic liquid crystalline (NLC) compound, 5CB, the research examines how the shape and motion chirality of the agents influence the overall twisting behavior. The results show that chiral agents induce shape chirality in the 5CB molecules, but dynamic chirality is not detectable at this stage. The study suggests that equilibrium is required for motion chirality to become evident, highlighting the need for further investigation.</description>

      <title>Constraints on new vector boson mediated electron-nucleus interactions from spectroscopy of polar diatomic molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A measurement of parity violation in the hyperfine structure of $^{138}$Ba$^{19}$F [E. Altunta\c{s} et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 120, 142501 (2018)] is reinterpreted with density functional theory calculations in terms of beyond Standard Model vector boson mediated electron-nucleus interactions. Our results set constraints on previously unexplored, new boson mediated axial vector-vector nucleus-electron interactions. Similar bounds are obtained by analyzing the atomic parity violation experiment with $^{133}$Cs. Moreover, we show that future experiments with cold heavy diatomic molecules like $^{225}$RaF will improve on the present sensitivity to axial vector-vector nucleon-nucleus interactions by at least four orders of magnitudes assuming current experimental resolution.</description>

      <title>ELECTRA: A Symmetry-breaking Cartesian Network for Charge Density Prediction with Floating Orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Electronic Tensor Reconstruction Algorithm (ELECTRA) - an equivariant model for predicting electronic charge densities using "floating" orbitals. Floating orbitals are a long-standing idea in the quantum chemistry community that promises more compact and accurate representations by placing orbitals freely in space, as opposed to centering all orbitals at the position of atoms. Finding ideal placements of these orbitals requires extensive domain knowledge though, which thus far has prevented widespread adoption. We solve this in a data-driven manner by training a Cartesian tensor network to predict orbital positions along with orbital coefficients. This is made possible through a symmetry-breaking mechanism that is used to learn position displacements with lower symmetry than the input molecule while preserving the rotation equivariance of the charge density itself. Inspired by recent successes of Gaussian Splatting in representing densities in space, we are using Gaussians as our orbitals and predict their weights and covariance matrices. Our method achieves a state-of-the-art balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy on established benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Influence of Crystal Structure and Composition on Optical and Electronic Properties of Pyridinium-based Bismuth Iodide Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the impacts of structure and composition on the optical and electronic properties of a series of pyridinium-based bismuth iodide complexes. Organic substrates with various functional groups, such as 4-aminopyridine (4-Ampy), 4-methylpyridine (4-Mepy), 4-dimethyaminopyridine (4-Dmapy), and 4-pyridinecarbonitrile (4-CNpy) with different electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups at the para position of the pyridine ring were employed. Crystallographic analysis reveals various bismuth iodide structures, including 1D chains and discrete 0D motifs. The optical band gap of these materials, identified via Diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS) and verified with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, is influenced by the crystal packing and stabilising interactions. Through a comprehensive analysis, including Hirshfeld surface (HS) and void assessment, the study underscores the influence of noncovalent intermolecular interactions on crystal packing. Spectroscopic evaluations provide insights into electronic interactions, elucidating the role of electron donor and acceptor substituents within the lattice. Thermogravimetric differential thermal analysis (TG-DTA) indicates structural stability up to 250{\deg}C. Linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) reveals significant conductivity in the range of 10-20 mS/pixel at 298.15 K. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Bi L3 edge indicates a similar oxidation state and electronic environment across all samples, underscoring the role of bismuth centres surrounded by iodides.</description>

      <title>Understanding and Mitigating Distribution Shifts For Machine Learning Force Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) are a promising alternative to expensive ab initio quantum mechanical molecular simulations. Given the diversity of chemical spaces that are of interest and the cost of generating new data, it is important to understand how MLFFs generalize beyond their training distributions. In order to characterize and better understand distribution shifts in MLFFs, we conduct diagnostic experiments on chemical datasets, revealing common shifts that pose significant challenges, even for large foundation models trained on extensive data. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that current supervised training methods inadequately regularize MLFFs, resulting in overfitting and learning poor representations of out-of-distribution systems. We then propose two new methods as initial steps for mitigating distribution shifts for MLFFs. Our methods focus on test-time refinement strategies that incur minimal computational cost and do not use expensive ab initio reference labels. The first strategy, based on spectral graph theory, modifies the edges of test graphs to align with graph structures seen during training. Our second strategy improves representations for out-of-distribution systems at test-time by taking gradient steps using an auxiliary objective, such as a cheap physical prior. Our test-time refinement strategies significantly reduce errors on out-of-distribution systems, suggesting that MLFFs are capable of and can move towards modeling diverse chemical spaces, but are not being effectively trained to do so. Our experiments establish clear benchmarks for evaluating the generalization capabilities of the next generation of MLFFs. Our code is available at https://tkreiman.github.io/projects/mlff_distribution_shifts/.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Basis Set Amelioration Method for Incremental Full Configuration Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incremental full configuration interaction (iFCI) is polynomial-cost approach to the FCI limit of electronic structure. This article introduces the many-body basis set amelioration (MBBSA) method, which is designed to allow iFCI to be applicable to larger atomic orbital basis sets. MBBSA uses a series of inexpensive iFCI calculations to approximate the correlation energy that would be found using a more expensive, highly accurate iFCI calculation. When compared to standard iFCI computations on smaller molecules in triple-zeta and larger basis sets, MBBSA provides approximations to total and relative energies within chemical accuracy. MBBSA yields cost savings of between 60 and 92% when compared to standard iFCI calculations, with larger systems having increased savings. Tests of MBBSA on two reactions that involve highly correlated systems, the automerization of cyclobutadiene and a Criegee intermediate reaction, show that MBBSA has practical utility for studying realistic chemistries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06046v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a molecular quantum rotor in a two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate. The focus is on studying the angulon quasiparticle concept in the crossover from few- to many-body physics. To this end, we formulate the problem in real space and solve it with a mean-field approach in the frame co-rotating with the impurity. We show that the system starts to feature angulon characteristics when the size of the bosonic cloud is large enough to screen the rotor. More importantly, we demonstrate the departure from the angulon picture for large system sizes or large angular momenta where the properties of the system are determined by collective excitations of the Bose gas.</description>

      <title>A Transformer Model for Predicting Chemical Reaction Products from Generic Templates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of chemical reaction outcomes is a major challenge in computational chemistry. Current models rely heavily on either highly specific reaction templates or template-free methods, both of which present limitations. To address these limitations, this work proposes the Broad Reaction Set (BRS), a dataset featuring 20 generic reaction templates that allow for the efficient exploration of the chemical space. Additionally, ProPreT5 is introduced, a T5 model tailored to chemistry that achieves a balance between rigid templates and template-free methods. ProPreT5 demonstrates its capability to generate accurate, valid, and realistic reaction products, making it a promising solution that goes beyond the current state-of-the-art on the complex reaction product prediction task.</description>
