      <title>Abelian covers of surfaces and the homology of the Torelli group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the first homology group of the mapping class group and Torelli group with coefficients in the first rational homology group of the universal abelian cover of the surface. We prove two contrasting results: for surfaces with one boundary component these twisted homology groups are finite-dimensional, but for surfaces with one puncture they are infinite-dimensional. These results play an important role in a recent paper of the authors calculating the second rational homology group of the Torelli group.</description>

      <title>Exotic embedded surfaces and involutions from Real Seiberg-Witten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Real Seiberg--Witten theory, Miyazawa introduced an invariant of certain 4-manifolds with involution and used this invariant to construct infinitely many exotic involutions on $\mathbb{CP}^2$ and infinitely many exotic smooth embeddings of $\mathbb{RP}^2$ in $S^4$. In this paper we extend Miyazawa's construction to a large class of 4-manifolds, giving many infinite families of involutions on 4-manifolds which are conjugate by homeomorphisms but not by diffeomorphisms and many infinite families of exotic embeddings of non-orientable surfaces in 4-manifolds, where exotic means continuously isotopic but not smoothly isotopic. Exoticness of our construction is detected using Real Seiberg--Witten theory. We study Miyazawa's invariant, relate it to the Real Seiberg--Witten invariants of Tian--Wang and prove various fundamental results concerning the Real Seiberg--Witten invariants such as: relation to positive scalar curvature, wall-crossing, a mod 2 formula for spin structures, a localisation formula relating ordinary and Real Seiberg--Witten invariants, a connected sum formula and a fibre sum formula.</description>

      <title>Ropelength-minimizing concentric helices and non-alternating torus knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An alternating torus knot or link may be constructed from a repeating double helix after connecting its two ends. A structure with additional helices may be closed to form a non-alternating torus knot or link. Previous work has optimized the dimensions and pitch of double helices to derive upper bounds on the ropelength of alternating torus knots, but non-alternating knots have not been studied extensively and are known to be tighter. Here, we examine concentric helices as units of non-alternating torus knots and discuss considerations for minimizing their contour length. By optimizing both the geometry and combinatorics of the helices, we find efficient configurations for systems with between 3 and 39 helices. Using insights from those cases, we develop an efficient construction for larger systems and show that concentric helices distributed between many shells have an optimized ropelength of approximately 7.83Q^(3/2) where Q is the total number of helices or the minor index of the torus knot, and the prefactor is exact and a 75 percent reduction from previous work. Links formed by extending these helices and bending them into a T(3Q,Q) torus link have a ropelength that is approximately 12 times the three-quarter power of the crossing number. These results reduce the ratio between the upper and lower bounds of the ropelength of non-alternating torus knots from 29 to between 1.4 and 3.8.</description>

      <title>Crossing number inequalities for curves on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that, as $m$ grows, any family of $m$ homotopically distinct closed curves on a surface induces a number of crossings that grows at least like $(m \log m)^2$. We use this to answer two questions of Pach, Tardos and Toth related to crossing numbers of drawings of multigraphs where edges are required to be non-homotopic. Furthermore, we generalize these results, obtaining effective bounds with optimal growth rates on every orientable surface.</description>

      <title>Veech groups of covers of the Chamanara surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider finite normal covers of an infinite translation surface with a large Veech group - the Chamanara surface. We give a characterization for these covers to have Veech groups which are large themselves, that is, which are of finite index in the Veech group of the Chamanara surface. For covers of degree 2, we study these large Veech groups in detail. As an application, we show that every free group in finitely many generators can be realized as the projective Veech group of a translation surface of finite area.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.09925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We make use of link Floer homology to study cobordisms between links embedded in 4-dimensional ribbon homology cobordisms. Combining results of Daemi--Lidman--Vela-Vick--Wong and Zemke, we show that ribbon homology concordances induce split injections on $\mathcal{HFL}^-$. We also make use of the torsion submodule of $\text{HFL}^-$ to give restrictions on the number of critical points in ribbon homology concordances.</description>

      <title>Branched covers of twist-roll spun knots and turned twisted tori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the double branched cover of a twist-roll spun knot in $S^4$ is smoothly preserved when four twists are added, and that the double branched cover of a twist-roll spun knot connected sum with a trivial projective plane is preserved after two twists are added. As a consequence, we conclude that the members of a family of homotopy $\mathbb{CP}^2$s recently constructed by Miyazawa are each diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{CP}^2$. We also apply our techniques to show that the double branched covers of odd-twisted turned tori are all diffeomorphic to $S^2 \times S^2$, and show that a family of homotopy 4-spheres constructed by Juh\'asz and Powell are all diffeomorphic to $S^4$.</description>

      <title>Generic Properties of Hitchin Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08487v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a split real form of a complex simple adjoint group whose Weyl group contains $-1$, let $\lambda$ be the Jordan projection of $G$, and let $S$ be a closed orientable surface of genus at least 2. For a $G$-Hitchin representation $\rho$, we define the set $J(\rho):=\{\lambda(\rho(x))\,|\,x\in\pi_1(S)\setminus \{1\}\}$. Choose any hyperplane $H$ in the maximal abelian subalgebra of the Lie algebra of $G$. Our main result shows that, for a generic $G$-Hitchin representation $\rho$, we have $J(\rho)\cap H=\emptyset$. As an application, we prove that generic orbifold Hitchin representations are strongly dense. This extends the result of Long, Reid, and Wolff for the Hitchin representations of surface groups. Our theorem also shows that the split real forms of many simple adjoint Lie groups contain strongly dense orbifold fundamental groups, partially generalizing the work of Breuillard, Guralnick, and Larsen.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be the fundamental group of a $k$-punctured, $k \geq 0$, closed connected orientable surface of genus $g \geq 2$. We show that the character variety of the $(Q^+, Q^-)$-Anosov irreducible representations, resp. the character variety of the $(P^+, P^-)$-Anosov Zariski dense representations of $\Gamma$ into $\SL(n , \C)$, $n \geq 2$, is a complex manifold of complex dimension \hbox{$(2g+k-2)(n^2-1)$}. For $\Gamma=\pi_1(\Sigma_g)$, we also show that these character varieties are holomorphic symplectic manifolds.</description>

Abstract: Given an end-periodic homeomorphism $f: S \to S$ we give a lower bound on the Handel--Miller stretch factor of $f$ in terms of the core characteristic of $f$, which is a measure of topological complexity for an end-periodic homeomorphism.

Abstract: The famous Conway--Gordon--Sachs theorem for the complete graph on six vertices was extended to the general complete graph on $n$ vertices by Kazakov--Korablev as a congruence modulo $2$, and its integral lift was given by Morishita--Nikkuni. However, the proof is complicated and long. In this paper, we provide a shorter proof of the generalized Conway--Gordon--Sachs theorem over integers.</description>

      <title>Folding Branched Covers of the $3$-Sphere Branched over Knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A folding of a branched cover of the 3-sphere that is branched over a knot is a continuous map of the cover into the product of the sphere with a disk that has the property that the projection onto the sphere factor induces the covering. Moreover, away from the branch set, the map is a general position immersion. Cyclic branched covers can be folded so that the map is an embedding when the disk factor is 2-dimensional. Dihedral branched covers can also be folded. In as much as possible, the foldings that are presented are quite detailed. In particular, the paper focuses upon a folding of the dihedral cover of the 3-sphere that is branched along a torus knot of type (2,5). The cover also is homeomorphic to the $3$-sphere.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a family of links we call torus necklaces for which the link groups are precisely the braid groups of generalised $J$-reflection groups. Moreover, this correspondence exhibits the meridians of the aforementioned link groups as braid reflections. In particular, this construction generalises to all irreducible rank two complex reflection groups a well-known correspondence between some rank two complex braid groups and some torus knot groups. In addition, as abstract groups, we show that the family of link groups associated to Seifert links coincides with the family of circular groups. This shows that every time a link group has a non-trivial center, it is a Garside group.</description>

Abstract: Ishizaka classified up to conjugacy hyperelliptic periodic automorphisms of a surface. Here, an involution $I$ on a surface $\Sigma_{g}$ is hyperelliptic if and only if $\Sigma_{g}/\langle I \rangle$ is homeomorphic to $S^2$. In this article, we give a classification up to conjugacy for irreducible periodic automorphisms of a surface $\Sigma_{g}$ which commute with involutions $\iota$ such that $\Sigma_{g}/\langle \iota \rangle$ is homeomorphic to $T^{2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.05805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the Moore complex of the Delta-group structure related to the pure braid groups and introduced by Berrick, Cohen, Wong, and Wu. We prove that the cycle and the boundary groups are invariant under all automorphisms of the pure braid groups, and thereby, we extend the results of Li and Wu on the reflection automorphism. We conclude that there is an induced action of all automorphisms of the pure braid groups on the homotopy groups of the two-sphere. Besides, we compute this action for a small number of strands.</description>
