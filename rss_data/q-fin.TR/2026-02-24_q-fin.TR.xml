      <title>AlphaForgeBench: Benchmarking End-to-End Trading Strategy Design with Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to a surge of financial benchmarks, evolving from static knowledge tests to interactive trading simulations. However, current evaluations of real-time trading performance overlook a critical failure mode: severe behavioral instability in sequential decision-making under uncertainty. We empirically show that LLM-based trading agents exhibit extreme run-to-run variance, inconsistent action sequences even under deterministic decoding, and irrational action flipping across adjacent time steps. These issues stem from stateless autoregressive architectures lacking persistent action memory, as well as sensitivity to continuous-to-discrete action mappings in portfolio allocation. As a result, many existing financial trading benchmarks produce unreliable, non-reproducible, and uninformative evaluations. To address these limitations, we propose AlphaForgeBench, a principled framework that reframes LLMs as quantitative researchers rather than execution agents. Instead of emitting trading actions, LLMs generate executable alpha factors and factor-based strategies grounded in financial reasoning. This design decouples reasoning from execution, enabling fully deterministic and reproducible evaluation while aligning with real-world quantitative research workflows. Experiments across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs show that AlphaForgeBench eliminates execution-induced instability and provides a rigorous benchmark for assessing financial reasoning, strategy formulation, and alpha discovery.</description>

      <title>Overreaction as an indicator for momentum in algorithmic trading: A Case of AAPL stocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates whether short-term market overreactions can be systematically predicted and monetized as momentum signals using high-frequency emotional information and modern machine learning methods. Focusing on Apple Inc. (AAPL), we construct a comprehensive intraday dataset that combines volatility normalized returns with transformer-based emotion features extracted from Twitter messages. Overreactions are defined as extreme return realizations relative to contemporaneous volatility and transaction costs and are modeled as a three-class prediction problem. We evaluate the performance of several nonlinear classifiers, including XGBoost, Random Forests, Deep Neural Networks, and Bidirectional LSTMs, across multiple intraday frequencies (1, 5, 10, and 15 minute data). Model outputs are translated into trading strategies and assessed using risk-adjusted performance measures and formal statistical tests. The results show that machine learning models significantly outperform benchmark overreaction rules at ultra short horizons, while classical behavioral momentum effects dominate at intermediate frequencies, particularly around 10 minutes. Explainability analysis based on SHAP reveals that volatility and negative emotions, especially fear and sadness, play a central role in driving predicted overreactions. Overall, the findings demonstrate that emotion-driven overreactions contain a predictable structure that can be exploited by machine learning models, offering new insights into the behavioral origins of intraday momentum and the interaction between sentiment, volatility, and algorithmic trading.</description>

      <title>Metaorder modelling and identification from public data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Market-order flow in financial markets exhibits long-range correlations. This is a widely known stylised fact of financial markets. A popular hypothesis for this stylised fact comes from the Lillo-Mike-Farmer (LMF) order-splitting theory. However, quantitative tests of this theory have historically relied on proprietary datasets with trader identifiers, limiting reproducibility and cross-market validation. We show that the LMF theory can be validated using publicly available Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) data by leveraging recently developed methods for reconstructing synthetic metaorders. We demonstrate the validation using 3 years of Transaction and Quote Data (TAQ) for the largest 100 stocks on the JSE when assuming that there are either N=50 or N=150 effective traders managing metaorders in the market.</description>

      <title>RAmmStein: Regime Adaptation in Mean-reverting Markets with Stein Thresholds -- Optimal Impulse Control in Concentrated AMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.19419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Concentrated liquidity provision in decentralized exchanges presents a fundamental Impulse Control problem. Liquidity Providers (LPs) face a non-trivial trade-off between maximizing fee accrual through tight price-range concentration and minimizing the friction costs of rebalancing, including gas fees and swap slippage. Existing methods typically employ heuristic or threshold strategies that fail to account for market dynamics. This paper formulates liquidity management as an optimal control problem and derives the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman quasi-variational inequality (HJB-QVI). We present an approximate solution RAmmStein, a Deep Reinforcement Learning method that incorporates the mean-reversion speed (theta) of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process among other features as input to the model. We demonstrate that the agent learns to separate the state space into regions of action and inaction. We evaluate the framework using high-frequency 1Hz Coinbase trade data comprising over 6.8M trades. Experimental results show that RAmmStein achieves a superior net ROI of 0.72% compared to both passive and aggressive strategies. Notably, the agent reduces rebalancing frequency by 67% compared to a greedy rebalancing strategy while maintaining 88% active time. Our results demonstrate that regime-aware laziness can significantly improve capital efficiency by preserving the returns that would otherwise be eroded by the operational costs.</description>
