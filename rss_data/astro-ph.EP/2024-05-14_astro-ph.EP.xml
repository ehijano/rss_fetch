      <title>Exoplanet Transit Spectroscopy with JWST NIRSpec: Diagnostics and Homogeneous Case Study of WASP-39 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The JWST has ushered in a new era of exoplanet transit spectroscopy. Among the JWST instruments, the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) has the most extensive set of configurations for exoplanet time series observations. The NIRSpec Prism and G395H grating represent two extremes in NIRSpec instrument modes, with the Prism spanning a wider spectral range (0.6-5.3 $\mu$m at lower resolution (R$\sim$100) compared to G395H (2.87-5.14 $\mu$m; R$\sim$2700). In this work, we develop a new data reduction framework, JexoPipe, to conduct a homogeneous assessment of the two NIRSpec modes for exoplanet spectroscopy. We use observations of the hot Saturn WASP-39 b obtained as part of the JWST Transiting Exoplanets ERS program to assess the spectral quality and stability between the two instrument modes at different epochs. We explore the noise sources, effect of saturation, and offsets in transmission spectra between the different instrument modes and also between the two G395H NRS detectors. We find an inter-detector offset in G395H of $\sim$ 40-50 ppm, consistent with recent studies. We find evidence for correlated noise in the Prism white light curve. We find the G395H spectrum to be of higher precision compared to the Prism at the same resolution. We also compare the JexoPipe spectra with those reported from other pipelines. Our work underscores the need for robust assessment of instrument performance and identification of optimal practices for JWST data reduction and analyses.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the long-term existence of dilute cores in giant planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ring seismology has recently revealed the presence of internal gravity waves inside Saturn that extend up to 60% of Saturn's radius starting from the center, in what is recognized today as Saturn's stably-stratified dilute core. Similarly, gravity measurements on Jupiter suggest the existence of a dilute core of still poorly constrained radial extent. These cores are likely in a double-diffusive regime, which prompt the question of their long-term stability. Indeed, previous DNS (Direct Numerical Simulations) studies in triply-periodic domains have shown that, in some regimes, double-diffusive convection tends to spontaneously form shallow convective layers, which coarsen until the region becomes fully convective. In this letter, we study the conditions for layering in double-diffusive convection using different boundary conditions, in which temperature and composition fluxes are fixed at the domain boundaries. We run a suite of DNS varying microscopic diffusivities of the fluid and the strength of the initial stratification. We find that convective layers still form as a result of the previously discovered gamma-instability which takes place whenever the local stratification drops below a critical threshold that only depends on the fluid diffusivities. We also find that the layers grow once formed, eventually occupying the entire domain. Our work thus recovers the results of previous studies, despite the new boundary conditions, suggesting that this behavior is universal. The existence of Saturn's stably-stratified core, today, therefore suggests that this threshold has never been reached, which places a new constraint on scenarios for the planet's formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Statistical Study of Planetesimal-Driven Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent exoplanet observations have revealed a diversity of exoplanetary systems, which suggests the ubiquity of radial planetary migration. One powerful known mechanism of planetary migration is planetesimal-driven migration (PDM), which makes planets undergo significant migration through gravitational scattering with planetesimals. Here, we present the results of our high-resolution self-consistent $N$-body simulations of PDM, in which gravitational interactions among planetesimals, the gas drag, and Type-I migration are all taken into account. Our results show that even small protoplanets can actively migrate through PDM. Moreover, a fair fraction of them migrate outward. This outward migration can give a solution for the ''planet migration problem'' caused by Type-I migration and explain the origin of Jovian planets.</description>

      <title>TOI-2447 b / NGTS-29 b: a 69-day Saturn around a Solar analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering transiting exoplanets with relatively long orbital periods ($&gt;$10 days) is crucial to facilitate the study of cool exoplanet atmospheres ($T_{\rm eq} &lt; 700 K$) and to understand exoplanet formation and inward migration further out than typical transiting exoplanets. In order to discover these longer period transiting exoplanets, long-term photometric and radial velocity campaigns are required. We report the discovery of TOI-2447 b ($=$ NGTS-29b), a Saturn-mass transiting exoplanet orbiting a bright (T=10.0) Solar-type star (T$_{\rm eff}$=5730 K). TOI-2447 b was identified as a transiting exoplanet candidate from a single transit event of 1.3% depth and 7.29 h duration in $TESS$ Sector 31 and a prior transit event from 2017 in NGTS data. Four further transit events were observed with NGTS photometry which revealed an orbital period of P=69.34 days. The transit events establish a radius for TOI-2447 b of $0.865 \pm 0.010\rm R_{\rm J}$, while radial velocity measurements give a mass of $0.386 \pm 0.025 \rm M_{\rm J}$. The equilibrium temperature of the planet is $414$ K, making it much cooler than the majority of $TESS$ planet discoveries. We also detect a transit signal in NGTS data not caused by TOI-2447 b, along with transit timing variations and evidence for a $\sim$150 day signal in radial velocity measurements. It is likely that the system hosts additional planets, but further photometry and radial velocity campaigns will be needed to determine their parameters with confidence. TOI-2447 b/NGTS-29b joins a small but growing population of cool giants that will provide crucial insights into giant planet composition and formation mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Gravitational influence of Saturn's rings on its moons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploratory missions have found that regolith on interplanetary bodies can be loosely packed and freely flowing, a state that strongly affects mission plans and that may also influence the large scale shapes of these bodies. We investigate whether notable circumferential ridges seen on Saturn's moons may be a byproduct of free flow of loosely packed regolith. Such ridges and other features likely record the history of the moons, and we find that if surface grains are freely flowing, then the combined gravity of Saturn itself and its tenuous ring generate similar circumferential features. Moreover, analysis of these features reveals the possibility of previously unreported morphologies, for example a stationary torus around a non rotating satellite. Some of these features persist even for a very low density and distant disk. This raises the prospect that nonlinear analysis of interactions from disks to moons and back again may lead to new insights.</description>

      <title>Constraining Time Variations in Enceladus' Water-Vapor Plume With Near-Infrared Spectra from Cassini-VIMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water vapor produces a series of diagnostic emission lines in the near infrared between 2.60 and 2.75 microns. The Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) onboard the Cassini spacecraft detected this emission signal from Enceladus' plume, and so VIMS observations provide information about the variability of the plume's water vapor content. Using a data set of 249 spectral cubes with relatively high signal-to-noise ratios, we confirmed the strength of this water-vapor emission feature corresponds to a line-of-sight column density of order 10^20 molecules/m^2, which is consistent with previous measurements from Cassini's Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS). Comparing observations made at different times indicates that the water-vapor flux is unlikely to vary systematically with Enceladus' orbital phase, unlike the particle flux, which does vary with orbital phase. However, variations in the column density on longer and shorter timescales cannot be ruled out and merit further investigation.</description>

      <title>KMT-2023-BLG-1866Lb: Microlensing super-Earth around an M dwarf host</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the short-term anomaly that appears in the lensing light curve of KMT-2023-BLG-1866. The anomaly was only partly covered due to its short duration, less than a day, coupled with cloudy weather conditions and restricted nighttime duration. Considering intricacy of interpreting partially covered signals, we thoroughly explore all potential degenerate solutions. Through this process, we identify three planetary scenarios that equally well account for the observed anomaly. These scenarios are characterized by the specific planetary parameters: $(s, q)_{\rm inner} = [0.9740 \pm 0.0083, (2.46 \pm 1.07) \times 10^{-5}]$, $(s, q)_{\rm intermediate} = [0.9779 \pm 0.0017, (1.56 \pm 0.25)\times 10^{-5}]$, and $(s, q)_{\rm outer} = [0.9894 \pm 0.0107, (2.31 \pm 1.29)\times 10^{-5}]$, where $s$ and $q$ denote the projected separation (scaled to the Einstein radius) and mass ratio between the planet and its host, respectively. We identify that the ambiguity between the inner and outer solutions stems from the inner-outer degeneracy, while the similarity between the intermediate solution and the others is due to an accidental degeneracy caused by incomplete anomaly coverage. Through Bayesian analysis utilizing the constraints derived from measured lensing observables and blending flux, our estimation indicates that the lens system comprises a very low-mass planet orbiting an early M-type star situated approximately (6.2 -- 6.5)~kpc from Earth in terms of median posterior values for the different solutions. The median mass of the planet host is in the range of (0.48 -- 0.51)~$M_\odot$, and that of the planet's mass spans a range of (2.6 -- 4.0)~$M_{\rm E}$, varying across different solutions. The detection of KMT-2023-BLG-1866Lb signifies the extension of the lensing surveys to very low-mass planets that have been difficult to be detected from earlier surveys.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Magmatic Architecture Beneath Oceanus Procellarum: Insights from GRAIL Mission Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Oceanus Procellarum region, characterized by its vast basaltic plains and pronounced volcanic activity, serves as a focal point for understanding the volcanic history of the Moon. Leveraging the Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission data, we imaged the magmatic structures beneath the Oceanus Procellarum region. Our 3D density models uncover pronounced linear magmatic structures along the Procellarum's western border and significant intrusions within the northern and southern Marius Hills. Crucially, they reveal three narrow near-horizontal sheeted magmatic structures, 80-150 km long, extending from near-surface to 6- 7 km depth, which we identified as sill-like magmatic conduits. These magmatic conduits connect the Marius Hills' northern and southern intrusions and bridge them with the Procellarum's western border structures. These discoveries suggest that sill-like magmatic conduits likely serve as central pathways facilitating magma transport across various volcanic systems and furthermore indicate widespread magmatic connectivity beneath the Oceanus Procellarum.</description>

      <title>A reference meteor magnitude for intercomparable fluxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rate at which meteors pass through Earth's atmosphere has been measured or estimated many times over; existing flux measurements span at least 12 astronomical magnitudes, or roughly five decades in mass. Unfortunately, the common practice of scaling flux to a universal reference magnitude of +6.5 tends to collapse the magnitude or mass dimension. Furthermore, results from different observation networks can appear discrepant due solely to the use of different assumed population indices, and readers cannot resolve this discrepancy without access to magnitude data. We present an alternate choice of reference magnitude that is representative of the observed meteors and minimizes the dependence of flux on population index. We apply this choice to measurements of recent Orionid meteor shower fluxes to illustrate its usefulness for synthesizing independent flux measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long term observations and space missions have generated a wealth of data on the magnetic fields of the Earth and other solar system planets. planetMagfields is a Python package designed to have all the planetary magnetic field data currently available in one place and to provide an easy interface to access the data. planetMagfields focuses on planetary bodies that generate their own magnetic field, namely Mercury, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Ganymede. planetMagfields provides functions to compute as well as plot the magnetic field on the planetary surface or at a distance above or under the surface. It also provides functions to filter out the field to large or small scales as well as to produce .vts files to visualize the field in 3D using Paraview, VisIt or similar rendering software. Lastly, the planetMagfields repository also provides a Jupyter notebook for easy interactive visualizations.</description>

      <title>GRASS II: Simulations of Potential Granulation Noise Mitigation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an updated version of GRASS (the GRanulation And Spectrum Simulator, Palumbo et al. 2022) which now uses an expanded library of 22 solar lines to empirically model time-resolved spectral variations arising from solar granulation. We show that our synthesis model accurately reproduces disk-integrated solar line profiles and bisectors, and we quantify the intrinsic granulation-driven radial-velocity (RV) variability for each of the 22 lines studied. We show that summary statistics of bisector shape (e.g., bisector inverse slope) are strongly correlated with the measured anomalous, variability-driven RV at high pixel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spectral resolution. Further, the strength of the correlations vary both line by line and with the summary statistic used. These correlations disappear for individual lines at the typical spectral resolutions and SNRs achieved by current EPRV spectrographs; so we use simulations from GRASS to demonstrate that they can, in principle, be recovered by selectively binning lines that are similarly affected by granulation. In the best-case scenario (high SNR and large number of binned lines), we find that a $\lesssim$30$\%$ reduction in the granulation-induced root mean square (RMS) RV can be achieved, but that the achievable reduction in variability is most strongly limited by the spectral resolution of the observing instrument. Based on our simulations, we predict that existing ultra-high-resolution spectrographs, namely ESPRESSO and PEPSI, should be able to resolve convective variability in other, bright stars.</description>

      <title>Earth as an Exoplanet. III. Using Empirical Thermal Emission Spectra as an Input for Atmospheric Retrieval of an Earth-twin Exoplanet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02634v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we treat Earth as an exoplanet and investigate our home planet by means of a potential future mid-infrared (MIR) space mission called the Large Interferometer For Exoplanets (LIFE). We combine thermal spectra from an empirical dataset of disk-integrated Earth observations with a noise model for LIFE to create mock observations. We apply a state-of-the-art atmospheric retrieval framework to characterize the planet, assess the potential for detecting the known bioindicators, and investigate the impact of viewing geometry, seasonality, and patchy clouds on the characterization. Key findings include: (1) we are observing a temperate habitable planet with significant abundances of $\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{H_2O}$, $\mathrm{O_3}$, and $\mathrm{CH_4}$; (2) seasonal variations in the surface and equilibrium temperature, and in the Bond albedo are detectable; (3) the viewing geometry and the spatially and temporally unresolved nature of our observations only have a minor impact on the characterization; (4) Earth's variable H2O profile and patchy cloud coverage lead to biased retrieval results for the atmospheric structure and trace gas abundances; (5) the limited extent of Earth's seasonal variations in biosignature abundances makes the direct detection of its biosphere through atmospheric seasonality unlikely. Our results suggest that LIFE could correctly identify Earth as a planet where life could thrive, with detectable levels of bioindicators, a temperate climate, and surface conditions allowing liquid surface water. Even if atmospheric seasonality is not easily observed, our study demonstrates that next generation, optimized space missions can assess whether nearby temperate terrestrial exoplanets are habitable or even inhabited.</description>

      <title>Validation of a Third Planet in the LHS 1678 System</title>

Abstract: The nearby LHS 1678 (TOI-696) system contains two confirmed planets and a wide-orbit, likely-brown-dwarf companion, which orbit an M2 dwarf with a unique evolutionary history. The host star occupies a narrow "gap" in the HR diagram lower main sequence, associated with the M dwarf fully convective boundary and long-term luminosity fluctuations. This system is one of only about a dozen M dwarf multi-planet systems to date that hosts an ultra-short period planet (USP). Here we validate and characterize a third planet in the LHS 1678 system using TESS Cycle 1 and 3 data and a new ensemble of ground-based light curves. LHS 1678 d is a 0.98 +/-0.07 Earth radii planet in a 4.97-day orbit, with an insolation flux of 9.1 +0.9/-0.8 Earth insolations. These properties place it near 4:3 mean motion resonance with LHS 1678 c and in company with LHS 1678 c in the Venus zone. LHS 1678 c and d are also twins in size and predicted mass, making them a powerful duo for comparative exoplanet studies. LHS 1678 d joins its siblings as another compelling candidate for atmospheric measurements with the JWST and mass measurements using high-precision radial velocity techniques. Additionally, USP LHS 1678 b breaks the "peas-in-a-pod" trend in this system, although additional planets could fill in the "pod" beyond its orbit. LHS 1678's unique combination of system properties and their relative rarity among the ubiquity of compact multi-planet systems around M dwarfs makes the system a valuable benchmark for testing theories of planet formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>TESS Free-floating Planet Candidate Is Likely a Stellar Flare</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of a terrestrial-mass free-floating planet candidate in the light curve of the star TIC 107150013 observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has recently been announced. A short-duration (~0.5 day), low-amplitude (~0.06 mag) brightening in the TESS light curve was interpreted as a short-timescale gravitational microlensing event. However, the purported event occurred far from the Galactic center and the Galactic plane (l~ 239 deg, b ~ -5 deg), on a relatively nearby (~3.2 kpc) star, making the microlensing interpretation unlikely. Here, we report the archival photometric observations of TIC 107150013 collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) from 2018 through 2020. The archival OGLE light curve reveals periodic variability indicative of starspots on the surface of the star. The presence of starspots indicates magnetic activity of the star, which may also manifest as stellar flares. We interpret the brightening of TIC 107150013 seen in the TESS data as the stellar flare. We present similar flaring stars detected in the archival OGLE data, mimicking short-timescale, low-amplitude microlensing events. Such stars may be a source of non-negligible false positive detections in the planned space-based microlensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Mixing is easy: New insights for cosmochemical evolution from pre-stellar core collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Signposts of early planet formation are ubiquitous in substructured young discs. Dense, hot and high-pressure regions formed during gravitational collapse process, integral to star formation, facilitate dynamical mixing of dust within the protostellar disc. This provides an incentive to constrain the role of gas-dust interaction and resolve zones of dust concentration during star-disc formation. We explore if thermal and dynamical conditions developed during disc formation can generate gas flows that efficiently mix and transport well-coupled gas and dust components. We simulated the collapse of dusty molecular cloud cores with the hydrodynamics code PLUTO augmented with radiation transport and self-gravity. We used a 2D axisymmetric geometry and follow the azimuthal component of velocity. Dust was treated as Lagrangian particles that are subject to drag from the gas, whose motion is computed on a Eulerian grid. We considered 1, 10 and 100 micron-sized neutral spherical dust. Importantly, the equation of state accurately includes molecular hydrogen dissociation. We focus on molecular cloud core masses of 1 and 3 Msun and explore effects of initial rotation rates and cloud core sizes. Our study underlines mechanisms for early transport of dust from inner hot disc regions via the occurrence of meridional flows and outflow. The vortical flow fosters dynamical mixing and retention of dust while thermal pressure driven outflow replenishes dust in the outer disc. Young dynamical precursors to planet-forming discs exhibit regions with complex hydrodynamical gas features and high-temperature structures. These can play a crucial role in concentrating dust for subsequent growth into protoplanets. Dust transport, especially, from sub-au scales surrounding the protostar to outer relatively cooler parts, offers an efficient pathway for thermal reprocessing during pre-stellar core collapse.

      <title>Pulsar Timing Noise from Brownian Motion of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) reported a signal at nanohertz frequencies consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background. Here, I show that the Brownian motion of the Sun as a result of its random gravitational interactions with the cluster of thousands of unmodeled Main-belt asteroids of diameters &lt;80km, not included in the Solar system ephemeris, introduces correlated timing noise for pulsars with the magnitude and frequencies of the reported signal.</description>
