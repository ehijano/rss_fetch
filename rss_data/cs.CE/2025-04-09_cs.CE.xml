      <title>Physics-aware generative models for turbulent fluid flows through energy-consistent stochastic interpolants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in domains such as text, image, and video synthesis. In this work, we explore the application of generative models to fluid dynamics, specifically for turbulence simulation, where classical numerical solvers are computationally expensive. We propose a novel stochastic generative model based on stochastic interpolants, which enables probabilistic forecasting while incorporating physical constraints such as energy stability and divergence-freeness. Unlike conventional stochastic generative models, which are often agnostic to underlying physical laws, our approach embeds energy consistency by making the parameters of the stochastic interpolant learnable coefficients. We evaluate our method on a benchmark turbulence problem - Kolmogorov flow - demonstrating superior accuracy and stability over state-of-the-art alternatives such as autoregressive conditional diffusion models (ACDMs) and PDE-Refiner. Furthermore, we achieve stable results for significantly longer roll-outs than standard stochastic interpolants. Our results highlight the potential of physics-aware generative models in accelerating and enhancing turbulence simulations while preserving fundamental conservation properties.</description>

      <title>MLPROP -- an open interactive web interface for thermophysical property prediction with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) enables the development of powerful methods for predicting thermophysical properties with unprecedented scope and accuracy. However, technical barriers like cumbersome implementation in established workflows hinder their application in practice. With MLPROP, we provide an interactive web interface for directly applying advanced ML methods to predict thermophysical properties without requiring ML expertise, thereby substantially increasing the accessibility of novel models. MLPROP currently includes models for predicting the vapor pressure of pure components (GRAPPA), activity coefficients and vapor-liquid equilibria in binary mixtures (UNIFAC 2.0, mod. UNIFAC 2.0, and HANNA), and a routine to fit NRTL parameters to the model predictions. MLPROP will be continuously updated and extended and is accessible free of charge via https://ml-prop.mv.rptu.de/. MLPROP removes the barrier to learning and experimenting with new ML-based methods for predicting thermophysical properties. The source code of all models is available as open source, which allows integration into existing workflows.</description>

      <title>Coupling approaches with non-matching grids for classical linear elasticity and bond-based peridynamic models in 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local-nonlocal coupling approaches provide a means to combine the computational efficiency of local models and the accuracy of nonlocal models. To facilitate the coupling of the two models, non-matching grids are often desirable as nonlocal grids usually require a finer resolution than local grids. In that case, it is often convenient to resort to interpolation operators so that models can exchange information in the overlap regions when nodes from the two grids do not coincide. This paper studies three existing coupling approaches, namely 1) a method that enforces matching displacements in an overlap region, 2) a variant that enforces a constraint on the stresses instead, and 3) a method that considers a variable horizon in the vicinity of the interfaces. The effect of the interpolation order and of the grid ratio on the performance of the three coupling methods with non-matching grids is carefully studied on one-dimensional examples using polynomial manufactured solutions. The numerical results show that the degree of the interpolants should be chosen with care to avoid introducing additional modeling errors, or simply minimize these errors, in the coupling approach.</description>

      <title>GraphPINE: Graph Importance Propagation for Interpretable Drug Response Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Explainability is necessary for many tasks in biomedical research. Recent explainability methods have focused on attention, gradient, and Shapley value. These do not handle data with strong associated prior knowledge and fail to constrain explainability results based on known relationships between predictive features.
  We propose GraphPINE, a graph neural network (GNN) architecture leveraging domain-specific prior knowledge to initialize node importance optimized during training for drug response prediction. Typically, a manual post-prediction step examines literature (i.e., prior knowledge) to understand returned predictive features. While node importance can be obtained for gradient and attention after prediction, node importance from these methods lacks complementary prior knowledge; GraphPINE seeks to overcome this limitation. GraphPINE differs from other GNN gating methods by utilizing an LSTM-like sequential format. We introduce an importance propagation layer that unifies 1) updates for feature matrix and node importance and 2) uses GNN-based graph propagation of feature values. This initialization and updating mechanism allows for informed feature learning and improved graph representation.
  We apply GraphPINE to cancer drug response prediction using drug screening and gene data collected for over 5,000 gene nodes included in a gene-gene graph with a drug-target interaction (DTI) graph for initial importance. The gene-gene graph and DTIs were obtained from curated sources and weighted by article count discussing relationships between drugs and genes. GraphPINE achieves a PR-AUC of 0.894 and ROC-AUC of 0.796 across 952 drugs. Code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GraphPINE-40DE.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithms for Option Hedging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic hedging is a financial strategy that consists in periodically transacting one or multiple financial assets to offset the risk associated with a correlated liability. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms have been used to find optimal solutions to dynamic hedging problems by framing them as sequential decision-making problems. However, most previous work assesses the performance of only one or two DRL algorithms, making an objective comparison across algorithms difficult. In this paper, we compare the performance of eight DRL algorithms in the context of dynamic hedging; Monte Carlo Policy Gradient (MCPG), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), along with four variants of Deep Q-Learning (DQL) and two variants of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). Two of these variants represent a novel application to the task of dynamic hedging. In our experiments, we use the Black-Scholes delta hedge as a baseline and simulate the dataset using a GJR-GARCH(1,1) model. Results show that MCPG, followed by PPO, obtain the best performance in terms of the root semi-quadratic penalty. Moreover, MCPG is the only algorithm to outperform the Black-Scholes delta hedge baseline with the allotted computational budget, possibly due to the sparsity of rewards in our environment.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing for Combinatorial Optimization: A Benchmarking Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing (QA) has the potential to significantly improve solution quality and reduce time complexity in solving combinatorial optimization problems compared to classical optimization methods. However, due to the limited number of qubits and their connectivity, the QA hardware did not show such an advantage over classical methods in past benchmarking studies. Recent advancements in QA with more than 5,000 qubits, enhanced qubit connectivity, and the hybrid architecture promise to realize the quantum advantage. Here, we use a quantum annealer with state-of-the-art techniques and benchmark its performance against classical solvers. To compare their performance, we solve over 50 optimization problem instances represented by large and dense Hamiltonian matrices using quantum and classical solvers. The results demonstrate that a state-of-the-art quantum solver has higher accuracy (~0.013%) and a significantly faster problem-solving time (~6,561x) than the best classical solver. Our results highlight the advantages of leveraging QA over classical counterparts, particularly in hybrid configurations, for achieving high accuracy and substantially reduced problem solving time in large-scale real-world optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Rediscovering Hyperelasticity by Deep Symbolic Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate modeling of the mechanical behavior of rubber-like materials under multi-axial loading constitutes a long-standing challenge in hyperelastic material modeling. This work employs deep symbolic regression as an interpretable machine learning approach to discover novel strain energy functions directly from experimental results, with a specific focus on the classical Treloar and Kawabata data sets for vulcanized rubber. The proposed approach circumvents traditional human model selection biases by exploring possible functional forms of strain energy functions, expressed in terms of both the first and second principal invariants of the right Cauchy-Green tensor. The resulting models exhibit high predictive accuracy for various deformation modes, including uniaxial tension, pure shear, equal biaxial tension, and biaxial loading. This work underscores the potential of deep symbolic regression in advancing hyperelastic material modeling and highlights the importance of considering both invariants in capturing the complex behaviors of rubber-like materials.</description>

      <title>PATH: A Discrete-sequence Dataset for Evaluating Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Approaches for Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13951v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is a challenging task due to a lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. Additionally, our dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions in literature. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data. Furthermore, results show that the threshold used can have a large influence on detection performance, hence more work needs to be invested in methods to find a suitable threshold without the need for labelled data.</description>
