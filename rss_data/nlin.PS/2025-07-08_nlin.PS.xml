      <title>Experimental observation of the spatio-temporal dynamics of breather gases in a recirculating fiber loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first experimental observation of breather gases (BGs) in optics, realized in a recirculating fiber loop enabling virtually lossless propagation over $1200$ km. Initiated by a slowly modulated optical background perturbed by noise, the BGs form through a nonlinear fission process and demonstrate spatiotemporal dynamics that align closely with numerical simulations of the focusing one-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. The minimal dissipation in our setup enables a statistical characterization of the BGs and confirms the theoretically predicted doubling of kurtosis during the evolution of the BGs. These results open new avenues for experimental studies of integrable turbulence involving solitons on finite background.</description>

      <title>Index Theorem and Vortex Kinetics in Bose-Einstein Condensates on a Haldane Sphere with a Magnetic Monopole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The geometry-gauge interplay constitutes a fundamental issue in quantum physics, with profound implications spanning from quantum gravity to topological matter. Here, we investigate the dynamic effects of geometry-gauge interplay in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) on a Haldane sphere with a magnetic monopole. We reveal an index theorem that establishes a correspondence between BEC vortices and the topology of the gauge field, enabling the construction of vortex-monopole composites. Furthermore, we derive the universal logarithmic interaction between composites, which governs the structure of the ground-state vortex lattice. By developing a kinetic theory, we predict scale-invariant vortex dynamics and an emergent duality. Both are confirmed through numerical simulations. This work first presents the dynamical coupling mechanism between spatial geometry and gauge fields, providing deep insights into superfluid systems with topological gauge structures in curved space.</description>

      <title>Hyperparametric solitons in nondegenerate optical parametric oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dissipative solitons and their associated low-noise, chip-scale frequency combs hold great potential for applications in optical communications, spectroscopy, precision time-keeping, and beyond. These applications drive interest in shifting soliton spectra to frequency bands far detuned from the telecom's C-band pump sources. Recent demonstrations have utilized second-harmonic generation and degenerate optical parametric oscillators (OPOs) to shift soliton combs away from the primary pump. However, these approaches lack the tunability offered by nondegenerate OPOs. This work presents a proof-of-principle demonstration of solitons in a silicon-nitride microresonator-based nondegenerate OPO system with engineered dispersion and optimized coupling rates. By pumping a relatively low-Q resonance in the C-band, we excite a signal soliton comb centred around a far-detuned, high-Q O-band resonance. This process also generates repetition-rate-locked combs at the pump and idler frequencies, with the latter occurring at a wavelength beyond
  2$\mu$m. We demonstrate that the solitons supported by this platform are distinct from other families of dissipative solitons and call them - hyperparametric solitons. They emerge when the narrow-band signal mode, phase-matched under negative pump detuning, reaches sufficient power to drive bistability in the parametric signal. We investigate the properties of hyperparametric solitons, including their parametrically generated background and multisoliton states, both experimentally and through theoretical modelling.</description>

      <title>Deriving thin-film averaged equations using computer algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of computer algebra for facilitating the derivation of thin film reduced-order models. We focus on the weighted residual integral boundary layer (WRIBL) method, which has proven to be a very effective technique for developing reduced-order models by averaging the Navier-Stokes equations over the thin-gap direction. In particular, we use SymPy (the symbolic computing library in Python) to derive the core-annular WRIBL model of Dietze and Ruyer-Quil (J. Fluid Mech. 762, 60, 2015); the derivation is especially involved due to the inclusion of second-order terms, the presence of two hydrodynamically active phases, the enforcement of interfacial boundary conditions, and the cylindrical geometry. We show, using excerpts of code, how each step of the derivation can be broken down into substeps that are amenable to symbolic computation. To illustrate the application of the derived model, we solve it numerically using scientific computing libraries in Python, and briefly explore the dynamics of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. The use of open-source computer algebra, in the manner described here, greatly eases the derivation of averaged models, thereby facilitating their use for the study of multiscale flows, as well as for computationally-efficient prediction and optimization.</description>

      <title>A regularized continuum model for traveling waves and dispersive shocks of the granular chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we focus on a discrete physical model describing granular crystals, whose equations of motion can be described by a system of differential difference equations (DDEs). After revisiting earlier continuum approximations, we propose a regularized continuum model variant to approximate the discrete granular crystal model through a suitable partial differential equation (PDE). We then compute, both analytically and numerically, its traveling wave and periodic traveling wave solutions, in addition to its conservation laws. Next, using the periodic solutions, we describe quantitatively various features of the dispersive shock wave (DSW) by applying Whitham modulation theory and the DSW fitting method. Finally, we perform several sets of systematic numerical simulations to compare the corresponding DSW results with the theoretical predictions and illustrate that the continuum model provides a good approximation of the underlying discrete one.</description>
