      <title>Refining local-type primordial non-Gaussianity: Sharpened $b_\phi$ constraints through bias expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local-type primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), predicted by many non-minimal models of inflation, creates a scale-dependent contribution to the power spectrum of large-scale structure (LSS) tracers. Its amplitude is characterized by the product $b_\phi f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, where $b_\phi$ is an astrophysical parameter dependent on the properties of the tracer. However, $b_\phi$ exhibits significant secondary dependence on halo concentration and other astrophysical properties, which may bias and weaken the constraints on $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$. In this work, we demonstrate that incorporating knowledge of the relation between Lagrangian bias parameters and $b_\phi$ can significantly enhance PNG constraints. We employ the Hybrid Effective Field Theory (HEFT) approach at the field-level and a linear regression model to seek a connection between the bias parameters and $b_{\phi}$ for halo and galaxy samples, constructed using the \textsc{AbacusSummit} simulation suite and mimicking the luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and quasi-stellar objects (QSOs) of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. For the fixed-mass halo samples, our full bias model reduces the uncertainty by more than 70\%, with most of that improvement coming from $b_\nabla$, which we find to be an excellent proxy for concentration. For the galaxy samples, our model reduces the uncertainty on $b_\phi$ by 80\% for all tracers. By adopting Lagrangian-bias informed priors on the parameter $b_\phi$, future analyses can thus constrain $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ with less bias and smaller errors.</description>

      <title>Testing the viability of $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ gravity models via effective equation of state constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper rigorously examines the potential of the $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ theory as a promising framework for understanding the dark sector of the universe, particularly in relation to cosmic acceleration. The $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ theory extends gravitational dynamics by incorporating both the torsion scalar $T$ and the trace of the energy-momentum tensor $\mathcal{T}$. Further, we explore the functional form $f(T, \mathcal{T}) = T + \beta \mathcal{T}$, where $\beta$ is a free parameter that modulates the matter's influence on spacetime evolution. To evaluate this model, we employ an effective EoS parameter dependent on redshift $z$, to solve the field equations and analyze the evolution of the Hubble parameter $H(z)$. Using a joint dataset ($H(z)+Pantheon^+$) and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with Bayesian analysis, we obtain the best-fit parameter values: $H_0 = 68.04 \pm 0.64$, $\beta = 0.14 \pm 0.17$, and $\gamma = 0.96^{+0.38}_{-0.69}$, which align well with current observational data. Our findings indicate a deceleration parameter of $q_0 = -0.51$, supporting a present-day accelerated expansion phase, with a transition redshift $z_t = 0.57$ marking the universe's shift from deceleration to acceleration. Moreover, we confirm a positive cosmic fluid energy density, reinforcing stability, and find an EoS parameter value of $\omega_0 = -0.76$, consistent with quintessence-driven acceleration. These results underscore the viability of $f(T, \mathcal{T})$ as a robust framework for addressing the accelerating universe and dark energy dynamics, paving the way for future investigations into its cosmological implications.</description>

      <title>Cuscuton-like contribution to dark energy evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work deals with the presence of the cuscuton term in the otherwise standard dark energy evolution under the usual FLRW background. We disclose a first-order framework similar to the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, which helps us to solve the equations of motion and find analytical solutions. We explore several possibilities, concentrating mainly on how the cuscuton-like contribution works to modify cosmic evolution. Some results are of current interest since they describe scenarios capable of changing the evolution, adding or excluding possible distinct phases during the Universe's expansion history. Additionally, we present interesting constraints on the cuscuton-like contribution for the dark energy evolution using a set of homogeneous geometrical observational probes. Finally, based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), we perform a statistical comparison of the cuscuton-like model with $\Lambda$CDM, and find strong support for our model.</description>

      <title>Supernovae Ia, high-redshift probes, and the Hubble tension: current status and future perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hubble constant ($H_0$) tension is one of the biggest challenges in modern cosmology. This consists of the discrepancy, at around $5\sigma$, between the local value of $H_0$ measured through Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) constrained with the Cepheids and the value inferred from the observations of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) by Planck data. According to the most appealing cosmological models, such as the flat $\Lambda$CDM, the $H_0$ should not vary according to the measurement method or the redshift $z$ of the probe used for estimating it. Thus, many ideas have been proposed in the literature to face this tension. In the current work, we summarize the results obtained with the binned analysis of SNe Ia, showing a decreasing trend for $H_0$ with $z$ with an evolutionary coefficient $\eta \sim 0.01$, and we further discuss the impact of high-$z$ probes such as Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) and quasars (QSOs) that allow reaching constraints on the cosmological parameters that will extend the Hubble diagram to high-$z$ values.</description>

      <title>Future Cosmology: New Physics and Opportunity from the China Space Station Telescope (CSST)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The China Space Station Telescope (CSST) is the next-generation Stage~IV survey telescope. It can simultaneously perform multi-band imaging and slitless spectroscopic wide- and deep-field surveys in ten years and an ultra-deep field (UDF) survey in two years, which are suitable for cosmological studies. Here we review several CSST cosmological probes, such as weak gravitational lensing, two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) galaxy clustering, galaxy cluster abundance, cosmic void, Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), and baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAO), and explore their capabilities and prospects in discovering new physics and opportunities in cosmology. We find that CSST will measure the matter distribution from small to large scales and the expansion history of the Universe with extremely high accuracy, which can provide percent-level stringent constraints on the property of dark energy and dark matter and precisely test the theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Redshift drift effect through the observation of HI 21cm signal with SKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents the findings of using the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) telescope to measure redshift drift via the HI 21cm signal, employing semi-annual observational interval within redshift around z $\sim$ 1 with main goal is to directly gauge the universe's expansion acceleration rate with millimeter-per-second (mm/s) precision. The SKA can detect over a billion HI 21cm emissions from individual galaxies to the redshift z $\sim$ 2 and thousands of absorption lines from Damped Lyman-alpha (DLA) systems against bright quasars to the redshift z $\sim$ 13, with the sensitivity limit of 100 mJy. By utilizing SKA's high spectral resolution settings (0.001, 0.002, 0.005, 0.01 Hz) to detect redshift drift, particularly focusing on the 0.001 and 0.002 Hz configuration, one aims to achieve the necessary mm/s in precision measurement by the 0.5-year observation period. The velocity drift rate, crucially determined by the two operational regimes within 0.01 to 0.21 mm/s and 0.031 to 0.17 mm/s, respectively, exceeds the theoretical accuracy limit of 1.28 mm/s. The analysis thoroughly restricts cosmological parameters related to dark energy using the Sandage-Loeb (SL) signal from the HI 21cm emission and absorption lines. It estimates $\rm H_0$ of about 70 km/s/Mpc, $\rm \Omega_m$ near 0.3, with w close to -1, $\rm w_0$ around -1, and $\rm w_a$ approaching -0.1. These results strongly endorse the SL effect as an effective method for confirming cosmic acceleration and exploring the dark sector in real-time cosmology with the SKA.</description>

      <title>Cosmic distance duality after DESI 2024 data release and dark energy evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic distance duality relates the angular-diameter and luminosity distances and its possible violation may puzzle the standard cosmological model. This appears particularly interesting in view of the recent results found by the DESI Collaboration, suggesting that a dynamical dark energy scenario seems to be favored than a genuine cosmological constant. Accordingly, we take into account possible violations by considering four different parameterizations, namely: a Taylor expansion around $z\simeq 0$, a slightly-departing logarithmic correction, a (1;2) Pad\'e rational series to heal the convergence problem and a Chebyshev polynomial expansion, reducing \emph{de facto} the systematic errors associated with the analysis. We test each of them in a model-independent (-dependent) way, by working out Monte-Carlo Markov chain analyses, employing the B\'ezier interpolation of the Hubble rate $H(z)$ for the model-independent approach while assuming the flat (non-flat) $\Lambda$CDM and $\omega_0\omega_1$CDM models, motivating the latter paradigm in view of the DESI findings. Subsequently, we explore two analyses, employing observational Hubble data, galaxy clusters from the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect and type Ia supernovae, investigating the impact of the DESI data catalog, first including then excluding the entire data set. Afterwards, we adopt statistical model selection criteria to assess the statistically favored cosmological model. Our results suggest \emph{no violation} of the cosmic distance duality. While a slight spatial curvature cannot be entirely excluded, the preferred cosmological model remains the flat $\Lambda$CDM background, even when incorporating DESI data. Finally, concerning the Hubble tension, our findings match the Riess estimates, as BAO data points are excluded.</description>

      <title>Scalar-Tensor Gravity and DESI 2024 BAO data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the implications of the DESI 2024 BAO data on scalar-tensor models of gravity. We consider four representative models: induced gravity (IG, equivalent to Jordan-Brans-Dicke), where we either fix today's value of the effective gravitational constant on cosmological scales to the Newton's constant or allow them to differ, Jordan-Brans-Dicke supplemented with a Galileon term (BDG), and early modified gravity (EMG) with a conformal coupling. In this way it is possible to investigate how different modified gravity models compare with each other when confronted with DESI 2024 BAO data. Compared to previous analyses, for all of these models, the combination of Planck and DESI data favors a larger value of the key parameter of the theory, such as the nonminimal coupling to gravity or the Galileon term, leading also to a larger value of $H_0$, due to the known degeneracy between these parameters. These new results are mainly driven by the first two redshift bins of DESI. In BDG, in which we find the largest value for $H_0$ among the models considered, the combination of Planck and DESI is consistent with CCHP results and reduces the $H_0$ tension with the SH0ES measurement to $1.2\sigma$ (compared to $4.5\sigma$ of $\Lambda$CDM in our Planck + DESI analysis).</description>

      <title>Uncertainties in the Hubble Constant from Peculiar Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the Hubble constant using type Ia supernovae explicitly correct for their estimated peculiar velocities using the 2M++ reconstruction of the local density field. The amount of uncertainty from this reconstruction procedure has thus far been unquantified. To rectify this, we use mock universe realisations of the 2M++ catalogue and generate predicted peculiar velocities using the same method as the predictions that are used to correct for the Pantheon+ catalogue. We find that the method yields uncertainties of 0.3 km/s/Mpc and hence subdominant to the total uncertainty in H0.</description>

      <title>\texttt{BrahMap}: A scalable and modular map-making framework for the CMB experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments have reached an era of unprecedented precision and complexity. Aiming to detect the primordial B-mode polarization signal, these experiments will soon be equipped with $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ detectors. Consequently, future CMB missions will face the substantial challenge of efficiently processing vast amounts of raw data to produce the initial scientific outputs - the sky maps - within a reasonable time frame and with available computational resources. To address this, we introduce \texttt{BrahMap}, a new map-making framework that will be scalable across both CPU and GPU platforms. Implemented in C++ with a user-friendly Python interface for handling sparse linear systems, \texttt{BrahMap} employs advanced numerical analysis and high-performance computing techniques to maximize the use of super-computing infrastructure. This work features an overview of the \texttt{BrahMap}'s capabilities and preliminary performance scaling results, with application to a generic CMB polarization experiment.</description>

      <title>Line-of-sight shear in SLACS strong lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inhomogeneities along the line of sight in strong gravitational lensing distort the images produced, in an effect called shear. If measurable, this shear may provide independent constraints on cosmological parameters, complementary to traditional cosmic shear. We model 50 strong gravitational lenses from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) catalogue with the aim of measuring the line-of-sight (LOS) shear for the first time. We use the `minimal model' for the LOS shear, which has been shown to be theoretically safe from degeneracies with lens model parameters, a finding which has been confirmed using mock data. We use the dolphin automated modelling pipeline, which uses the lenstronomy software as a modelling engine, to model our selected lenses. We model the main deflector with an elliptical power law profile, the lens light with elliptical S\'ersic profiles and the source with a basis set of shapelets and an elliptical S\'ersic profile. We successfully obtain a line-of-sight shear measurement from 18 of the 50 lenses. We find that these LOS shear measurements are consistent with external shears measured in recent works using a simpler shear model, which are larger than those expected from weak lensing. Neglecting the post-Born correction to the potential of the main deflector due to foreground shear leads to a propagation of degeneracies to the LOS shear measurement, and the same effect is seen if a prior is used to connect the lens mass and light ellipticities. The inclusion of an octupole moment in the lens mass profile does not lead to shear measurements that are in better agreement with the expectations from weak lensing.</description>

      <title>Exploring gravitational impulse via quantum Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gravitational impulse by using the generalized formulation of the quantum Boltzmann equation (QBE), wherein the initial states are taken as wave packets rather than plane waves. The QBE equation operates within an open quantum system framework. Using this approach, we can analyze the two-body gravitational scattering by considering one body as part of the environment and the other as the system. Similarly, we apply this approach to the gravitational impulse of a photon due to a massive object, during which we consider the photon as the system and the massive object as the environment. In this methodology, we use the forward scattering term of the extended QBE to compute the time evolution of the momentum operator associated with the system. While this term vanishes when considering point particles, we demonstrate its persistence when using wave packets to describe both massive particles and the photon field. Through this procedure, we obtain the leading order of the system's impulse. The results reported here are entirely consistent with the previous approaches.</description>

      <title>On the Stability of Non-Singular Solutions in Effective Theory from Kaluza-Klein Unimodular Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unimodular theory incorporating the Kaluza-Klein construction in five dimensions leads, after reduction to four dimensions, to a new class of scalar-tensor theory. The vacuum cosmological solutions display a bouncing, non singular behavior. From the four dimensional point of view, the solutions are completely regular. However, the propagation of gravitational waves in this geometry displays the presence of instabilities which reflect some features of the original five dimensional structure. Comparison with a four dimensional quantum model with cosmological constant, which has a similar background behavior, is discussed.</description>

      <title>Gamma-Ray Observations of Galaxy Clusters Strongly Constrain Dark Matter Annihilation in Prompt Cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal dark matter models generically include the prompt creation of highly-concentrated dark matter cusps in the early Universe. Recent studies find that these cusps can survive to the present day, as long as they do not fall into extremely dense regions of baryonic structure. In this work, we build models of dark matter annihilation within the prompt cusps that reside in galaxy clusters, showing that they dominate the total $\gamma$-ray annihilation signal. Using 15 years of Fermi-LAT data, we find no evidence for a $\gamma$-ray excess from these sources, and set strong constraints on annihilating dark matter. These constraints generically rule out the thermal annihilation cross-section to the $b\bar{b}$ channel for dark matter masses below $\sim$200~GeV.</description>

      <title>Ephemeral Oscillons in Scalar-Tensor Theories: The Higgs-like case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the post-inflationary evolution of a non-minimally coupled inflaton field in scalar-tensor theories, framed within the flexible framework of Einstein-Cartan gravity. By focusing on a class of simplified Higgs-like scenarios, we simulate the transition from the end of inflation to the formation of oscillons using fully-fledged 3+1 classical lattice simulations. Once oscillons form, we extract their profiles and perform 1+1 simulations to evolve their radial equations. Our findings reveal that these oscillons, unlike typical cases in the literature, are relatively short-lived, due to the presence of self interactions at small field values. The radiation produced by this novel type of oscillons can quickly lead to a radiation-dominated Universe, even in the absence of additional fields or interactions. Finally, we leverage our results to derive precise predictions for the inflationary observables and the produced spectrum of gravitational waves associated with oscillon formation. Significantly, our study establishes also an upper bound on the duration of the heating phase in Einstein-Cartan Higgs inflation scenarios.</description>

      <title>Probing small-scale power spectrum with gravitational-wave diffractive lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel way to probe subgalactic-scale matter distribution with diffractive lensing on gravitational waves. Five-year observations from Einstein Telescope and DECIGO are expected to probe $k= 10^5\sim 10^8 \,{\rm Mpc}^{-1}$ down to $P(k) = 10^{-16} \sim 10^{-14} \,{\rm Mpc}^3$ level. These results can be interpreted in terms of primordial black holes in the range $M_{\rm PBH} \gtrsim 10^{-3}M_\odot$ down to $f_{\rm PBH} = 10^{-6}$ level, or QCD axion minihalos in the range $m_a = 10^{-3} \sim 10^{-12} \,{\rm eV}$. A key result of the paper is the approximate relation between the scale $k$ and the gravitational wave frequency $f$, derived in an ensemble of `multi-lensing' events. This relation enables direct measurement of the power spectrum at specific scales, with sensitivities characterized by model-independent kernels $\delta P(k)$. Additionally, we delineate the statistical properties of `multi-lensing' based on the `Fresnel number' $N_F$. When $N_F \gtrsim {\cal O}(1)$, the statistical significance can be approximately calculated by Variance of lensing effects, which is directly related to the power spectrum among other moments of matter distribution.</description>

      <title>Model-Independent Probe of Cosmic Distance Duality Relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, cosmic distance duality relation is probed without considering any background cosmological model. The only \textit{a priori} assumption is that the Universe is described by the Friedmann-Lema$\hat{i}$tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric The strong gravitational lensing (SGL) data is used to construct the dimensionless co-moving distance function $d(z)$ and latest type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) Pantheon+ data is used to estimate luminosity distances at the corresponding redshifts $z$. Using the distance sum rule along null geodesics of the FLRW metric, the CDDR violation is probed in both flat and non-flat space-time by considering two parametrizations for $\eta(z)$, the function generally used to probe the possible deviations from CDDR. The results show that, CDDR is compatible with the observations at a very high level of confidence for linear parametrization in flat Universe. In non-flat Universe too, CDDR is valid within $1\sigma$ confidence interval with a mild dependence of $\eta$ on the curvature density parameter $\Omega_{K}$ . The results for non-linear parametrization also show no significant deviation from CDDR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For several independent reasons, the idea that notorious sources of entropy could exist in the Universe has been recently revived. Taking advantage of a new framework accounting for non-equilibrium processes in cosmology, we explicitly investigate the cosmological dynamics as a function of the entropy production, focusing on the stability of the system. An exhaustive investigation is performed. As the main physical conclusion, we show that for a wide class of entropy source terms, the fluid dynamics converges towards an effective cosmological constant. Constraints on the associated entropic force are also obtained.</description>

      <title>VacuumTunneling: A package to solve bounce equation with renormalization factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vacuum tunneling rate $\Gamma$ from the effective action is a key to studying the cosmological first-order phase transition(FOPT). One solid way to compute the $\Gamma$ is to start with the derivative expansion of the effective action and solve the bounce equation numerically. In this process, the renormalization factor $Z$ of the tunneling field may play a center rule, which is not considered in existing packages. Therefore, we present a \texttt{Mathematica} package \vt to compute the bounce action with or without the renormalization factor. Applying the \vt package, we find that the presence of $Z$ has a significant impact on the action, as well on the tunneling path. We provide some concrete examples to demonstrate the difference between the solution with and without the renormalization factor, both in the action and tunneling path. This package is based on the modified shooting and path deformation method. We also made some optimizations for the super-cooling phase transition(thick wall scenario), in which other numerical package works poorly. This package works as long as the expressions can give values of the potential and the renormalization at a certain field point. This means the input potential and the renormalization can be merely numerical quantities without analytical expressions. The computation time can be as short as 1 second in single-field tunneling and several seconds in multi-field cases.</description>

Abstract: In the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali (ADD) model with n extra compactified dimensions, the gravitational potential scales as 1/r^{n+1} and becomes significantly stronger at short distances. We investigate the possibility of forming small-sized composite systems of Standard Model particles bound by this potential. Such bound states, composed of quarks, neutrinos, axions, or other particles, exhibit a small cross-section-to-mass ratio, making them viable candidates for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Constraints on fast radio burst population from the first CHIME/FRB catalog from Hierarchical Bayesian Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as one of the most dynamic areas of research in astronomy and cosmology. Despite increasing number of FRBs have been reported, the exact origin of FRBs remains elusive. Investigating the intrinsic distributions of FRBs could provide valuable insights into their possible origins and enhance the power of FRBs a cosmological probe. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian inference approach combining with several viable models to investigate the population information of FRBs released in the CHIME catalog 1. By utilizing this method, we aim to uncover the underlying patterns and characteristics of the FRB population. Taking into account the uncertainties and complex relationships within the data. We find that the distribution of FRBs does not trace the history of star formation, and there is evidence that the FRB population has time delay with respect to the history of star formation.</description>

      <title>Repeated pattern of $\gamma$-ray flares in the blazar PKS 1502+106 coincident with the IC190730A neutrino event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been demonstrated that at least 10 percent of the brightest blazars in the fourth Fermi-LAT catalog of $\gamma$-ray sources exhibit repeating patterns of $\gamma$-ray flares. These events may be associated with the presence of a non-uniform sheath surrounding a fast jet spine in some blazars. Theoretical models suggest that such a sheath could facilitate neutrino production in these structured jets. We aim to test the previously reported marginal statistical evidence for a connection between repeating patterns of $\gamma$-ray flares in blazars and high-energy neutrino events that are positionally consistent with these sources. We identified a repeating pattern of flares in the $\gamma$-ray light curve of the blazar PKS 1502+106, which lies within the 50\% uncertainty region of the IC190730A neutrino candidate event. This occurrence is combined with two other high-energy ($\ge 200$ TeV) neutrino events from ICECAT-1 that arrived in both positional and temporal coincidence with two blazars exhibiting ongoing repeating flare patterns. A Monte-Carlo simulation was conducted to evaluate the likelihood of accidental coincidences between the repeating flare patterns and neutrino events, accounting for potential unrecognized systematic uncertainties in the arrival directions of the ICECAT-1 events. Our findings indicate that the probability of a random coincidence in both time and arrival direction for three high-energy neutrino candidates and three blazars with ongoing recurring patterns of $\gamma$-ray flares is $1.56\times 10^{-3}$ ($3.2\sigma$).</description>

Abstract: This article is dedicated to the memory of Alexei Starobinsky. I begin with some recollections of him and then review the generalization of his wonderful stochastic formalism from scalar potential models to theories which interact with fermions and photons, and finally to theories with derivative interactions such as nonlinear sigma models and gravity. This entails effective potentials generated by the usual field-dependent masses, as well as by field-dependent field strengths, and by field-dependent Hubble parameters. I also discuss secular loop corrections which cannot be captured by stochastic techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs), hypothetical extensions of the Standard Model, can convert into photons in an external magnetic field. Two recent studies~\cite{Todarello:2023ptf, Ruz:2024gkl} explored the phenomenology of ALP-photon conversion in the magnetic field of the solar atmosphere. Dark matter ALPs convert into radio photons and may be detected with next-generation radio interferometers, while ALPs produced in the solar core convert into X-rays. Thanks to solar observation acquired with the NuSTAR X-ray telescope, Ref.~\cite{Ruz:2024gkl} establishes stringent robust bounds on the ALP-photon coupling over a large portion of parameter space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Connecting inflation with neutrino physics through non-thermal leptogenesis via direct inflaton-right-handed neutrino (RHN) coupling naturally incorporates neutrino reheating, leaving no ambiguity regarding the early history of the Universe. In ref.~\cite{Zhang:2023oyo}, we demonstrate that non-thermal leptogenesis from inflaton decay expands the viable parameter space compared to thermal leptogenesis and provides a natural link to inflation. In this work, we refine our previous findings by closely examining the dynamics of neutrino reheating. We first calculate the duration of neutrino reheating on a general basis, then analyze inflationary observables consistent with neutrino reheating across four models, establishing a direct connection between baryon asymmetry and the spectral index. This approach places these two important observables on the same plane and yields specific predictions that help break the degeneracy among inflationary models. The well-motivated and economical framework offers a simple, natural, and testable description of the early Universe.</description>

Abstract: The Time Domain Extragalactic Survey (TiDES) conducted on the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) will perform spectroscopic follow-up of extragalactic transients discovered in the era of the NSF-DOE Vera C. Rubin Observatory. TiDES will conduct a 5-year survey, covering ${&gt;}14\,000\,\mathrm{square\, degrees}$, and use around 250 000 fibre hours to address three main science goals: (i) spectroscopic observations of ${&gt;}30 000$ live transients, (ii) comprehensive follow-up of ${&gt;}200 000$ host galaxies to obtain redshift measurements, and (iii) repeat spectroscopic observations of Active Galactic Nuclei to enable reverberation mapping studies. The live spectra from TiDES will be used to reveal the diversity and astrophysics of both normal and exotic supernovae across the luminosity-timescale plane. The extensive host-galaxy redshift campaign will allow exploitation of the larger sample of supernovae and improve photometric classification, providing the largest-ever sample of spec-confirmed type Ia supernovae, capable of a sub-2 per cent measurement of the equation-of-state of dark energy. Finally, the TiDES reverberation mapping experiment of 700--1\,000 AGN will complement the SN Ia sample and extend the Hubble diagram to $z\sim2.5$</description>

      <title>How to detect lensing rotation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13313v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing rotation of images is predicted to be negligible at linear order in density perturbations, but can be produced by the post-Born lens-lens coupling at second order. This rotation is somewhat enhanced for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) lensing due to the large source path length, but remains small and very challenging to detect directly by CMB lensing reconstruction alone. We show the rotation may be detectable at high significance as a cross-correlation signal between the curl reconstructed with Simons Observatory (SO) or CMB-S4 data, and a template constructed from quadratic combinations of large-scale structure (LSS) tracers. Equivalently, the lensing rotation-tracer-tracer bispectrum can also be detected, where LSS tracers considered include the CMB lensing convergence, galaxy density, and the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB), or optimal combinations thereof. We forecast that an optimal combination of these tracers can probe post-Born rotation at the level of $5.7\sigma$-$6.1\sigma$ with SO and $13.6\sigma$-$14.7\sigma$ for CMB-S4, depending on whether standard quadratic estimators or maximum a posteriori iterative methods are deployed. We also show possible improvement up to $21.3\sigma$ using a CMB-S4 deep patch observation with polarization-only iterative lensing reconstruction. However, these cross-correlation signals have non-zero bias because the rotation template is quadratic in the tracers, and exists even if the lensing is rotation free. We estimate this bias analytically, and test it using simple null-hypothesis simulations to confirm that the bias remains subdominant to the rotation signal of interest. Detection and then measurement of the lensing rotation cross-spectrum is therefore a realistic target for future observations.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological solitonic objects such as monopoles, cosmic strings, domain walls, oscillons and Q-balls often appear in theories of the early Universe. We demonstrate that such scenarios are generically accompanied by a novel production source of gravitational waves stemming from soliton isocurvature perturbations. The resulting induced universal gravitational waves (UGWs) reside at lower frequencies compared to gravitational waves typically associated with soliton formation. We show that UGWs from axion-like particle (ALP) oscillons, originating from ALP misalignment, extend the frequency range of produced gravitational waves by more than two orders of magnitude regardless of the ALP mass and decay constant and can be observable in upcoming gravitational wave experiments. UGWs open a new route for gravitational wave signatures in broad classes of cosmological theories.</description>

Abstract: Formation of cosmological solitons is generically accompanied by production of gravitational waves (GWs), with a universal GW background expected at frequency scales below that of non-linear dynamics. Beginning with a general phenomenological description of GWs associated with soliton formation, we demonstrate that universal GW background from axion-like particle (ALP) solitonic oscillons provides a viable interpretation to the recent NANOGrav 15 year pulsar timing array data, which does not suffer from the overproduction of primordial black holes. We show that pulsar timing array data displays preference for models where formed solitons do not strongly interact or cluster. Coincidence observations with Nancy Roman telescope will allow to discriminate between distinct scenarios of cosmological solitons.</description>

      <title>Field-level simulation-based inference with galaxy catalogs: the impact of systematic effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been recently shown that a powerful way to constrain cosmological parameters from galaxy redshift surveys is to train graph neural networks to perform field-level likelihood-free inference without imposing cuts on scale. In particular, de Santi et al. (2023) developed models that could accurately infer the value of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ from catalogs that only contain the positions and radial velocities of galaxies that are robust to uncertainties in astrophysics and subgrid models. However, observations are affected by many effects, including 1) masking, 2) uncertainties in peculiar velocities and radial distances, and 3) different galaxy selections. Moreover, observations only allow us to measure redshift, intertwining galaxies' radial positions and velocities. In this paper we train and test our models on galaxy catalogs, created from thousands of state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations run with different codes from the CAMELS project, that incorporate these observational effects. We find that, although the presence of these effects degrades the precision and accuracy of the models, and increases the fraction of catalogs where the model breaks down, the fraction of galaxy catalogs where the model performs well is over 90 %, demonstrating the potential of these models to constrain cosmological parameters even when applied to real data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we calibrate the luminosity relation of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) with the machine learning (ML) algorithms from the Pantheon+ sample of type Ia supernovae in a cosmology-independent way. By using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) selected with the best performance in the ML algorithms, we calibrate the Amati relation (\unboldmath{$E_{\rm p}$-$E_{\rm iso}$}) relation with the A219 sample to construct the Hubble diagram of GRBs. Via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method with GRBs at high redshift and latest observational Hubble data, we find the results of constraints on cosmological models by using KNN and RF algorithms are consistent with those obtained from GRBs calibrated by using the Gaussian Process.</description>

      <title>Nearly-zero large-angle anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16147v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The global isotropy of the universe is analyzed on the scale of the cosmic horizon, using the angular correlation function $C(\Theta)$ of cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature at large angular separation $\Theta$. Even-parity correlation $C_{\rm even}(\Theta)$ is introduced to obtain a direct, precise measure of horizon-scale curvature anisotropy independent of the unknown dipole, with uncertainty dominated by models of Galactic emission. In maps from {\sl Planck}, $C_{\rm even}(\Theta)$ at $\Theta\simeq 90^\circ\pm 15^\circ$ is found to be much closer to zero than previously documented measurements of correlation, with an absolute value three to four orders of magnitude smaller than expected in standard theory. Such a small variation from zero is estimated to occur by chance in a fraction $\simeq 10^{-4.3}$ to $\simeq 10^{-2.8}$ of standard realizations. We consider an alternative interpretation of this result, as a signature of a scale-invariant angular symmetry of cosmological initial conditions. An example of such a symmetry is formulated geometrically, by assuming that quantum fluctuations during inflation have spacelike coherence bounded by compact causal diamonds, and become classical perturbations when world lines cross inflationary horizons. It is argued that this interpretation is inconsistent with the standard theory of initial conditions, but is broadly consistent with other cosmological measurements, and is subject to further tests.</description>

      <title>Role of Spatial Curvature in a Dark Energy Interacting Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the effects of spatial curvature in a model where dark matter and dark energy interact. The analysis employs a range of datasets, including CMB, BAO, Type Ia Supernova, $H(z)$ from cosmic chronometers, $H_0$ measurements from Megamasers and SH0ES, growth rate data and strong lensing time delay measurements, to assess the model's fit and explore the late-time dynamics of the interacting dark sector in a non-flat cosmological framework. The study indicates that introducing curvature does affect the Hubble constant ($H_0$) and the structure growth parameter ($S_8$), and also helps in alleviating the tensions between early and late universe observations to some extent. The observational data shows an indication for an open universe. This implies that the presence of curvature and its influence on Universe's evolution cannot be neglected entirely.</description>

      <title>Detectable signals of post-Born lensing curl B-modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19998v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Curl lensing, also known as lensing field-rotation or shear B-modes, is a distinct post-Born observable caused by two lensing deflections at different redshifts (lens-lens coupling). For the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the field-rotation is approximately four orders of magnitude smaller than the CMB lensing convergence. Direct detection is therefore challenging for near-future CMB experiments such as the Simons Observatory (SO) or CMB `Stage-4' (CMB-S4). Instead, the curl can be probed in cross-correlation between a direct reconstruction and a template formed using pairs of large-scale structure (LSS) tracers to emulate the lens-lens coupling. In this paper, we derive a new estimator for the optimal curl template specifically adapted for curved-sky applications, and test it against non-Gaussian complications using N-body cosmology simulations. We find non-foreground biases to the curl cross-spectrum are purely Gaussian at the sensitivity of SO. However, higher-order curl contractions induce non-Gaussian bias at the order of $1\sigma$ for CMB-S4 using quadratic estimators (QE). Maximum a-Posteriori (MAP) lensing estimators significantly reduce biases for both SO and CMB-S4, in agreement with our analytic predictions. We also show that extragalactic foregrounds in the CMB can bias curl measurements at order of the signal, and evaluate a variety of mitigation strategies to control these biases for SO-like experiments. Near-future observations will be able to measure post-Born lensing curl B-modes.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nonlinear dynamics of a rolling axion during inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13405v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A spectator axion-gauge sector, minimally coupled to the inflaton, with the axion experiencing a momentary stage of fast roll during cosmological inflation, can generate unique signatures in primordial density fluctuations and the gravitational wave background. We present the first lattice simulation of this system using a novel hybrid numerical scheme. This approach solves the fully nonlinear dynamics of the axion-gauge sector while treating the gravitational interaction between the axion and inflaton linearly. Initially, we test the validity of the WKB approximation in the linear regime. We then investigate strong backreaction dynamics within the axion-gauge sector. Our findings reveal that backreaction significantly suppresses the growth of the gauge field and the amplitude of scalar perturbations. The simulation also allows us to analyze the non-Gaussianity of scalar fluctuations, including higher-order statistics. We show that, although non-Gaussianity is suppressed by strong backreaction, it remains higher than in the minimal model where the axion coincides with the inflaton. Our results highlight the need for simulations to make robust predictions to test against data from gravitational wave interferometers and large-scale structure surveys.</description>

      <title>Ultra-light dark matter with non-canonical kinetics reopening the mass window</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fuzzy dark matter (FDM) with mass around $10^{-22}$ eV is viewed as a promising paradigm in understanding the structure formation of the local universe at small scales. Recent observations, however, begin to challenge FDM in return. We focus on the arguments between the solution to CDM small-scale curiosities and recent observations on matter power spectrum, and find its implication on an earlier formation of small-scale structure. In this article, we propose a scheme of k-ULDM scalar field with a differently-evolving sound speed, thanks to the non-canonical kinetics. With the help of the Dirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) theory, we illustrate to change the behavior of the quantum pressure term countering collapse, therefore change the history of structure growth. We find that it can truly reopen the ULDM mass window closed by the Lyman-$\alpha$ problem. We will discuss such examples in this paper, while more possibilities remain to be explored.</description>

      <title>DESI and SNe: Dynamical Dark Energy, $\Omega_m$ Tension or Systematics?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) observations, when combined with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe), have led to statistically significant dynamical dark energy (DDE) claims. In this letter we reconstruct the $\Lambda$CDM parameter $\Omega_m$ from the $w_0 w_a$CDM cosmologies advocated by the DESI collaboration. We identify i) a mild increasing $\Omega_m$ trend at high redshift and ii) a sharp departure from $\Lambda$CDM at low redshift. The latter, which is statistically significant, is driven by SNe that are $1.9 \sigma- 2.5 \sigma$ discrepant with DESI full-shape galaxy clustering in overlapping redshift ranges. We identify a low redshift subsample of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) SNe sample that is discrepant with DESI at $3.4 \sigma$ despite both observables probing the same effective redshift. SNe and BAO/full-shape modeling should not disagree on $\Omega_m$ at the same effective redshift. This ``$\Omega_m$ tension'' most likely points to unexplored systematics. In general, any \textit{bona fide} DDE signal should be confirmed independently across observables, so the DDE claims are premature.</description>

      <title>A New Master Supernovae Ia sample and the investigation of the $H_0$ tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11772v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern cosmological research still thoroughly debates the discrepancy between local probes and the Cosmic Microwave Background observations in the Hubble constant ($H_0$) measurements, ranging from $4\sigma$ to $6\sigma$. In the current study we examine this tension using the Supernovae Ia (SNe Ia) data from the Pantheon, PantheonPlus, Joint Lightcurve Analysis (JLA), and Dark Energy Survey (DES) catalogs together with their combination called Master Sample containing 3789 SNe Ia, and dividing all of them into redshift-ordered bins. Two main binning techniques are presented: the equipopulation and the equispace in the $\log\, z$. We perform a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis (MCMC) for each bin to determine the $H_0$ value, estimating it within the standard flat $\Lambda$CDM and the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM models. These $H_0$ values are then fitted with the following phenomenological function: $\mathcal{H}_0(z) = \tilde{H}_0 / (1 + z)^\alpha$, where $\tilde{H}_0$ is a free parameter representing $\mathcal{H}_0(z)$ fitted at $z=0$, and $\alpha$ is the evolutionary parameter. Our results indicate a decreasing trend characterized by $\alpha \sim 0.01$ whose consistency with zero range from $1.00 \sigma$ at 3 bins in the Pantheon sample with the $w_{0}w_{a}$CDM model to $\geq 6 \sigma$ at 12 bins with the JLA and DES samples within the $\Lambda$CDM model. Such a trend in the SNe Ia catalogs could be due to evolution with redshift for the SNe Ia astrophysical variables or unveiled selection biases. Alternatively, intrinsic physics, possibly the $f(R)$ theory of gravity, could be responsible for this trend.</description>

Abstract: We apply the recently developed analysis of 16 years of INTEGRAL/SPI data including a dark matter spatial template to derive bounds on dark matter candidates lighter than WIMPs (like sterile neutrinos or axion-like particles) decaying into line or continuum electromagnetic final state channels. The bounds obtained are the strongest to date for dark matter masses between $\sim $60 keV and $\sim$16 MeV experiencing two-body decays producing photon lines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion bubbles can form due to an explicit breaking of the Peccei-Quinn symmetry in the early Universe. In this paper, we investigate the modified formation of QCD axion bubble in the presence of axionlike particle (ALP), considering its resonant conversion to QCD axion. We consider a general scenario where the QCD axion mixes with ALP before the QCD phase transition. In this scenario, the energy density of the ALP can be adiabatic transferred to the QCD axion at a temperature $T_R$, resulting in the suppression of the cosmic background temperature $T_B$ at which the energy density of the QCD axion equals that of the radiation. The QCD axion bubbles form when the QCD axions arise during the QCD phase transition. Finally, we briefly discuss the impact of the formation of QCD axion bubbles on the formation of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Candidate strongly lensed type Ia supernovae in the Zwicky Transient Facility archive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed type Ia supernovae (glSNe Ia) are unique astronomical tools that can be used to study cosmological parameters, distributions of dark matter, the astrophysics of the supernovae, and the intervening lensing galaxies themselves. A small number of highly magnified glSNe Ia have been discovered by ground-based telescopes such as the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), but simulations predict that a fainter population may also exist. We present a systematic search for glSNe Ia in the ZTF archive of alerts distributed from June 1 2019 to September 1 2022. Using the AMPEL platform, we developed a pipeline that distinguishes candidate glSNe Ia from other variable sources. Initial cuts were applied to the ZTF alert photometry before forced photometry was obtained for the remaining candidates. Additional cuts were applied to refine the candidates based on their light curve colours, lens galaxy colours, and the resulting parameters from fits to the SALT2 SN Ia template. The candidates were also cross-matched with the DESI spectroscopic catalogue. Seven transients were identified that had an associated galaxy DESI redshift, which we present as glSN Ia candidates. Although superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) cannot be fully rejected as contaminants, two events, ZTF19abpjicm and ZTF22aahmovu, are significantly different from typical SLSNe and their light curves can be modelled as two-image glSN Ia systems. From this two-image modelling, we estimate time delays of 22 $\pm$ 3 and 34 $\pm$ 1 days for the two events, respectively, which suggests that we have uncovered a population of glSNe Ia with longer time delays. The pipeline is currently being applied to the live ZTF alert stream to identify and follow-up future candidates while active, and it could be the foundation for glSNe Ia searches in future surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>Relativistic interacting fluids in cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01412v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by cosmological applications for interacting matters, an extension of the action functional for relativistic fluids is proposed to incorporate the physics of non-adiabatic processes and chemical reactions. The former are characterised by entropy growth, while the latter violate particle number conservation. The relevance of these physics is demonstrated in the contexts of self-interacting fluids, fluids interacting with scalar fields, and hyperhydrodynamical interactions with geometry. The possible cosmological applications range from early-universe phase transitions to astrophysical phenomena, and from matter creation inflationary alternatives to interacting dark sector alternatives to the $\Lambda$CDM model that aim to address its tensions. As an example of the latter, a single fluid model of a unified dark sector is presented. The simple action of the model features one field and one parameter, yet it can both reproduce the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and predict new phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Non-canonical 3-form dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we meticulously construct a 3-form Lagrangian designed to mimic the dynamics of both dust matter in the past and dark energy driving the acceleration in the present era. A dynamical systems approach is used to investigate the underlying behavior of the cosmological background. By investigating the influence of the potential slope and initial conditions on the dynamical solutions, we identify distinct viable scenarios capable of replicating a De Sitter universe in the present epoch. An intriguing aspect of the model is the existence of solutions describing multiple inflationary phases in which the 3-form self-interacting potential decays rapidly.</description>

      <title>Accelerating lensed quasar discovery and modeling with physics-informed variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly lensed quasars provide valuable insights into the rate of cosmic expansion, the distribution of dark matter in foreground deflectors, and the characteristics of quasar hosts. However, detecting them in astronomical images is difficult due to the prevalence of non-lensing objects. To address this challenge, we developed a generative deep learning model called VariLens, built upon a physics-informed variational autoencoder. This model seamlessly integrates three essential modules: image reconstruction, object classification, and lens modeling, offering a fast and comprehensive approach to strong lens analysis. VariLens is capable of rapidly determining both (1) the probability that an object is a lens system and (2) key parameters of a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass model -- including the Einstein radius ($\theta_\mathrm{E}$), lens center, and ellipticity -- in just milliseconds using a single CPU. A direct comparison of VariLens estimates with traditional lens modeling for 20 known lensed quasars within the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) footprint shows good agreement, with both results consistent within $2\sigma$ for systems with $\theta_\mathrm{E}&lt;3$ arcsecs. To identify new lensed quasar candidates, we begin with an initial sample of approximately 80 million sources, combining HSC data with multiwavelength information from various surveys. After applying a photometric preselection aimed at locating $z&gt;1.5$ sources, the number of candidates was reduced to 710,966. Subsequently, VariLens highlights 13,831 sources, each showing a high likelihood of being a lens. A visual assessment of these objects results in 42 promising candidates that await spectroscopic confirmation. These results underscore the potential of automated deep learning pipelines to efficiently detect and model strong lenses in large datasets.</description>

      <title>Asymmetries from a charged memory-burdened PBH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore a purely gravitational origin of observed baryon asymmetry and dark matter (DM) abundance from asymmetric Hawking radiation of light primordial black holes (PBH) in presence of a non-zero chemical potential, originating from the space-time curvature. Considering the PBHs are described by a Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m metric, and are produced in a radiation dominated Universe, we show, it is possible to simultaneously explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry along with right DM abundance satisfying bounds from big bang nucleosynthesis, cosmic microwave background and gravitational wave energy density due to PBH density fluctuation. We also obtain the parameter space beyond the semiclassical approximation, taking into account the quantum effects on charged PBH dynamics due to memory burden.</description>

      <title>LHC-friendly freeze-in dark matter via Higgs portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that single-field freeze-in dark matter barely leaves footprints in dark matter direct detection and collider experiments. This situation can be altered in two-field context. In this work we propose a two-field freeze-in dark matter model through Higgs portal. The observed dark matter relic abundance is obtained by a decay of scalar mediator thermalized in the early Universe. While there is a lack of direct dark matter signals, the scalar mediator is in the reach of HL-LHC either through vector boson fusion or Mono-Z channel. Within allowed scalar mass window of 10-50 GeV, we use improved cuts to derive both $2\sigma$ exclusion and $5\sigma$ discovery limits, depending on the value of Higgs portal coupling. If verified, this scalar mediator signal allows us to infer the freeze-in dark matter.</description>

      <title>Collapsing domain walls with $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating coupling to thermalized fermions and their impact on gravitational wave detections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of domain walls formed through the spontaneous breaking of an approximate $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in a scalar field, focusing on their collapse under the influence of quantum and thermal corrections induced by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-violating Yukawa coupling to Dirac fermions in the thermal bath. The thermal effects render the potential bias between the true and false vacua temperature-dependent and may lead to notable variations in the annihilation temperature of domain walls, in addition to the shift caused by temperature-independent quantum corrections. These modifications could substantially alter the gravitational wave spectrum produced by collapsing domain walls, potentially providing observable signatures for future gravitational wave detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Holes Formed during Magneto-Hydrodynamic Turbulence in Early Universe as Dominant Part of Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBH) offer a compelling candidate for dark matter. Within the framework of the Standard Model, the production of PBHs through well-tested physical processes is highly worthy of investigations. This work highlights the role of turbulences in the very early universe in sustaining intense and persistent fluctuations of energy or mass density, which could provide a natural mechanism for PBH formations in the primordial universe. We analyze the mass range and abundance of PBHs produced in the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence induced by the first-order electroweak phase transition. Remarkably, without invoking any new physics beyond the Standard Model, we find that the mass range of the produced PBHs falls within the only allowed "asteroid mass" window, and within natural parameter regions their abundance can be sufficiently large. These findings strongly suggest that PBHs produced in the magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in the early universe could comprise the dominant part of dark matter.</description>

      <title>Potential of RES-NOVA as Dark Matter observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The RES-NOVA project is an experimental initiative aimed at detecting neutrinos from the next galactic supernova using PbWO$_{4}$ cryogenic detectors, operated at low temperatures in a low-background environment. By utilizing archaeological lead (Pb) as the target material, RES-NOVA leverages its high radiopurity, large nuclear mass, and the natural abundance of $^{207}$Pb, making it well-suited for exploring both spin-independent and spin-dependent Dark Matter (DM) interactions via nuclear scattering. This work presents a background model developed for the RES-NOVA technology demonstrator and evaluates its implications for Dark Matter detection. Detailed calculations of nuclear matrix elements, combined with the unique properties of archaeological Pb, demonstrate RES-NOVA's potential as a complementary tool to existing direct detection experiments for studying Dark Matter interactions. The experiment will conduct DM searches over a broad mass range spanning 4 orders of magnitude, from sub-GeV/$c^2$ to TeV/$c^2$. In the most optimistic scenario, RES-NOVA is expected to probe DM-nucleon cross-sections down to 1$\times 10^{-43}$ cm$^2$ and 2$\times 10^{-46}$ cm$^2$ for candidates with masses of 2 GeV/$c^2$ and 20 GeV/$c^2$, respectively.</description>
