      <title>Dubrovin duality for open Hurwitz flat F-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Dubrovin dual of a Hurwitz Frobenius manifold extends naturally to an F-manifold with compatible flat connection on the universal curve, in the sense of the open WDVV equations. A similar result is proven for the Frobenius manifold itself in arXiv:2503.09258 . This equips the universal curve with two F-manifolds with compatible flat structure, and we study their duality. We show that they combine into a bi-flat F-manifold. Conditions on open WDVV solutions imposed in previous work are retrieved in this setting, thus providing them with a geometrical meaning. Finally, explicit examples are computed. For Saito Frobenius manifolds of types $A$ and $D$, the extended prepotentials coincide with open WDVV solutions computed independently, whereas even the existence of the solution in type $E$ had not been previously discussed. On the other hand, new non-homogeneous solutions are constructed by duality.</description>

      <title>Spaces of initial conditions for quartic Hamiltonian systems of Painlev\'e and quasi-Painlev\'e type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric approach for Painlev\'e and quasi-Painlev\'e differential equations in the complex plane is applied to non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems, quartic in the dependent variables. By computing their defining manifolds (analogue of the Okamoto's space of initial conditions in the quasi-Painlev\'e case), we provide a classification of such systems. We distinguish the various cases by the local behaviour at the movable singularities of the solutions, which are algebraic poles or ordinary poles. The principal cases are categorised by the initial base points of the system in the extended phase space $\mathbb{CP}^2$ and their multiplicities, arising from the coalescence of $4$ simple base points in the generic case. Through the mechanisms of coalescence of base points and degeneration (by setting certain coefficient functions in the Hamiltonian to $0$), all possible sub-cases of quartic Hamiltonian systems with the quasi-Painlev\'e property are obtained, and are characterised by their corresponding Newton polygons. As particular sub-cases we recover certain systems equivalent to known Painlev\'e equations, or variants thereof. The resulting picture is a multi-faceted description of each case: the local behaviour around singularities, the surface type, and the Newton polygon.</description>

      <title>Invariant Reduction for Partial Differential Equations. III: Poisson brackets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, under suitable conditions, finite-dimensional systems describing invariant solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs) inherit local Hamiltonian operators through the mechanism of invariant reduction, which applies uniformly to point, contact, and higher symmetries. The inherited operators endow the reduced systems with Poisson bivectors that relate constants of motion to symmetries. Applying the same mechanism to invariant conservation laws, we further show that the induced Poisson brackets agree with those of the original systems, up to sign. This is illustrated by two examples in which the inherited Poisson brackets and inherited constants of motion yield integrability of the reduced systems.</description>

      <title>Form factors of composite branch-point twist operators in the sinh-Gordon model on a multi-sheeted Riemann surface: semiclassical limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum sinh-Gordon model in 1+1 dimensions is one of the simplest and best-studied massive integrable relativistic quantum field theories. We consider this theory on a multi-sheeted Riemann surfaces with a flat metric, which can be seen as a pile of planes connected to each other along cut lines. The cut lines end at branch points, which are represented by a twist operator ${\cal T}_n.$ Operators of such kind are interesting in the framework of the problem of computing von Neumann and Renyi entanglement entropies in the original model on the plane. The composite branch-point twist operators (CTO) are a natural generalization of the twist operators, obtained by placing a local operator to a branch point by means of a certain limiting procedure. Correlation function in quantum field theory can be, in principle, found by means of the spectral decomposition. It allows one to express them in terms of form factors of local operators, i.e. their matrix elements in the basis of stationary states. In integrable models complete sets of exact form factors of all operators can be found exactly as solutions of a system of bootstrap equations. Nevertheless, identification of these solution to the operators in terms of the basic fields remains problematic. In this work, we develop a technique of computing form factors of a class of CTO determined in terms of the basic field in the semiclassical approximation.</description>
