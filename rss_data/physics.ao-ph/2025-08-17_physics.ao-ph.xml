      <title>Data-driven global ocean model resolving ocean-atmosphere coupling dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced global weather forecasting, outperforming traditional numerical models in both accuracy and computational efficiency. Nevertheless, extending predictions beyond subseasonal timescales requires the development of deep learning (DL)-based ocean-atmosphere coupled models that can realistically simulate complex oceanic responses to atmospheric forcing. This study presents KIST-Ocean, a DL-based global three-dimensional ocean general circulation model using a U-shaped visual attention adversarial network architecture. KIST-Ocean integrates partial convolution, adversarial training, and transfer learning to address coastal complexity and predictive distribution drift in auto-regressive models. Comprehensive evaluations confirmed the model's robust ocean predictive skill and efficiency. Moreover, it accurately captures realistic ocean response, such as Kelvin and Rossby wave propagation in the tropical Pacific, and vertical motions induced by cyclonic and anticyclonic wind stress, demonstrating its ability to represent key ocean-atmosphere coupling mechanisms underlying climate phenomena, including the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. These findings reinforce confidence in DL-based global weather and climate models and their extending DL-based approaches to broader Earth system modeling, offering potential for enhancing climate prediction capabilities.</description>

      <title>Approximating the universal thermal climate index using sparse regression with orthogonal polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article explores novel data-driven modeling approaches for analyzing and approximating the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI), a physiologically-based metric integrating multiple atmospheric variables to assess thermal comfort. Given the nonlinear, multivariate structure of UTCI, we investigate symbolic and sparse regression techniques as tools for interpretable and efficient function approximation. In particular, we highlight the benefits of using orthogonal polynomial bases-such as Legendre polynomials-in sparse regression frameworks, demonstrating their advantages in stability, convergence, and hierarchical interpretability compared to standard polynomial expansions. We demonstrate that our models achieve significantly lower root-mean squared losses than the widely used sixth-degree polynomial benchmark-while using the same or fewer parameters. By leveraging Legendre polynomial bases, we construct models that efficiently populate a Pareto front of accuracy versus complexity and exhibit stable, hierarchical coefficient structures across varying model capacities. Training on just 20% of the data, our models generalize robustly to the remaining 80%, with consistent performance under bootstrapping. The decomposition effectively approximates the UTCI as a Fourier-like expansion in an orthogonal basis, yielding results near the theoretical optimum in the L2 (least squares) sense. We also connect these findings to the broader context of equation discovery in environmental modeling, referencing probabilistic grammar-based methods that enforce domain consistency and compactness in symbolic expressions. Taken together, these results illustrate how combining sparsity, orthogonality, and symbolic structure enables robust, interpretable modeling of complex environmental indices like UTCI - and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art approximation in both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>Scattering graph method for 3D radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A novel method for monochromatic scalar 3D radiative transfer, designed primarily for modeling remote sensing imaging, is presented. For simulating an observation of an imaging satellite instrument, the method uses a heuristic scattering coupling function to model the inter-pixel scattering of radiation, which is represented with a graph. The GPU-capable code implementation of the method, TURSCA, was validated against two established 3D RT models, Siro and SHDOM with relative agreement at 3% and 6%, respectively. The capabilities of TURSCA in modeling a satellite observation of an emission plume are examined. The presented method opens up new avenues of research, especially in satellite-based remote sensing of atmospheres.</description>
