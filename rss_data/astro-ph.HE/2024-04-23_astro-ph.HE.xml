      <title>Magnetic amplification in pre-merger neutron stars through resonance-induced magnetorotational instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal resonances in the final seconds of a binary neutron-star inspiral can excite oscillation modes in one or both of the constituents to large amplitudes. Under favorable circumstances, resonant pulsations can overstrain the stellar crust and unleash a torrent of magnetoelastic energy that manifests as a gamma-ray `precursor flare'. We show that for realistic, stratified stars rotating with a spin frequency of $\gtrsim 30\,$Hz, the fundamental $g$-mode or its first overtone can also execute a differential rotation in the crust such that a magnetic field of strength $\gtrsim 10^{13}\,$G is generated via magnetorotational instabilities. This may help to explain observed precursor rates and their luminosities. Pre-merger magnetic growth would also provide seed magnetic energy for the post-merger remnant.</description>

      <title>Loss of coherence and change in emission physics for radio emission from very inclined cosmic-ray air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation radio experiments such as the Radio Detector of the upgraded Pierre Auger Observatory and the planned GRAND and BEACON arrays target the detection of ultra-high-energy particle air showers arriving at low elevation angles. These inclined cosmic-ray air showers develop higher in the atmosphere than vertical ones, enhancing magnetic deflections of electrons and positrons inside the cascade. We evidence two novel features in their radio emission: a new polarization pattern, consistent with a geo-synchrotron emission model and a coherence loss of the radio emission, both for showers with zenith angle $\theta \gtrsim 65^{\circ}$ and strong enough magnetic field amplitude (typical strength of $B\sim 50\, \rm \mu T$). Our model is compared with both ZHAireS and CoREAS Monte-Carlo simulations. Our results break the cannonical description of a radio signal made of Askaryan and transverse current emission only, and provide guidelines for the detection and reconstruction strategies of next-generation experiments, including cosmic-ray/neutrino discrimination.</description>

      <title>On the X-ray efficiency of the white dwarf pulsar candidate ZTF J190132.9+145808.7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly magnetized, rapidly rotating massive white dwarfs (WDs) emerge as potential outcomes of double degenerate mergers. These WDs can act as sources of non-thermal emission and cosmic rays, gethering attention as WD pulsars. In this context, we studied the X-ray emissions from ZTF J190132.9+145808.7 (hereafter ZTF J1901+14), a notable massive isolated WD in the Galaxy, using the Chandra X-ray observatory. Our results showed 3.5sigma level evidence of X-ray signals, although it is marginal. Under the assumption of a photon index of 2, we derived its intrinsic flux to be 2.3 (0.9--4.7) $\times 10^{-15}$~erg~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and luminosity 4.6 (2.0--9.5) $\times 10^{26}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ for a 0.5--7 keV band in the 90% confidence range, given its distance of 41 pc. We derived an X-ray efficiency (eta) concerning the spin-down luminosity to be 0.012 (0.0022--0.074), a value comparable to that of ordnary neutron star pulsars. The inferred X-ray luminosity may be compatible with curvature radiation from sub-TeV electrons accelerated within open magnetic fields in the magnetosphere of ZTF J1901+14. Conducting more extensive X-ray observations is crucial to confirm whether ZTF J1901+14-like isolated WDs are also significant sources of X-rays and sub-TeV electron cosmic rays, similar to other WD pulsars in accreting systems.</description>

      <title>Black hole-neutron star binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational wave signals of black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binary systems have now been detected, and future detections might be accompanied by electromagnetic counterparts. BHNS mergers involve much of the same physics as binary neutron star mergers: strong gravity, nuclear density matter, neutrino radiation, and magnetic turbulence. They also share with binary neutron star systems the potential for bright electromagnetic signals, especially gamma ray bursts and kilonovae, and the potential to be significant sources of r-process elements. However, BHNS binaries are more asymmetric, and their mergers produce different amounts and arrangements of the various post-merger material components (e.g. disk and dynamical ejecta), together with a more massive black hole; these differences can have interesting consequences. In this chapter, we review the modeling of BHNS mergers and post-merger evolution in numerical relativistic hydrodynamics and magnetohydrodynamics. We attempt to give readers a broad understanding of the answers to the following questions. What are the main considerations that determine the merger outcome? What input physics must (or should) go into a BHNS simulation? What have the most advanced simulations to date learned?</description>

      <title>NuSTAR detection of a broad absorption line in IGR J06074+2205</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the broadband X-ray study of the BeXRB pulsar IGR J06074+2205 using NuSTAR observations. The temporal and spectral characteristics of the source are investigated. We detect coherent X-ray pulsations of the source and determine the spin period evolution. Using the current spin period data of the source, we show that the source is spinning down at 0.0202(2)\; s\; $day^{-1}$. The pulse profiles are found to evolve with energy and luminosity. Another interesting feature of the source is that the pulse profiles are dual peaked. The dual-peaked pulse profile is characterized by a decreasing secondary peak amplitude with increasing energy. We also observed a proportionate increase in the primary peak amplitude as the energy increases. The pulse fraction exhibits an overall increasing trend with the energy. The X-ray continuum of the source indicates the existence of a characteristic absorption feature with a centroid energy $\sim 55$ keV, which may be interpreted as a cyclotron line. We estimate the corresponding magnetic field strength to be $\sim4.74\times10^{12}$ G. A peculiar `10 keV' absorption feature is observed in the X-ray spectra of the second observation.The luminosity measurements predict that the source may be accreting in the sub-critical regime.</description>

      <title>Planetary nebula morphologies indicate a jet-driven explosion of SN 1987A and other core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I demonstrate the usage of planetary nebulae (PNe) to infer that a pair of jets shaped the ejecta of the core-collapse supernova (CCSN) SN 1987A. The main structure of the SN 1987A inner ejecta, the keyhole, comprised two low-intensity zones. The northern one has a bright rim on its front, while the southern one has an elongated nozzle. Earlier comparison of the SN 1987A keyhole with bubbles in the galaxy group NGC 5813 led to its identification as a jet-shaped rim-nozzle structure. Here, I present rim-nozzle asymmetry in planetary nebulae (PNe), thought to be shaped by jets, which solidify the claim that jets powered the ejecta of SN 1987A and other CCSNe. This finding for the iconic SN 1987A with its unique properties strengthens the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe. In a few hundred years, the CCSN 1987A will have a complicated structure with two main symmetry axes, one along the axis of the three circumstellar rings that two opposite 20,000-years pre-explosion jets shaped, and the other along the long axis of the keyhole that was shaped by the main jet pair of the exploding jets of SN 1987A in the frame of the JJEM.</description>

      <title>Three dimensional end-to-end simulation for kilonova emission from a black-hole neutron-star merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study long-term evolution of the matter ejected in a black-hole neutron-star (BH-NS) merger employing the results of a long-term numerical-relativity simulation and nucleosynthesis calculation, in which both dynamical and post-merger ejecta formation are consistently followed. In particular, we employ the results for the merger of a $1.35\,M_\odot$ NS and a $5.4\,M_\odot$ BH with the dimensionless spin of 0.75. We confirm the finding in the previous studies that thermal pressure induced by radioactive heating in the ejecta significantly modifies the morphology of the ejecta. We then compute the kilonova (KN) light curves employing the ejecta profile obtained by the long-term evolution. We find that our present BH-NS model results in a KN light curve that is fainter yet more enduring than that observed in AT2017gfo. This is due to the fact that the emission is primarily powered by the lanthanide-rich dynamical ejecta, in which a long photon diffusion time scale is realized by the large mass and high opacity. While the peak brightness of the KN emission in both the optical and near-infrared bands is fainter than or comparable to those of binary NS models, the time-scale maintaining the peak brightness is much longer in the near-infrared band for the BH-NS KN model. Our result indicates that a BH-NS merger with massive ejecta can observationally be identified by the bright and long lasting ($&gt;$two weeks) near-infrared emission.</description>

      <title>Confronting Dark Matter Capture Rate with Continuous Gravitational Wave Probe of Local Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) from various astrophysical sources are one of the many future probes of upcoming Gravitational Wave (GW) search missions. Neutron stars (NSs) with deformity are one of the leading sources of CGW emissions. In this work, for the first time, a novel attempt to estimate the dark matter (DM) capture rate is performed using CGW as the probe to the local NS population. Competitive bounds on DM capture from the local NS population are reported when compared with DM direct search experiments and other astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>What can cosmic-ray knees reveal about source populations?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic ray (CR) knees (spectral steepenings) encode information on CR accelerator populations. We seek population features that imprint onto knee observables in a manner that is robust enough to be discernible even in the presence of significant systematics in CR data. In particular, we explore how diversity among population members could imprint on the knee phenomenology, under the assumption that a knee is due to a fixed-rigidity cutoff in the source spectra. We use a simple theoretical model for a population of CR accelerators. Each population member accelerates CR to a power-law spectrum, up to a cutoff rigidity. We allow for variance among members, in cutoff rigidity and power-law slope. We find that: (a) the slope step of the spectrum is $\sim 0.5$, decreasing weakly with increasing spread in either property; (b) composition always breaks first; (c) the difference between the break energies in composition and flux increases with increasing diversity; (d) composition and flux break together only if population diversity is minimal. These trends are robust under our assumptions; deviations from them would indicate more complex physics than encoded in our simple model. Comparing these trends with observed CR knees, we conclude that: (i) the primary knee at $\sim 4\times10^{15}$ eV is consistent with a constant-rigidity cutoff according to KASCADE-Grande data processed with post-LHC hadronic models, but not according to other datasets; (ii) the second knee at $\sim 5 \times 10^{17}$ eV requires more complexity than our model; (iii) the spectral feature identified by Auger at $\sim 10^{19}$ eV is consistent with a constant-rigidity source cutoff only if there is a substantial spread in both cutoff rigidity and slope. Interestingly, a significant spread in slope would also result in spectral curvature before the break, which would in turn be contributing to the ankle feature.</description>

      <title>Signature of Particle Diffusion on the X-ray Spectra of the blazar Mkn 421</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The curvature in blazar spectrum has the potential to understand the particle dynamics in jets. We performed a detailed analysis of simultaneous Swift-XRT (0.3-10 keV) and NuSTAR (3-79 keV)} observations of Mkn 421. Our analysis of NuSTAR observations alone reveals that, during periods of low flux, the hard X-ray spectra are best represented by a steep power-law with photon index reaching $\sim$ 3. However, the spectrum exhibits significant curvature during its high flux states. To investigate this, we explore plausible diffusion processes facilitating shock acceleration in the emission region that can contribute to the observed spectral curvature. Particularly, such processes can cause gradual fall of the photon spectrum at high energies which can be represented by a sub-exponential function. The parameter that decides this spectral change can be used to characterise the energy dependence of the diffusive process. Our results suggest that the X-ray spectra of Mkn 421 are consistent with a scenario where particle acceleration is mediated through Bohm-type diffusion and the spectra beyond the synchrotron peak is modulated by the radiative loss process.</description>

      <title>Leading Axion-Photon Sensitivity with NuSTAR Observations of M82 and M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the most sensitive search to-date for the existence of ultralight axions using data from the NuSTAR telescope. We search for stellar axion production in the M82 starburst galaxy and the M87 central galaxy of the Virgo cluster and then the subsequent conversion into hard X-rays in the surrounding magnetic fields. We sum over the full stellar populations in these galaxies when computing the axion luminosity, and we account for the conversion of axions to photons by using magnetic field profiles in simulated IllustrisTNG analogue galaxies. We show that analyzing NuSTAR data towards these targets between roughly 30 to 70 keV shows no evidence for axions and leads to robust constraints on the axion-photon coupling at the level of $|g_{a\gamma\gamma}| \lesssim 6.4 \times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ for $m_a \lesssim 10^{-10}$ eV at 95% confidence.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Muonization by Active-Sterile Neutrino Mixing in Protoneutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $\nu_\mu$-$\nu_s$ and $\bar\nu_\mu$-$\bar\nu_s$ mixing in the protoneutron star (PNS) created in a core-collapse supernova (CCSN). We point out the importance of the feedback on the general composition of the PNS in addition to the obvious feedback on the $\nu_\mu$ lepton number. We show that for our adopted mixing parameters $\delta m^2\sim 10^2\,$keV$^2$ and $\sin^2 2\theta$ consistent with the current constraints, sterile neutrino production is dominated by the Mikheyev$-$Smirnov$-$Wolfenstein conversion of $\bar\nu_\mu$ into $\bar\nu_s$ and that the subsequent escape of $\bar\nu_s$ increases the $\nu_\mu$ lepton number, which in turn enhances muonization of the PNS primarily through $\nu_\mu+n\to p+\mu^-$. We find that this enhancement is amplified by diffusion of the $\nu_e$ and $\nu_\mu$ lepton numbers. While these results are qualitatively robust, their quantitative effects on the dynamics and active neutrino emission of CCSNe should be evaluated by including $\nu_\mu$-$\nu_s$ and $\bar\nu_\mu$-$\bar\nu_s$ mixing in the simulations.</description>

      <title>Imprints of Supermassive Black Hole Evolution on the Spectral and Spatial Anisotropy of Nano-Hertz Stochastic Gravitational-Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14508v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation and evolution of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains an open question in the field of modern cosmology. The detection of nanohertz (n-Hz) gravitational waves via pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) in the form of individual events and the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) offers a promising avenue for studying SMBH formation across cosmic time, with SGWB signal being the immediately detectable signal with the currently accessible telescope sensitivities. By connecting the galaxy properties in the large scale (Gpc scale) cosmological simulation such as \texttt{MICECAT} with the small scale ($\sim$ Mpc scale) galaxy simulations from \texttt{ROMULUS}, we show that different scenarios of galaxy--SMBHs evolution with redshift leads to a frequency-dependent spatial anisotropy in the SGWB signal. The presence of slow evolution of the SMBHs in the Universe leads to a pronounced blue anisotropic spectrum of the SGWB. In contrast, if SMBHs grow faster in the Universe in lighter galaxies, the frequency-dependent spatial anisotropy exhibits a more flattened anisotropic spectrum. This additional aspect of the SGWB signal on top of the monopole SGWB signal, can give insight on how the SMBHs form in the high redshift Universe and its interplay with the galaxy formation from future measurements.</description>

      <title>Lifetime-Limited Linewidth Measurements of the 3C and 3D Soft X-ray Transitions in Ni XIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We used the monochromatic soft X-ray beamline P04 at the synchrotron-radiation facility PETRA III to resonantly excite the strongest $2p-3d$ transitions in neon-like Ni XIX ions, $[2p^6]_{J=0} \rightarrow [(2p^5)_{1/2}\,3d_{3/2}]_{J=1}$ and $[2p^6]_{J=0} \rightarrow [(2p^5)_{3/2}\,3d_{5/2}]_{J=1}$, respectively dubbed 3C and 3D, achieving a resolving power of 15,000 and signal-to-background ratio of 30. We obtain their natural linewidths, with an accuracy of better than 10\%, as well as the oscillator-strength ratio $f(3C)/f(3D)$ = 2.51(11) from analysis of the resonant fluorescence spectra. These results agree with those of previous experiments, earlier predictions, and our own advanced calculations.</description>

      <title>Bring the Heat: Tidal Heating Constraints for Black Holes and Exotic Compact Objects from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Data</title>

Abstract: We present the first constraints on tidal heating for the binary systems detected in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) gravitational wave data. Tidal heating, also known as tidal dissipation, characterizes the viscous nature of an astrophysical body and provides a channel for exchanging energy and angular momentum with the tidal environment. Using the worldline effective field theory formalism, we introduce a physically motivated and easily interpretable parametrization of tidal heating valid for an arbitrary compact astrophysical object. We then derive the imprints of the spin-independent and linear-in-spin tidal heating effects of generic binary components on the waveform phases and amplitudes of quasi-circular orbits. Notably, the mass-weighted spin-independent tidal heating coefficient derived in this work, $\mathcal{H}_0$, is the dissipative analog of the tidal Love number. We constrain the tidal heating coefficients using the public LVK O1-O3 data. Our parameter estimation study includes two separate analyses: the first treats the catalog of binary events as binary black holes (BBH), while the second makes no assumption about the nature of the binary constituents and can therefore be interpreted as constraints for exotic compact objects. In the former case, we combine the posterior distributions of the individual BBH events and obtain a joint constraint of $-13 &lt; \mathcal{H}_0 &lt; 20$ at the $90\%$ credible interval for the BBH population. This translates into a bound on the fraction of the emitted gravitational wave energy lost due to tidal heating (or gained due to radiation enhancement effects) at $|\Delta E_H/\Delta E_{\infty}|\lesssim 3\cdot 10^{-3}$. Our work provides the first robust framework for deriving and measuring tidal heating effects in merging binary systems, demonstrating its potential as a powerful probe of the nature of binary constituents and tests of new physics.</description>

      <title>Solar flare observations with the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland (RNO-G)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The science program of the Radio Neutrino Observatory-Greenland (RNO-G) extends beyond particle astrophysics to include radioglaciology and, as we show herein, solar physics, as well. Impulsive solar flare observations not only permit direct measurements of light curves, spectral content, and polarization on time scales significantly shorter than most extant dedicated solar observatories, but also offer an extremely useful above-surface calibration source, with pointing precision of order tens of arc-minutes. Using the early RNO-G data from 2022-2023, observed flare characteristics are compared to well-established solar observatories. Also, a number of individual flares are used to highlight angular reconstruction and calibration methods. RNO-G observes signal excesses during solar flares reported by the solar-observing Callisto network and in coincidence with about 60% of the brightest excesses recorded by the SWAVES satellite, when the Sun is above the horizon for RNO-G. In these observed flares, there is significant impulsivity in the time-domain. In addition, the solar flares are used to calibrate the RNO-G absolute pointing on the radio signal arrival direction to sub-degree resolution.</description>

      <title>QCD topology and axion properties in an isotropic hot and dense medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the QCD topology and axion properties at finite temperature and chemical potential in the framework of the two-flavor Nambu$-$Jona-Lasinio model. We find that the behaviors of the two lowest cumulants of the QCD topological charge distribution and axion properties are highly sensitive to the critical behavior of the chiral phase transition. In particular, the topological susceptibility and the axion mass follow the response of the chiral condensate to temperature and chemical potential, showing that both quantities decrease monotonically with the increment of temperature and/or chemical potential. However, it is important to note that the normalized fourth cumulant behaves differently depending on the temperature. At low temperatures, it is a non-monotonic function of the chemical potential, while at high temperatures, it monotonically decreases. Additionally, its value invariably approaches the asymptotic value of $b_2^{\text {inst }}=-1/12$, predicted by the dilute instanton gas model. We also observe that with the increase in chemical potential at relatively low temperatures, the axion self-coupling constant exhibits a sharp peak around the critical point, which can even be more than twice its vacuum value. After that, the self-coupling drops sharply to a much lower value than its vacuum value, eventually approaching zero in the high chemical potential limit. The finding that the axion self-coupling constant is significantly enhanced in high-density environments near the chiral phase transition could lead to the creation or enhancement of an axion Bose-Einstein condensate in compact astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>A Parameter-Free Tour of the Binary Black Hole Population</title>

Abstract: The continued operation of the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors is enabling the first detailed measurements of the mass, spin, and redshift distributions of the merging binary black hole population. Our present knowledge of these distributions, however, is based largely on strongly parameteric models; such models typically assume the distributions of binary parameters to be superpositions of power laws, peaks, dips, and breaks, and then measure the parameters governing these "building block" features. Although this approach has yielded great progress in initial characterization of the compact binary population, the strong assumptions entailed leave it often unclear which physical conclusions are driven by observation and which by the specific choice of model. In this paper, we instead model the merger rate of binary black holes as an unknown \textit{autoregressive process} over the space of binary parameters, allowing us to measure the distributions of binary black hole masses, redshifts, component spins, and effective spins with near-complete agnosticism. We find the primary mass spectrum of binary black holes to be doubly-peaked, with a fairly flat continuum that steepens at high masses. We identify signs of unexpected structure in the redshift distribution of binary black holes: a uniform-in-comoving volume merger rate at low redshift followed by a rise in the merger rate beyond redshift $z\approx 0.5$. Finally, we find that the distribution of black hole spin magnitudes is unimodal and concentrated at small but non-zero values, and that spin orientations span a wide range of spin-orbit misalignment angles but are also moderately unlikely to be truly isotropic.</description>

      <title>The Maximum Energy of Shock-Accelerated Cosmic Rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identifying the accelerators of Galactic cosmic ray protons (CRs) with energies up to a few PeV ($10^{15}$ eV) remains a theoretical and observational challenge. Supernova remnants (SNRs) represent strong candidates, as they provide sufficient energetics to reproduce the CR flux observed at Earth. However, it remains unclear whether they can accelerate particles to PeV energies, particularly after the very early stages of their evolution. This uncertainty has prompted searches for other source classes and necessitates comprehensive theoretical modeling of the maximum proton energy, $E_{\rm max}$, accelerated by an arbitrary shock. While analytic estimates of $E_{\rm max}$ have been put forward in the literature, they do not fully account for the complex interplay between particle acceleration, magnetic field amplification, and shock evolution. This paper uses a multi-zone, semi-analytic model of particle acceleration based on kinetic simulations to place constraints on $E_{\rm max}$ for a wide range of astrophysical shocks. In particular, we develop relationships between $E_{\rm max}$, shock velocity, size, and ambient medium. We find that SNRs can only accelerate PeV particles under a select set of circumstances, namely, if the shock velocity exceeds $\sim 10^4$ km s$^{-1}$ and escaping particles drive magnetic field amplification. However, older, slower SNRs may still produce observational signatures of PeV particles due to populations accelerated when the shock was younger. Our results serve as a reference for modelers seeking to quickly produce a self-consistent estimate of the maximum energy accelerated by an arbitrary astrophysical shock.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Background: Gravitational Wave Anisotropy and Continuous Waves from Supermassive Black Hole Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays have found evidence for a low-frequency gravitational wave background (GWB). Assuming the GWB is produced by supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), the next gravitational wave (GW) signals astronomers anticipate are Continuous Waves (CWs) from single SMBHBs and their associated GWB anisotropy. The prospects for detecting CWs and anisotropy are highly dependent on the astrophysics of SMBHB populations. Thus, information from single sources can break degeneracies in astrophysical models and place much more stringent constraints than the GWB alone. We simulate and evolve SMBHB populations, model their GWs, and calculate their anisotropy and detectability. We investigate how varying components of our semi-analytic model, including the galaxy stellar mass function, the SMBH--host galaxy relation ($M_\mathrm{BH}$--$M_\mathrm{bulge}$), and the binary evolution prescription impact the expected detections. The CW occurrence rate is greatest for few total binaries, high SMBHB masses, large scatter in $M_\mathrm{BH}$--$M_\mathrm{bulge}$, and long hardening times. The occurrence rate depends most on the binary evolution parameters, implying that CWs offer a novel avenue to probe binary evolution. The most detectable CW sources are in the lowest frequency bin for a 16.03-year PTA, have masses from $\sim\!\!10^9-10^{10}\mathrm{M}_\odot$, and are $\sim\!\!1$ Gpc away. The level of anisotropy increases with frequency, with the angular power spectrum over multipole modes $\ell$ varying in low-frequency $C_{\ell&gt;0}/C_0$ from $\sim\!\!5\times 10^{-3}$ to $\sim\!\!2\times10^{-1}$, depending on the model; typical values are near current upper limits. Observing this anisotropy would support SMBHB models for the GWB over cosmological models, which tend to be isotropic.</description>

      <title>Winds and Disk Turbulence Exert Equal Torques on Thick Magnetically Arrested Disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11490v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional accretion disk lore is that magnetized turbulence is the principal angular momentum transport process that drives accretion. However, when dynamically important large-scale magnetic fields thread an accretion disk, they can produce mass and angular momentum outflows, known as winds, that also drive accretion. Yet, the relative importance of turbulent and wind-driven angular momentum transport is still poorly understood. To probe this question, we analyze a long-duration ($1.2 \times 10^5 r_{\rm g}/c$) simulation of a rapidly rotating ($a=0.9$) black hole feeding from a thick ($H/r\sim0.3$), adiabatic, magnetically arrested disk (MAD), whose dynamically important magnetic field regulates mass inflow and drives both uncollimated and collimated outflows (i.e., winds and jets, respectively). By carefully disentangling the various angular momentum transport processes within the system, we demonstrate the novel result that disk winds and disk turbulence both extract roughly equal amounts of angular momentum from the disk. We find cumulative angular momentum and mass accretion outflow rates of $\dot{L}\propto r^{0.9}$ and $\dot{M}\propto r^{0.4}$, respectively. This result suggests that understanding both turbulent and laminar stresses is key to understanding the evolution of systems where geometrically thick MADs can occur, such as the hard state of X-ray binaries, low-luminosity active galactic nuclei, some tidal disruption events, and possibly gamma-ray bursts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ a data-driven approach to investigate the rigidity and spatial dependence of the diffusion of cosmic rays in the turbulent magnetic field of the Milky Way. Our analysis combines data sets from the experiments Voyager, AMS-02, CALET, and DAMPE for a range of cosmic ray nuclei from protons to oxygen. Our findings favor models with a smooth behavior in the diffusion coefficient, indicating a good qualitative agreement with the predictions of self-generated magnetic turbulence models. Instead, the current cosmic-ray data do not exhibit a clear preference for or against inhomogeneous diffusion, which is also a prediction of these models. Future progress might be possible by combining cosmic-ray data with gamma rays or radio observations, enabling a more comprehensive exploration.</description>

      <title>Bridging relativistic jets from black hole scales to long-term electromagnetic radiation distances: A moving-mesh general relativistic hydrodynamics code with the HLLC Riemann solver</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relativistic jets accompany the collapse of massive stars, the merger of compact objects, or the accretion of gas in active galactic nuclei. They carry information about the central engine and generate electromagnetic radiation. No self-consistent simulations have been able to follow these jets from their birth at the black hole scale to the Newtonian dissipation phase, making the inference of central engine property through astronomical observations undetermined. We present the general relativistic moving-mesh framework to achieve the continuity of jet simulations throughout space and time. We implement the general relativistic extension for the moving-mesh relativistic hydrodynamic code, JET, and develop a tetrad formulation to utilize the Harten-Lax-van Leer Contact (HLLC) Riemann solver in the general relativistic moving-mesh code. The new framework is able to trace the radial movement of relativistic jets from central regions where strong gravity holds all the way to distances of jet dissipation.</description>

      <title>Electron-capture supernovae in NS+He star systems and the double neutron star systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05103v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron-capture supernovae (EC-SNe) provide an alternative channel for producing neutron stars (NSs). They play an important role in the formation of double NS (DNS) systems and the chemical evolution of galaxies, and contribute to the NS mass distribution in observations. It is generally believed that EC-SNe originate from $e$-captures on $\rm^{24}Mg$ and $\rm^{20}Ne$ in the massive degenerate oxygen-neon (ONe) cores with masses close to the Chandrasekhar limit ($M_{\rm Ch}$). However, the origin of EC-SNe is still uncertain. In this paper, we systematically studied the EC-SNe in NS+He star systems by considering the explosive oxygen burning that may occur in the near-$M_{\rm Ch}$ ONe core. We provided the initial parameter spaces for producing EC-SNe in the initial orbital period $-$ initial He star mass (log$P_{\rm orb}^{\rm i}-M_{\rm He}^{\rm i}$) diagram, and found that both $M_{\rm He}^{\rm i}$ and minimum $P_{\rm orb}^{\rm i}$ for EC-SNe increase with metallicity. Then, by considering NS kicks added to the newborn NS, we investigated the properties of the formed DNS systems after the He star companions collapse into NSs, such as the orbital periods, eccentricities and spin periods of recycle pulsars ($P_{\rm spin}$), etc. The results show that most of the observed DNS systems can be produced by NS kicks of $\lesssim50\rm\,km\,s^{-1}$. In addition, we found that NSs could accrete more material if the residual H envelope on the He star companions is considered, which can form the mildly recycled pulsars ($P_{\rm spin}\sim20\,$ms) in DNS systems.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical binary black hole mergers in globular clusters: mass function and evolution with redshift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hierarchical black hole (BH) mergers are one of the most straightforward mechanisms to produce BHs inside and above the pair-instability mass gap. Here, we investigate the impact of globular cluster (GC) evolution on hierarchical mergers, and we account for the uncertainties related to BH mass pairing functions on the predicted primary BH mass, mass ratio and spin distribution. We find that the evolution of the host GC quenches the hierarchical BH assembly already at the third generation, mainly due to cluster expansion powered by a central BH sub-system. Hierarchical mergers match the primary BH mass distribution from GW events for $m_1 &gt; 50 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, regardless of the assumed BH pairing function. At lower masses, however, different pairing functions lead to dramatically different predictions on the primary BH mass merger rate density. We find that the primary BH mass distribution evolves with redshift, with a larger contribution from mergers with $m_1 \geq 30 \, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ for $z\geq{}2$. Finally, we calculate the mixing fraction of BBHs from GCs and isolated binary systems. Our predictions are very sensitive to the spins, which favor a large fraction ($&gt;0.6$) of BBHs born in GCs, in order to reproduce misaligned spin observations.</description>

Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory relies on an array of photomultiplier tubes to detect Cherenkov light produced by charged particles in the South Pole ice. IceCube data analyses depend on an in-depth characterization of the glacial ice, and on novel approaches in event reconstruction that utilize fast approximations of photoelectron yields. Here, a more accurate model is derived for event reconstruction that better captures our current knowledge of ice optical properties. When evaluated on a Monte Carlo simulation set, the median angular resolution for in-ice particle showers improves by over a factor of three compared to a reconstruction based on a simplified model of the ice. The most substantial improvement is obtained when including effects of birefringence due to the polycrystalline structure of the ice. When evaluated on data classified as particle showers in the high-energy starting events sample, a significantly improved description of the events is observed.</description>

      <title>The role of heating on the formation and the dynamics of YSO jets : I. A parametric study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical arguments as well as observations of young stellar objects (YSO) support the presence of a diversified circumstellar environment. A stellar jet is thought to account for most of the stellar spin down and disk wind outflow for the observed high mass loss rate, thus playing a major role in the launching of powerful jets. RY Tau, for instance, is an extensively studied intermediate mass pre-main sequence star. Observational data reveal a small scale jet called microjet. Nevertheless, it is not clear how the microjet shapes the jet observed at a large scale. The goal is to investigate the spatial stability and structure of the central jet at a large scale by mixing the stellar and disk components. We mix two existing analytical self-similar models for the disk and the stellar winds to build the initial set-ups. Instead of using a polytropic equation of state, we map from the analytical solutions, the heating and cooling sources. The heating exchange rate is controlled by two parameters, its spatial extent and its intensity. The central jet and the surrounding disk are strongly affected by these two parameters. We separate the results in three categories, which show different emissivity, temperature, and velocity maps. We reached this categorization by looking at the opening angle of the stellar solution. For cylindrically, well collimated jets, we have opening angles as low as 10 degrees between 8 and 10 au, and for the wider jets, we can reach 30 degrees with a morphology closer to radial solar winds. Our parametric study shows that the less heated the outflow is, the more collimated it appears. We also show that recollimation shocks appear consistently with UV observations in terms of temperature but not density.</description>

      <title>A short review of the pulsar magnetic inclination angles (II)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pulsar magnetic inclination angle is a key parameter for pulsar physics. It influences the observable properties of pulsars, such as the pulse beam width, braking index, polarisation, and emission geometry. In this study, we give a brief overview of the current state of knowledge and research on this parameter and its implications for the internal physics of pulsars. We use the observed pulsar data of magnetic inclination angle and braking index to constrain the star's number of precession cycles, $\xi$, which reflects the interaction between superfluid neutrons and other particles inside a neutron star\,(NS). We apply the method proposed by Cheng et al. (2019) to analyse the data of PSR J2013+3845 and obtain the constraints for $\xi$ ranging from $2.393\times 10^{5}$ to $1.268\times10^{6}$. And further analysis suggests that the internal magnetic field structure of PSR J2013+3845 is likely dominated by toroidal component. This study may help us understand the process of internal viscous dissipation and the related evolution of the inclination angles of pulsars, and may have important implications for the study of continuous gravitational wave emissions from NS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inclination angle $\chi$ between magnetic and rotation axes of pulsars is an important parameter in pulsar physics. The changes in the inclination angle of a pulsar would lead to observable effects, such as changes in the pulse beam width and braking index of the star. In this paper, we perform a short review on the evolution of pulsar's magnetic inclination angle, as well as the latest research progress. Using an alignment rotator model in vacuum, we investigate the magnetic inclination angle change rates for 12 high-braking index pulsars without glitch, whose timing observations are obtained using the Nanshan 25-m Radio Telescope at Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory. For our purpose, three representative pulsars J0157+6212, J1743-3150 and J1857+0526 are chosen and their rotation and inclination angle evolutions are further investigated. In the future, radio and X-ray polarimetric observations will provide more information about the inclination angles of pulsars, which could help us understand the origin of the variations in $\chi$ of pulsars and shed light on the range of possibilities of pulsar magnetic field configuration. A continuous study of the pulsar inclination angle will provide an important window into additional physical processes at work in the young and highly magnetized pulsars.</description>

      <title>Improved Treatment of Dark Matter Capture in Neutron Stars III: Nucleon and Exotic Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.02525v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the capture of dark matter (DM) in neutron stars via scattering on hadronic targets, including neutrons, protons and hyperons. We extend previous analyses by including momentum dependent form factors, which account for hadronic structure, and incorporating the effect of baryon strong interactions in the dense neutron star interior, rather than modelling the baryons as a free Fermi gas. The combination of these effects suppresses the DM capture rate over a wide mass range, thus increasing the cross section for which the capture rate saturates the geometric limit. In addition, variation in the capture rate associated with the choice of neutron star equation of state is reduced. For proton targets, the use of the interacting baryon approach to obtain the correct Fermi energy is essential for an accurate evaluation of the capture rate in the Pauli-blocked regime. For heavy neutron stars, which are expected to contain exotic matter, we identify cases where DM scattering on hyperons contributes significantly to the total capture rate. Despite smaller neutron star capture rates, compared to existing analyses, we find that the projected DM-nucleon scattering sensitivity greatly exceeds that of nuclear recoil experiments for a wide DM mass range.</description>

      <title>4D Weyl Anomaly and Diversity of the Interior Structure of Quantum Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interior metric of 4D spherically symmetric static black holes by using the semi-classical Einstein equation and find a consistent class of geometries with large curvatures. We approximate the matter fields by conformal fields and consider the contribution of the 4D Weyl anomaly, giving a state-independent constraint. Combining this with an equation of state yields an equation that determines the interior geometry completely. We explore the solution space of the equation in a non-perturbative manner for $\hbar$. First, we find four types of asymptotic behaviors and examine the general features of the solutions. Then, by imposing physical conditions, we obtain approximately a general class of interior geometries: various combinations of dilute and dense structures without a horizon or singularity. This represents the diversity of the interior structure. Finally, we show that the number of possible patterns of such interior geometries corresponds to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.12755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The past 10 years have seen tremendous progress in our capability of testing General Relativity in the strong field regime with black hole observations. 10 years ago, the theory of General Relativity was almost completely unexplored in the strong field regime. Today, we have gravitational wave data of the coalescence of stellar-mass black holes, radio images of the supermassive black holes SgrA$^*$ and M87$^*$, and high-quality X-ray data of stellar-mass black holes in X-ray binaries and supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei. In this manuscript, we will review current efforts to test General Relativity with black hole X-ray data and we will provide a detailed description of the public codes available on ABHModels.</description>

      <title>The relation between the cool-core radius and the host galaxy clusters: thermodynamic properties and cluster mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16297v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of cool-core systems in a sample of four galaxy clusters (RXCJ1504.1-0248, A3112, A4059, and A478) using archival X-ray data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory. Cool cores are frequently observed at the centers of galaxy clusters and are considered to be formed by radiative cooling of the intracluster medium (ICM). Cool cores are characterized by a significant drop in the ICM temperature toward the cluster center. We extract and analyze X-ray spectra of the ICM to measure the radial profiles of the ICM thermodynamic properties including temperature, density, pressure, entropy, and radiative cooling time. We define the cool-core radius as the turnover radius in the ICM temperature profile and investigate the relation between the cool-core radius and the properties of the host galaxy clusters. In our sample, we observe that the radiative cooling time of the ICM at the cool-core radius exceeds 10 Gyr, with RXCJ1504.1-0248 exhibiting a radiative cooling time of $32^{+5}_{-11}$ Gyr at its cool-core radius. These results indicate that not only radiative cooling but also additional mechanisms such as gas sloshing may play an important role in determining the size of cool cores. Additionally, we find that the best-fit relation between the cool-core radius and the cluster mass ($M_{500}$) is consistent with a linear relation. Our findings suggest that cool cores are linked to the evolution of their host galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gravity Effects on Fermionic Dark Matter and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the phenomenological consequences of breaking discrete global symmetries in quantum gravity (QG). We extend a previous scenario where discrete global symmetries are responsible for scalar dark matter (DM) and domain walls (DWs), to the case of fermionic DM, considered as a feebly interacting massive particle, which achieves the correct DM relic density via the freeze-in mechanism. Due to the mixing between DM and the standard model neutrinos, various indirect DM detection methods can be employed to constrain the QG scale, the scale of freeze-in, and the reheating temperature simultaneously. Since such QG symmetry breaking leads to DW annihilation, this may generate the characteristic gravitational wave background, and hence explain the recent observations of the gravitational wave spectrum by pulsar timing arrays. This work therefore highlights a tantalizing possibility of probing the effective scale of QG from observations.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lomb-Scargle Analysis of 22 years of Super-Kamiokande solar $^8$B neutrino data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11258v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram to 22 years data of solar $^{8}$B neutrino fluxes detected by Super-Kamiokande. The primary motivation of this work was to check if the sinusoidal modulation at a frequency of 9.43/year (with a period of 38 days), which we had found to be marginally significant with the first five years of Super-K data, persists, with the accumulated data. We use four different metrics for the calculation of significance. We do not find any evidence for periodicity at the aforementioned frequency or any other frequency with the updated data. Therefore the marginally detected periodicity at 9.43/year with the first five years of data was only a statistical fluctuation.</description>
