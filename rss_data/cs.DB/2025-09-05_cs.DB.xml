      <title>Design and Development of a Web Platform for Blood Donation Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blood donation is a critical component of healthcare, yet locating suitable donors in emergencies often presents significant challenges. This paper presents the design and development of a Blood Donation Web Platform, a web-based system that connects patients, donors, and administrators within a centralized digital space. The platform allows interested donors to register their personal information, including blood group, contact details, and availability. Patients can search for donors based on blood group and location, and the system provides a list of nearby donors who are ready to donate. The platform design was guided by use case, database, class, and sequence diagrams to ensure a well-structured and efficient system architecture. Modern web technologies, including PHP (Laravel framework), HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and MySQL, supported by XAMPP and Visual Studio Code, were employed to implement a dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly platform. By streamlining donor refgistration, blood requests, and communication, the proposed system reduces delays and complexities in emergencies, improving timely accessibility of blood and enhancing overall efficiency in blood donation services.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Text2Cypher with Schema Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05118v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowledge graphs represent complex data using nodes, relationships, and properties. Cypher, a powerful query language for graph databases, enables efficient modeling and querying. Recent advancements in large language models allow translation of natural language questions into Cypher queries - Text2Cypher. A common approach is incorporating database schema into prompts. However, complex schemas can introduce noise, increase hallucinations, and raise computational costs. Schema filtering addresses these challenges by including only relevant schema elements, improving query generation while reducing token costs. This work explores various schema filtering methods for Text2Cypher task and analyzes their impact on token length, performance, and cost. Results show that schema filtering effectively optimizes Text2Cypher, especially for smaller models. Consistent with prior research, we find that larger models benefit less from schema filtering due to their longer context capabilities. However, schema filtering remains valuable for both larger and smaller models in cost reduction.</description>

      <title>Text2Cypher: Data Pruning using Hard Example Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Database query languages such as SQL for relational databases and Cypher for graph databases have been widely adopted. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) enable natural language interactions with databases through models like Text2SQL and Text2Cypher. Fine-tuning these models typically requires large, diverse datasets containing non-trivial examples. However, as dataset size increases, the cost of fine-tuning also rises. This makes smaller, high-quality datasets essential for reducing costs for the same or better performance. In this paper, we propose five hard-example selection techniques for pruning the Text2Cypher dataset, aiming to preserve or improve performance while reducing resource usage. Our results show that these hard-example selection approaches can halve training time and costs with minimal impact on performance, and demonstrates that hard-example selection provides a cost-effective solution.</description>

      <title>GPU Acceleration of SQL Analytics on Compressed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GPUs are uniquely suited to accelerate (SQL) analytics workloads thanks to their massive compute parallelism and High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) -- when datasets fit in the GPU HBM, performance is unparalleled. Unfortunately, GPU HBMs remain typically small when compared with lower-bandwidth CPU main memory. Besides brute-force scaling across many GPUs, current solutions to accelerate queries on large datasets include leveraging data partitioning and loading smaller data batches in GPU HBM, and hybrid execution with a connected device (e.g., CPUs). Unfortunately, these approaches are exposed to the limitations of lower main memory and host-to-device interconnect bandwidths, introduce additional I/O overheads, or incur higher costs. This is a substantial problem when trying to scale adoption of GPUs on larger datasets. Data compression can alleviate this bottleneck, but to avoid paying for costly decompression/decoding, an ideal solution must include computation primitives to operate directly on data in compressed form.
  This is the focus of our paper: a set of new methods for running queries directly on light-weight compressed data using schemes such as Run-Length Encoding (RLE), index encoding, bit-width reductions, and dictionary encoding. Our novelty includes operating on multiple RLE columns without decompression, handling heterogeneous column encodings, and leveraging PyTorch tensor operations for portability across devices. Experimental evaluations show speedups of an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art commercial CPU-only analytics systems, for real-world queries on a production dataset that would not fit into GPU memory uncompressed. This work paves the road for GPU adoption in a much broader set of use cases, and it is complementary to most other scale-out or fallback mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.02548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose KG-ER, a conceptual schema language for knowledge graphs that describes the structure of knowledge graphs independently of their representation (relational databases, property graphs, RDF) while helping to capture the semantics of the information stored in a knowledge graph.</description>
