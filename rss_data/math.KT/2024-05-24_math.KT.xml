      <title>A few computations about the real cycle class map in low dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the surjectivity of the real cycle class map from $I$-cohomology to classical intergral cohomology for some real smooth varieties, in particular surfaces. This might be considered as one of several possible incarnations of real integral Hodge theory.</description>

      <title>Foams with flat connections and algebraic K-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a connection between algebraic K-theory and foam cobordisms, where foams are stratified manifolds with singularities of a prescribed form. We consider $n$-dimensional foams equipped with a flat bundle of finitely-generated projective $R$-modules over each facet of the foam, together with gluing conditions along the subfoam of singular points. In a suitable sense which will become clear, a vertex (or the smallest stratum) of an $n$-dimensional foam replaces an $(n+1)$-simplex with a total ordering of vertices. We show that the first K-theory group of a ring $R$ can be identified with the cobordism group of decorated 1-foams embedded in the plane. A similar relation between the $n$-th algebraic K-theory group of a ring $R$ and the cobordism group of decorated $n$-foams embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is expected for $n&gt;1$. An analogous correspondence is proposed for arbitrary exact categories. Modifying the embedding and other conditions on the foams may lead to new flavors of K-theory groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a homotopy introduced by de Wilde and Lecomte and homological perturbation theory for $A_\infty$-algebras, we give an explicit proof that the universal enveloping algebra $UL$ of a differential graded Lie algebra $L$ is Koszul, via an explicit contracting homotopy from the cobar construction $\Omega CL$ of the Chevalley-Eilenberg chain coalgebra $CL$ of $L$ to $UL$.</description>

      <title>Towards a refinement of the Bloch-Kato conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rost and Voevodsky proved the Bloch-Kato conjecture relating Milnor $k$-theory and Galois cohomology. Their result implies that for a field $F$ containing a primitive $p$th root of unity, the Galois cohomology ring of $F$ with $\mathbb{F}_p$ coefficients is generated by elements of degree 1 as an $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebra. Therefore, for a given Galois extension $K/F$ and an element $\alpha$ in $H^*(\text{Gal}(K/F), \mathbb{F}_p)$ there exits a Galois extension $L/F$ containing $K/F$ such that the inflation of $\alpha$ in $H^*(\text{Gal}(L/F), \mathbb{F}_p)$ belongs to an $\mathbb{F}_p$-subalgebra of $H^*(\text{Gal}(L/F), \mathbb{F}_p)$ generated by $1$-dimensional classes. It is interesting to find relatively small explicit Galois extensions $L/F$ with the above property for a given $\alpha$ in $H^*(\text{Gal}(K/F), \mathbb{F}_p)$ as above. In this paper, we provide some answers to this question for cohomology classes in degree two, thus setting the first step toward refining the Bloch-Kato conjecture. We illustrate this refinement by explicitly computing the cohomology rings of superpythagorean and $p$-rigid fields. Additionally, as a byproduct of our work, we characterize elementary abelian $2$-groups as the only finite $p$-groups whose mod-$p$ cohomology ring is generated by degree-one elements. This provides additional motivation for studying refinements of the Bloch-Kato conjecture and exploring the connections between group cohomology and Galois theory.</description>

      <title>Two new motivic complexes for non-smooth schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These are expanded notes from a talk at the RIMS Workshop, Algebraic Number Theory and Related Topics, December 13th, 2023. We discussed Elmanto-Morrow's motivic complex, the procdh sheafification of the classical motivic complex, and their comparison. The procdh topology and the comparison is joint work with Shuji Saito. The comparison was obtained through joint discussion with Morrow, and its proof relies heavily on the main results of [EM23].</description>

      <title>K-theory and localizing invariants of large categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the so-called continuous $K$-theory for a certain class of "large" stable $\infty$-categories, more precisely, for dualizable presentable categories. For compactly generated categories, the continuous $K$-theory is simply the usual (non-connective) $K$-theory of the full subcategory of compact objects. More generally, we show that any localizing invariant of small stable $\infty$-categories can be uniquely extended to a localizing invariant of dualizable categories.
  We compute the continuous $K$-theory for categories of sheaves on locally compact Hausdorff spaces. Using the special case for sheaves on the real line, we give an alternative proof of the theorem of Kasprowski and Winges \cite{KW19} on the commutation of $K$-theory with infinite products for small stable $\infty$-categories.
  We also study the general theory of dualizable categories. In particular, we give an "explicit" proof of Ramzi's theorem \cite{Ram} on the $\omega_1$-presentability of the category of dualizable categories. Among other things, we prove that dualizability is equivalent to "flatness" in the category of presentable stable categories.</description>
