      <title>Workers as Partners: a Theory of Responsible Firms in Labor Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework analyzing responsible firms (REFs) that prioritize worker welfare alongside profits in labor markets with search frictions. At the micro level, REFs' use of market power varies with labor conditions: they refrain from using it in slack markets but may exercise it in tight markets without harming workers. Our macro analysis shows these firms offer higher wages, creating a distinct high-wage sector. When firms endogenously choose worker bargaining power, there is a trade-off between worker surplus and employment, though this improves with elastic labor supply. While REFs cannot survive with free entry, they can coexist with profit-maximizing firms under limited competition, where their presence forces ordinary firms to raise wages.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Heterogeneous Impact of Economy-Wide Shocks: A Machine Learning Approach Applied to Colombian Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.04570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our paper presents a methodology to study the heterogeneous effects of economy-wide shocks and applies it to the case of the impact of the COVID-19 crisis on exports. This methodology is applicable in scenarios where the pervasive nature of the shock hinders the identification of a control group unaffected by the shock, as well as the ex-ante definition of the intensity of the shock's exposure of each unit. In particular, our study investigates the effectiveness of various Machine Learning (ML) techniques in predicting firms' trade and, by building on recent developments in causal ML, uses these predictions to reconstruct the counterfactual distribution of firms' trade under different COVID-19 scenarios and to study treatment effect heterogeneity. Specifically, we focus on the probability of Colombian firms surviving in the export market under two different scenarios: a COVID-19 setting and a non-COVID-19 counterfactual situation. On average, we find that the COVID-19 shock decreased a firm's probability of surviving in the export market by about 20 percentage points in April 2020. We study the treatment effect heterogeneity by employing a classification analysis that compares the characteristics of the firms on the tails of the estimated distribution of the individual treatment effects.</description>

      <title>Shared Hardships Strengthen Bonds: Negative Shocks, Embeddedness and Employee Retention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jarring events inspiring reflection, known as ``shocks" in the literature, are the motive force in explaining changes in employee embeddedness and retention within the unfolding model of labor turnover. Substantial research effort has examined strategies for insulating valued employees from adverse shocks. However, this paper provides empirical evidence that unambiguously negative shocks can increase employee retention when underlying firm and employee incentives with respect to these shocks are aligned. Using survival analysis on a unique data set of 466,236 communication records and 45,873 employment spells from 21 trucking companies, we show how equipment-related shocks tend to increase the duration of employment. Equipment shocks also generate paradoxically positive sentiments that demonstrate an increase in employees' affective commitment to the firm. Our results highlight the important moderating role aligned incentives have in how shocks ultimately translate into retention. Shared hardships strengthen bonds in employment as in other areas.</description>
