      <title>Water ice in the debris disk around HD 181327</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Debris disks are exoplanetary systems that contain planets, minor bodies (i.e., asteroids, Kuiper belt objects, comets, etc.), and micron-sized debris dust. Since water ice is the most common frozen volatile, it plays an essential role in the formation of planets and minor bodies. Although water ice has been commonly found in Kuiper belt objects and comets in the Solar System, no definitive evidence for water ice in debris disks has been obtained to date. Here, we report the discovery of water ice in the HD 181327 disk using the James Webb Space Telescope Near-Infrared Spectrograph. We detect the solid-state broad absorption feature of water ice at 3 $\mu$m and a distinct Fresnel peak feature at 3.1 $\mu$m, a characteristic of large water-ice particles. This implies the presence of a water-ice reservoir in the HD 181327 exoKuiper belt. Gradients of water-ice features at different stellocentric distances reveal a dynamic process of destroying and replenishing water ice in the disk, with estimated water-ice mass fractions ranging from 0.1% at ~85 au to 14% at ~113 au. It is highly plausible that the icy bodies that release water ice in HD 181327 could be the extra-solar counterparts of some of the Kuiper belt objects in our Solar System, supported by their spectral similarity.</description>

      <title>The atmospheres of rocky exoplanets III. Using atmospheric spectra to constrain surface rock composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The crust composition of rocky exoplanets with a substantial atmosphere can not be observed directly. However, recent developments start to allow the observation and characterisation of their atmospheres. Aims. We aim to establish a link between the observable spectroscopic atmospheric features and the mineralogical crust composition of exoplanets. This allows to constrain the surface composition just by observing transit spectra. Methods. We use a diverse set of total element abundances inspired by various rock compositions, Earth, Venus, and CI chondrite as a basis for our bottom-to-top atmospheric model. We assume thermal and chemical equilibrium between the atmosphere and the planetary surface. Based on the atmospheric models in hydrostatic and chemical equilibrium with the inclusion of element depletion due to cloud formation theoretical transit spectra are calculated. Results. The atmospheric type classification allows constraints on the surface mineralogy especially with respect to sulphur compounds, iron oxides and iron hydroxides, feldspars, silicates and carbon species. Spectral features provide the possibility to differentiate the atmospheric types and thus allow some constraints on the surface composition.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet atmospheres at high spectral resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution spectroscopy (HRS) has grown into one of the main techniques to characterise the atmospheres of extrasolar planets. High spectral resolving power allows for the efficient removal of telluric and host-star contamination. Combined with the large collecting area of ground-based telescopes it enables detailed studies of atmospheric species, temperature structure, atmospheric loss, and global winds and circulation patterns. In this review, the wide range of HRS observation and data-analysis techniques are described and literature results discussed. Key findings include:
  * The highest irradiated planets show a rich spectrum of atomic and ionic species, just like stars.
  * Retrieval analyses of Hot Jupiters and directly imaged Super- Jupiters point to Solar metallicities and chemistry, but observed samples are still heterogeneous and incomplete.
  * There appears to be a clear dichotomy between Hot Jupiters with and without atmospheric inversions, depending on their equilibrium temperature.
  * Some highly irradiated planets exhibit enormous leading and/or trailing tails of helium gas, providing unique insights into planet evolution and atmospheric escape processes.
  * Minor isotopes of carbon and oxygen are now being detected in gas giant planets and brown dwarfs with the interesting potential to shed light on formation pathways.
  A list of potential pitfalls is provided for those new to the field, and synergies with JWST are discussed. HRS has a great future ahead with the advent of the extremely large telescopes, promising to bring temperate rocky exoplanets into view with their increase in HRS detection speed of up to three orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Searching for GEMS: Confirmation of TOI-5573b, a Cool, Saturn-like Planet Orbiting An M-dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the confirmation of TOI-5573b, a Saturn-sized exoplanet on an 8.79-day orbit around an early M-dwarf (3790 K, 0.59 R$\odot$, 0.61 M$\odot$, 12.30 J mag). TOI-5573b has a mass of $112^{+18}_{-19}$ M$\oplus$ (0.35$\pm$0.06 M$\mathrm{Jup}$) and a radius of $9.75\pm0.47$ R$\oplus$ (0.87$\pm$0.04 R$\mathrm{Jup}$), resulting in a density of $0.66^{+0.16}_{-0.13}$ g cm$^{-3}$, akin to that of Saturn. The planet was initially discovered by TESS and confirmed using a combination of 11 transits from four TESS sectors (20, 21, 47 and 74), ground-based photometry from the Red Buttes Observatory, and high-precision radial velocity data from the Habitable-zone Planet Finder (HPF) and NEID spectrographs, achieving a 5$\sigma$ precision on the planet's mass. TOI-5573b is one of the coolest Saturn-like exoplanets discovered around an M-dwarf, with an equilibrium temperature of $528\pm10$ K, making it a valuable target for atmospheric characterization. Saturn-like exoplanets around M-dwarfs likely form through core accretion, with increased disk opacity slowing gas accretion and limiting their mass. The host star's super-solar metallicity supports core accretion, but uncertainties in M-dwarf metallicity estimates complicate definitive conclusions. Compared to other GEMS (Giant Exoplanets around M-dwarf Stars) orbiting metal-rich stars, TOI-5573b aligns with the observed pattern that giant planets preferentially form around M-dwarfs with super-solar metallicity. Further high-resolution spectroscopic observations are needed to explore the role of stellar metallicity in shaping the formation and properties of giant exoplanets like TOI-5573b.</description>

      <title>The Moon as a possible source for Earth's co-orbital bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing number of Earth's co-orbital bodies being discovered. At least five of them are known to be temporarily in quasi-satellite orbits. One of those, 469219 Kamo'oalewa, was identified as possibly having the same composition as the Moon. We explore the conditions necessary for lunar ejecta to evolve into Earth's co-orbital bodies, with particular attention to quasi-satellite orbits. We investigate the parameter space of ejection velocity and geographic launch location across the lunar surface. The study employs numerical simulations of the four-body problem (Sun-Earth-Moon-particle) with automated classification for co-orbital states. Particles are ejected from randomly distributed points covering the lunar surface with velocities from 1.0 to 2.6 times the Moon's escape velocity. Trajectories co-orbital to Earth are found to be common, with approximately 6.68% of particles evolving into Earth co-orbital motion and 1.92% exhibiting quasi-satellite behavior. We identify an optimal ejection velocity (1.2v$_{esc}$) for quasi-satellite production, yielding over 6% conversion efficiency. Successful ejections show a strong preference for the equatorial regions of the trailing hemisphere. Collisions with Earth or Moon occur for only 4% of the sample. Extended integrations reveal long-lived configurations, including tadpole orbits persisting for 10,000 years and horseshoe co-orbitals maintaining stability for 5,000 years. Our results strengthen the plausibility of lunar origin for Earth's co-orbital bodies, including quasi-satellites like Kamo'oalewa and 2024PT5. We identify both "prompt" and "delayed" co-orbital formation mechanisms, with a steady-state production regime that could explain the presence of lunar-derived objects in Earth's co-orbital regions despite infrequent major lunar impacts.</description>

      <title>TASSIE: a TASmanian Search for Inclined Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first results of a pilot 'TASmanian Search for Inclined Exoplanets' (TASSIE) program. This includes observations and analysis of five short-period exoplanet candidates using data from TESS and the Harlingten 50 cm telescope at the Greenhill Observatory. We describe the instrumentation, data reduction process and target selection strategy for the program. We utilise archival multi-band photometry and new mid-resolution spectra to determine stellar parameters for five TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs). We then perform a statistical validation to rule out false positives, before moving on to a joint transit analysis of the remaining systems. We find that TOI3070, TOI3124 and TOI4266 are likely non-planetary signals, which we attribute to either short-period binary stars on grazing orbits or stellar spots. For TOI3097, we find a hot sub-Jovian to Jovian size planet ($R_{3097Ab}$ = 0.89 $\pm$ 0.04 $R_{J}$, $P_{3097Ab}$ = 1.368386 $\pm$ 0.000006 days) orbiting the primary K dwarf star in a wide binary system. This system shows indications of low metallicity ([Fe/H] $\approx$ -1), making it an unlikely host for a giant planet. For TOI3163, we find a Jovian-size companion on a circular orbit around a late F dwarf star, with $R_{3163b}$ = 1.42 $\pm$ 0.05 $R_{J}$ and $P_{3163b}$ = 3.074966 $\pm$ 0.000022 days. In future, we aim to validate further southern giant planet candidates with a particular focus on those residing in the sub-Jovian desert/savanna.</description>

      <title>Fully analytical propagator for lunar satellite orbits in closed form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a fully analytical propagator for the orbits of lunar artificial satellites in a lunar gravity and third-body model sufficiently precise for a wide range of practical applications. The gravity model includes the twelve most important lunar gravity harmonics as well as the Earth's quadrupole tidal terms with a precise representation of the Earth's lunicentric ephemeris, and it gives an accuracy comparable to the way more extended semi-analytical propagator SELENA [6] for satellite orbits at altitudes from 300 to 3000 km. Extra terms of a more complete gravity model are straightforward to include using the formulas of the presently discussed analytical theory. The theory is based on deriving an approximate analytical solution of the secular part of the equations of motion using a Hamiltonian normal form in closed form. In total, we have two types of element transformations: from osculating to mean elements (as in [6]), and from mean to proper elements. The solution of the problem in proper elements is trivial, and, through the inverses of the above transformations, it allows to recover the position and velocity of a satellite analytically at any time t given initial conditions of the osculating elements at time $t_0$ without any intermediate numerical propagation. The propagator model is valid in time spans of several decades, and for every initial condition leading to no-fall on the Moon's surface, except for identified thin zones around a set of secular resonances corresponding to commensurabilities between the satellite's secular frequencies and the secular frequencies of the lunicentric Earth's orbit. Open software python and symbolic routines implementing our propagator are provided in the repository [14]. Precision tests with respect to fully numerical orbital propagation in Cartesian coordinates are reported.</description>

      <title>An Analytical Model of Wavelength-dependent Opposition Surge in Emittance and Re ectance Spectroscopy of Airless Rocky Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical frameworks for reflection and emission spectroscopy of exoplanet surfaces are becoming increasingly important for the characterization of rocky exoplanets, especially with the rapid growth of the detected exoplanet population and observational capabilities. The Hapke theory of reflectance and emittance spectroscopy has been widely adopted in the exoplanet community, yet a key physical effect - the opposition surge enhancement at small phase angles - remains largely neglected. This phenomenon, driven by shadow hiding and coherent backscattering, introduces a significant brightening that depends on wavelength, particle size, and surface morphology. In this paper, I propose an alternative formulation for opposition surge modeling, ensuring a smooth-to-sharp transition at small phase angles, dictated by wavelength-dependent scattering properties. I evaluate the impact of opposition surge on phase curves and surface spectra, comparing a family of models with increasing simplifications, ranging from a full wavelength-dependent opposition effect to its complete omission. My results indicate that neglecting opposition effects can introduce systematic deviations in retrieved albedos, spectral features, and phase curves, with errors reaching up to 20%-30% in certain spectral bands. Upcoming JWST observations will probe phase angles below ~10{\deg} for rocky exoplanets around M dwarfs; thus, accounting for opposition effects is crucial for accurate surface characterization. Proper treatment of this effect will lead to improved retrievals of surface albedo, mineralogical composition, and roughness properties. This study establishes a physically consistent framework for exoplanet phase-curve modeling and provides a foundation for future retrieval algorithms aimed at interpreting exoplanet surfaces.</description>

      <title>Asteroid sizes determined with thermophysical model and stellar occultations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The sizes of many asteroids, especially slowly rotating, low-amplitude targets, remain poorly constrained due to selection effects. These biases limit the availability of high-quality data, leaving size estimates reliant on spherical shape assumptions. Such approximations introduce significant uncertainties propagating, e.g. into density determinations or thermophysical and compositional studies, affecting our understanding of asteroid properties. Aims. This work targets poorly studied main-belt asteroids, most of which lacked shape models. Using only high-quality dense light curves, thermal IR observations (incl. WISE), and stellar occultations, we aimed to produce reliable shape models and scale them via two independent techniques, allowing size comparison. We conducted two campaigns to obtain dense photometric light curves and to acquire multi-chord stellar occultations. Methods. Shape and spin models were reconstructed using lightcurve inversion. Sizes were determined by (1) thermophysical modeling with the Convex Inversion Thermophysical Model (CITPM), optimizing spin and shape models to visible lightcurve and IR data, and (2) scaling shape models with stellar occultations. Results. We obtained precise sizes and shape models for 15 asteroids. CITPM- and occultation-derived sizes agree within 5% in most cases, demonstrating the modeling's reliability. Larger discrepancies usually stem from incomplete occultation chord coverage. The study also gives insights into surface properties incl. albedo, roughness and thermal inertia. Conclusions. Using high-quality data and an advanced TPM integrating thermal and visible data with shape adjustment enabled precise size estimates comparable to those from multi-chord stellar occultations. We resolved major inconsistencies in previous size estimates, providing solid input for future studies on asteroid densities and surfaces.</description>

      <title>Shape index of Yarkovsky effect on irregularly shaped asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Yarkovsky effect on real asteroids is complicated to calculate either by analytical or numerical methods, since they are generally irregular in shape. We propose an index to properly characterise the shape of any asteroid, through which the Yarkovsky effect can be easily calculated without the heavy computations of surface temperatures. By analysing the energy absorbed and then emitted by a surface element, we find that the effective working power produced by the radiation recoil force on this surface element and its contribution to the Yarkovsky effect are both proportional to the double projected area of the surface element. The normalized total projected area over the asteroid's surface is defined as the shape index ($S_1$). We model the Yarkovsky effects of different asteroids using multiphysics software COMSOL, and take the rate of semi-major axis drift ($d a/d t$) obtained in these numerical simulations as the measurement of the strength of Yarkovsky effect. A linear relationship between $d a/d t$ and $S_1$ is confirmed. The shape index is then improved by taking the shadowing effect into account. A much better linear relationship is found between $d a/d t$ and the improved index $S_2$. This linear relationship is obeyed very well in a wide range of thermal parameter values. The influences of scattering and self-heating effects on the linear relationship are found ignorable. Using the shape index and the linear relation obtained in this paper, the rate of semi-major axis migration due to the Yarkovsky effect can be calculated accurately. Compared with the full numerical modeling of surface temperature and then the thermal radiation on an irregularly shaped asteroid, it is very easy to compute the shape index, which brings great convenience to the estimation of Yarkovsky effect.</description>

      <title>The Blinking Crystallinity of Europa: A Competition between Irradiation and Thermal Alteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface of Europa experiences a competition between thermally-induced crystallization and radiation-induced amorphization processes, leading to changes of its crystalline structure. The non-linear crystallization and temperature-dependent amorphization rate, incorporating ions, electrons and UV doses, are integrated into our multiphysics surface model (MSM) LunaIcy, enabling simulations of these coupled processes on icy moons.
  Thirty simulations spanning 100 000 years, covering the full ranges of albedo and latitude values on Europa, explore the competition between crystallization and irradiation. This is the first modeling of depth-dependent crystallinity profiles on icy moons. The results of our simulations are coherent with existing spectroscopic studies of Europa, both methods showing a primarily amorphous phase at the surface, followed by a crystalline phase after the first millimeter depth. Our method provides quantitative insights into how various parameters found on Europa can influence the subsurface crystallinity profiles.
  Interpolating upon our simulations, we have generated a crystallinity map of Europa showing, within the top millimeter, highly crystalline ice near the equator, amorphous ice at the poles, and a mix of the two at mid-latitudes. Regions/depths with balanced competition between crystallization and amorphization rates are of high interest due to their periodic fluctuations in crystalline fraction. Our interpolated map reveals periodic variations, with seasonal amplitudes reaching up to 35% of crystalline fraction. These variations could be detected through spectroscopy, and we propose a plan to observe them in forthcoming missions.</description>

      <title>The vertical structure of debris discs and the role of disc gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Debris discs provide valuable insights into the formation and evolution of exoplanetary systems. Their structures are commonly attributed to planetary perturbations, serving as probes of as-yet-undetected planets. However, most studies of planet-debris disc interactions ignore the disc's gravity, treating it as a collection of massless planetesimals. Here, using an analytical model, we investigate how the vertical structure of a back-reacting debris disc responds to secular perturbations from an inner, inclined planet. Considering the disc's axisymmetric potential, we identify two dynamical regimes: planet-dominated and disc-dominated, which may coexist, separated by a secular-inclination resonance. In the planet-dominated regime ($M_d/m_p\ll1$), we recover the classical result: a transient warp propagates outward until the disc settles into a box-like structure centered around the planetary orbit's initial inclination $I_p(0)$, with a distance-independent aspect ratio $\mathcal{H}(R)\approx I_p(0)$. In contrast, in the disc-dominated regime ($M_d/m_p\gtrsim1$), the disc exhibits dynamical rigidity, remaining thin and misaligned, with significantly suppressed inclinations and a sharply declining aspect ratio, $\mathcal{H}(R)\propto I_p(0)R^{-7/2}$. In the intermediate regime ($M_d/m_p\lesssim1$), the system exhibits a secular-inclination resonance, leading to long-lived, warp-like structures and a bimodal inclination distribution, containing both dynamically hot and cold populations. We provide analytic formulae describing these effects as a function of system parameters. We also find that the vertical density profile is intrinsically non-Gaussian and recommend fitting observations with non-zero slopes of $\mathcal{H}(R)$. Our results may be used to infer planetary parameters and debris disc masses based on observed warps and scale heights, as demonstrated for HD110058 and $\beta$ Pic.</description>

      <title>Light Echoes of Time-resolved Flares and Application to Kepler Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light echoes of stellar flares provide an intriguing option for exploring protoplanetary disks in young stellar systems. Previous work on light echoes of circumstellar disks made use of delta-function flares for modeling. We present a new model that incorporates echoes produced by extended, time-resolved flares. We then test this model on known disk-bearing stars with Kepler K2 data by estimating disk parameters from possible echo signals. We focus on two stars; the first appears to be a good candidate for use of this echo model, which predicts disk parameters that are consistent with known values. The second star turns out to be more problematic as a result of high brightness variability in its post-peak lightcurve. These two cases show both the promise and limitations of light echoes as a tool for exploring protoplanetary disks in the time domain</description>

      <title>Architecture of Tianyu Software: Relative Photometry as a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tianyu telescope, an one-meter robotic optical survey instrument to be constructed in Lenghu, Qinghai, China, is designed for detecting transiting exoplanets, variable stars and transients. It requires a highly automated, optimally distributed, easily extendable, and highly flexible software to enable the data processing for the raw data at rates exceeding 500MB/s. In this work, we introduce the architecture of the Tianyu pipeline and use relative photometry as a case to demonstrate its high scalability and efficiency. This pipeline is tested on the data collected from Muguang observatory and Xinglong observatory. The pipeline demonstrates high scalability, with most processing stages increasing in throughput as the number of consumers grows. Compared to a single consumer, the median throughput of image calibration, alignment, and flux extraction increases by 41%, 257%, and 107% respectively when using 5 consumers, while image stacking exhibits limited scalability due to I/O constraints. In our tests, the pipeline was able to detect two transiting sources. Besides, the pipeline captures variability in the light curves of nine known and two previously unknown variable sources in the testing data. Meanwhile, the differential photometric precision of the light curves is near the theoretical limitation. These results indicate that this pipeline is suitable for detecting transiting exoplanets and variable stars. This work builds the fundation for further development of Tianyu software.

      <title>The high-energy protons of the ground level enhancement (GLE74) event on 11 May 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High energy solar protons were observed by particle detectors aboard spacecraft in near-Earth orbit on May 11, 2024 and produced the 74th ground level enhancement (GLE74) event registered by ground-based neutron monitors. This study involves a detailed reconstruction of the neutron monitor response, along with the identification of the solar eruption responsible for the emission of the primary particles, utilizing both in situ and remote-sensing. Observations spanning proton energies from a few MeV to around 1.64 GeV, collected from the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO-A), and neutron monitors, were integrated with records of the associated solar soft X-ray flare, coronal mass ejection, and radio bursts, to identify the solar origin of the GLE74. Additionally, a time-shift analysis was conducted to link the detected particles to their solar sources. Finally, a comparison of GLE74 to previous ones is carried out. GLE74 reached a maximum particle rigidity of at least 2.4 GV and was associated with a series of type III, type II, and type IV radio bursts. The release time of the primary solar energetic particles (SEPs) with an energy of 500 MeV was estimated to be around 01:21 UT. A significant SEP flux was observed from the anti-Sun direction with a relatively broad angular distribution, rather than a narrow, beam-like pattern, particularly during the main phase at the particle peak flux. Comparisons with previous GLEs suggest that GLE74 was a typical event in terms of solar eruption dynamics.</description>

      <title>Formation and Early Evolution of Protoplanetary Disks under Nonuniform Cosmic-Ray Ionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Angular momentum transport by magnetic fields is important for formation and evolution of protoplanetary disks. The effects of magnetic fields are suppressed due to non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects such as ambipolar diffusion and Ohmic dissipation, which depend on the degree of ionization. Cosmic rays (CRs) are the primary source of ionization in star-forming clouds, and their distribution is nonuniform as it is affected by gas density and magnetic fields. Therefore, CRs, magnetic fields, and gas interact with each other. In this work, we develop a new fully implicit cosmic ray transport module in Athena++ and perform three-dimensional simulations of disk formation from collapse of molecular cloud cores. Since CRs are strongly attenuated in the dense gas at the disk scale, distribution of magnetic fields is considerably altered compared to conventional models assuming a uniform ionization rate. While the total magnetic fluxes accreted onto the disks remain similar as the gas outside the disks remain sufficiently ionized and well coupled, the magnetic fields in the disks are less twisted due to the stronger non-ideal MHD effects. As a consequence, magnetic angular momentum transport is strongly suppressed at the disk scale, resulting in more gravitationally unstable disks with more prominent spiral arms. Our simulations demonstrate influence of non-uniform ionization resulting from CR transport and attenuation on the disk formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Circumplanetary Disks are Rare around Planets at Large Orbital Radii: A Parameter Survey of Flow Morphology around Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the formation and structure of circumplanetary disks (CPDs) varies with planet mass and protoplanetary disk aspect ratio. Using static mesh refinement and a near-isothermal equation of state, we perform a small parameter survey of hydrodynamic simulations with parameters appropriate for disk-embedded protoplanets at moderate to large orbital radii. We find that CPD formation occurs along a continuum, with ``diskiness'' increasing smoothly with planetary mass and decreasing disk aspect ratio. As expected from disk hydrostatic equilibrium arguments, the transition from envelope-dominated to disk-dominated structures is determined to first order by the ratio of the planetary Hill sphere radius to the disk scale height, but planets need to be significantly super-thermal to host classical rotationally supported CPDs. The circularization radius of inflowing gas (as a fraction of the Hill sphere radius) shows an approximately quadratic power-law scaling with the ratio of planetary mass to the thermal mass. Compared to more physically complete radiation hydrodynamic simulations, our runs almost maximize the possibility for classical CPD formation, and hence define a plausible necessary condition for CPDs. The low abundance of detected CPDs in disks where planetary companions are inferred from substructure data may be due to a combination of the large scale height of the protoplanetary disk, and a low frequency of sufficiently massive protoplanets. Unless their CPDs cool below the local protoplanetary disk temperature, most of the wide-orbit giant planet population will be embedded in quasi-spherical envelopes that are hard to detect. Disks, and satellite systems, are more likely to form around smaller orbital separation planets.</description>

      <title>The bolometric Bond albedo and energy balance of Uranus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a newly developed `holistic' atmospheric model of the aerosol structure in Uranus's atmosphere, based upon observations made by HST/STIS, Gemini/NIFS and IRTF/SpeX from 2000 -- 2009, we make a new estimate the bolometric Bond albedo of Uranus during this time of $A^* = 0.338 \pm 0.011$, with a phase integral of $q^* = 1.36 \pm 0.03$. Then, using a simple seasonal model, developed to be consistent with the disc-integrated blue and green magnitude data from the Lowell Observatory from 1950 to 2016, we model how Uranus's reflectivity and heat budget vary during its orbit and determine new orbital-mean average values for the bolometric Bond albedo of $\overline{A^*} = 0.349 \pm 0.016$ and for the absorbed solar flux of $\overline{P_\mathrm{in}}=0.604 \pm 0.027$ W m$^{-2}$. Assuming the outgoing thermal flux to be $\overline{P_\mathrm{out}}=0.693 \pm 0.013$ W m$^{-2}$, as previously determined from Voyager 2 observations, we arrive at a new estimate of Uranus's average heat flux budget of $P_\mathrm{out}/P_\mathrm{in} = 1.15 \pm 0.06$, finding considerable variation with time due to Uranus's significant orbital eccentricity of 0.046. This leads the flux budget to vary from $P_\mathrm{out}/P_\mathrm{in} = 1.03$ near perihelion, to 1.24 near aphelion. We conclude that although $P_\mathrm{out}/P_\mathrm{in}$ is considerably smaller than for the other giant planets, Uranus is not in thermal equilibrium with the Sun.</description>

      <title>Origin of the Moon's Earth-like isotopic composition from giant impact on a differential rotating proto-Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: According to the giant impact theory, the Moon formed by accreting the circum-terrestrial debris disk produced by Theia colliding with the proto-Earth. The giant impact theory can explain most of the properties of the Earth-Moon system, however, simulations of giant impact between a planetary embryo and the growing proto-Earth indicate that the materials in the circum-terrestrial debris disk produced by the impact originate mainly from the impactor. Thus, the giant impact theory has difficulty explaining the Moon's Earth-like isotopic compositions. More materials from the proto-Earth could be delivered to the circum-terrestrial debris disk when a slightly sub-Mars-sized body collides with a fast rotating planet of rigid rotation but the resulting angular momentum is too large compared with that of the current Earth-Moon system. Since planetesimals accreted by the proto-Earth hit the surface of the proto-Earth, enhancing the rotation rate of the surface of the proto-Earth. The surface's fast rotation rate relative to the slow rotation rate of the inner region of the proto-Earth leads to transfer of angular momentum from surface to inner, resulting in the differential rotation. Here, we show that the giant impact of a sub-Mars-sized body on a differential rotating proto-Earth with a fast rotating outer region and a relative slow rotating inner region could result in a circum-terrestrial debris disk with materials predominately from the proto-Earth without violating the angular momentum constraint. The theory proposed here may provide a viable way of explaining the similarity in the isotopic compositions of the Earth and Moon.</description>
