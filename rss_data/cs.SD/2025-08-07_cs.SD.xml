      <title>Toward Low-Latency End-to-End Voice Agents for Telecommunications Using Streaming ASR, Quantized LLMs, and Real-Time TTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a low-latency telecom AI voice agent pipeline for real-time, interactive telecommunications use, enabling advanced voice AI for call center automation, intelligent IVR (Interactive Voice Response), and AI-driven customer support. The solution is built for telecom, combining four specialized models by NetoAI: TSLAM, a 4-bit quantized Telecom-Specific Large Language Model (LLM); T-VEC, a Telecom-Specific Embedding Model; TTE, a Telecom-Specific Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model; and T-Synth, a Telecom-Specific Text-to-Speech (TTS) model. These models enable highly responsive, domain-adapted voice AI agents supporting knowledge-grounded spoken interactions with low latency. The pipeline integrates streaming ASR (TTE), conversational intelligence (TSLAM), retrieval augmented generation (RAG) over telecom documents, and real-time TTS (T-Synth), setting a new benchmark for telecom voice assistants. To evaluate the system, we built a dataset of 500 human-recorded telecom questions from RFCs, simulating real telecom agent queries. This framework allows analysis of latency, domain relevance, and real-time performance across the stack. Results show that TSLAM, TTE, and T-Synth deliver real-time factors (RTF) below 1.0, supporting enterprise, low-latency telecom deployments. These AI agents -- powered by TSLAM, TTE, and T-Synth -- provide a foundation for next-generation telecom AI, enabling automated customer support, diagnostics, and more.</description>

      <title>Wearable Music2Emotion : Assessing Emotions Induced by AI-Generated Music through Portable EEG-fNIRS Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emotions critically influence mental health, driving interest in music-based affective computing via neurophysiological signals with Brain-computer Interface techniques. While prior studies leverage music's accessibility for emotion induction, three key limitations persist: \textbf{(1) Stimulus Constraints}: Music stimuli are confined to small corpora due to copyright and curation costs, with selection biases from heuristic emotion-music mappings that ignore individual affective profiles. \textbf{(2) Modality Specificity}: Overreliance on unimodal neural data (e.g., EEG) ignores complementary insights from cross-modal signal fusion.\textbf{ (3) Portability Limitation}: Cumbersome setups (e.g., 64+ channel gel-based EEG caps) hinder real-world applicability due to procedural complexity and portability barriers. To address these limitations, we propose MEEtBrain, a portable and multimodal framework for emotion analysis (valence/arousal), integrating AI-generated music stimuli with synchronized EEG-fNIRS acquisition via a wireless headband. By MEEtBrain, the music stimuli can be automatically generated by AI on a large scale, eliminating subjective selection biases while ensuring music diversity. We use our developed portable device that is designed in a lightweight headband-style and uses dry electrodes, to simultaneously collect EEG and fNIRS recordings. A 14-hour dataset from 20 participants was collected in the first recruitment to validate the framework's efficacy, with AI-generated music eliciting target emotions (valence/arousal). We are actively expanding our multimodal dataset (44 participants in the latest dataset) and make it publicly available to promote further research and practical applications. \textbf{The dataset is available at https://zju-bmi-lab.github.io/ZBra.</description>

      <title>Towards Hallucination-Free Music: A Reinforcement Learning Preference Optimization Framework for Reliable Song Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in audio-based generative language models have accelerated AI-driven lyric-to-song generation. However, these models frequently suffer from content hallucination, producing outputs misaligned with the input lyrics and undermining musical coherence. Current supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches, limited by passive label-fitting, exhibit constrained self-improvement and poor hallucination mitigation. To address this core challenge, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework leveraging preference optimization for hallucination control. Our key contributions include: (1) Developing a robust hallucination preference dataset constructed via phoneme error rate (PER) computation and rule-based filtering to capture alignment with human expectations; (2) Implementing and evaluating three distinct preference optimization strategies within the RL framework: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). DPO operates off-policy to enhance positive token likelihood, achieving a significant 7.4% PER reduction. PPO and GRPO employ an on-policy approach, training a PER-based reward model to iteratively optimize sequences via reward maximization and KL-regularization, yielding PER reductions of 4.9% and 4.7%, respectively. Comprehensive objective and subjective evaluations confirm that our methods effectively suppress hallucinations while preserving musical quality. Crucially, this work presents a systematic, RL-based solution to hallucination control in lyric-to-song generation. The framework's transferability also unlocks potential for music style adherence and musicality enhancement, opening new avenues for future generative song research.</description>

      <title>SpectroStream: A Versatile Neural Codec for General Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose SpectroStream, a full-band multi-channel neural audio codec. Successor to the well-established SoundStream, SpectroStream extends its capability beyond 24 kHz monophonic audio and enables high-quality reconstruction of 48 kHz stereo music at bit rates of 4--16 kbps. This is accomplished with a new neural architecture that leverages audio representation in the time-frequency domain, which leads to better audio quality especially at higher sample rate. The model also uses a delayed-fusion strategy to handle multi-channel audio, which is crucial in balancing per-channel acoustic quality and cross-channel phase consistency.</description>

      <title>Estimating Musical Surprisal from Audio in Autoregressive Diffusion Model Noise Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the information content (IC) of predictions from a Generative Infinite-Vocabulary Transformer (GIVT) has been used to model musical expectancy and surprisal in audio. We investigate the effectiveness of such modelling using IC calculated with autoregressive diffusion models (ADMs). We empirically show that IC estimates of models based on two different diffusion ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describe diverse data better, in terms of negative log-likelihood, than a GIVT. We evaluate diffusion model IC's effectiveness in capturing surprisal aspects by examining two tasks: (1) capturing monophonic pitch surprisal, and (2) detecting segment boundaries in multi-track audio. In both tasks, the diffusion models match or exceed the performance of a GIVT. We hypothesize that the surprisal estimated at different diffusion process noise levels corresponds to the surprisal of music and audio features present at different audio granularities. Testing our hypothesis, we find that, for appropriate noise levels, the studied musical surprisal tasks' results improve. Code is provided on github.com/SonyCSLParis/audioic.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Pipeline for Enabling Non-Verbal Speech Generation and Understanding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human spoken communication involves not only lexical content but also non-verbal vocalizations (NVs) such as laughter, sighs, and coughs, which convey emotions, intentions, and social signals. However, most existing speech systems focus solely on verbal content and lack the ability to understand and generate such non-verbal cues, reducing the emotional intelligence and communicative richness of spoken interfaces. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{NonVerbalSpeech-38K}$, a large and diverse dataset for non-verbal speech generation and understanding, collected from real-world media and annotated using an automatic pipeline. The dataset contains 38,718 samples (about 131 hours) with 10 categories of non-verbal cues, such as laughter, sniff, and throat clearing. We further validate the dataset by fine-tuning state-of-the-art models, including F5-TTS and Qwen2-Audio, demonstrating its effectiveness in non-verbal speech generation and understanding tasks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We propose a practical pipeline for building natural and diverse non-verbal speech datasets; (2) We release a large-scale dataset to advance research on non-verbal speech generation and understanding; (3) We validate the dataset's effectiveness by demonstrating improvements in both non-verbal speech synthesis and captioning, thereby facilitating richer human-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>SPGISpeech 2.0: Transcribed multi-speaker financial audio for speaker-tagged transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce SPGISpeech 2.0, a dataset suitable for speaker-tagged transcription in the financial domain. SPGISpeech 2.0 improves the diversity of applicable modeling tasks while maintaining the core characteristic of the original SPGISpeech dataset: audio snippets and their corresponding fully formatted text transcriptions, usable for end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR). SPGISpeech 2.0 consists of 3,780 additional hours of professionally transcribed earnings calls. Furthermore, the dataset contains call and speaker information for each audio snippet facilitating multi-talker ASR. We validate the utility of SPGISpeech 2.0 through improvements in speaker-tagged ASR performance of popular speech recognition models after fine-tuning on SPGISpeech 2.0. Released free for non-commercial use, we expect SPGISpeech 2.0 to foster advancements in speech recognition technologies and inspire a wide range of research applications.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Dialogue Annotation with Speaker Characteristics Leveraging a Frozen LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In dialogue transcription pipelines, Large Language Models (LLMs) are frequently employed in post-processing to improve grammar, punctuation, and readability. We explore a complementary post-processing step: enriching transcribed dialogues by adding metadata tags for speaker characteristics such as age, gender, and emotion. Some of the tags are global to the entire dialogue, while some are time-variant. Our approach couples frozen audio foundation models, such as Whisper or WavLM, with a frozen LLAMA language model to infer these speaker attributes, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning of either model. Using lightweight, efficient connectors to bridge audio and language representations, we achieve competitive performance on speaker profiling tasks while preserving modularity and speed. Additionally, we demonstrate that a frozen LLAMA model can compare x-vectors directly, achieving an Equal Error Rate of 8.8% in some scenarios.</description>

      <title>Pitch Accent Detection improves Pretrained Automatic Speech Recognition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems that use semi-supervised speech representations can be boosted by a complimentary pitch accent detection module, by introducing a joint ASR and pitch accent detection model. The pitch accent detection component of our model achieves a significant improvement on the state-of-the-art for the task, closing the gap in F1-score by 41%. Additionally, the ASR performance in joint training decreases WER by 28.3% on LibriSpeech, under limited resource fine-tuning. With these results, we show the importance of extending pretrained speech models to retain or re-learn important prosodic cues such as pitch accent.</description>

      <title>Keyword Spotting with Hyper-Matched Filters for Small Footprint Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-vocabulary keyword spotting (KWS) refers to the task of detecting words or terms within speech recordings, regardless of whether they were included in the training data. This paper introduces an open-vocabulary keyword spotting model with state-of-the-art detection accuracy for small-footprint devices. The model is composed of a speech encoder, a target keyword encoder, and a detection network. The speech encoder is either a tiny Whisper or a tiny Conformer. The target keyword encoder is implemented as a hyper-network that takes the desired keyword as a character string and generates a unique set of weights for a convolutional layer, which can be considered as a keyword-specific matched filter. The detection network uses the matched-filter weights to perform a keyword-specific convolution, which guides the cross-attention mechanism of a Perceiver module in determining whether the target term appears in the recording. The results indicate that our system achieves state-of-the-art detection performance and generalizes effectively to out-of-domain conditions, including second-language (L2) speech. Notably, our smallest model, with just 4.2 million parameters, matches or outperforms models that are several times larger, demonstrating both efficiency and robustness.</description>

      <title>RAP: Real-time Audio-driven Portrait Animation with Video Diffusion Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-driven portrait animation aims to synthesize realistic and natural talking head videos from an input audio signal and a single reference image. While existing methods achieve high-quality results by leveraging high-dimensional intermediate representations and explicitly modeling motion dynamics, their computational complexity renders them unsuitable for real-time deployment. Real-time inference imposes stringent latency and memory constraints, often necessitating the use of highly compressed latent representations. However, operating in such compact spaces hinders the preservation of fine-grained spatiotemporal details, thereby complicating audio-visual synchronization RAP (Real-time Audio-driven Portrait animation), a unified framework for generating high-quality talking portraits under real-time constraints. Specifically, RAP introduces a hybrid attention mechanism for fine-grained audio control, and a static-dynamic training-inference paradigm that avoids explicit motion supervision. Through these techniques, RAP achieves precise audio-driven control, mitigates long-term temporal drift, and maintains high visual fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAP achieves state-of-the-art performance while operating under real-time constraints.</description>

      <title>From Detection to Correction: Backdoor-Resilient Face Recognition via Vision-Language Trigger Detection and Noise-Based Neutralization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biometric systems, such as face recognition systems powered by deep neural networks (DNNs), rely on large and highly sensitive datasets. Backdoor attacks can subvert these systems by manipulating the training process. By inserting a small trigger, such as a sticker, make-up, or patterned mask, into a few training images, an adversary can later present the same trigger during authentication to be falsely recognized as another individual, thereby gaining unauthorized access. Existing defense mechanisms against backdoor attacks still face challenges in precisely identifying and mitigating poisoned images without compromising data utility, which undermines the overall reliability of the system. We propose a novel and generalizable approach, TrueBiometric: Trustworthy Biometrics, which accurately detects poisoned images using a majority voting mechanism leveraging multiple state-of-the-art large vision language models. Once identified, poisoned samples are corrected using targeted and calibrated corrective noise. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that TrueBiometric detects and corrects poisoned images with 100\% accuracy without compromising accuracy on clean images. Compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches, TrueBiometric offers a more practical, accurate, and effective solution for mitigating backdoor attacks in face recognition systems.</description>

      <title>Embedding Alignment in Code Generation for Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LLM-powered code generation has the potential to revolutionize creative coding endeavors, such as live-coding, by enabling users to focus on structural motifs over syntactic details. In such domains, when prompting an LLM, users may benefit from considering multiple varied code candidates to better realize their musical intentions. Code generation models, however, struggle to present unique and diverse code candidates, with no direct insight into the code's audio output. To better establish a relationship between code candidates and produced audio, we investigate the topology of the mapping between code and audio embedding spaces. We find that code and audio embeddings do not exhibit a simple linear relationship, but supplement this with a constructed predictive model that shows an embedding alignment map could be learned. Supplementing the aim for musically diverse output, we present a model that given code predicts output audio embedding, constructing a code-audio embedding alignment map.</description>

      <title>Video Soundtrack Generation by Aligning Emotions and Temporal Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce EMSYNC, a video-based symbolic music generation model that aligns music with a video's emotional content and temporal boundaries. It follows a two-stage framework, where a pretrained video emotion classifier extracts emotional features, and a conditional music generator produces MIDI sequences guided by both emotional and temporal cues. We introduce boundary offsets, a novel temporal conditioning mechanism that enables the model to anticipate and align musical chords with scene cuts. Unlike existing models, our approach retains event-based encoding, ensuring fine-grained timing control and expressive musical nuances. We also propose a mapping scheme to bridge the video emotion classifier, which produces discrete emotion categories, with the emotion-conditioned MIDI generator, which operates on continuous-valued valence-arousal inputs. In subjective listening tests, EMSYNC outperforms state-of-the-art models across all subjective metrics, for music theory-aware participants as well as the general listeners.</description>

      <title>AudioGen-Omni: A Unified Multimodal Diffusion Transformer for Video-Synchronized Audio, Speech, and Song Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00733v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present AudioGen-Omni - a unified approach based on multimodal diffusion transformers (MMDit), capable of generating high-fidelity audio, speech, and song coherently synchronized with the input video. AudioGen-Omni introduces a novel joint training paradigm that seamlessly integrates large-scale video-text-audio corpora, enabling a model capable of generating semantically rich, acoustically diverse audio conditioned on multimodal inputs and adaptable to a wide range of audio generation tasks. AudioGen-Omni employs a unified lyrics-transcription encoder that encodes graphemes and phonemes from both song and spoken inputs into dense frame-level representations. Dense frame-level representations are fused using an AdaLN-based joint attention mechanism enhanced with phase-aligned anisotropic positional infusion (PAAPI), wherein RoPE is selectively applied to temporally structured modalities to ensure precise and robust cross-modal alignment. By unfreezing all modalities and masking missing inputs, AudioGen-Omni mitigates the semantic constraints of text-frozen paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal conditioning. This joint training approach enhances audio quality, semantic alignment, and lip-sync accuracy, while also achieving state-of-the-art results on Text-to-Audio/Speech/Song tasks. With an inference time of 1.91 seconds for 8 seconds of audio, it offers substantial improvements in both efficiency and generality.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Audio Deepfake Attribution and Model Recognition: A Multi-Level Autoencoder-Based Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The proliferation of audio deepfakes poses a growing threat to trust in digital communications. While detection methods have advanced, attributing audio deepfakes to their source models remains an underexplored yet crucial challenge. In this paper we introduce LAVA (Layered Architecture for Voice Attribution), a hierarchical framework for audio deepfake detection and model recognition that leverages attention-enhanced latent representations extracted by a convolutional autoencoder trained solely on fake audio. Two specialized classifiers operate on these features: Audio Deepfake Attribution (ADA), which identifies the generation technology, and Audio Deepfake Model Recognition (ADMR), which recognize the specific generative model instance. To improve robustness under open-set conditions, we incorporate confidence-based rejection thresholds. Experiments on ASVspoof2021, FakeOrReal, and CodecFake show strong performance: the ADA classifier achieves F1-scores over 95% across all datasets, and the ADMR module reaches 96.31% macro F1 across six classes. Additional tests on unseen attacks from ASVpoof2019 LA and error propagation analysis confirm LAVA's robustness and reliability. The framework advances the field by introducing a supervised approach to deepfake attribution and model recognition under open-set conditions, validated on public benchmarks and accompanied by publicly released models and code.

      <title>PESTO: Pitch Estimation with Self-supervised Transposition-equivariant Objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of pitch estimation using Self Supervised Learning (SSL). The SSL paradigm we use is equivariance to pitch transposition, which enables our model to accurately perform pitch estimation on monophonic audio after being trained only on a small unlabeled dataset. We use a lightweight ($&lt;$ 30k parameters) Siamese neural network that takes as inputs two different pitch-shifted versions of the same audio represented by its Constant-Q Transform. To prevent the model from collapsing in an encoder-only setting, we propose a novel class-based transposition-equivariant objective which captures pitch information. Furthermore, we design the architecture of our network to be transposition-preserving by introducing learnable Toeplitz matrices.
  We evaluate our model for the two tasks of singing voice and musical instrument pitch estimation and show that our model is able to generalize across tasks and datasets while being lightweight, hence remaining compatible with low-resource devices and suitable for real-time applications. In particular, our results surpass self-supervised baselines and narrow the performance gap between self-supervised and supervised methods for pitch estimation.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Speech Language Models: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03751v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently garnered significant attention, primarily for their capabilities in text-based interactions. However, natural human interaction often relies on speech, necessitating a shift towards voice-based models. A straightforward approach to achieve this involves a pipeline of ``Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) + LLM + Text-to-Speech (TTS)", where input speech is transcribed to text, processed by an LLM, and then converted back to speech. Despite being straightforward, this method suffers from inherent limitations, such as information loss during modality conversion, significant latency due to the complex pipeline, and error accumulation across the three stages. To address these issues, Speech Language Models (SpeechLMs) -- end-to-end models that generate speech without converting from text -- have emerged as a promising alternative. This survey paper provides the first comprehensive overview of recent methodologies for constructing SpeechLMs, detailing the key components of their architecture and the various training recipes integral to their development. Additionally, we systematically survey the various capabilities of SpeechLMs, categorize their evaluation metrics, and discuss the challenges and future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.

      <title>ZipVoice: Fast and High-Quality Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech with Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13053v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing large-scale zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) models deliver high speech quality but suffer from slow inference speeds due to massive parameters. To address this issue, this paper introduces ZipVoice, a high-quality flow-matching-based zero-shot TTS model with a compact model size and fast inference speed. Key designs include: 1) a Zipformer-based vector field estimator to maintain adequate modeling capabilities under constrained size; 2) Average upsampling-based initial speech-text alignment and Zipformer-based text encoder to improve speech intelligibility; 3) A flow distillation method to reduce sampling steps and eliminate the inference overhead associated with classifier-free guidance. Experiments on 100k hours multilingual datasets show that ZipVoice matches state-of-the-art models in speech quality, while being 3 times smaller and up to 30 times faster than a DiT-based flow-matching baseline. Codes, model checkpoints and demo samples are publicly available at https://github.com/k2-fsa/ZipVoice.</description>
