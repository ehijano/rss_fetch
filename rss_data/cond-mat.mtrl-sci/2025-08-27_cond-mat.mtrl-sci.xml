      <title>Computational study of alpha-ray induced electron excitation in diamonds for radiation detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the mechanism of radiation detection in diamonds, we developed a real time time dependent density functional theory based calculation scheme to evaluate changes in the density of states induced by alpha ray irradiation. A bulk diamond structural model was constructed, with impurities optionally introduced to assess their effect on electronic excitation. Simulations revealed that the passage of high speed helium ions, representing alpha particles, produced significant electronic excitation in the diamond model. Subsequent calculations of the excited state dynamics after ion removal indicated that excitation can persist for several hundred femtoseconds without triggering nonradiative relaxation. These findings demonstrate that the proposed approach offers a robust theoretical framework for evaluating the performance of diamond-based radiation detectors.</description>

      <title>Light-induced odd-parity altermagnets on dimerized lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are an emerging class of collinear magnets with momentum-dependent spin splitting and zero net magnetization. These materials can be broadly classified into two categories based on the behavior of spin splitting at time-reversal-related momenta: even-parity and odd-parity altermagnets. While even-parity altermagnets have been thoroughly investigated both theoretically and experimentally, the systems capable of hosting odd-parity altermagnetism remain largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light dynamically converts collinear PT-symmetric antiferromagnets on dimerized lattices into odd parity p-wave altermagnets. Because of the underlying Dirac band structure of the dimerized lattice, we find that the resulting p-wave altermagnets can realize Chern insulators (2D) and Weyl semimetals (3D) under appropriate drive conditions. Our findings demonstrate that collinear antiferromagnets on dimerized lattices provide ideal platforms to investigate the dynamical generation of odd-parity altermagnetism.</description>

      <title>Parity Breaking at Faceted Crystal Growth Fronts during Ice Templating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directional solidification of water-based solutions has emerged as a versatile technique to template hierarchical porous materials, but this nonequilibrium process remains incompletely understood. Here we use phase-field simulations to shed light on the mechanism that selects the growth direction of the lamellar ice structure that templates those materials. Our results show that this selection can be understood within the general framework of spontaneous parity breaking, yielding quantitative predictions for the tilt angle of lamellae with respect to the thermal axis. The results provide a theoretical basis to interpret a wide range of experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Phase-Field Model of Freeze Casting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Directional solidification of water-based solutions has emerged as a versatile technique for templating hierarchical porous materials. However, the underlying mechanisms of pattern formation remain incompletely understood. In this work, we present a detailed derivation and analysis of a quantitative phase-field model for simulating this nonequilibrium process. The phase-field model extends the thin-interface formulation of dilute binary alloy solidification with anti-trapping to incorporate the highly anisotropic energetic and kinetic properties of the partially faceted ice-water interface. This interface is faceted in the basal plane normal to the &lt;0001&gt; directions and atomically rough in other directions within the basal plane. On the basal plane, the model reproduces a linear or nonlinear kinetic relationship that can be linked to experimental measurements. In both cases, spontaneous parity breaking of the solidification front is observed, leading to the formation of partially faceted ice lamellae that drift laterally in one of the &lt;0001&gt; directions. We demonstrate that the drifting velocity is controlled by the kinetics on the basal plane and converges as the thickness of the diffuse solid-liquid interface decreases. Furthermore, we examine the effect of the form of the kinetic anisotropy, which is chosen here such that the inverse of the kinetic coefficient varies linearly from a finite value in the &lt;0001&gt; directions to zero in all other directions within the basal plane. Our results indicate that the drifting velocity of ice lamellae is not affected by the slope of this linear relation, and the radius and undercooling at the tip of an ice lamella converge at relatively small slope values. Consequently, the phase-field simulations remain quantitative with computationally tractable choices of both the interface thickness and the slope assumed in the form of the kinetic anisotropy.</description>

      <title>Exploration of Hexagonal, Layered Carbides and Nitrides as Ultra-High Temperature Ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layered, hexagonal crystal structures, like zeta and eta phases, play an important role in ultra-high temperature ceramics, often significantly increasing toughness of carbide composites. Despite their importance open questions remain about their structure, stability, and compositional pervasiveness. We use high-throughput density functional theory to characterize the thermodynamic stability and elastic constants of layered carbides and nitrides M$_{n+1}$X$_{n}$ with $n$ = 1, 2, and 3, $M$ = Ta, Ti, Hf, Zr, Nb, Mo, V, W, Sc, Cr, Mn and $X$ = C, N. The stacking sequences explored are inspired by the possible use of MXenes as precursors to enable relatively low temperature processing of high-temperature ceramics. We identified 67 new hexagonal, layered materials with thermal stability comparable or better than previously observed zeta phases. To assess their potential for high temperature applications, we used machine learning and physics-based models with DFT inputs to predict their melting temperatures and discovered several candidates on par with the current state of the art zeta-like phases and five with predicted melting temperatures above 2500 K. The findings expand the range of chemistries and structures for high-temperature applications.</description>

      <title>Electron-Phonon interaction and lattice thermal conductivity from metals to 2D Dirac crystals: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron--phonon (e--ph) coupling governs electrical resistivity, hot-carrier cooling, and critically, thermal transport in solids. Recent first-principles advances now predict e--ph limited thermal conductivity from d-band metals and wide-band-gap semiconductors to 2D Dirac crystals without empirical parameters. In bulk metals, ab-initio lifetimes show that phonons, though secondary, still carry up to 40\% of the heat once e--ph scattering is included. We next survey coupled Boltzmann frameworks, exemplified by \textsc{elphbolt}, that capture mutual drag and ultrafast non-equilibrium in semiconductors. For 2D Dirac crystals, mirror symmetry, carrier density, strain, and finite size rearrange the scattering hierarchy: ZA modes dominate pristine graphene yet become the main resistive branch in nanoribbons once symmetry is broken. At low Fermi energies and high temperatures, the standard 3-particle decay is partially cancelled, elevating 4-particle processes and necessitating dynamically screened, higher-order theory. Throughout, we identify the microscopic levers such as the electronic density of states, phonon frequency, deformation potential, and show how doping, strain, or dielectric environment can tune e--ph damping. We conclude by outlining open challenges such as: developing coupled e--ph solvers, solving the full mode-to-mode Peierls--Boltzmann equation with 4-particle terms, embedding correlated electron methods in e--ph workflows, and leveraging higher-order e--ph coupling and symmetry breaking to realise phononic thermal diodes and rectifiers. Solving these challenges will elevate e--ph theory from a diagnostic tool to a predictive, parameter-free platform that links symmetry, screening, and many-body effects to heat and charge transport in next-generation electronic, photonic, and thermoelectric devices.</description>

      <title>Long lifetimes of nanoscale skyrmions in lithium-decorated van der Waals ferromagnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), which originates from spin-orbit coupling and relies on broken inversion symmetry, is recognized as a key ingredient in forming magnetic skyrmions. However, most 2D magnets exhibit inversion symmetry; therefore, the DMI is suppressed. Here, we propose a strategy to induce large DMI via lithium absorption on the surface of 2D magnets -- an experimentally feasible approach. Using first-principles and atomistic spin simulations, we predict the formation of nanoscale skyrmions in lithium-decorated monolayer Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ by imposing small out-of-plane magnetic fields ($B_z$). Notably, we find very large skyrmion energy barriers of more than 300 meV at $B_z = 0.4$ T, comparable to those observed in ferromagnet/heavy-metal interfaces. The origin of these unique skyrmions is attributed to the competition between strong DMI, exchange frustration, and small magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy. We further show that the lifetimes of metastable skyrmions exceed one hour for temperatures up to 75 K.</description>

      <title>Ice-assisted soft-landing deposition for van der Waals integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals integration enables the creation of electronic and optoelectronic devices with unprecedented performance and novel functionalities beyond the existing material limitations. However, it is typically realized using a physical pick-up-and-place process to minimize interfacial damages and is hardly integrated into conventional lithography and metallization procedures. Here we demonstrate a simple in situ transfer strategy for van der Waals integration, in which a thin film of amorphous water ice acts as a buffer layer to shield against the bombardment of energetic clusters during metallization. After ice sublimation, the deposited metal film can be gently and in situ placed onto underlying substrates, to form an atomically clean and damage-free metal-semiconductor interface. This strategy allows ultra-clean and non-destructive fabrication of high-quality contacts on monolayer MoS2, which is extremely beneficial to produce a high-performance 2D field-effect transistor with an ultra-high on/off ratio of 1010, mobility of 80 (cm2 V-1s-1), and also with reduced Fermi level pinning effect. We also demonstrate the batch production of CVD-grown MoS2 transistor arrays with uniform electrical characteristics. Such a gentle and ultra-clean fabrication approach has been further extended to materials with high reactivity, such as halide perovskites. Our method can be easily integrated with mature semiconductor manufacturing technology and may become a generic strategy for fabricating van der Waals contacted devices.</description>

      <title>Origin of Glass-like Thermal Conductivity in Crystalline TlAgTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ordered crystalline compounds exhibiting ultralow and glass-like thermal conductivity are both fundamentally and technologically important, where phonon quasi-particles dominate their heat transport. Understanding the microscopic mechanisms that govern such unusual transport behavior is necessary to unravel the complex interplay of crystal structure, phonons, and collective excitations of these quasi-particles. Here, we use state-of-the-art first-principles calculations based on quantum density functional theory to investigate the origin of experimentally measured unusually low and glassy thermal conductivity in semiconducting TlAgTe. Utilizing a unifying framework of anharmonic lattice dynamics theory that combine phonon self-energy induced frequency renormalization, particle-like Peierls ($kappa_l^P$) and wave-like coherent ($kappa_l^C$) thermal transport contributions including three and four-phonon scattering channels, we successfully explain the experimental results both in terms of magnitude and temperature dependence. Our analysis reveals that TlAgTe exhibits several localized phonon modes arising from concerted rattling-like vibration of Tl atoms, which show strong temperature dependence and enhanced four-phonon scattering rates that are dominated by Umklapp processes, suppressing $kappa_l^P$ to ultralow values. The ensuing strong anharmonicity induced by local structural distortions, lone-pair electrons, and rattling-like vibrations of the heavy cations lead to a transition from particle-like behavior to wave-like tunneling characteristics of the phonon modes above 40 cm$^-1$, contributing significantly to $kappa_l^C$ which increases with temperature. Our analysis uncovers important structure-property relationship, which may be used in designing of novel materials with tunable thermal conductivity.</description>

      <title>Flexible orbital torque device with ultralow switching current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital torque (OT) offers a highly efficient way for electrical magnetization manipulation. However, its potential in the emerging field of flexible spintronics remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a flexible and robust OT device based on a mica/SrRuO3(SRO)/CoPt heterostructure. We measure a large torque efficiency of -0.31, which originates from the significant orbital Hall effect in the SRO layer. Leveraging the low thermal conductivity of the mica substrate, a thermally-assisted switching mechanism is activated, enabling an ultralow threshold current density of 9.2x109 A/m2. This value represents a 90% reduction compared to conventional spin-torque devices and a 52% reduction against its rigid counterpart on a SrTiO3 substrate. The superior performances is well-maintained after 103 bending cycles, conforming its exceptional flexibility and durability. Our work pioneers the development of flexible OT devices, showcasing a viable path toward next-generation, low-power wearable spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Chemical control of polymorphism and ferroelectricity in PbTiO3 and SrTiO3 monolayers and bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Layers of perovskites, found in 3D materials, 2D heterostructures, and nanotubes, often distort from high symmetry to facilitate dipole polarisation that is exploitable in many applications. Using density-functional theory calculations, ferroelectricity in bilayers of the 2D materials PbTiO3 and SrTiO3 is shown to be controlled by bond breakage and formation processes that act as binary switches. These stacking-dependent processes turn on and off as a function of relaxation from high-symmetry structures and the application of biaxial strain, and their concerted rearrangements lead to low energy barriers for ferroelectric polarisation switching. Structures with symmetry intermediate between high-symmetry octahedral forms and low-symmetry ferroelectric forms are identified, allowing the intrinsic processes associated with traditional "ferrodistortive" and "antiferrodistortive" distortions of TiO6 octahedra to be identified. Ferrodistortive-mode activity is shown to be generated by the simultaneous application of two different types of curvilinear antiferrodistortive motions. In this way, four angular variabes control polarisation switching through the concerted making and breaking of chemical bonds. These subltities make the polarisation sensitive to chemical-environment and temperature effects that manipulate strain and structure, features exploitable in futuristic devices.</description>

      <title>In silico investigation of Ba-based ternary chalcogenides for photovoltaic applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In solar cells, the absorbers are the key components for capturing solar energy and converting photons into electron-hole pairs. The search for high-performance absorbers with advantageous characteristics is an ongoing task for researchers. In this work, we investigated promising and environmentally benign Ba-based ternary chalcogenides for photovoltaic applications. The total number of Ba-based ternary chalcogenides in the Materials Project database was found to be 279. Materials screening based on bandgap size and stability reduced the number of compounds to 19. The performance of an absorber depends on the charge carrier lifetime, which is controlled by non-radiative processes involving defects. Hence, we investigated the intrinsic defects and p-type dopability of the compounds. We identified two Ba-based compounds, namely \ch{BaCu2Se2} and \ch{ZrBaSe3}, as promising absorbers for single-junction and tandem cells and investigated them in detail.</description>

      <title>Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator for Temperature-Dependent Anisotropic Plasticity in HCP Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network surrogate models for constitutive laws in computational mechanics have been in use for some time. In plasticity, these models often rely on gated recurrent units (GRUs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) cells, which excel at capturing path-dependent phenomena. However, they suffer from long training times and time-resolution-dependent predictions that extrapolate poorly. Moreover, most existing surrogates for macro- or mesoscopic plasticity handle only relatively simple material behavior. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator (TRNO), a time-resolution-independent neural architecture. We apply the TRNO to model the temperature-dependent plastic response of polycrystalline magnesium, which shows strong plastic anisotropy and thermal sensitivity. The TRNO achieves high predictive accuracy and generalizes effectively across diverse loading cases, temperatures, and time resolutions. It also outperforms conventional GRU and LSTM models in training efficiency and predictive performance. Finally, we demonstrate multiscale simulations with the TRNO, yielding a speedup of at least three orders of magnitude over traditional constitutive models.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry in low-energy linear and nonlinear optical responses of magnetic Rashba semiconductor (Ge,Mn)Te</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum geometry appears as a key factor in understanding the optical properties of quantum materials, with the anticipation on diverging or quantized responses near the Dirac and Weyl points. Here we investigate linear and nonlinear optical responses -- optical conductivity and injection current -- in a magnetic Rashba semiconductor in the mid-infrared region, with varying the Fermi energy across the Dirac point. We reveal that the linear optical conductivity reflects quantum metric, which remains finite irrespective of the diminishing joint density-of-states at lower photon energy. It is also confirmed that the magnetic injection current enhances depending on the energy of the Fermi level relative to the Dirac point. These optical spectra are nicely reproduced by our theoretical calculations with geometrical effects taken into account.</description>

      <title>Designing Antiferromagnetic Spin-1/2 Chains in Janus Fullerene Nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We computationally design antiferromagnetic spin-1/2 chains in fullerene nanoribbons by introducing extra C$_{60}$ cages at one of their edges. The resulting odd number of intermolecular bonds induces an unpaired $\pi$-electron and hence a quantised magnetic moment in otherwise non-magnetic nanoribbons. We further reveal the formation of an antiferromagnetic ground state upon the linear arrangement of spin-$1/2$ C$_{60}$ cages that is insensitive to the specific structural motifs. Compared with graphene nanoribbons, Janus fullerene nanoribbons may offer an experimentally more accessible route to magnetic edge states with atomic precision in low-dimensional carbon nanostructures, possibly serving as a versatile nanoarchitecture for scalable spin-based devices and the exploration of many-body quantum phases.</description>

      <title>Strong and Engineerable Optical Anisotropy in Easily Integrable Epitaxial SrO(SrTiO 3 ) N Ruddlesden--Popper Thin Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical anisotropy is a key property for numerous photonic devices. However, bulk anisotropic materials suitable for such applications remain relatively scarse and are often challenging to synthesize as thin films. Additionally, the optical losses as well as the complex structuration of anisotropic metamaterials hinder their integrability in photonic devices. Based on ellipsometry measurements coupled with reflectance, it is demonstrated here that Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) SrO(SrTiO 3 ) N phases (STO-RP N ), epitaxial thin films composed of a SrTiO 3 lattice periodically interrupted by one SrO atomic plane every N unit cells, exhibit pronounced dichroism and birefringence over a broad spectral range. Notably, this anisotropy is tunable by adjusting the RP order N. In contrast to most other anisotropic materials reported in the literature, STO-RP N thin layers can be fabricated using industry-standard growth processes. As it can be epitaxially grown on Si and GaAs using SrTiO 3 templates, the work paves the way for their compact integration on these photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Microscale optoelectronic synapses with switchable photocurrent from halide perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient visual data processing by neuromorphic networks requires volatile artificial synapses that detect and process light inputs, ideally in the same device. Here, we demonstrate microscale back-contacted optoelectronic halide perovskite artificial synapses that leverage ion migration induced by a bias voltage to modulate their photocurrent. The photocurrent changes are due to the accumulation of mobile ions, which induces a transient electric field in the perovskite. The photocurrent changes are volatile, decaying on the order of seconds. The photocurrent changes can be controlled by both the applied voltage and illumination. The symmetric device supports changing of the photocurrent polarity, switching between inhibitory and exhibitory functioning. The photocurrent can be updated by spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP)-learning rules inspired by biology. We show with simulations how this could be exploited as an attention mechanism in a neuromorphic detector. Our fabrication procedure is compatible with high-density integration with CMOS and memristive neuromorphic networks for energy-efficient visual data processing inspired by the brain.</description>

      <title>3D Strain Field Reconstruction by Inversion of Dynamical Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strain governs not only the mechanical response of materials but also their electronic, optical, and catalytic properties. For this reason, the measurement of the 3D strain field is crucial for a detailed understanding and for further developments of material properties through strain engineering. However, measuring strain variations along the electron beam direction has remained a major challenge for (scanning-) transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM). In this article, we present a method for 3D strain field determination using 4D-STEM. The method is based on the inversion of dynamical diffraction effects, which occur at strain field variations along the beam direction. We test the method against simulated data with a known ground truth and demonstrate its application to an experimental 4D-STEM dataset from an inclined pseudomorphically grown Al$_{0.47}$Ga$_{0.53}$N layer.</description>

      <title>A comparative nanotribological investigation on amorphous and polycrystalline forms of MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The wear behavior of two amorphous and polycrystalline forms of MoS2 prepared by magnetron sputtering has been characterized in a combined nanoindentation and atomic force microscopy study. From the analysis of the depth and width of wear tracks estimated after scratching the surfaces with a Berkovich indenter and a loading force up to 2 mN, we conclude that both forms follow the Archard wear equation, and the wear resistance is about four times higher on the amorphous MoS2. Moreover, a comparison of lateral force maps on pristine and worn areas shows a considerable reduction of friction on both forms, which is possibly due to the significant smoothing of the surfaces caused by scratching. With normal forces in the micro N range, the analysis is made difficult by the fact that the linear dimensions of the wear tracks are comparable to those of the granular structures forming the surfaces. Even if the Archard equation could not be tested in this case, the wear resistance is considerably larger on amorphous MoS2 also on the nanoscale. In this way, our results disclose information on the nanotribology of MoS2 thin films in forms different from the layered structures commonly discussed in the literature. The amorphous form outperforms the polycrystalline one.</description>

      <title>Exploring nanoscale metallic multilayer Ta/Cu films: Structure and some insights on deformation and strengthening mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoscale metallic multilayer (NMM) films are systems offering insight into the role of interfaces in metal plasticity, deformation, and strengthening mechanisms. Magnetron sputtering was used to fabricate the Ta-Cu NMM films with a periodicity (equal Ta and Cu layer thickness) from 6 to 80 nm, with resulting structure exhibiting strongly incoherent tetragonal beta-Ta and face-centered cubic Cu phase. The high-load indentation test, TEM studies, and the rCLS model collectively demonstrate that all NMM films predominantly undergo plastic deformation. This plastic deformation primarily occurs within the soft Cu layer, while the propagation of dislocations across the incoherent interface is largely excluded.</description>

      <title>On the role played by electrons in the stress-strain curves of ideal crystalline solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19043v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical properties of a solid, which relate its deformation to external applied forces, are key factors in enabling or disabling the use of an otherwise optimal material in any application, strongly influencing also its service lifetime. Intrinsic crystal deformation mechanisms, investigated experimentally on single crystals with low dislocation densities, have been studied theoretically through atomistic simulations, mainly focusing on lattice-induced instabilities. Here, instead, we employ density functional theory and a thermodynamic analysis to probe and analyze the way in which the electronic charge of crystalline solids (Cu, Al and diamond) responds to uniaxial strain and affects their mechanical properties. Indeed, despite the very simple nature of our models, and in the presence of minimal atomic displacements, we find that the stress strain curves of Cu and Al deviate from a simple linear elastic behavior. Within a thermodynamics perspective, the features of such curves can be interpreted in terms of first and second order phase transitions, which originate from Van-Hove singularities of the electronic density of states crossing the Fermi level and electron redistribution within the solid, respectively.</description>

      <title>Lattice vacancy migration barriers in Fe-Ni alloys, and why Ni atoms diffuse slowly: An ab initio study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mobility of both Fe and Ni atoms in ferromagnetic $\textrm{Fe}_x \textrm{Ni}_{1-x}$ alloys ($0.4 \leq x \leq 0.6$) is investigated within the framework of ab initio electronic structure calculations, using the nudged elastic band (NEB) method to accurately quantify energetic barriers to lattice vacancy migration. Both the atomically disordered ($A1$) fcc phase, as well as the atomically ordered, tetragonal $\textrm{L}1_0$ phase - which is under consideration as a material for a rare-earth-free 'gap' magnet for advanced engineering applications - are investigated. Across an ensemble of NEB calculations performed on supercell configurations spanning a range of compositions and containing disordered, partially ordered, and fully ordered structures, we find that Ni atoms are consistently significantly less mobile than Fe atoms. Crucially, we are able to interpret these findings in terms of the ferromagnetic alloy's underlying spin-polarised electronic structure. Specifically, we report a coupling between the size of local lattice distortions and the magnitude of the local electronic spin polarisation around vacancies. This causes Fe atoms to relax into lattice vacancies, while Ni atoms remain rigidly fixed to their original lattice positions. This effect plays a key role in determining the reduced mobility of Ni atoms compared to that of Fe atoms. These results shed atomic-scale insight into the longstanding experimental observation that Ni exhibits remarkably slow atomic diffusion in Fe-Ni alloys.</description>

      <title>Alloyed cementite (Fe-Ni-Cr)$_3$C: structure and hyperfine field from DFT calculations and experimental comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The alloying elements introduced into carbon steel to enhance its mechanical properties also diffuse into cementite (Fe$_3$C) particles, modifying their characteristics and thereby influencing the overall performance of the steel. This study employs density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate cementite doped with Ni and Cr which exhibit contrasting effects. The preferred lattice sites of impurity atoms were determined through a comparison of calculated and experimental structural parameters. The formation mechanism of the hyperfine magnetic field (HFF) and its correlation with atomic magnetic moments were systematically investigated. The validity of common approximations in M\"ossbauer spectroscopy analysis was evaluated for the cementite system. HFF distribution functions were modeled using calculated values and compared with experiments.</description>

      <title>MC3D: The Materials Cloud computational database of experimentally known stoichiometric inorganics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DFT is a widely used method to compute properties of materials, which are often collected in databases and serve as valuable starting points for further studies. In this article, we present the Materials Cloud Three-Dimensional Structure Database (MC3D), an online database of computed three-dimensional (3D) inorganic crystal structures. Close to a million experimentally reported structures were imported from the COD, ICSD and MPDS databases; these were parsed and filtered to yield a collection of 72589 unique and stoichiometric structures, of which 95% are, to date, classified as experimentally known. The geometries of structures with up to 64 atoms were then optimized using density-functional theory (DFT) with automated workflows and curated input protocols. The procedure was repeated for different functionals (and computational protocols), with the latest version (MC3D PBEsol-v2) comprising 32013 unique structures. All versions of the MC3D are made available on the Materials Cloud portal, which provides a graphical interface to explore and download the data. The database includes the full provenance graph of all the calculations driven by the automated workflows, thus establishing full reproducibility of the results and more-than-FAIR procedures.</description>

      <title>Odd-Parity Altermagnetism Originated from Orbital Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18361v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Odd-parity spin-splitting plays a central role in spintronics and unconventional superconductivity, yet its microscopic realization in collinear magnetic systems remains elusive. We propose a general symmetry-based strategy for realizing odd-parity altermagnetism by stacking two noncentrosymmetric monolayers in an interlayer antiferromagnetic configuration and applying an in-plane layer-flip operation. In this setting, odd-parity spin-splitting originates from nonrelativistic orbital orders rather than spin-orbit coupling, and is protected by an effective time-reversal symmetry despite the explicit time-reversal symmetry being broken. By exploiting lattice symmetries, our framework enables the realization of both $p$- and $f$-wave altermagnets. The resulting models generically host quantum spin Hall insulator phases, featuring topologically protected helical edge states and quantized spin Hall conductance. Our work expands the landscape of altermagnetic phases and opens a pathway toward spintronics and unconventional superconductivity in altermagnetic systems.</description>

      <title>High-throughput superconducting $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ predictions through density of states rescaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: First principles computational methods can predict the superconducting critical temperature $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ of conventional superconductors through the electron-phonon spectral function. Full convergence of this quantity requires Brillouin zone integration on very dense grids, presenting a bottleneck to high-throughput screening for high $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ systems. In this work, we show that an electron-phonon spectral function calculated at low cost on a coarse grid yields accurate $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ predictions, provided the function is rescaled to correct for the inaccurate value of the density of states at the Fermi energy on coarser grids. Compared to standard approaches, the method converges rapidly and improves the accuracy of predictions for systems with sharp features in the density of states. This approach can be directly integrated into existing materials screening workflows, enabling the rapid identification of promising candidates that might otherwise be overlooked.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the strong coupling model of $d^1$ transition metal tri-halides in the large spin-orbit coupled limit. By considering ab-initio-calculation-inspired hierarchy of hopping pathways of these compounds, SU(4) symmetry is found to emerge at multiple points in the parameter space of the hopping parameters. The resultant Dirac spin-orbital liquids, within the parton mean field description, are distinct. The calculated dynamical structure factor fingerprints this distinctive nature, giving rise to observable effects. This opens up a playground for SU(4) Dirac Spin-Orbital liquid in $d^1$ Honeycomb lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Intersite Charge Transfer, Antiferromagnetism, and Strain in Barocaloric ACu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ Quadruple Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a minimal Landau theory for the concomitant intersite charge-transfer, antiferromagnetic, and isostructural phase transitions in ACu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ perovskites (A = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb). The model incorporates the difference in average ligand-hole occupancy between Cu and Fe, the staggered magnetization of the Fe sublattice, volume strain, and intrinsic thermal expansion, together with their couplings. It qualitatively reproduces key thermodynamic properties of the ACu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ family, including the staggered magnetization, lattice volume, magnetic susceptibility, and the nearly linear temperature-pressure phase boundary. The framework predicts a pronounced elastic softening near the phase boundary, consistent with experiments where the bulk modulus of the low-pressure, charge-transferred antiferromagnetic phase exceeds that of the high-pressure, non-transferred paramagnetic phase. It also yields pressure-driven isothermal entropy changes, revealing that the intrinsic thermal expansion of the high- and low-temperature phases significantly shapes the overall barocaloric response. These results contrast with previous analyses of NdCu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$, where thermal expansion was neglected in the entropy construction, and call for a reevaluation of barocaloric effects in quadruple perovskites.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The liquid-liquid phase separation of biomolecules is an important process for intracellular organization. Biomolecular sequence combinatorics leads to a large variety of proteins and nucleic acids which can interact to form a diversity of dense liquid (`condensate') phases. The relationship between sequence design and the diversity of the resultant phases is therefore of interest. Here, we explore this question using the DNA nanostar system which permits the creation of multi-phase condensate droplets through sequence engineering of the sticky end bonds that drive particle-particle attraction. We explore the theoretical limits of nanostar phase diversity, then experimentally demonstrate the ability to create 9 distinct, non-adhering nanostar phases that do not share components. We further study how thermal processing affects the morphology and dynamics of such a highly diverse condensate system. We particularly show that a rapid temperature quench leads to the formation of a densely packed 2-D layer of droplets that is transiently stabilized by caging effects enabled by the phase diversity, leading to glassy dynamics, such as slow coarsening and dynamic heterogeneity.

      <title>Itinerant and topological excitations in a honeycomb spiral spin liquid candidate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The frustrated insulating magnet can stabilize a spiral spin liquid, arising from cooperative fluctuations among a subextensively degenerate manifold of spiral configurations, with ground-state wave vectors forming a continuous contour or surface in reciprocal space. The atomic-mixing-free honeycomb antiferromagnet GdZnPO has recently emerged as a promising spiral spin-liquid candidate, hosting nontrivial topological excitations. Despite growing interest, the transport and topological properties of spiral spin liquids remain largely unexplored experimentally. Here, we report transport measurements on high-quality, electrically insulating GdZnPO single crystals. We observe a giant low-temperature magnetic thermal conductivity down to $\sim$50 mK, described by $\kappa_{xx}^\mathrm{m}$ $\sim$ $\kappa_0+\kappa_1T$, where both $\kappa_0$ and $\kappa_1$ are positive constants associated with excitations along and off the spiral contour in reciprocal space, respectively. This behavior parallels the magnetic specific heat, underscoring the presence of mobile low-energy excitations intrinsic to the putative spiral spin liquid. Furthermore, the observed positive thermal Hall effect confirms the topological nature of at least some of these excitations. Our findings provide key insights into the itinerant and topological properties of low-lying spin excitations in the spiral spin-liquid candidate.</description>

      <title>Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations and planar Hall effect in HfTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18956v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) HfTe2 is a topological semimetal candidate with increasing attentions recently. The map of the Fermi surface is of interest and importance to understand its properties. Here we present a study of Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations and planar Hall effect (PHE) in HfTe2. The single crystals grown by flux method show the largest unsaturated magnetoresistance (MR) effect of 1.1*104 % at 14 T and 2 K. The angle-resolved SdH oscillations reveal that the Fermi surface consists of three pockets with different anisotropy. In addition, we observe PHE and anisotropic MR (AMR) effect in the material for a wide temperature range. The effective mass, carrier density and quantum transport mobility are quantified in the system, and the Berry phase is discussed. Our work provides crucial insights into the electronic structure and the Fermi surface of the semimetal.</description>

      <title>Polarity-dependent Electroadhesion at Silicon Interfaces with Nanoscale Roughness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We measure and model electroadhesion across multi-asperity silicon interfaces with nanometer scale roughness. When electrically biased, our naturally oxidized silicon interfaces display a leakage current consistent with the Fowler-Nordheim model and electroadhesion that can be successfully captured using a boundary element contact model. We show that polysilicon exhibits electroadhesion only under positive bias applied to the substrate monocrystalline wafer, which we interpret as a result of the reduced mobility of holes, with respect to electrons, within polysilicon. Overall, our findings reveal that electrostatic interactions can significantly enhance adhesion and friction between stiff and smooth surfaces, which can be important for example in precision positioning applications.</description>

      <title>Phase Coherent Transport in Two-Dimensional Tellurium Flakes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elemental tellurium (Te) is a compelling van der Waals material due to its interesting chiral crystal structure and predicted topological properties. Here, we report the fabrication and comprehensive quantum transport study of devices based on Te flakes with varying thicknesses. We demonstrate a hole mobility reaching up to 1000 cm2/V.s in a 17 nm thick flake at 30 Kelvin. At deep cryogenic temperatures (&lt; 50mK), the transport characteristics transition from Coulomb blockade in the low carrier density regime to pronounced Fabry-P\'erot (F-P) interference at higher densities. Notably, the visibility of these F-P oscillations is significantly enhanced in the thinner flake device. The application of a magnetic field reveals a clear Zeeman splitting of the conductance peaks. The rich variety of quantum transport phenomena observed underscores the high quality of our thin Te flakes and establishes them as a promising platform for exploring novel physics and device concepts, such as topological superconductivity and low-power spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced proximate quantum spin ice phase in Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a comprehensive bulk characterization and neutron scattering investigation of single-crystalline Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, a magnetic pyrochlore synthesized via a flux-growth method. Unpolarized neutron diffuse scattering reveals the emergence of spin-ice correlations below $T \sim 1$ K, evidenced by the development of anisotropic pinch-point features that are consistent with quantum-spin-ice (QSI) behavior. A.C. susceptibility measurements indicate a progressive slowing of spin dynamics in this regime, culminating in complete spin freezing below $T_f \approx 0.15$ K. Inelastic neutron scattering at $T = 0.5$ K reveals a broad spectrum of quasi-elastic magnetic excitations, with intensity in the low-energy range $[0, 0.2]$ meV significantly suppressed below $T_f$. Meanwhile, an incipient (100)-type magnetic order begins to nucleate, and a gapped excitation centered at $\hbar\omega = 0.23$ meV persists. We further identify two distinct dynamical timescales above $T_f$, a slow component $\tau_{\mathrm{slow}} \sim 10^{-5}$ s and a fast component $\tau_{\mathrm{fast}} \sim 10^{-10}$ s, in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions for QSI systems. Taken together, these results indicate that Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ enters a disorder-induced spin-frozen phase below $T_f$, lying in close proximity to a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid.</description>

      <title>Point defect design in (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ -- new insights on agglomeration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10467v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional properties of ferroelectrics and their change with time depend crucially on the defect structure. In particular, point defects and bias fields induced by defect dipoles modify the field hysteresis and play an important role in fatigue and aging. However, a full understanding on how order, agglomeration and strength of defect dipoles affect phase stability and functional properties is still lacking. To close these gaps in knowledge, we screen these parameters by \textit{ab\ initio} based molecular dynamics simulations with the effective Hamiltonian method for the prototypical ferroelectric material (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$. Our findings suggest that the {\it{active surface area}} of the defects, rather than the defect concentration is the decisive factor. For a fixed defect concentration, clustering reduces the {\it{active surface area}} and thus the defect-induced changes of phase stability and field hysteresis. Particularly planar agglomerates of defects appear as promising route for the material design as their impact on the field hysteresis can be controlled by the field direction and as their impact on the phase stability shows a cross-over with the strength of the defect dipoles. For this agglomeration, we show that the recoverable stored energy can outperform the response of pristine (Ba,Sr)TiO$_3$ even in its paraelectric phase due to a pinched double-loop field hysteresis.</description>

      <title>Toward improved property prediction of 2D materials using many-body quantum Monte Carlo methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The field of two-dimensional (2D) materials has grown dramatically in the last two decades. 2D materials can be utilized for a variety of next-generation optoelectronic, spintronic, clean energy, and quantum computation applications. These 2D structures, which are often exfoliated from layered van der Waals (vdW) materials, possess highly inhomogeneous electron densities and can possess short- and long-range electron correlations. The complexities of 2D materials make them challenging to study with standard mean-field electronic structure methods such as density functional theory (DFT), which relies on approximations for the unknown exchange-correlation functional. In order to overcome the limitations of DFT, highly accurate many-body electronic structure approaches such as Diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) can be utilized. In the past decade, DMC has been used to calculate accurate magnetic, electronic, excitonic, and topological properties in addition to accurately capturing interlayer interactions and cohesion and adsorption energetics of 2D materials. This approach has been applied to 2D systems of wide interest including graphene, phosphorene, MoS$_2$, CrI$_3$, VSe$_2$, GaSe, GeSe, borophene, and several others. In this review article, we highlight some successful recent applications of DMC to 2D systems for improved property predictions beyond standard DFT.</description>

Abstract: The difference between free surface energy and fracture toughness in amorphous silica is studied via multi-scale simulations. We combine the homogenization of a molecular dynamics fracture model with a phase-field approach to track and quantify the various energy contributions. We clearly separate free surface energy localized as potential energy on the surface and damage diffusion over a 16-23 A range around the crack path. The plastic contribution is negligible. These findings, which clarify brittle fracture mechanisms in amorphous materials, align with toughness measurements in silica.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) plays a pivotal role in determining the electronic and structural properties of graphene-based devices. In this work, we employ quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) to study the interlayer interactions and stacking-fault energy (SFE) between graphene and hBN. We generated QMC energies for several rigid bilayer stacking configurations and fitted these data to the Kolmogorov-Crespi type interlayer potential (ILP) model. Our QMC-derived potential offers a more reliable alternative to conventional density functional theory methods, which are prone to errors in predicting properties in van der Waals materials. This study enables highly accurate predictions of structural and electronic properties in graphene hBN heterostructures. The resulting ILP-QMC potential is made available for further use in simulating complex systems, such as twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) on hBN.</description>

      <title>Phase Transformation Kinetics Model for Metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a new model for phase transformation kinetics in metals by generalizing the Levitas-Preston (LP) phase field model of martensite phase transformations (see Levitas and Preston (2002a,b); Levitas, Preston and Lee (2003)) to arbitrary pressure. Furthermore, we account for and track: the interface speed of the pressure driven phase transformation, properties of critical nuclei, as well as nucleation at grain sites and on dislocations and homogeneous nucleation. The volume fraction evolution of each phase is described by employing KJMA (Kolmogorov, 1937; Johnson and Mehl, 1939; Avrami, 1939, 1940, 1941) kinetic theory. We then test our new model for iron under ramp loading conditions and compare our predictions for the $\alpha\to\epsilon$ iron phase transition to experimental data of Smith et al. (2013). More than one combination of material and model parameters (such as dislocation density and interface speed) led to good agreement of our simulations to the experimental data, thus highlighting the importance of having accurate characterization data regarding the microstructure of the sample in question.</description>

      <title>Interacting Dirac magnons in the van der Waals ferromagnet CrBr$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07650v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of magnon-magnon interactions in the two-dimensional van der Waals ferromagnet CrBr$_3$ focusing on its honeycomb lattice structure. Motivated by earlier theoretical predictions of temperature-induced spectral shifts and van Hove singularities in the magnon dispersion~[S. S. Pershoguba \textit{et al}., Dirac Magnons in Honeycomb Ferromagnets, \href{https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.8.011010}{Phys. Rev. X {\textbf{8}}, 011010 (2018)}], we go beyond the commonly used thermal magnon approximation by applying second-order perturbation theory in a fully numerical framework. Our analysis uncovers significant deviations from previous analysis: in particular, the predicted singularities are absent, consistent with recent inelastic neutron scattering measurements~[S. E. Nikitin \textit{et al}., Thermal Evolution of Dirac Magnons in the Honeycomb Ferromagnet CrBr$_3$, \href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.127201}{Phys. Rev. Lett. {\textbf{129}}, 127201 (2022)}]. Moreover, we find that the temperature dependence of the renormalized magnon spectrum exhibits a distinct $T^3$ behavior for the optical magnon branch, while retaining $T^2$ behavior for the acoustic or down magnon band. This feature sheds new light on the collective dynamics of Dirac magnons and their interactions. We further compare the honeycomb case with a triangular Bravais lattice, relevant for ferromagnetic monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, and show that both systems lack singular features while displaying quite distinct thermal trends.</description>

      <title>In-situ SHG microscopy investigation of the domain-wall-conductivity enhancement procedure in lithium niobate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conductive domain walls (CDWs) in the uniaxial ferroelectric lithium niobate (LiNbO$_3$, LN) have attracted a lot of interest as potential elements in 2D nanoelectronics, due to their orders-of-magnitude larger electronic AC and DC conductivities as compared to the host material. On the way towards generating standardized CDWs into z-cut bulk LN crystals with controllable geometry and electrical properties, we have encountered setbacks recently: Although the first preparation step, i.e., the established UV-light-assisted liquid-electrode poling, reliably creates fully penetrating hexagonal domains with the DWs being aligned almost parallel to the polarization axis, the second step in the DW 'conductivity-enhancement' process through post-growth voltage ramping, resulted in randomly-shaped DWs as reflected in their different current-voltage (I-V) characteristics even after having applied the same process parameters. To clarify this phenomenon, we present here an \textit{in-situ} and time-resolved second-harmonic-generation (SHG) microscopy investigation of DW samples of different sizes, monitoring the DW evolution during that critical voltage ramping, which allowed us to reconstruct the 3D DW shapes both prior to and after the enhancement process. As a result, we are able to map the temporal changes of the local DW inclination angle $\alpha$, and to quantify the DW velocity. As a consequence, we need to re-assess and re-think the origin of the DW conductivity (DWC) in LN: The hitherto assumed simple connection between $\alpha$ and the DWC can not be generalized, since point defects accumulating along DWs act as extra sources for charge carrier trapping/release, significantly contributing to the DW current.</description>

Abstract: We report the realization of epitaxial indium thin films on PbTe nanowires. The film is continuous and forms an atomically sharp interface with PbTe. Tunneling devices reveal a hard superconducting gap. The gap size, 1.08 to 1.18 meV, is twice as large as bulk indium's ($\sim$ 0.5 meV), due to the presence of PbTe. A similar enhancement is also observed in the critical temperature of In on a PbTe substrate. Subgap peaks appear at finite magnetic fields. The effective $g$-factor (15-45) is notably enhanced compared to bare PbTe wires ($&lt;$ 10) due to the presence of In, differing from Al-hybrids. Josephson devices exhibit gate-tunable supercurrents. The PbTe-In hybrid enhances the properties of both, the superconductivity of In and g-factors of PbTe, and thus may enable exotic phases of matter such as topological superconductivity.</description>

Abstract: Interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) between two magnetic layers sandwiched by a nonmagnetic spacer layer plays a critical role in shaping the magnetic properties of such heterostructures. The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect has been realized in a structure composed of two magnetically doped topological insulator (TI) layers separated by an undoped TI layer. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize a series of magnetic TI sandwiches with varying thicknesses of the middle TI spacer layer. The well-quantized QAH effect is observed in all these samples, and the IEC modulates its critical behavior between the top and bottom magnetic TI layers. Near the plateau phase transition (PPT), thinner QAH samples exhibit a two-dimensional critical metal behavior with nearly temperature-independent longitudinal resistance. In contrast, thicker QAH samples behave as a three-dimensional insulator with reduced longitudinal resistance at higher temperatures. We employ a magnetic TI Hamiltonian with random magnetic domains to understand the IEC-induced critical-metal-to-insulator transition observed near QAH PPT.</description>

      <title>UniGenX: a unified generative foundation model that couples sequence, structure and function to accelerate scientific design across proteins, molecules and materials</title>

Abstract: Function in natural systems arises from one-dimensional sequences forming three-dimensional structures with specific properties. However, current generative models suffer from critical limitations: training objectives seldom target function directly, discrete sequences and continuous coordinates are optimized in isolation, and conformational ensembles are under-modeled. We present UniGenX, a unified generative foundation model that addresses these gaps by co-generating sequences and coordinates under direct functional and property objectives across proteins, molecules, and materials. UniGenX represents heterogeneous inputs as a mixed stream of symbolic and numeric tokens, where a decoder-only autoregressive transformer provides global context and a conditional diffusion head generates numeric fields steered by task-specific tokens. Besides the new high SOTAs on structure prediction tasks, the model demonstrates state-of-the-art or competitive performance for the function-aware generation across domains: in materials, it achieves "conflicted" multi-property conditional generation, yielding 436 crystal candidates meeting triple constraints, including 11 with novel compositions; in chemistry, it sets new benchmarks on five property targets and conformer ensemble generation on GEOM; and in biology, it improves success in modeling protein induced fit (RMSD &lt; 2 {\AA}) by over 23-fold and enhances EC-conditioned enzyme design. Ablation studies and cross-domain transfer substantiate the benefits of joint discrete-continuous training, establishing UniGenX as a significant advance from prediction to controllable, function-aware generation.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Coupling-Induced Quantum Phase Transition in Quantum Anomalous Hall Multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum phase transition arises from competition between different ground states and is typically accessed by varying a single physical parameter near absolute zero temperature. The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect with high Chern number C has recently been achieved in magnetic topological insulator (TI) multilayers. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize a series of magnetic TI penta-layers by varying the thickness of the middle magnetic TI layer, designated as m quintuple layers. Electrical transport measurements demonstrate a quantum phase transition between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states. For m 1 and m 2, the sample exhibits the well-quantized C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states, respectively. For 1 m 2, we observe a monotonic decrease in Hall resistance from h/e2 to h/2e2 with increasing m, accompanied by a peak in the longitudinal resistance. The quantum phase transition between C = 1 and C = 2 QAH states is attributed to the weakening of the interlayer coupling between the top and the bottom C = 1 QAH layers. Our findings provide a scalable strategy for engineering QAH devices with a tunable Chern number. This approach enables precise control and enhanced functionality in chiral edge current-based electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Dynamic correlations of frustrated quantum spins from high-temperature expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For quantum spin systems in equilibrium, the dynamic structure factor (DSF) is among the most feature-packed experimental observables. However, from a theory perspective it is often hard to simulate in an unbiased and accurate way, especially for frustrated and high-dimensional models at intermediate temperature. To address this challenge, we compute the DSF from a dynamic extension of the high-temperature expansion to frequency moments. We focus on nearest-neighbor Heisenberg models with spin-lengths S=1/2 and 1. We provide comprehensive benchmarks and consider a variety of frustrated two- and three-dimensional antiferromagnets as applications. In particular we shed new light on the anomalous intermediate temperature regime of the S=1/2 triangular lattice model and reproduce the DSF measured recently for the S=1 pyrochlore material NaCaNi2F7. An open-source numerical implementation for arbitrary lattice geometries is also provided.</description>

      <title>Many-body localization in a quantum Ising model with the long-range interaction: Accurate determination of the transition point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) transition emerges at strong disorder in interacting systems, separating chaotic and reversible dynamics. Although the existence of MBL transition within the macroscopic limit in spin chains with a short-range interaction was proved rigorously, the transition point is not found yet because of the dramatic sensitivity of the transition point to the chain length at computationally accessible lengths, possible due to local fluctuations destroying localization. Here we investigate MBL transition in the quantum Ising model (Ising model in a transverse field) with the long-range interaction suppressing the fluctuations similarly to that for the second-order phase transitions. We estimate the MBL threshold within the logarithmic accuracy using exact results for a somewhat similar localization problem on a Bethe lattice problem and show that our expectations are fully consistent with the estimate of the transition point using exact diagonalization. In spite of unlimited growing of the critical disorder within the thermodynamic limit, this result offers the opportunity to probe the critical behavior of the system near the transition point. Moreover, the model is relevant for the wide variety of physical systems with the long-range dipole-dipole, elastic or indirect exchange interactions.</description>

      <title>High-temperature series expansion of the dynamic Matsubara spin correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high-temperature series expansion for quantum spin models is a well-established tool to compute thermodynamic quantities and equal-time spin correlations, in particular for frustrated interactions. We extend the scope of this expansion to the dynamic Matsubara spin-spin correlator and develop an algorithm that yields exact expansion coefficients in the form of rational numbers. We focus on Heisenberg models with a single coupling constant J and spin lengths S=1/2 and 1. The expansion coefficients up to 12th order in J/T are precomputed on all possible ~10^6 graphs embeddable in arbitrary lattices and are provided under {https://github.com/bsbierski/Dyn-HTE}. This enables calculation of static momentum-resolved susceptibilities for arbitrary site-pairs or wavevectors. We test our results for the S=1/2 Heisenberg chain and on the triangular lattice model. An important application that we discuss in a companion letter is the calculation of real-frequency dynamic structure factors. This is achieved by identifying the high-frequency expansion coefficients of the Matsubara correlator with frequency moments of the spectral function.</description>

      <title>Time-bin encoded quantum key distribution over 120 km with a telecom quantum dot source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) with deterministic single photon sources has been demonstrated over intercity fiber and free-space channels. The previous implementations relied mainly on polarization encoding schemes, which are susceptible to birefringence, polarization-mode dispersion and polarization-dependent loss in practical fiber networks. In contrast, time-bin encoding offers inherent robustness and has been widely adopted in mature QKD systems using weak coherent laser pulses. However, its feasibility in conjunction with a deterministic single-photon source has not yet been experimentally demonstrated. In this work, we construct a time-bin encoded QKD system employing a high-brightness quantum dot (QD) single-photon source operating at telecom wavelength. Our proof-of-concept experiment successfully demonstrates the possibility of secure key distribution over fiber link of 120 km, while maintaining extraordinary long-term stability over 6 hours of continuous operation. This work provides the first experimental validation of integrating a quantum dot single-photon source with time-bin encoding in a telecom-band QKD system. In addition, it demonstrates the highest secure key rate among the time-bin QKDs based on single-photon sources. This development signifies a substantial advancement in the establishment of a robust and scalable QKD network based on solid-state single-photon technology</description>

      <title>Competing edge and bulk localisation in non-reciprocal disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the competing mechanisms of localisation in one-dimensional block disordered subwavelength resonator systems subject to non-reciprocal damping, induced by an imaginary gauge potential. Using a symmetrisation approach to enable the adaptation of tools from Hermitian systems, we derive the limiting spectral distribution of these systems as the number of blocks goes to infinity and characterise their spectral properties in terms of the spectral properties of their constituent blocks. By employing a transfer matrix approach, we then clarify, in terms of Lyapunov exponents, the competition between the edge localisation due to imaginary gauge potentials and the bulk localisation due to disorder. In particular, we demonstrate how the disorder acts as insulation against the non-Hermitian skin effect, preventing edge localisation for small imaginary gauge potentials.</description>
