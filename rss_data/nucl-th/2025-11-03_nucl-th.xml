      <title>Double pole $S$-matrix singularity in the continuum of $^7$Be</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double pole singularity of the $S$-matrix, the so-called exceptional point, associated with the $5/2^-$ doublet of resonances in the spectrum of $^{7}$Be has been identified in the framework of the Gamow shell model. The exceptional point singularity is demonstrated by the coalescence of wave functions and spectral functions of the two resonances, as well as by the singular behavior of spectroscopic factors and electromagnetic transitions.</description>

      <title>Semi-classical and boson descriptions of scissors states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two interacting rotors Hamiltonian is alternatively treated semi-classically and by a Dyson boson expansion method. The linearized equations of motion lead to dispersion equation for the wobbling frequency. One defined a ground band with energies consisting in a rotational part and one half of the vibrational wobbling energy. Adding to each state energy the corresponding wobbling quanta one obtains the first excited band. Phonon amplitudes are used to calculate the reduced probability for the inter-band M1 transitions. The states exhibit a shears character. One points out a chiral symmetry which is broken by the interaction term, leading to a pair of twin chiral bands. Applications are made for $^{156}$Gd. One outlines the ability of the two rotor model to account for the wobbling and chiral motion in nuclei. Although the chosen trial function has not a definite total angular momentum, for two particular ansatz of the pairs $I_p,I_n$ the average value of the total angular momentum approximates,
  to a certain accuracy, the partial angular momentum $I_p$ In this context, the rotational bands defined throughout this present paper could be labeled by the total I.</description>

      <title>Holographic equation of state matched with hadron gas equation as a tool for the study of the quark-gluon plasma evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the matching of the holographic equation of state with the equation of Hadron Resonance Gas for studying the nuclear matter properties within the framework of relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Machine learning methods are applied to the calibration of model's free parameters using the lattice QCD results for the physical values of quark masses. One of the most advanced procedures for matching is used with the function that approximate behavior of both models on particular limit adopted from NEOS equation. Final hadronic spectra are obtained within multi-staged numerical approach of the iEBE-MUSIC and SMASH-vHLLE packages. The code of relativistic hydrodynamics is modified by implementing a tabulated holographic equation of state, enabling simulations of quark-gluon plasma evolution with dynamically generated initial conditions via the 3D Monte Carlo Glauber Model and SMASH. Hybrid iSS+UrQMD and Hadron Sampler+SMASH approaches are utilized at the freeze-out stage.</description>

      <title>Finite density QCD phase structure from strangeness fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Charting the phase diagram of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) at large density is a challenging task due to the complex action problem in lattice simulations. Through simulations at imaginary baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$ we observe that, if the strangeness neutrality condition is imposed, both the strangeness chemical potential $\mu_S/\mu_B$ and the strangeness susceptibility $\chi_2^S$ take on constant values at the chiral transition for varying $\mu_B$. We present new lattice data to extrapolate contours of constant $\mu_S/\mu_B$ or $\chi_2^S$ to finite baryon chemical potential. We argue that they are good proxies for the QCD crossover because, as we show, they are only mildly influenced by criticality and by finite volume effects. We obtain continuum limits for these proxies up to $\mu_B = 400$ MeV, through a next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^2$LO) Taylor expansion based on large-statistics data on $16^3 \times 8$, $20^3 \times 10$ and $24^3 \times 12$ lattices with our 4HEX improved staggered action. We show that these are in excellent agreement with existing results for the chiral transition and, strikingly, also with analogous contours obtained with the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model. On the $16^3 \times 8$ lattice, we carry out the expansion up to next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^4$LO), and extend the extrapolation beyond $\mu_B=500$ MeV, again finding perfect agreement with the HRG model. This suggests that the crossover line constructed from this proxy starts deviating from the chemical freeze-out line near $\mu_B\approx500$ MeV, as expected but not yet observed.</description>

      <title>Automated event generation for S-wave quarkonium and leptonium production in NRQCD and NRQED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extension of the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework that enables the automated calculation of leading-order cross sections for S-wave quarkonium and leptonium production within the non-relativistic QCD (NRQCD) and non-relativistic QED (NRQED) factorisation formalisms. The framework has been validated against a variety of benchmark processes, demonstrating robustness and flexibility for phenomenological studies. A key advantage of this implementation is its seamless integration with existing MadGraph5_aMC@NLO features, allowing computations not only within the Standard Model but also in a wide range of Beyond the Standard Model or Effective Field Theory scenarios via a modified Universal Feynman Output (UFO) interface. Furthermore, the framework maintains compatibility with standard Monte Carlo event generators for parton showering and hadronisation. Through numerous examples, we highlight that theoretical studies of quarkonium processes require careful consideration: the impact of subleading contributions is often difficult to predict using simple counting arguments based solely on the hierarchy of couplings and velocity-scaling rules.</description>

      <title>Improved calculation of radiative corrections to $\boldsymbol{\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A reliable calculation of radiative corrections to $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ decays is an important prerequisite for using hadronic $\tau$ decays for a data-driven evaluation of the hadronic-vacuum-polarization contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$. In this Letter, we present an improved model-independent analysis of these radiative corrections, including, for the first time, effects beyond point-like pions in the evaluation of the loop diagrams. These structure-dependent corrections, implemented via a dispersive representation of the pion form factor, lead to significant changes compared to previous calculations due to enhancements near the $\rho(770)$ resonance. We also devise strategies for the matching to chiral perturbation theory and a stable implementation of the real corrections down to the two-pion threshold, which shows that some higher-order isospin-breaking corrections need to be kept due to a strong threshold enhancement. Finally, we perform dispersive fits to the currently available $\tau\to\pi\pi\nu_\tau$ spectra and discuss the consequences for isospin-breaking corrections in the evaluation of $a_\mu^\text{HVP, LO}[\pi\pi,\tau]$.</description>

      <title>Trapping-potential dependence of the unitary Fermi gas at the BCS-BEC crossover</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold-atom experiments which measure Fermi-gas properties near unitarity confine fermionic atoms to a region of space using trapping potentials of various shapes. The presence of a trapping potential introduces a new characteristic physical scale in the superfluid EFT which, inter alia, describes the acoustic branch of excitations in the far infrared well below the scale of the superfluid gap. In this EFT there is a clear hierarchy of scales, and corrections to the homogeneous system due to the trapping potential may be organized into three regions with distinct power counting that relies on both the EFT derivative expansion, and the WKB approximation, which is an expansion in gradients of the trapping potential. The energy spectrum of the superfluid system is obtained in each of the regions by explicit computation of the phonon-field fluctuations, and by the modifications to the dynamic structure factor due to the corresponding density fluctuations. The most significant deviations from linear dispersion due to the trapping potential are found in the far infrared region of the superfluid EFT.</description>

      <title>Baryon anti-Baryon Photoproduction Cross Sections off the Proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The GlueX experiment at Jefferson Lab has observed $p\bar{p}$ and, for the first time, $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ and $p\bar{\Lambda}$ photoproduction from a proton target at photon energies up to 11.6 GeV. The angular distributions are forward peaked for all produced pairs, consistent with Regge-like $t$-channel exchange. Asymmetric wide-angle anti-baryon distributions show the presence of additional processes. In a phenomenological model, we find consistency with a double $t$-channel exchange process where anti-baryons are created only at the middle vertex. The model matches all observed distributions with a small number of free parameters. In the hyperon channels, we observe a clear distinction between photoproduction of the $\Lambda\bar{\Lambda}$ and $p\bar{\Lambda}$ systems but general similarity to the $p\bar{p}$ system. We report both total cross sections and cross sections differential with respect to momentum transfer and the invariant masses of the created particle pairs. No narrow resonant structures were found in these reaction channels. The suppression of $s\bar{s}$ quark pairs relative to $d\bar{d}$ quark pairs is similar to what has been seen in other reactions.</description>

      <title>First evidence for the J$&gt;$1 components of the pygmy dipole resonance in neutron-rich nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gamma ($\gamma$) decay shapes the synthesis of heavy elements in neutron-rich nuclear environments of neutron star mergers, supplying the Universe with heavy elements. The low-energy pygmy dipole resonance (PDR) influences nuclear reaction rates of the rapid nucleosynthesis through enhanced $\gamma$ transitions. However, since it is difficult to reproduce astrophysical conditions in laboratories, PDR was previously observed only in $J = 1$ spin states. Here we report the first experimental observation of $J &gt; 1$ components of PDR, identified in the $\beta$-delayed $\gamma$ decay of the J$^{\pi}$ = 3$^{-}$ spin-parity isomer of $^{80}$Ga. The data analysis, combined with decay information and theoretical calculations allows the identification of resonant structures below the neutron emission threshold of the neutron-rich germanium $^{80}$Ge as J$^{\pi} = (2,3)^-$ components of the PDR built on the low-lying J$^{\pi}$ = 2$^+$ quadrupole state. Our findings extend the concept of PDR beyond dipole states, with implications for nuclear structure theory and experiment, as well as the element production in the cosmos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To study cross sections and polarization asymmetries for the processes $e p \to e n \pi^+$ and $e p \to e p \pi^0$ in the backward region, we develop a flexible phenomenological model for nucleon-to-pion transition distribution amplitudes ($\pi N$ TDAs), which are used in the QCD collinear factorization description of the scattering amplitudes. Our model is based on the two-component factorized Ansatz for the corresponding spectral densities, quadruple distribution. It takes into account the constraints for $\pi N$ TDAs arising from the threshold pion production theorem and also includes a forward limit contribution that can be fitted to experimental data. We examine the sensitivity of observable predictions to various modelling assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that recent advances in QED theory of Li-like ions [V. A. Yerokhin et al., Phys. Rev. A 112, 042801 (2025)] enable determinations of absolute nuclear charge radii for heavy elements. By incorporating constraints derived from electron-scattering data, we obtain radii that are independent of the assumed model of the nuclear charge distribution. Our approach is validated for $^{208}$Pb, a well-studied spherical nucleus, and is then applied to $^{209}$Bi, where low-lying nuclear excitations complicate the interpretation of muonic-atom data.</description>

      <title>Equation-of-state-informed pulse profile modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NICER has enabled mass-radius inferences for pulsars using pulse profile modeling, providing constraints on the equation of state (EOS) of cold, dense matter. To date, PPM and EOS inference have been carried out as two separate steps, with the former using EOS-agnostic priors. This approach has several drawbacks. Ideally, one would perform a fully hierarchical Bayesian inference where the pulse profile and EOS model parameters are jointly fit, but implementing such a framework is complex and computationally demanding. Here, we present an intermediate solution introducing an EOS-informed prior on mass-radius into the existing PPM pipeline using normalizing flows. By focusing on the parameter space consistent with certain EOSs, this approach both tightens constraints on neutron star parameters while reducing computational costs and requiring minimal additional implementation effort. We test this approach on two pulsars, PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0437-4715, and with two EOS model families: a model based on the speed of sound inside the neutron star interior (CS) and a piecewise-polytropic (PP) model. Both EOS models implement constraints from chiral effective field theory calculations of dense matter. For both pulsar datasets, the inferred radius credible intervals are narrower than in the EOS-agnostic case, with CS favoring smaller radii and PP favoring larger radii. For PSR J0437-4715, the EOS-informed priors reveal a new, more extreme geometric mode that is statistically favored but physically questionable. Including the PPM posteriors in the subsequent EOS inference further tightens the mass-radius posteriors through the chiral effective field theory constraints. However, there is also a sensitivity to the high-density extensions, where the PP (CS) model produces a shift towards larger (smaller) radii and corresponding stiffening (softening) of the pressure-energy density relation.</description>

Abstract: We present the first next-to-leading-logarithmic QCD analysis of the electromagnetic corrections to the semileptonic weak Hamiltonian, including the mixed $\mathcal{O}(\alpha\,\alpha_s^2)$ corrections to the vector coupling $g_V$. The analysis combines the evaluation of three-loop anomalous dimensions and two-loop matching corrections with a consistent factorization of short-distance QCD effects. The latter is implemented through a scheme change based on a $d$-dimensional operator product expansion performed inside the loop integrals. The resulting renormalization-group--improved expression for the radiative correction $\Delta^V_R = 2.432(16)\%$ can be systematically refined using input from lattice QCD and perturbation theory and improves the consistency of first-row CKM unitarity tests.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric extensions of nuclear equations of state: probing the breakdown scale of relativistic mean-field theory</title>

Abstract: Phenomenological calculations of the properties of dense matter, such as relativistic mean-field theories, represent a pathway to predicting the microscopic and macroscopic properties of neutron stars. However, such theories do not generically have well-controlled uncertainties and may break down within neutron stars. To faithfully represent the uncertainty in this breakdown scale, we develop a hybrid representation of the dense-matter equation of state, which assumes the form of a relativistic mean-field theory at low densities, while remaining agnostic to any nuclear theory at high densities. To achieve this, we use a nonparametric equation of state model to incorporate the correlations of the underlying relativistic mean-field theory equation of state at low pressures and transition to more flexible correlations above some chosen pressure scale. We perform astrophysical inference under various choices of the transition pressure between the theory-informed and theory-agnostic models. We further study whether the chosen relativistic mean-field theory breaks down above some particular pressure and find no such evidence. Using simulated data for future astrophysical observations at about two-to-three times the precision of current constraints, we show that our method can identify the breakdown pressure associated with a potential strong phase transition.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear analysis of causality for heat flow in heavy-ion collisions: constraints from equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the causal parameter space of the Mueller-Israel-Stewart second-order theory for heat-conducting fluids in nonlinear regimes for one-dimensional fluid flow. We show that this parameter space is highly constrained and particularly sensitive to the equation of state and second-order transport coefficients. Through numerical analysis of the characteristic equations, we identify regions of strong hyperbolicity, weak hyperbolicity, and non-hyperbolicity, mapping the boundaries of causality violation as functions of the heat flux to energy density ratio $q/\varepsilon$ and relaxation parameters. We also explore the causality conditions using a realistic lattice QCD-based equation of state. Using the Navier-Stokes approximation, we estimate the heat flow magnitude to assess causality criteria for one-dimensional heat conduction in heavy-ion collisions. Our calculations reveal unrealistically large heat flux values ($|{\bf{q}}|/\varepsilon \sim 330-811$) for typical RHIC conditions when using thermal conductivity estimates from kinetic theory models, suggesting either significant overestimation of transport coefficients or breakdown of the fluid approximation in these extreme conditions. The pressure gradient corrections reduce the heat flow by approximately 15\% but do not resolve the causality concerns.</description>

      <title>Local spin polarization by color-field correlators and momentum anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local spin polarization of quarks induced by color-field correlators stemming from the correlation of chromo-Lorentz force and chromo-magnetic polarization or chromo-spin Hall effect in the presence of momentum anisotropy. Such effects can trigger longitudinal polarization from fluctuating color fields in glasma or quark gluon plasma phases with transverse expansion for relativistic heavy ion collisions. Especially, from the glasma effect, the resulting longitudinal polarization spectrum of $\Lambda/\bar{\Lambda}$ hyperons has a sinusoidal structure with twice the azimuthal angle relative to the anisotropic direction. An order-of-magnitude estimate of the effect aligns with experimental observations. Our findings highlight the significant role of coherent gluon fields as a novel source for spin polarization phenomena in high-energy nuclear collisions.</description>
