      <title>Geoff: The Generic Optimization Framework &amp; Frontend for Particle Accelerator Controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geoff is a collection of Python packages that form a framework for automation of particle accelerator controls. With particle accelerator laboratories around the world researching machine learning techniques to improve accelerator performance and uptime, a multitude of approaches and algorithms have emerged. The purpose of Geoff is to harmonize these approaches and to minimize friction when comparing or migrating between them. It provides standardized interfaces for optimization problems, utility functions to speed up development, and a reference GUI application that ties everything together. Geoff is an open-source library developed at CERN and maintained and updated in collaboration between CERN and GSI as part of the EURO-LABS project. This paper gives an overview over Geoff's design, features, and current usage.</description>

      <title>Recent results from MicroBooNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modelling and reconstructing neutrino-nucleus scattering is difficult, but it is crucial to do it precisely to enable next-generation oscillation measurements. Liquid argon time projection chambers (LArTPCs), such as MicroBooNE, can be the tool for this job as they are excellent precision neutrino detectors with their ability to produce detailed three-dimensional interaction images and precise energy and spatial resolution. MicroBooNE currently possesses the world's largest neutrino-argon scattering data set collected over five years using the BNB and NuMI neutrino beams at Fermilab. The experiment has performed measurements over a broad range of physics topics including neutrino argon cross sections, searches for BSM physics, and investigations of the MiniBooNE LEE excess. Many of these measurements are essential for improving the modelling of nuclear effects for both MicroBooNE and future LArTPC neutrino experiments, such as DUNE. This talk will give an overview of recent MicroBooNE results, the analysis techniques that enable them, and prospects for future measurements.</description>

      <title>Laser-plasma acceleration in a conical plasma channel with longitudinally inhomogeneous plasma profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-plasma acceleration is considered as a modern method of accelerating bunches using a wakefield excited by a laser pulse. This paper demonstrates the use of a longitudinally inhomogeneous increasing plasma density gradient in a conical channel to increase of the energy of a self-injected bunch. Comparison of a conical channels with homogeneous and inhomogeneous plasma and also conical and cylindrical homogeneous channels, shows a clear advantage of an inhomogeneous conical channel. The longitudinally inhomogeneous plasma helps to maintain the self-injected bunch in the wakefield acceleration phase and increases the accelerating gradient. The conical geometry prevents laser pulse expanding, and compress it. The combined effect was shown: the inhomogeneous plasma use, the effect of a conical geometry led to significant increasing the accelerating gradient and longitudinal momentum of the bunch.</description>

      <title>ILC250 Cost Update -- 2024</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The International Linear Collider was conceived as a global project for an energy-frontier electron-positron collider.It employs superconducting RF and nano-beam technologies with a center-of-mass energy of 500 GeV. Its cost was estimated in 2013, based on the Technical Design Report published in 2013.Japan's high-energy community proposed to host the ILC in Japan as a Higgs boson factory at 250 GeV in its first phase, and a revised cost estimate was conducted in 2017 to host it in Japan. However, due to global price increases and currency fluctuations that emerged afterward, the 2017 estimate is now outdated. A new cost evaluation has therefore been performed, according for global inflation tends, exchange rate shifts, and recent experiences in SRF based accelerators. This report describes the cost update performed in 2024. The cost update is included in the ILC Status Report in May 2025, contributing to the ongoing 2026 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics.</description>

      <title>Anomalous pinch in electron-electron beam collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09398v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that an anomalous pinch can occur in ultrarelativistic electron-electron or positron-positron beam interaction, caused by the combined interplay of collective beam motion (disruption) and strong-field quantum electrodynamics (SF-QED). The locally created electron-positron pairs, from SF-QED effects, screen the self-fields of the beams and can invert the polarity of the Lorentz force resulting in a pinch of the beams. A theoretical model predicts the pinch condition and is confirmed by first-principles 3-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. This anomalous pinch enhances density compression, increases the collision luminosity, and amplifies the local magnetic fields and the quantum parameter of the beam particles by several orders of magnitude.</description>
