      <title>Configuration and EMT Simulation of the 240-bus MiniWECC System Integrating Offshore Wind Farms (OWFs)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As offshore wind farms (OWFs) become increasingly prevalent in Northern California and Southern Oregon, they introduce faster dynamics into the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) system, reshaping its dynamic behavior. Accordingly, electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation is essential to assess high frequency dynamics of the WECC system with integrated OWFs. Against this background, this paper presents the integration of detailed dynamic models of OWFs into a 240-bus miniWECC system in PSCAD software. The sequential initialization technique is employed to facilitate the smooth initiation of a large-scale system in an EMT simulation. The performance of the configured model is assessed under wind speed variations and grounded faults, demonstrating the effectiveness of the miniWECC system with OWFs. This system serves as a valuable basic use case for validating the fast dynamic performance of future WECC systems with high penetration of wind energy.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Prescribed-Time Safety for Control of Unknown Systems with Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many control system applications, state constraint satisfaction needs to be guaranteed within a prescribed time. While this issue has been partially addressed for systems with known dynamics, it remains largely unaddressed for systems with unknown dynamics. In this paper, we propose a Gaussian process-based time-varying control method that leverages backstepping and control barrier functions to achieve safety requirements within prescribed time windows. It can be used to keep a system within a safe region or to make it return to a safe region within a limited time window. These properties are cemented by rigorous theoretical results. The effectiveness of the proposed controller is demonstrated in a simulation of a robotic manipulator.</description>

      <title>System Design Approach for Control of Differentially Private Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to concurrently design dynamic controllers and correlated differential privacy noise in dynamic control systems. An increase in privacy noise increases the system's privacy but adversely affects the system's performance. Our approach optimizes the noise distribution while shaping closed-loop system dynamics such that the privacy noise has the least impact on system performance and the most effect on system privacy. We further add privacy noise to both control input and system output to privatize the system's state for an adversary with access to both communication channels and direct output measurements. The study also suggests tailored privacy bounds for different states, providing a comprehensive framework for jointly optimizing system performance and privacy in the context of differential privacy.</description>

This paper presents an exploration of the application of DA to adaptive filtering (AF) algorithms, analyzing trends, discussing challenges, and outlining future prospects. It begins by providing an overview of both DA and AF algorithms, highlighting their individual merits and established applications. Subsequently, the integration of DA into AF algorithms is explored, showcasing its ability to optimize multiply-accumulate operations and mitigate the computational burden associated with AF algorithms. Throughout the paper, the critical trends observed in the field are discussed, including advancements in DA-based hardware architectures. Moreover, the challenges encountered in implementing DA-based AF is also discussed. The continued evolution of DA techniques to cater to the demands of modern AF applications, including real-time processing, resource-constrained environments, and high-dimensional data streams is anticipated. In conclusion, this paper consolidates the current state of applying DA to AF algorithms, offering insights into prevailing trends, discussing challenges, and presenting future research and development in the field. The fusion of these two domains holds promise for achieving improved computational efficiency, reduced hardware complexity, and enhanced performance in various signal processing applications.</description>

      <title>Guaranteeing Service in Connected Microgrids: Storage Planning and Optimal Power Sharing Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of renewable energy sources (RES) into power distribution grids poses challenges to system reliability due to the inherent uncertainty in their power production. To address this issue, battery energy sources (BESs) are being increasingly used as a promising solution to counter the uncertainty associated with RES power production. During the overall system planning stage, the optimal capacity of the BES has to be decided. In the operational phase, policies on when to charge the BESs and when to use them to support loads must be determined so that the BES remains within its operating range, avoiding depletion of charge on one hand and remaining within acceptable margins of maximum charge on the other. In this paper, a stochastic control framework is used to determine battery capacity, for microgrids, which ensures that during the operational phase, BESs' operating range is respected with pre-specified high probability. We provide an explicit analytical expression of the required BESs energy capacity for a single microgrid with RES as the main power source. Leveraging insights from the single microgrid case, the article focuses on the design and planning of BESs for the two-microgrid scenario. In this setting, microgrids are allowed to share power while respecting the capacity constraints imposed by the power lines. We characterize the optimal power transfer policy between the microgrids and the optimal BES capacity for multiple microgrids. This provides the BES savings arising from connecting the microgrids.</description>

      <title>Differential Privacy in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems with Tracking Performance Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to make the tracking error of a class of nonlinear systems differentially private in addition to guaranteeing the tracking error performance. We use funnel control to make the tracking error evolve within a performance funnel that is pre-specified by the user. We make the performance funnel differentially private by adding a bounded continuous noise generated from an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-type process. Since the funnel controller is a function of the performance funnel, the noise adds randomized perturbation to the control input. We show that, as a consequence of the differential privacy of the performance funnel, the tracking error is also differentially private. As a result, the tracking error is bounded by the noisy funnel boundary while maintaining privacy. We show a simulation result to demonstrate the framework.</description>

      <title>Prototyping and Experimental Results for Environment-Aware Millimeter Wave Beam Alignment via Channel Knowledge Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel knowledge map (CKM), which aims to directly reflect the intrinsic channel properties of the local wireless environment, is a novel technique for achieving environmentaware communication. In this paper, to alleviate the large training overhead in millimeter wave (mmWave) beam alignment, an environment-aware and training-free beam alignment prototype is established based on a typical CKM, termed beam index map (BIM). To this end, a general CKM construction method is first presented, and an indoor BIM is constructed offline to learn the candidate transmit and receive beam index pairs for each grid in the experimental area. Furthermore, based on the location information of the receiver (or the dynamic obstacles) from the ultra-wide band (UWB) positioning system, the established BIM is used to achieve training-free beam alignment by directly providing the beam indexes for the transmitter and receiver. Three typical scenarios are considered in the experiment, including quasi-static environment with line-of-sight (LoS) link, quasistatic environment without LoS link and dynamic environment. Besides, the receiver orientation measured from the gyroscope is also used to help CKM predict more accurate beam indexes. The experiment results show that compared with the benchmark location-based beam alignment strategy, the CKM-based beam alignment strategy can achieve much higher received power, which is close to that achieved by exhaustive beam search, but with significantly reduced training overhead.</description>

      <title>LLM-Assisted Light: Leveraging Large Language Model Capabilities for Human-Mimetic Traffic Signal Control in Complex Urban Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic congestion in metropolitan areas presents a formidable challenge with far-reaching economic, environmental, and societal ramifications. Therefore, effective congestion management is imperative, with traffic signal control (TSC) systems being pivotal in this endeavor. Conventional TSC systems, designed upon rule-based algorithms or reinforcement learning (RL), frequently exhibit deficiencies in managing the complexities and variabilities of urban traffic flows, constrained by their limited capacity for adaptation to unfamiliar scenarios. In response to these limitations, this work introduces an innovative approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) into TSC, harnessing their advanced reasoning and decision-making faculties. Specifically, a hybrid framework that augments LLMs with a suite of perception and decision-making tools is proposed, facilitating the interrogation of both the static and dynamic traffic information. This design places the LLM at the center of the decision-making process, combining external traffic data with established TSC methods. Moreover, a simulation platform is developed to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed framework. The findings from our simulations attest to the system's adeptness in adjusting to a multiplicity of traffic environments without the need for additional training. Notably, in cases of Sensor Outage (SO), our approach surpasses conventional RL-based systems by reducing the average waiting time by $20.4\%$. This research signifies a notable advance in TSC strategies and paves the way for the integration of LLMs into real-world, dynamic scenarios, highlighting their potential to revolutionize traffic management.

      <title>Remote UGV Control via Practical Wireless Channels: A Model Predictive Control Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In addressing wireless networked control systems (WNCS) subject to unexpected packet loss and uncertainties, this paper presents a practical Model Predictive Control (MPC) based control scheme with considerations of of packet dropouts, latency, process noise and measurement noise. A discussion of the quasi-static Rayleigh fading channel is presented herein to enhance the realism of the underlying assumption in a real-world context. To achieve a desirable performance, the proposed control scheme leverages the predictive capabilities of a direct multiple shooting MPC, employs a compensation strategy to mitigate the impact of wireless channel imperfections. Instead of feeding noisy measurements into the MPC, we employ an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to mitigate the influence of measurement noise and process disturbances. Finally, we implement the proposed MPC algorithm on a simulated Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) and conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of our control scheme across various scenarios. Through our simulation results and comparative analyses, we have substantiated the effectiveness and improvements brought about by our approach through the utilization of multiple metrics.</description>

      <title>Mechanism Design Optimization through CAD-Based Bayesian Optimization and Quantified Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research delves into optimizing mechanism design, with an emphasis on the energy efficiency and the expansive design possibilities of reciprocating mechanisms. It investigates how to efficiently integrate Computer-Aided Design (CAD) simulations with Bayesian Optimization (BO) and a constrained design space, aiming to enhance the design optimization process beyond the confines of traditional kinematic and dynamic analysis. The study sets out to create a novel optimization framework that merges CAD simulations with a BO strategy. Initially, the feasibility of a mechanism design is assessed through CAD-motion simulations, which gauge its practicality. Upon deeming a design feasible, an evaluation via CAD-motion simulations is conducted to ascertain the objective value. This research proposes utilizing non-parametric Gaussian processes for crafting a surrogate model of the objective function, considering the design space's static and dynamic constraints. The findings reveal that the introduced CAD-based Bayesian Optimization framework adeptly identifies optimal design parameters that minimize root mean square (RMS) torque while complying with predetermined constraints. This method markedly diminishes the complexity seen in analytical approaches, rendering it adaptable to intricate mechanisms and practicable for machine builders. The framework evidences the utility of integrating constraints in the optimization process, showing promise for attaining globally optimal designs efficiently. A case study on an emergency ventilator, with three design parameters, demonstrates a 71% RMS torque reduction after 255 CAD-based evaluations, underscoring the approach's effectiveness and its potential for refining mechanism design optimization.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Sensor-Based Feedback Control for Obstacle Avoidance in Unknown Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the Safety Velocity Cones (SVCs) obstacle avoidance approach for real-time autonomous navigation in an unknown $n$-dimensional environment. We propose a locally Lipschitz continuous implementation of the SVC controller using the distance-to-the-obstacle function and its gradient. We then show that the proposed implementation guarantees safe navigation in generic environments and almost globally asymptotic stability (AGAS) of the desired destination when the workspace contains strongly convex obstacles. The proposed computationally efficient control algorithm can be implemented onboard vehicles equipped with limited range sensors (e.g., LiDAR, depth camera), allowing the controller to be locally evaluated without requiring prior knowledge of the environment.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Metaplasticity for Continual Learning with Memristors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crossbar architectures utilizing memristor devices hold promise to address continual learning challenges in resource-constrained edge devices. However, these nanoscale devices often exhibit low precision and high variability in conductance modulation, rendering them unsuitable for continual learning solutions that consolidate weights through precise modulation. This issue can be circumvented by accumulating weight gradients in auxiliary high-precision memory and updating memristor weights when gradients are equivalent to memristor weight resolution. However, it leads to frequent memory access, high memory overhead, and energy dissipation. In this research, we propose probabilistic metaplasticity, which consolidates weights by modulating their update probability rather than magnitude. The proposed mechanism eliminates high-precision modification to weight magnitude and consequently, high-precision memory for gradient accumulation. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed mechanism by integrating probabilistic metaplasticity into a spiking network trained on an error threshold with low-precision memristor weights. Evaluations of two continual learning benchmarks show that probabilistic metaplasticity consumes ~67% lower memory for additional parameters and up to two orders of magnitude lower energy during parameter updates compared to an auxiliary memory-based solution while achieving state-of-the-art performance. The proposed model shows potential for energy-efficient continual learning with low-precision emerging devices.</description>

      <title>Smart HPA: A Resource-Efficient Horizontal Pod Auto-scaler for Microservice Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microservice architectures have gained prominence in both academia and industry, offering enhanced agility, reusability, and scalability. To simplify scaling operations in microservice architectures, container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes feature Horizontal Pod Auto-scalers (HPAs) designed to adjust the resources of microservices to accommodate fluctuating workloads. However, existing HPAs are not suitable for resource-constrained environments, as they make scaling decisions based on the individual resource capacities of microservices, leading to service unavailability and performance degradation. Furthermore, HPA architectures exhibit several issues, including inefficient data processing and a lack of coordinated scaling operations. To address these concerns, we propose Smart HPA, a flexible resource-efficient horizontal pod auto-scaler. It features a hierarchical architecture that integrates both centralized and decentralized architectural styles to leverage their respective strengths while addressing their limitations. We introduce resource-efficient heuristics that empower Smart HPA to exchange resources among microservices, facilitating effective auto-scaling of microservices in resource-constrained environments. Our experimental results show that Smart HPA outperforms the Kubernetes baseline HPA by reducing resource overutilization, overprovisioning, and underprovisioning while increasing resource allocation to microservice applications.</description>

      <title>The Fusion of Deep Reinforcement Learning and Edge Computing for Real-time Monitoring and Control Optimization in IoT Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In response to the demand for real-time performance and control quality in industrial Internet of Things (IoT) environments, this paper proposes an optimization control system based on deep reinforcement learning and edge computing. The system leverages cloud-edge collaboration, deploys lightweight policy networks at the edge, predicts system states, and outputs controls at a high frequency, enabling monitoring and optimization of industrial objectives. Additionally, a dynamic resource allocation mechanism is designed to ensure rational scheduling of edge computing resources, achieving global optimization. Results demonstrate that this approach reduces cloud-edge communication latency, accelerates response to abnormal situations, reduces system failure rates, extends average equipment operating time, and saves costs for manual maintenance and replacement. This ensures real-time and stable control.</description>

      <title>Exponential Stability of Parametric Optimization-Based Controllers via Lur'e Contractivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of LTI systems driven by controllers derived from parametric optimization problems. Our primary focus is on parametric projection controllers, namely parametric programs whose objective function is the squared distance to a nominal controller. Leveraging the virtual system method of analysis and a novel contractivity result for Lur'e systems, we establish a sufficient LMI condition for the exponential stability of an LTI system with a parametric projection-based controller. Separately, we prove additional results for single-integrator systems. Finally, we apply our results to state-dependent saturated control systems and control barrier function-based control and provide numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Learning Barrier-Certified Polynomial Dynamical Systems for Obstacle Avoidance with Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Established techniques that enable robots to learn from demonstrations are based on learning a stable dynamical system (DS). To increase the robots' resilience to perturbations during tasks that involve static obstacle avoidance, we propose incorporating barrier certificates into an optimization problem to learn a stable and barrier-certified DS. Such optimization problem can be very complex or extremely conservative when the traditional linear parameter-varying formulation is used. Thus, different from previous approaches in the literature, we propose to use polynomial representations for DSs, which yields an optimization problem that can be tackled by sum-of-squares techniques. Finally, our approach can handle obstacle shapes that fall outside the scope of assumptions typically found in the literature concerning obstacle avoidance within the DS learning framework.

      <title>Perceive With Confidence: Statistical Safety Assurances for Navigation with Learning-Based Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid advances in perception have enabled large pre-trained models to be used out of the box for processing high-dimensional, noisy, and partial observations of the world into rich geometric representations (e.g., occupancy predictions). However, safe integration of these models onto robots remains challenging due to a lack of reliable performance in unfamiliar environments. In this work, we present a framework for rigorously quantifying the uncertainty of pre-trained perception models for occupancy prediction in order to provide end-to-end statistical safety assurances for navigation. We build on techniques from conformal prediction for producing a calibrated perception system that lightly processes the outputs of a pre-trained model while ensuring generalization to novel environments and robustness to distribution shifts in states when perceptual outputs are used in conjunction with a planner. The calibrated system can be used in combination with any safe planner to provide an end-to-end statistical assurance on safety in a new environment with a user-specified threshold $1-\epsilon$. We evaluate the resulting approach - which we refer to as Perceive with Confidence (PwC) - with experiments in simulation and on hardware where a quadruped robot navigates through indoor environments containing objects unseen during training or calibration. These experiments validate the safety assurances provided by PwC and demonstrate significant improvements in empirical safety rates compared to baselines.</description>

      <title>A Novel Feature Learning-based Bio-inspired Neural Network for Real-time Collision-free Rescue of Multi-Robot Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Natural disasters and urban accidents drive the demand for rescue robots to provide safer, faster, and more efficient rescue trajectories. In this paper, a feature learning-based bio-inspired neural network (FLBBINN) is proposed to quickly generate a heuristic rescue path in complex and dynamic environments, as traditional approaches usually cannot provide a satisfactory solution to real-time responses to sudden environmental changes. The neurodynamic model is incorporated into the feature learning method that can use environmental information to improve path planning strategies. Task assignment and collision-free rescue trajectory are generated through robot poses and the dynamic landscape of neural activity. A dual-channel scale filter, a neural activity channel, and a secondary distance fusion are employed to extract and filter feature neurons. After completion of the feature learning process, a neurodynamics-based feature matrix is established to quickly generate the new heuristic rescue paths with parameter-driven topological adaptability. The proposed FLBBINN aims to reduce the computational complexity of the neural network-based approach and enable the feature learning method to achieve real-time responses to environmental changes. Several simulations and experiments have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed FLBBINN. The results show that the proposed FLBBINN would significantly improve the speed, efficiency, and optimality for rescue operations.</description>

      <title>GRF-based Predictive Flocking Control with Dynamic Pattern Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is promising but challenging to design flocking control for a robot swarm to autonomously follow changing patterns or shapes in a optimal distributed manner. The optimal flocking control with dynamic pattern formation is, therefore, investigated in this paper. A predictive flocking control algorithm is proposed based on a Gibbs random field (GRF), where bio-inspired potential energies are used to charaterize ``robot-robot'' and ``robot-environment'' interactions. Specialized performance-related energies, e.g., motion smoothness, are introduced in the proposed design to improve the flocking behaviors. The optimal control is obtained by maximizing a posterior distribution of a GRF. A region-based shape control is accomplished for pattern formation in light of a mean shift technique. The proposed algorithm is evaluated via the comparison with two state-of-the-art flocking control methods in an environment with obstacles. Both numerical simulations and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed design.</description>

Abstract: Designing control policies for stabilization tasks with provable guarantees is a long-standing problem in nonlinear control. A crucial performance metric is the size of the resulting region of attraction, which essentially serves as a robustness "margin" of the closed-loop system against uncertainties. In this paper, we propose a new method to train a stabilizing neural network controller along with its corresponding Lyapunov certificate, aiming to maximize the resulting region of attraction while respecting the actuation constraints. Crucial to our approach is the use of Zubov's Partial Differential Equation (PDE), which precisely characterizes the true region of attraction of a given control policy. Our framework follows an actor-critic pattern where we alternate between improving the control policy (actor) and learning a Zubov function (critic). Finally, we compute the largest certifiable region of attraction by invoking an SMT solver after the training procedure. Our numerical experiments on several design problems show consistent and significant improvements in the size of the resulting region of attraction.</description>

      <title>Regret Analysis of Policy Optimization over Submanifolds for Linearly Constrained Online LQG</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancement in online optimization and control has provided novel tools to study online linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problems, where cost matrices are varying adversarially over time. However, the controller parameterization of existing works may not satisfy practical conditions like sparsity due to physical connections. In this work, we study online linear quadratic Gaussian problems with a given linear constraint imposed on the controller. Inspired by the recent work of [1] which proposed, for a linearly constrained policy optimization of an offline LQR, a second order method equipped with a Riemannian metric that emerges naturally in the context of optimal control problems, we propose online optimistic Newton on manifold (OONM) which provides an online controller based on the prediction on the first and second order information of the function sequence. To quantify the proposed algorithm, we leverage the notion of regret defined as the sub-optimality of its cumulative cost to that of a (locally) minimizing controller sequence and provide the regret bound in terms of the path-length of the minimizer sequence. Simulation results are also provided to verify the property of OONM.</description>

      <title>Learning How to Strategically Disclose Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strategic information disclosure, in its simplest form, considers a game between an information provider (sender) who has access to some private information that an information receiver is interested in. While the receiver takes an action that affects the utilities of both players, the sender can design information (or modify beliefs) of the receiver through signal commitment, hence posing a Stackelberg game. However, obtaining a Stackelberg equilibrium for this game traditionally requires the sender to have access to the receiver's objective. In this work, we consider an online version of information design where a sender interacts with a receiver of an unknown type who is adversarially chosen at each round. Restricting attention to Gaussian prior and quadratic costs for the sender and the receiver, we show that $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret is achievable with full information feedback, where $T$ is the total number of interactions between the sender and the receiver. Further, we propose a novel parametrization that allows the sender to achieve $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret for a general convex utility function. We then consider the Bayesian Persuasion problem with an additional cost term in the objective function, which penalizes signaling policies that are more informative and obtain $\mathcal{O}(\log(T))$ regret. Finally, we establish a sublinear regret bound for the partial information feedback setting and provide simulations to support our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Sampled-Data Controller Synthesis using Dissipative Linear Periodic Jump-Flow Systems with Design Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we will propose linear-matrix-inequality-based techniques for the design of sampled-data controllers that render the closed-loop system dissipative with respect to \textcolor{blue}{quadratic supply functions}, which includes passivity and an upper-bound on the system's $\mathcal{H}_\infty$-norm as a special case. To arrive at these results, we model the sampled-data control system as a linear periodic jump-flow system, study dissipativity in terms of differential linear matrix inequalities (DLMIs) and then convert these DLMIs into a single linear matrix inequality. We will present three applications of these synthesis techniques: 1) passivity-based controller synthesis, as found in teleoperations, 2) input-output-response matching of a continuous-time filter with a discrete-time filter (by minimizing the $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$-norm of a generalized plant) and 3) a sampled-data controller redesign problem, where the objective is to find the best sampled-data controller, in the $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$-norm sense, for a given continuous-time controller. We will show that synthesising sampled-data controllers leads to better closed-loop system behaviour than using a Tustin discretization of a continuous-time controller.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Recursive Estimation in Adaptive Safety-Critical Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01901v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for online parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification in the context of adaptive safety-critical control. The key insight enabling our approach is that the parameter estimate generated by the continuous-time recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm at any point in time is an affine transformation of the initial parameter estimate. This property allows for parameterizing such estimates using objects that are closed under affine transformation, such as zonotopes, and enables the efficient propagation of such set-based estimates as time progresses. We illustrate how such an approach facilitates the synthesis of safety-critical controllers for systems with parametric uncertainty and additive disturbances using control barrier functions, and demonstrate the utility of our approach through illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation-Based States Reconstruction of Uncertain Linear Systems with Overparameterization and Unknown Additive Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.10289v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of state reconstruction is considered for uncertain linear time-invariant systems with overparameterization, arbitrary state-space matrices and unknown additive perturbation described by an exosystem. A novel adaptive observer is proposed to solve it, which, unlike known solutions, simultaneously: (i) reconstructs the physical state of the original system rather than the virtual state of its observer canonical form, (ii) ensures exponential convergence of the reconstruction error to zero when the condition of finite excitation is satisfied, (iii) is applicable to systems, in which mentioned perturbation is generated by an exosystem with fully uncertain constant parameters. The proposed solution uses a recently published parametrization of uncertain linear systems with unknown additive perturbations, the dynamic regressor extension and mixing procedure, as well as a method of physical states reconstruction developed by the authors. Detailed analysis for stability and convergence has been provided along with simulation results to validate the theoretical analysis.</description>

Abstract: Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) combines the representational power of neural networks with the uncertainty quantification of Gaussian Processes. Hence, it is potentially a promising tool to learn and control complex dynamical systems. In this work, we develop a scalable abstraction-based framework that enables the use of DKL for control synthesis of stochastic dynamical systems against complex specifications. Specifically, we consider temporal logic specifications and create an end-to-end framework that uses DKL to learn an unknown system from data and formally abstracts the DKL model into an Interval Markov Decision Process (IMDP) to perform control synthesis with correctness guarantees. Furthermore, we identify a deep architecture that enables accurate learning and efficient abstraction computation. The effectiveness of our approach is illustrated on various benchmarks, including a 5-D nonlinear stochastic system, showing how control synthesis with DKL can substantially outperform state-of-the-art competitive methods.</description>

Abstract: Distributed optimal control is known to be challenging and can become intractable even for linear-quadratic regulator problems. In this work, we study a special class of such problems where distributed state feedback controllers can give near-optimal performance. More specifically, we consider networked linear-quadratic controllers with decoupled costs and spatially exponentially decaying dynamics. We aim to exploit the structure in the problem to design a scalable reinforcement learning algorithm for learning a distributed controller. Recent work has shown that the optimal controller can be well approximated only using information from a $\kappa$-neighborhood of each agent. Motivated by these results, we show that similar results hold for the agents' individual value and Q-functions. We continue by designing an algorithm, based on the actor-critic framework, to learn distributed controllers only using local information. Specifically, the Q-function is estimated by modifying the Least Squares Temporal Difference for Q-functions method to only use local information. The algorithm then updates the policy using gradient descent. Finally, we evaluate the algorithm through simulations that indeed suggest near-optimal performance.</description>

      <title>Outlier Accommodation for GNSS Precise Point Positioning using Risk-Averse State Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliable and precise absolute positioning is necessary in the realm of Connected Automated Vehicles (CAV). Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provides the foundation for absolute positioning. Recently enhanced Precise Point Positioning (PPP) technology now offers corrections for GNSS on a global scale, with the potential to achieve accuracy suitable for real-time CAV applications. However, in obstructed sky conditions, GNSS signals are often affected by outliers; therefore, addressing outliers is crucial. In GNSS applications, there are many more measurements available than are required to meet the specification. Therefore, selecting measurements to avoid outliers is of interest. The recently developed Risk-Averse Performance-Specified (RAPS) state estimation optimally selects measurements to minimize outlier risk while meeting a positive semi-definite constraint on performance; at present, the existing solution methods are not suitable for real-time computation and have not been demonstrated using challenging real-world data or in Real-time PPP (RT-PPP) applications. This article makes contributions in a few directions. First, it uses a diagonal performance specification, which reduces computational costs relative to the positive semi-definite constraint. Second, this article considers GNSS RT-PPP applications. Third, the experiments use real-world GNSS data collected in challenging environments. The RT-PPP experimental results show that among the compared methods: all achieve comparable performance in open-sky conditions, and all exceed the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) specification; however, in challenging environments, the diagonal RAPS approach shows improvement of 6-19% over traditional methods. Throughout, RAPS achieves the lowest estimation risk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important problem in many areas of science is that of recovering interaction networks from simultaneous time-series of many interacting dynamical processes. A common approach is to use the elements of the correlation matrix or its inverse as proxies of the interaction strengths, but the reconstructed networks are necessarily undirected. Transfer entropy methods have been proposed to reconstruct directed networks but the reconstructed network lacks information about interaction strengths. We propose a network reconstruction method that inherits the best of the two approaches by reconstructing a directed weighted network from noisy data under the assumption that the network is sparse and the dynamics are governed by a linear (or weakly-nonlinear) stochastic dynamical system. The two steps of our method are i) constructing an (infinite) family of candidate networks by solving the covariance matrix Lyapunov equation for the state matrix and ii) using L1-regularization to select a sparse solution. We further show how to use prior information on the (non)existence of a few directed edges to drastically improve the quality of the reconstruction.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of ensuring safety with a few shots of samples for partially unknown systems. We first characterize a fundamental limit when producing safe actions is not possible due to insufficient information or samples. Then, we develop a technique that can generate provably safe actions and recovery behaviors using a minimum number of samples. In the performance analysis, we also establish Nagumos theorem - like results with relaxed assumptions, which is potentially useful in other contexts. Finally, we discuss how the proposed method can be integrated into a policy gradient algorithm to assure safety and stability with a handful of samples without stabilizing initial policies or generative models to probe safe actions.</description>

      <title>Can Direct Latent Model Learning Solve Linear Quadratic Gaussian Control?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the task of learning state representations from potentially high-dimensional observations, with the goal of controlling an unknown partially observable system. We pursue a direct latent model learning approach, where a dynamic model in some latent state space is learned by predicting quantities directly related to planning (e.g., costs) without reconstructing the observations. In particular, we focus on an intuitive cost-driven state representation learning method for solving Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control, one of the most fundamental partially observable control problems. As our main results, we establish finite-sample guarantees of finding a near-optimal state representation function and a near-optimal controller using the directly learned latent model. To the best of our knowledge, despite various empirical successes, prior to this work it was unclear if such a cost-driven latent model learner enjoys finite-sample guarantees. Our work underscores the value of predicting multi-step costs, an idea that is key to our theory, and notably also an idea that is known to be empirically valuable for learning state representations.</description>

      <title>OSMOSIS: Enabling Multi-Tenancy in Datacenter SmartNICs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-tenancy is essential for unleashing SmartNIC's potential in datacenters. Our systematic analysis in this work shows that existing on-path SmartNICs have resource multiplexing limitations. For example, existing solutions lack multi-tenancy capabilities such as performance isolation and QoS provisioning for compute and IO resources. Compared to standard NIC data paths with a well-defined set of offloaded functions, unpredictable execution times of SmartNIC kernels make conventional approaches for multi-tenancy and QoS insufficient. We fill this gap with OSMOSIS, a SmartNICs resource manager co-design. OSMOSIS extends existing OS mechanisms to enable dynamic hardware resource multiplexing of the on-path packet processing data plane. We integrate OSMOSIS within an open-source RISC-V-based 400Gbit/s SmartNIC. Our performance results demonstrate that OSMOSIS fully supports multi-tenancy and enables broader adoption of SmartNICs in datacenters with low overhead.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Dynamics Learning from Point Cloud Observations for Nonholonomic Mobile Robot Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable autonomous navigation requires adapting the control policy of a mobile robot in response to dynamics changes in different operational conditions. Hand-designed dynamics models may struggle to capture model variations due to a limited set of parameters. Data-driven dynamics learning approaches offer higher model capacity and better generalization but require large amounts of state-labeled data. This paper develops an approach for learning robot dynamics directly from point-cloud observations, removing the need and associated errors of state estimation, while embedding Hamiltonian structure in the dynamics model to improve data efficiency. We design an observation-space loss that relates motion prediction from the dynamics model with motion prediction from point-cloud registration to train a Hamiltonian neural ordinary differential equation. The learned Hamiltonian model enables the design of an energy-shaping model-based tracking controller for rigid-body robots. We demonstrate dynamics learning and tracking control on a real nonholonomic wheeled robot.</description>

      <title>Mixed Reality Environment and High-Dimensional Continuification Control for Swarm Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01573v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many new methodologies for the control of large-scale multi-agent systems are based on macroscopic representations of the emerging systemdynamics, in the form of continuum approximations of large ensembles. These techniques, that are typically developed in the limit case of an infinite number of agents, are usually validated only through numerical simulations. In this paper, we introduce a mixed reality set-up for testing swarm robotics techniques, focusing on the macroscopic collective motion of robotic swarms. This hybrid apparatus combines both real differential drive robots and virtual agents to create a heterogeneous swarm of tunable size. We also extend continuification-based control methods for swarms to higher dimensions, and assess experimentally their validity in the new platform. Our study demonstrates the effectiveness of the platform for conducting large-scale swarm robotics experiments, and it contributes new theoretical insights into control algorithms exploiting continuification approaches.</description>

      <title>Tightly Bounded Polynomials via Flexible Discretizations for Dynamic Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polynomials are widely used to represent the trajectories of states and/or inputs. It has been shown that a polynomial can be bounded by its coefficients, when expressed in the Bernstein basis. However, in general, the bounds provided by the Bernstein coefficients are not tight. We propose a method for obtaining numerical solutions to dynamic optimization problems, where a flexible discretization is used to achieve tight polynomial bounds. The proposed method is used to solve a constrained cart-pole swing-up optimal control problem. The flexible discretization eliminates the conservatism of the Bernstein bounds and enables a lower cost, in comparison with non-flexible discretizations. A theoretical result on obtaining tight polynomial bounds with a finite discretization is presented. In some applications with linear dynamics, the non-convexity introduced by the flexible discretization may be a drawback.</description>
