      <title>From Snaking to Isolas: A One-Active-Site Approximation in Discrete Optical Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate time-independent solutions of a discrete optical cavity model featuring saturable Kerr nonlinearity, a discrete version of the Lugiato-Lefever equation. This model supports continuous wave (uniform) and localized (discrete soliton) solutions. Stationary bright solitons arise through the interaction of dark and bright uniform states, forming a homoclinic snaking bifurcation diagram within the Pomeau pinning region. As the system approaches the anti-continuum limit (weak coupling), this snaking bifurcation widens and transitions into $\subset$-shaped isolas. We propose a one-active-site approximation that effectively captures the system's behavior in this regime. The approximation also provides insight into the stability properties of soliton states. Numerical continuation and spectral analysis confirm the accuracy of this semianalytical method, showing excellent agreement with the full model.</description>

      <title>Mode-locking in a semiconductor photonic bandgap laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimode lasers have a very complex dynamics, as expected when oscillators are nonlinearly coupled. Order emerges when the modes lock together; in this case the coherent superposition of the modes results into a periodic train of pulses or a nearly constant power output with a linearly chirped frequency, for instance. The first is promoted by a saturable absorber, or an equivalent physical mechanism, while the latter is connected to more subtle conditions, such as the fast dynamics of the gain. Here we consider the case of a multimode semiconductor laser with gain provided by quantum wells but without any saturable absorber. The cavity is designed to have a photonic bandgap and very low dispersion. We show, first in theory, that modes can lock together and generate a variety of waveforms which are not trains of pulses nor chirped continuous power waves. Mode locking is observed in experiments on a III-V/Silicon hybrid laser with the cavity made of a suitably tapered grating. Moreover, we find that the mode-locking beatnote is strongly dependent on the injected current: we reach more than 1 GHz modulation amplitude of the beatnote at a modulation frequency of 50 kHz. The behaviour of the laser is critically determined by the dispersion, which can be controlled by the photonic crystal structure. By scaling up the number of interacting modes, this laser source may offer an effective and extremely flexible way of generating waveforms \`a la carte.</description>

      <title>Instability bands for periodic traveling waves in the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two families of periodic traveling waves exist in the focusing mKdV (modified Korteweg-de Vries) equation. Spectral stability of these waveforms with respect to co-periodic perturbations of the same period has been previously explored by using spectral analysis and variational formulation. By using tools of integrability such as a relation between squared eigenfunctions of the Lax pair and eigenfunctions of the linearized stability problem, we revisit the spectral stability of these waveforms with respect to perturbations of arbitrary periods. In agreement with previous works, we find that one family is spectrally stable for all parameter configurations, whereas the other family is spectrally unstable for all parameter configurations. We show that the onset of the co-periodic instability for the latter family changes the instability bands from figure-$8$ (crossing at the imaginary axis) into figure-$\infty$ (crossing at the real axis).</description>

      <title>Traveling periodic waves and breathers in the nonlocal derivative NLS equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonlocal derivative NLS (nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger) equation describes modulations of waves in a stratified fluid and a continuous limit of the Calogero--Moser--Sutherland system of particles. For the defocusing version of this equation, we prove the linear stability of the nonzero constant background for decaying and periodic perturbations and the nonlinear stability for periodic perturbations. For the focusing version of this equation, we prove linear and nonlinear stability of the nonzero constant background under some restrictions. For both versions, we characterize the traveling periodic wave solutions by using Hirota's bilinear method, both on the nonzero and zero backgrounds. For each family of traveling periodic waves, we construct families of breathers which describe solitary waves moving across the stable background. A general breather solution with $N$ solitary waves propagating on the traveling periodic wave background is derived in a closed determinant form.</description>

      <title>Self-Adapted Josephson Oscillation of Dark-Bright Solitons under Constant Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the propagation of dark-bright solitons in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with general nonlinear parameters, and explore how nonlinear interactions enrich the soliton dynamics giving rise to nonsinusoidal oscillations under constant forces. Treating the bright soliton as an effective barrier, we reveal that such oscillations are characterized by the Josephson equations with self-adapted critical current and bias voltage, whose explicit analytic expressions are derived using the Lagrangian variational method. The dynamical phase diagram in nonlinear parameter space is presented, identifying oscillation regions with different skewed sinusoidal dependence, and diffusion regions with irreversible soliton spreading due to instability of the barrier. Furthermore, we obtain periodic dispersion relations of the solitons, indicating a switch between positive and negative inertial masses, consistent with the oscillation behaviors. Our results provide a general and comprehensive theoretical framework for soliton oscillation dynamics and pave the way for investigating various nonlinear transports and their potential applications.</description>

      <title>Small-amplitude synchronisation in driven Potts models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study driven $q$-state Potts models with thermodynamically consistent dynamics and global coupling. For a wide range of parameters, these models exhibit a dynamical phase transition from decoherent oscillations into a synchronised phase. Starting from a general microscopic dynamics for individual oscillators, we derive the normal form of the high-dimensional Hopf-Bifurcation that underlies the phase transition. The normal-form equations are exact in the thermodynamic limit and close to the bifurcation. Exploiting the symmetry of the model, we solve these equations and thus uncover the intricate stable synchronisation patterns of driven Potts models, characterised by a rich phase diagram. Making use of thermodynamic consistency, we show that synchronisation reduces dissipation in such a way that the most stable synchronised states dissipate the least entropy. Close to the phase transition, our findings condense into a linear dissipation-stability relation that connects entropy production with phase-space contraction, a stability measure. At finite system size, our findings suggest a minimum-dissipation principle for driven Potts models that holds arbitrarily far from equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Minimum-dissipation principle for synchronised stochastic oscillators far from equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14982v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a linear stability-dissipation relation (SDR) for $q$-state Potts models driven far from equilibrium by a nonconservative force. At a critical coupling strength, these models exhibit a synchronisation transition from a decoherent into a synchronised state. In the vicinity of this transition, the SDR connects the entropy production rate per oscillator to the phase-space contraction rate, a measure of stability, in a simple way. For large but finite systems, we argue that the SDR implies a minimum-dissipation principle for driven Potts models as the dynamics selects stable non-equilibrium states with least dissipation. This principle holds arbitrarily far from equilibrium, for any stochastic dynamics, and for all $q$.</description>

      <title>On zero-background solitons of the sharp-line Maxwell-Bloch equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work is devoted to systematically study general $N$-soliton solutions possibly containing multiple degenerate soliton groups (DSGs), in the context of the sharp-line Maxwell-Bloch equations with a zero background.We also show that results can be readily migrated to other integrable systems, with the same non-self-adjoint Zakharov-Shabat scattering problem or alike. Results for the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation and the complex modified Korteweg-De Vries equation are obtained as explicit examples for demonstrative purposes. A DSG is a localized coherent nonlinear traveling-wave structure, comprised of inseparable solitons with identical velocities. Hence, DSGs are generalizations of single solitons (considered as $1$-DSGs), and form fundamental building blocks of solutions of many integrable systems. We provide an explicit formula for an $N$-DSG and its center. With the help of the Deift-Zhou's nonlinear steepest descent method, we prove the localization of DSGs, and calculate the long-time asymptotics for an arbitrary $N$-soliton solutions. It is shown that the solution becomes a linear combination of multiple DSGs in the distant past and future, with explicit formulae for the asymptotic phase shift for each DSG. Other generalizations of a single soliton are also discussed, such as $N$th-order solitons and soliton gases. We prove that every $N$th-order soliton can be obtained by fusion of eigenvalues of $N$-soliton solutions, with proper rescalings of norming constants, and demonstrate that soliton-gas solution can be considered as limits of $N$-soliton solutions as $N\to+\infty$.</description>
