      <title>Modeling society with a responsible elite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the ViSE (Voting in a Stochastic Environment) model, we examine the dynamics in a society, part of which can be considered an elite. The model allows us to analyze the influence of social attitudes, such as collectivism, individualism, altruism on the well-being of agents. The dynamics is determined by collective decisions and changes in the structure of society, in particular, by the formation of groups of cooperating agents. It is found that the presence of a "responsible elite", combining the support of other agents with limited concern for their own benefit, stabilizes society and eliminates the "pit of losses" paradox. The benefit to society from having a responsible elite is comparable to that from having a prosocial group of the same size. If the elite radically increases the weight of the group component in its combined voting strategy, then its incomes rise sharply, while society's incomes decline. If, in response to the selfish transformation of the elite, a new responsible elite emerges, proportionally larger than the previous one, then society will stabilize again, and the old elite will lose its dominant position. This process can be repeated as long as the size of society allows the formation of new responsible elites of the required size.</description>

      <title>Autocratic strategies in Cournot oligopoly game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An oligopoly is a market in which the price of a goods is controlled by a few firms. Cournot introduced the simplest game-theoretic model of oligopoly, where profit-maximizing behavior of each firm results in market failure. Furthermore, when the Cournot oligopoly game is infinitely repeated, firms can tacitly collude to monopolize the market. Such tacit collusion is realized by the same mechanism as direct reciprocity in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, where mutual cooperation can be realized whereas defection is favorable for both prisoners in one-shot game. Recently, in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, a class of strategies called zero-determinant strategies attracts much attention in the context of direct reciprocity. Zero-determinant strategies are autocratic strategies which unilaterally control payoffs of players. There were many attempts to find zero-determinant strategies in other games and to extend them so as to apply them to broader situations. In this paper, first, we show that zero-determinant strategies exist even in the repeated Cournot oligopoly game. Especially, we prove that an averagely unbeatable zero-determinant strategy exists, which is guaranteed to obtain the average payoff of the opponents. Second, we numerically show that the averagely unbeatable zero-determinant strategy can be used to promote collusion when it is used against an adaptively learning player, whereas it cannot promote collusion when it is used against two adaptively learning players. Our findings elucidate some negative impact of zero-determinant strategies in oligopoly market.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Influence of Pavement Performance on Road Safety Through Crash Frequency and Severity Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Road safety is impacted by a range of factors that can be categorized into human, vehicle, and roadway/environmental elements. This research explores the connection between pavement performance and road safety, particularly in relation to crash frequency and severity, using data from the Iowa Department of Transportation (DOT) for 2022. By merging crash data with pavement inventory data, we conduct a spatial analysis that incorporates the geographical coordinates of crash sites with the conditions of road segments. Statistical methods are applied to compare crash rates and severity across various pavement condition categories. To identify the most influential factors affecting crash rates and severity, we use machine learning models along with negative binomial and ordered probit regression models. The study's key findings reveal that higher speed limits, well-maintained roads, and improved friction scores correlate with lower crash rates, whereas rougher roads and adverse weather conditions are linked to higher crash severity. This analysis emphasizes the critical need for prioritizing pavement maintenance and integrating safety-focused design principles to boost road safety. Moreover, the study underscores the ongoing need for research to better understand and address the intricate relationship between pavement performance and road safety.</description>

      <title>CHRONEX-US: City-level historical road network expansion dataset for the conterminous United States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geospatial datasets on the long-term evolution of road networks are scarce, hampering our quantitative understanding of how the contemporary road network has evolved over the course of the 20th century. However, such information is crucial to better understand the dynamics of road network growth and expansion, and to shed light on the consequences of (sub-) urbanization processes, such as increasing mobility, traffic congestion, land take and transportation inequality. Herein, we describe CHRONEX-US ('City-level historical road network expansion dataset for the conterminous United States'), a geospatial vector dataset reporting estimates of the construction year for each road segment in densely and semi-densely built-up spaces within 693 core-based statistical areas (i.e., Metropolitan and Micropolitan statistical areas) in the conterminous US. CHRONEX-US is based on the USGS National Transportation Dataset (NTD), integrated with the historical settlement compilation for the US (HISDAC-US). CHRONEX-US reports model-based construction epoch estimates for local residential road network segments within urban and peri-urban areas, using different model-based scenarios. The vector data inherit topological integrity from the NTD data allowing for routing and other connectivity-based analyses within temporal strata of urban road networks. CHRONEX-US vector geometries are attributed with the US Census Bureau's MAF/TIGER Feature Class Code (MTFCC), enabling stratification of the data by road category. CHRONEX-US is available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28644674.</description>

      <title>A Self-Organized Criticality Model of Extreme Events and Cascading Disasters of Hub and Spoke Air Traffic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical infrastructure networks--including transportation, power grids, and communication systems--exhibit complex interdependencies that can lead to cascading failures with catastrophic consequences. These disasters often originate from failures at critical points in the network, where single-node disruptions can propagate rapidly due to structural dependencies and high-impact linkages. Such vulnerabilities are exacerbated in systems that have been highly optimized for efficiency or have self-organized into fragile configurations over time. The U.S. air transportation system, built on a hub-and-spoke model, exemplifies this type of critical infrastructure. Its reliance on a small number of high-throughput hubs means that even localized disruptions--especially those triggered by increasingly frequent and extreme weather events--can initiate cascades with nationwide impact. We introduce a novel application of Self-Organized Criticality (SOC) theory to model and analyze cascading failures in such systems. Through a detailed case study of U.S. airline operations, we show how the SOC model captures the power-law distribution of disruptions and the long-tail risk of systemic failures, reflecting the interplay between structural fragility and climate shocks. Our approach enables quantitative assessment of network vulnerability, identification of critical nodes, and evaluation of proactive strategies for disaster risk reduction. The results demonstrate that the SOC model replicates the observed statistical patterns--frequent small events and rare, severe failures--offering a powerful systems-level framework for infrastructure resilience planning and emergency response.</description>

      <title>Exploring the effect of spatial scales in studying urban mobility pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban mobility plays a crucial role in the functioning of cities, influencing economic activity, accessibility, and quality of life. However, the effectiveness of analytical models in understanding urban mobility patterns can be significantly affected by the spatial scales employed in the analysis. This paper explores the impact of spatial scales on the performance of the gravity model in explaining urban mobility patterns using public transport flow data in Singapore. The model is evaluated across multiple spatial scales of origin and destination locations, ranging from individual bus stops and train stations to broader regional aggregations. Results indicate the existence of an optimal intermediate spatial scale at which the gravity model performs best. At the finest scale, where individual transport nodes are considered, the model exhibits poor performance due to noisy and highly variable travel patterns. Conversely, at larger scales, model performance also suffers as over-aggregation of transport nodes results in excessive generalisation which obscures the underlying mobility dynamics. Furthermore, distance-based spatial aggregation of transport nodes proves to outperform administrative boundary-based aggregation, suggesting that actual urban organisation and movement patterns may not necessarily align with imposed administrative divisions. These insights highlight the importance of selecting appropriate spatial scales in mobility analysis and urban modelling in general, offering valuable guidance for urban and transport planning efforts aimed at enhancing mobility in complex urban environments.</description>

      <title>The status quo of fire evacuation drills in nursery schools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fire drills are a commonly-used training method for improving how people act in emergency situations. This article deals with fire drills in early childhood education facilities and analyses data gathered from an online survey of 1151 Czech nursery schools (23.5% of nursery schools invited to participate, 21.5% of all officially registered nursery schools in Czechia). It provides recommendations for improving the effectiveness of fire drills in nursery schools. Results suggest that regular (typically annual) fire drills are common training practices at these schools, but more frequent fire drills led to significantly fewer issues during evacuation. The most frequent evacuation issue encountered during fire drills, according to our data, was slow movement. Many children needed assistance, notably on stairs; nursery schools located only on the ground floor reported fewer issues during evacuation than other schools. The purpose, design, and implementation of fire drills with our study confirming results from prior studies must be properly integrated into complex and systematic fire safety education programs that specifically reflect the characteristics, needs, and possible limitations of preschool children.</description>

      <title>Reframing Spatial Dependence as Geographic Feature Attribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial dependence, referring to the correlation between variable values observed at different geographic locations, is one of the most fundamental characteristics of spatial data. The presence of spatial dependence violates the classical statistical assumption of independent and identically distributed observations and implies a high degree of information redundancy within spatial datasets. However, this redundancy can also be interpreted as structured information, which has been widely leveraged in spatial modeling, prediction, and explanation tasks. With the rise of geospatial big data and the rapid advancement of deep learning and large models, effectively modeling and characterizing spatial dependence has become essential for enhancing the performance of spatial analysis and uncovering latent spatial processes. From a data-driven perspective, this study proposes a novel interpretation: spatial dependence can be understood as the contribution of geographic location -- specifically, latitude and longitude -- to the observed variation in target variables. To validate this hypothesis, we conduct simulation experiments in which data are generated based on known spatial processes. We train machine learning models to predict variable values using only coordinate information. Subsequently, XAI techniques are employed to quantify the contribution of spatial features. The resulting importance scores are then compared with local indicators of spatial association (LISA). Across a range of spatial process settings, we observe consistently high correlations (greater than 0.94) between coordinate-based contributions and LISA values. These findings offer a new data-driven perspective on spatial dependence, bridging traditional spatial statistical approaches with modern machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Can Recombination Displace Dominant Scientific Ideas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific breakthroughs are widely attributed to the novel recombination of existing ideas. Yet despite explosive global growth in scientific labor and publications -- creating more opportunities to reconfigure knowledge -- the rate of breakthroughs has not kept pace. To investigate this disconnect, we analyze 49 million scholarly works from 1960 to 2024 using measures of atypical recombination and disruptive innovation. Contrary to recombination theories, we find a robust negative correlation between atypicality and disruption -- consistent across fields, time, team sizes, and even across versions of the same paper. Interviews with scientists about landmark breakthroughs suggest an alternative mechanism of innovation: displacement, in which nearly all breakthroughs supplanted dominant ideas within their fields. Bibliometric evidence confirms this pattern, showing that disruptive work often overlap in topic with its most-cited reference, indicating that breakthroughs emerge through within -- field displacement rather than cross-domain recombination. Notably, displacing methods takes longer than displacing theories -- revealing different temporal dynamics of epistemic change.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Political Influence Through Social Media: Network and Causal Dynamics in the 2022 French Presidential Election</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the 2022 French presidential election, we collected daily Twitter messages on key topics posted by political candidates and their close networks. Using a data-driven approach, we analyze interactions among political parties, identifying central topics that shape the landscape of political debate. Moving beyond traditional correlation analyses, we apply a causal inference technique: Convergent Cross Mapping, to uncover directional influences among political communities, revealing how some parties are more likely to initiate changes in activity while others tend to respond. This approach allows us to distinguish true influence from mere correlation, highlighting asymmetric relationships and hidden dynamics within the social media political network. Our findings demonstrate how specific issues, such as health and foreign policy, act as catalysts for cross-party influence, particularly during critical election phases. These insights provide a novel framework for understanding political discourse dynamics and have practical implications for campaign strategists and media analysts seeking to monitor and respond to shifts in political influence in real time.</description>

      <title>Mean-field and Monte Carlo Analysis of Multi-Species Dynamics of agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a mean-field (MF) approximation for the recurrence relation governing the dynamics of $m$ species of particles on a square lattice, and we simultaneously perform Monte Carlo (MC) simulations under identical initial conditions to emulate the intricate motion observed in environments such as subway corridors and scramble crossings in large cities. Each species moves according to transition probabilities influenced by its respective static floor field and the state of neighboring cells. To illustrate the methodology, we analyze statistical fluctuations in the spatial distribution for $m = 1$, $m = 2$, and $m = 4$ and for different regimes of average density and biased movement. A numerical comparison is conducted to determine the best agreement between the MC simulations and the MF approximation considering a renormalization exponent $\beta$ that optimizes the fit between methods. Finally, we report a phenomenon we term "Gaussian-to-Gaussian" behavior, in which an initially normal distribution of particles becomes distorted due to interactions among same and opposing species, passes through a transient regime, and eventually returns to a Gaussian-like profile in the steady state, after multiple rounds of motion under periodic boundary conditions.</description>

Abstract: Energy justice, at the intersection of energy and societal ethics, studies the origins, quantification, and resolution of persistent and potential inequities within the energy sector, serving as a foundational pillar for societal harmony. In this review, we overview the historical and modern definitions of energy equity and frameworks of energy justice. We highlight the tools adopted to measure equity in the energy context, unveiling multifaceted inequities that permeate global energy landscapes. We discuss the limitations of prevalent metrics such as the Gini coefficient and Generalized Entropy Indices in the evaluation of energy justice concerns. Finally, we analyze publications that examined current practices and proposed improving methods towards a more equitable energy market for the society from policy, planning, and operation perspectives.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Behavior in Pre-State Societies: An Agent-Based Approach of the Aksum Civilization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03191v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study intends to test the hypothesis that, contrary to traditional interpretation, the social structure of the polity of Aksum - especially in its early stages - was not characterized by a vertical hierarchy with highly centralized administrative power, and that the leaders mentioned in the few available inscriptions were predominantly ritual leaders with religious rather than coercive political authority. This hypothesis, suggested by the available archaeological evidence, is grounded in Charles Stanish's model, which posits that pre-state societies could achieve cooperative behavior without the presence of coercive authority. Using agent-based modeling applied to data inspired by the Aksum civilization, we examine the dynamics of cooperation in the presence and absence of a Public Goods Game. Results show that while cooperative behavior can emerge in the short term without coercive power, it may not be sustainable over the long term, suggesting a need for centralized authority to foster stable, complex societies. These findings provide insights into the evolutionary pathways that lead to state formation and complex social structures.</description>

Abstract: Individuals who do not comply with public health safety measures pose a significant challenge to effective epidemic control, as their risky behaviours can undermine public health interventions. This is particularly relevant in urban environments because of their high population density and complex social interactions. In this study, we employ detailed contact networks, built using a data-driven approach, to examine the impact of non-compliant individuals on epidemic dynamics in three major Italian cities: Torino, Milano, and Palermo. We use a heterogeneous extension of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model that distinguishes between ordinary and non-compliant individuals, who are more infectious and/or more susceptible. By combining electoral data with recent findings on vaccine hesitancy, we obtain spatially heterogeneous distributions of non-compliance. Epidemic simulations demonstrate that even a small proportion of non-compliant individuals in the population can substantially increase the number of infections and accelerate the timing of their peak. Furthermore, the impact of non-compliance is greatest when disease transmission rates are moderate. Including the heterogeneous, data-driven distribution of non-compliance in the simulations results in infection hotspots forming with varying intensity according to the disease transmission rate. Overall, these findings emphasise the importance of monitoring behavioural compliance and tailoring public health interventions to address localised risks.</description>

      <title>2064 global population crisis scenario predicted by the most general dynamic model</title>

Abstract: There is currently no consensus on how the global population will evolve in the next decades and in the next century. The reason for this uncertainty is the absence of reliable population dynamic models. In this paper, we remedy to this situation by reporting on a population dynamic model, a single nonlinear differential equation adapted from the physics of disordered systems, which is able to mathematically describe all the various regimes encountered in the global population recorded as a function of time, over the past 12000 years until now. Regimes of simple exponential growth (Malthus), logistic (Verhulst) plateaus as well as stretched-exponential and compressed-exponential growth regimes are all reliably described by this mathematical equation in its various limits. Besides showing that this is, indeed, the most general population dynamic model, we use it to explore its solutions projected into the future. In particular, two different scenarios are predicted. In one of them, which assumes that the future evolution would continue along a similar pattern as the past decades (hence without any major global ecological crisis affecting the resource exploitation), a von Foerster-type doomsday scenario with a sudden rise of the global population to unsustainable levels could appear as early as 2078. In the opposite scenario, if a global ecological crisis were to set in today, affecting the ability to exploit resources, given the current estimates of the Earth's carrying capacity, the global population is forecasted to reduce by half by 2064. Furthermore, the proposed dynamic model provides with a new aggregated parameter (K, in the model) that can be monitored and controlled so as to avoid the doomsday scenarios.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Non-uniqueness of Node Co-occurrence Matrices of Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraphs extend traditional networks by capturing multi-way or group interactions. Given the complexity of hypergraph data and the wide range of methodology available for pairwise network analysis, hypergraph data is often projected onto a weighted and undirected network. The simplest of these projections, often referred to as a node co-occurrence matrix, is known to be non-unique, as distinct non-isomorphic hypergraphs can produce the same weighted adjacency matrix. This non-uniqueness raises important questions about the structural information lost during the projection and how to efficiently quantify the complexity of the original hypergraph. Here we develop a search algorithm to identify all hypergraphs corresponding to a given projection, analyze its runtime, and explore its parallelisability. Applying this algorithm to projections derived from a random hypergraph model, we characterize conditions under which projections are non-unique. Our findings provide a new framework and set of computational tools to investigate projections of hypergraphs.</description>
