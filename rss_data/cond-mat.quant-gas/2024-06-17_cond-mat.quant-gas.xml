      <title>Resonant analogue configurations in atomic condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a contribution to a memorial volume, we provide a comprehensive discussion of resonant configurations in analogue gravity, focusing on its implementation in atomic condensates and combining review features with original insights and calculations. In particular, we analyze the analogues of the Andreev and Hawking effects using a microscopic description based on the Bogoliubov approximation. We contemplate several resonant scenarios whose efficiency to enhance anomalous scattering processes is compared to that of non-resonant setups. The presence of quantum signatures in analogue configurations, such as the violation of Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities or entanglement, is analyzed, observing that resonant configurations highly increase the entanglement signal, especially for the Andreev effect. We also discuss how these results have served as inspiration for the rapidly expanding field of quantum information in high-energy colliders. Finally, we study the physics of black-hole lasers as further examples of resonant analogue structures, distinguishing three stages in its time evolution. For short times, we compute the linear and non-linear spectrum for different models. For intermediate times, we generalize the current analysis of the BHL-BCL crossover. For long times, we discuss the emerging concept of spontaneous Floquet state and its potential implications.</description>

      <title>Stability of persistent currents in superfluid fermionic rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of persistent currents in superfluid fermionic gases confined to a ring geometry. Our studies, conducted at zero temperature using time-dependent density functional theory, cover interaction regimes from strong (unitary Fermi gas) to weak (Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer regime) couplings. Stability is tested with respect to the presence of an external defect within the ring. The dissipation mechanism related to vortex generation is present in all interaction regimes. Interestingly, while the corresponding critical winding number is found to be independent of the regime, the flow energy dissipation and its origin strongly depend on it. Vortex emission is accompanied by Cooper pair breaking, which occurs even beyond the vortex core in the weakly interacting regime. The pair-breaking mechanism prevents the imprinting of a persistent current with a winding number above a threshold, which decreases as we approach the BCS regime. Our study reveals the existence of two types of critical winding numbers above which the currents cease to be persistent in Fermi superfluids: one related to the proliferation of quantum vortices and the other with the onset of the pair-breaking mechanism.</description>

      <title>A high-flux cold-atom source utilising a grating atom chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) have been proposed for many applications in atom interferometry, as their coherence over long evolution times promises unprecedented sensitivity. To date, BECs can be efficiently created in devices using atom chips, but these are still complex and place high demands on size, weight and power. To further simplify these setups, we equipped an atom chip with a nano-structured diffraction-grating to derive all beams for the magneto-optical trap (MOT) from a single laser beam. Moreover, using a 2D$^+$-MOT as an atomic source and a beam with uniform intensity for the grating illumination, we capture $1\times10^9$ atoms in one second, cool them to $14\,\mu$K, and demonstrate magnetic trapping using the atom chip. This is a major step towards the simplification of portable BEC devices for quantum sensing on earth and in space.</description>

      <title>Kibble-Zurek Mechanism and Beyond: Lessons from a Holographic Superfluid Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superfluid phase transition dynamics and associated spontaneous vortex formation with the crossing of the critical temperature in a disk geometry is studied in the framework of the $AdS/CFT$ correspondence by solving the Einstein-Abelian-Higgs model in an $AdS_4$ black hole. For a slow quench, the vortex density admits a universal scaling law with the cooling rate as predicted by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM), while for fast quenches, the density shows a universal scaling behavior as a function of the final temperature, that lies beyond the KZM prediction. The vortex number distribution in both the power-law and saturation regimes can be approximated by a normal distribution. However, the study of the universal scaling of the cumulants reveals non-normal features and indicates that vortex statistics in the newborn superfluid is best described by the Poisson binomial distribution, previously predicted in the KZM regime [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 240602 (2020)]. This is confirmed by studying the cumulant scalings as a function of the quench time and the quench depth. Our work supports the existence of a universal defect number distribution that accommodates the KZM scaling, its breakdown at fast quenches, and the additional universal scaling laws as a function of the final value of the control parameter.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Dynamics and Particle Production in a Toroidal Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.05611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) trapped inside an expanding toroid that can realize an analogue inflationary universe. As the system expands, we find that phonons in the BEC undergo redshift and damping due to quantum pressure effects, owing to the thinness of the ring. We predict that rapidly expanding toroidal BEC's can exhibit spontaneous particle creation, and study this phenomenon in the context of an initial coherent state wavefunction. We show how particle creation would be revealed in the atom density and density correlations, and discuss connections to the cosmological theory of inflation.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation in canonical ensemble with fixed total momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider Bose-Einstein condensation of noninteracting homogeneous three-dimensional gas in canonical ensemble when both particle number $N$ and total momentum $\mathbf{P}$ of all particles are fixed. Using the saddle point method, we derive the large-$N$ analytical approximations for partition function, free energy, and statistical distributions of occupation numbers of different single-particle energy levels. At temperatures below the critical point of phase transition, we predict, in some ranges of $\mathbf{P}$, fragmentation of the condensate, when more than one single-particle level is macroscopically occupied. The occupation number distributions have approximately Gaussian shapes for the levels hosting the condensate, and exponential shapes for other, noncondensate levels. Our analysis demonstrates breaking of Galilean invariance of moving finite-temperature many-particle system in the presence of Bose-Einstein condensation and extends the theory of moving and rotating quantum systems to the finite-temperature large-$N$ limit.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction matching for solving quantum many-body problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17488v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ab initio calculations play an essential role in our fundamental understanding of quantum many-body systems across many subfields, from strongly correlated fermions to quantum chemistry and from atomic and molecular systems to nuclear physics. One of the primary challenges is to perform accurate calculations for systems where the interactions may be complicated and difficult for the chosen computational method to handle. Here we address the problem by introducing a new approach called wavefunction matching. Wavefunction matching transforms the interaction between particles so that the wavefunctions up to some finite range match that of an easily computable interaction. This allows for calculations of systems that would otherwise be impossible due to problems such as Monte Carlo sign cancellations. We apply the method to lattice Monte Carlo simulations of light nuclei, medium-mass nuclei, neutron matter, and nuclear matter. We use high-fidelity chiral effective field theory interactions and find good agreement with empirical data. These results are accompanied by new insights on the nuclear interactions that may help to resolve long-standing challenges in accurately reproducing nuclear binding energies, charge radii, and nuclear matter saturation in ab initio calculations.</description>

      <title>Localized dopant motion across the 2D Ising phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I investigate the motion of a single hole in 2D spin lattices with square and triangular geometries. While the spins have nearest neighbor Ising spin couplings $J$, the hole is allowed to move only in 1D along a single line in the 2D lattice with nearest neighbor hopping amplitude $t$. The non-equilibrium hole dynamics is initialized by suddenly removing a single spin from the thermal Ising spin lattice. I find that for any nonzero spin coupling and temperature, the hole is localized. This is an extension of the thermally induced localization phenomenon [arXiv:2310.11193] to the case, where there is a phase transition to a long-range ordered ferromagnetic phase. The dynamics depends only on the ratio of the temperature to the spin coupling, $k_BT / |J|$, and on the ratio of the spin coupling to the hopping $J/t$. I characterize these dependencies in great detail. In particular, I find universal behavior at high temperatures, common features for the square and triangular lattices across the Curie temperatures for ferromagnetic interactions, and highly distinct behaviors for the two geometries in the presence of antiferromagnetic interactions due geometric frustration in the triangular lattice.</description>
