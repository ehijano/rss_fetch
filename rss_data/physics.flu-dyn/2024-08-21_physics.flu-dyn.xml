      <title>Onset instability of inverted flags clamped by a cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the hydrodynamic characteristics and analyze the instability mechanism of a two-dimensional inverted flag clamped by a cylinder. Two transition routes and a total of six kinds of solutions exist under this configuration for different diameters of cylinders due to complex bifurcations. Specifically, for small cylinders, the undeformed equilibrium transitions to static deformed equilibrium through a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation, which is judged by the weakly nonlinear analysis together with the global linear instability analysis. The instability mechanism is the lifting effect of the steady structure mode working at the leading edge of the elastic plate. For large cylinders, another unstable fluid mode (decoupled with structure mode) causes the disappearance of the static undeformed and deformed equilibrium, replaced by a small amplitude flapping. The structure mode and the flow mode mainly contribute to the growth of perturbations in plate and downstream cylinder regions respectively, which can excite multi-mode oscillating transition analyzed by proper orthogonal decomposition. Moreover, we find there is a critical diameter $D_c$ dividing the pitchfork bifurcation and Hopf bifurcation, and $D_c$ decreases with the increase of Reynolds number. Finally, we prove downstream vortex shedding can induce upward vortex-induced vibration of the plate and further improve the efficiency of energy transfer from the fluid to the structure during small-deflection flapping.</description>

      <title>Airfoil Synchronous Surging and Pitching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combined pitching-and-surging of an airfoil at the identical frequency (i.e., synchronously), at four different phase-differences, was investigated theoretically and experimentally. The most general unsteady theoretical formulation was adopted to calculate the lift coefficient, and then extended to explicitly compute the unsteady bound vortex sheet. This was used for comparison to experiments and facilitated the computation of both Joukowsky and impulsive-pressure lift contributions. Experiments were performed using a NACA 0018 airfoil in an unsteady wind tunnel at an average Reynolds number of $3.0 \times 10^5$, with a free-stream oscillation amplitude of 0.51, an angle-of-attack range of $2^\circ \pm 2^\circ$, and a reduced frequency of 0.097. In general, excellent correspondence was observed between theory and experiment, representing the first direct experimental validation of the general theory. It was shown, both theoretically and experimentally, that the lift coefficient was not accurately represented by independent superposition of surging and pitching effects, due to variations in the instantaneous effective reduced frequency not accounted for during pure pitching. Deviations from theory, observed at phase-lags of $90^\circ$ and $180^\circ$ were attributed to bursting of separation bubbles during the early stages of the acceleration phase. The largest deviations occurred when the impulsive-pressure lift contribution was small relative to the Joukowsky contribution, because the latter was most affected by bubble-bursting. Bubble-bursting resulted in large form-drag oscillations that occurred at identical phase angles within the oscillation cycle, irrespective of the phase difference between surging and pitching, as well as in the absence of pitching. The bubble-bursting dynamic stall mechanism may have important implications for rotor performance and noise emissions.</description>

      <title>Inferring Underwater Topography with FINN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal partial differential equations (PDEs) find extensive application across various scientific and engineering fields. While numerous models have emerged from both physics and machine learning (ML) communities, there is a growing trend towards integrating these approaches to develop hybrid architectures known as physics-aware machine learning models. Among these, the finite volume neural network (FINN) has emerged as a recent addition. FINN has proven to be particularly efficient in uncovering latent structures in data. In this study, we explore the capabilities of FINN in tackling the shallow-water equations, which simulates wave dynamics in coastal regions. Specifically, we investigate FINN's efficacy to reconstruct underwater topography based on these particular wave equations. Our findings reveal that FINN exhibits a remarkable capacity to infer topography solely from wave dynamics, distinguishing itself from both conventional ML and physics-aware ML models. Our results underscore the potential of FINN in advancing our understanding of spatiotemporal phenomena and enhancing parametrization capabilities in related domains.</description>

      <title>Breaking of a floating particle raft by water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16188</link>

Abstract: When particles of a few tens of microns are spread on the surface of water, they aggregate under the action of capillary forces and form a thin floating membrane, a particle raft. In a tank with a raft made of graphite powder, we generate in the laboratory gravity surface waves, whose wavelength {about 17 cm} is very large compared to the thickness of the raft {of order 10 microns}. For a sufficiently strong wave amplitude, the raft breaks up progressively by developing cracks and producing fragments whose sizes decrease on a time scale long compared to the period of the wave. We characterize the breaking mechanisms. Then, we investigate the area distribution of the fragments produced during the fragmentation process. The visual appearance of the fragments distributed in size and surrounded by open water bears a {notable} resemblance to the floes produced by the fracturing of sea ice by waves in the polar oceans. Fragmentation concepts and morphological tools built for sea ice floes can be applied to our macroscopic analog, on which the entire dynamic evolution is accessible. {However, the mechanic of the two systems differ, as our particle raft breaks due to the viscous stresses, whereas the sea-ice fractures due its bending by the waves.</description>

      <title>Expressing turbulent kinetic energy as coarse-grained enstrophy or strain deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08672v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: n turbulent flows, the fluid element gets deformed by chaotic motion due to the formation of sharp velocity gradients. A direct connection between the element of fluid stresses and the energy balance still remains elusive. Here, an exact identity of incompressible turbulence is derived linking the velocity gradient norm across the scales with the total kinetic energy. In the context of three-dimensional (3D) homogeneous turbulence, this relation can be specialised obtaining the expression of total kinetic energy decomposed either in terms of deformations due to strain motion or via the resolved-scale enstrophy of the fluid element. Applied to data from direct numerical simulations (DNS) describing homogeneous and isotropic turbulence, the decomposition reveals that, beyond the scales dominated by the external forcing, extensional and contractile deformations account approximately for 55% and 40% of the kinetic energy of the associated scale while less than the remaining 5% is carried by the indefinite-type stresses. From these two identities one can derive an exact expression for the kinetic energy spectrum which is based solely on real space quantities providing a characterisation of the Kolomogorov constant as well. Numerical evidences show that this formulation of the energy spectrum reproduces the power-law behaviour of the Kolmogorov spectral scaling.</description>
