      <title>The Resurgence of Trumponomics: Implications for the Future of ESG Investments in a Changing Political Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public policy shapes the economic landscape, influencing everything from corporate behavior to individual investment decisions. For Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investors, these policy shifts can create opportunities and challenges as they navigate an ever-changing regulatory environment. The contrast between the Trump and Biden administrations offers a striking example of how differing political agendas can affect ESG investments. Trump's first term was marked by deregulation and policies favoring fossil fuels, which created an uncertain environment for sustainable investments. When Biden assumed office, his focus on climate action and clean energy reinvigorated the ESG sector, offering a more stable and supportive landscape for green investments. However, with Trump's return to power in his second term, these policies are being reversed again, leading to further volatility. This paper explores how such dramatic shifts in public policy influence economic strategies and directly impact ESG investors' decisions, forcing them to constantly reassess their portfolios in response to changing political climates.</description>

      <title>Cutting through Complexity: How Data Science Can Help Policymakers Understand the World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Economies are fundamentally complex and becoming more so, but the new discipline of data science-which combines programming, statistics, and domain knowledge-can help cut through that complexity, potentially with productivity benefits to boot. This chapter looks at examples of where innovations from data science are cutting through the complexities faced by policymakers in measurement, allocating resources, monitoring the natural world, making predictions, and more. These examples show the promise and potential of data science to aid policymakers, and point to where actions may be taken that would support further progress in this space.</description>

      <title>A Framework to Monitor the Effects of External Shocks on Housing Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework to holistically test for and monitor the impact of different types of events affecting a country's housing market, yet originating from housing-external sources. We classify events along three dimensions leading to testable hypotheses: prices versus quantities, supply versus demand, and immediate versus gradually evolving. These dimensions translate into guidance about which data type, statistical measure and testing strategy should be used. To perform such test suitable statistical models are needed which we implement as a hierarchical hedonic price model and a complementary count model. These models are amended by regime and contextual variables as suggested by our classification strategy. We apply this framework to the Austrian real estate market together with three disruptive events triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic, a policy tightening mortgage lending standards, as well as the cost-of-living crisis that came along with increased financing costs. The tests yield the expected results and, by that, some housing market puzzles are resolved. Deviating from the prior classification exercise means that some developments would have been undetected. Further, adopting our framework consistently when performing empirical research on residential real estate would lead to better comparable research results and, by that, would allow researchers to draw meta-conclusions from the bulk of studies available across time and space.</description>

      <title>Strategizing with AI: Insights from a Beauty Contest Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Keynesian beauty contest is a wide class of games of guessing the most popular strategy among other players. In particular, guessing a fraction of a mean of numbers chosen by all players is a classic behavioral experiment designed to test iterative reasoning patterns among various groups of people. The previous literature reveals that the level of sophistication of the opponents is an important factor affecting the outcome of the game. Smarter decision makers choose strategies that are closer to theoretical Nash equilibrium and demonstrate faster convergence to equilibrium in iterated contests with information revelation. We replicate a series of classic experiments by running virtual experiments with modern large language models (LLMs) who play against various groups of virtual players. We test how advanced the LLMs' behavior is compared to the behavior of human players. We show that LLMs typically take into account the opponents' level of sophistication and adapt by changing the strategy. In various settings, most LLMs (with the exception of Llama) are more sophisticated and play lower numbers compared to human players. Our results suggest that LLMs (except Llama) are rather successful in identifying the underlying strategic environment and adopting the strategies to the changing set of parameters of the game in the same way that human players do. All LLMs still fail to play dominant strategies in a two-player game. Our results contribute to the discussion on the accuracy of modeling human economic agents by artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Estimating Export-productivity Cutoff Contours with Profit Data: A Novel Threshold Estimation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a novel method to estimate firm-specific market-entry thresholds in international economics, allowing fixed costs to vary across firms alongside productivity. Our framework models market entry as an interaction between productivity and observable fixed-cost measures, extending traditional single-threshold models to ones with set-valued thresholds. Applying this approach to Chinese firm data, we estimate export-market entry thresholds as functions of domestic sales and surrogate variables for fixed costs. The results reveal substantial heterogeneity and threshold contours, challenging conventional single-threshold-point assumptions. These findings offer new insights into firm behavior and provide a foundation for further theoretical and empirical advancements in trade research.</description>

      <title>The Benefits from Bundling Demand in K-12 Broadband Procurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07277v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a new market design for K-12 schools' internet procurement. In 2014, New Jersey switched from school-specific decentralized procurement to a new system that bundled participating schools into four regional groups. Using an event study approach, we estimate that participation in this new procurement system reduced K-12 schools' internet prices by approximately $10 per megabit per second per month (Mbps) 37% relative to baseline levels, while increasing bandwidth by 500% Mbps. Relying on a feature of the procurement design, we present evidence that prices fell because bundling mitigated the exposure problem in internet procurement -- the risk that suppliers win contracts insufficient to cover their fixed infrastructure costs. Our findings are robust to deviations from the parallel trend assumption that may arise in our setting because of voluntary participation. Bounding the change in school expenditures due to the program, we find that participants saved at least as much as their federal E-rate subsidy. Using the estimated price reduction and bandwidth expansion, we calculate substantial welfare gains under minimal assumptions on schools' demand for broadband.</description>

      <title>Democratising Agricultural Commodity Price Forecasting: The AGRICAF Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20363v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring food security is a critical global challenge, particularly for low-income countries where food prices impact the access to nutritious food. The volatility of global agricultural commodity (AC) prices exacerbates food insecurity, with international trade restrictions and market disruptions further complicating the situation. Despite online platforms for monitoring food prices, there is a significant gap in providing detailed explanations and forecasts accessible to non-specialists. To address this, we propose the Agricultural Commodity Analysis and Forecasts (AGRICAF) methodology, integrating explainable machine learning (XML) and econometric techniques to analyse and forecast global agricultural commodity prices up to one year ahead, dynamically adapting to different forecast horizons. This innovative integration allows us to model complex interactions and dynamics while providing clear, interpretable results. This paper demonstrates how AGRICAF can be used, applying it to three major agricultural commodities - maize, soybean, and wheat - and explaining how different factors impact prices across various months and forecast horizons. By facilitating access to accurate and interpretable medium-term forecasts of AC prices, AGRICAF can contribute to developing a fair and sustainable food system.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Inheritance: Surname Bias in AI Decisions Reinforces Intergenerational Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surnames often convey implicit markers of social status, wealth, and lineage, shaping perceptions in ways that can perpetuate systemic biases and intergenerational inequality. This study is the first of its kind to investigate whether and how surnames influence AI-driven decision-making, focusing on their effects across key areas such as hiring recommendations, leadership appointments, and loan approvals. Using 72,000 evaluations of 600 surnames from the United States and Thailand, two countries with distinct sociohistorical contexts and surname conventions, we classify names into four categories: Rich, Legacy, Normal, and phonetically similar Variant groups. Our findings show that elite surnames consistently increase AI-generated perceptions of power, intelligence, and wealth, which in turn influence AI-driven decisions in high-stakes contexts. Mediation analysis reveals perceived intelligence as a key mechanism through which surname biases influence AI decision-making process. While providing objective qualifications alongside surnames mitigates most of these biases, it does not eliminate them entirely, especially in contexts where candidate credentials are low. These findings highlight the need for fairness-aware algorithms and robust policy measures to prevent AI systems from reinforcing systemic inequalities tied to surnames, an often-overlooked bias compared to more salient characteristics such as race and gender. Our work calls for a critical reassessment of algorithmic accountability and its broader societal impact, particularly in systems designed to uphold meritocratic principles while counteracting the perpetuation of intergenerational privilege.</description>
