      <title>Bridging the Rossby number gap in rapidly rotating thermal convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geophysical and astrophysical fluid flows are typically buoyantly driven and are strongly constrained by planetary rotation at large scales. Rapidly rotating Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RRRBC) provides a paradigm for direct numerical simulations (DNS) and laboratory studies of such flows, but the accessible parameter space remains restricted to moderately fast rotation (Ekman numbers $\rm Ek \gtrsim 10^{-8}$), while realistic $\rm Ek$ for astro-/geophysical applications are significantly smaller. Reduced equations of motion, the non-hydrostatic quasi-geostrophic equations describing the leading-order behavior in the limit of rapid rotation ($\rm Ek \to 0$) cannot capture finite rotation effects, leaving the physically most relevant part of parameter space with small but finite $\rm Ek$ currently inaccessible. Here, we introduce the rescaled incompressible Navier-Stokes equations (RiNSE), a reformulation of the Navier-Stokes-Boussinesq equations informed by the scalings valid for $\rm Ek\to 0$. We provide the first full DNS of RRRBC at unprecedented rotation strengths down to $\rm Ek=10^{-15}$ and below and show that the RiNSE converge to the asymptotically reduced equations.</description>

      <title>Effects of pristine and photoaged tire wear particles and their leachable additives on key nitrogen removal processes and nitrous oxide accumulation in estuarine sediments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global estuaries and coastal regions, acting as critical interfaces for mitigating nitrogen flux to marine, concurrently contend with contamination from tire wear particles (TWPs). However, the effects of pristine and photoaged TWP (P-TWP and A-TWP) and their leachates (P-TWPL and A-TWPL) on key nitrogen removal processes in estuarine sediments remain unclear. This study explored the responses of denitrification rate, anammox rate, and nitrous oxide (N2O) accumulation to P-TWP, A-TWP, P-TWPL, and A-TWPL exposures in estuarine sediments, and assessed the potential biotoxic substances in TWPL. Results indicate that P-TWP inhibited the denitrification rate and increased N2O accumulation without significantly impacting the anammox rate. A-TWP intensified the denitrification rate inhibition by further reducing narG gene abundance and NAR activity, and also decreased the hzo gene abundance, HZO activity, and Candidatus Kuenenia abundance, thereby slowing the anammox rate. N2O accumulation was lower after A-TWP exposure than P-TWP, with the NIR/NOS and NOR/NOS activity ratios closely associated with N2O accumulation. Batch experiments indicated that photoaging promoted Zn release from TWPL, significantly contributing to the inhibited denitrification rate and increased N2O accumulation by TWP. In addition, TWP drives changes in microbial community structure through released additives, with the abundance of DNB and AnAOB closely linked to the Zn, Mn, and As concentrations in TWPL. This study offers insights into assessing the environmental risks of TWPs in estuarine ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Estimating Atmospheric Variables from Digital Typhoon Satellite Images via Conditional Denoising Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study explores the application of diffusion models in the field of typhoons, predicting multiple ERA5 meteorological variables simultaneously from Digital Typhoon satellite images. The focus of this study is taken to be Taiwan, an area very vulnerable to typhoons. By comparing the performance of Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probability Model (CDDPM) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet), results suggest that the CDDPM performs best in generating accurate and realistic meteorological data. Specifically, CDDPM achieved a PSNR of 32.807, which is approximately 7.9% higher than CNN and 5.5% higher than SENet. Furthermore, CDDPM recorded an RMSE of 0.032, showing a 11.1% improvement over CNN and 8.6% improvement over SENet. A key application of this research can be for imputation purposes in missing meteorological datasets and generate additional high-quality meteorological data using satellite images. It is hoped that the results of this analysis will enable more robust and detailed forecasting, reducing the impact of severe weather events on vulnerable regions.
