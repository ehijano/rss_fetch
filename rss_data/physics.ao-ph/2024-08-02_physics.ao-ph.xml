      <title>OTCliM: generating a near-surface climatology of optical turbulence strength ($C_n^2$) using gradient boosting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces OTCliM (Optical Turbulence Climatology using Machine learning), a novel approach for deriving comprehensive climatologies of atmospheric optical turbulence strength ($C_n^2$) using gradient boosting machines. OTCliM addresses the challenge of efficiently obtaining reliable site-specific $C_n^2$ climatologies, crucial for ground-based astronomy and free-space optical communication. Using gradient boosting machines and global reanalysis data, OTCliM extrapolates one year of measured $C_n^2$ into a multi-year time series. We assess OTCliM's performance using $C_n^2$ data from 17 diverse stations in New York State, evaluating temporal extrapolation capabilities and geographical generalization. Our results demonstrate accurate predictions of four held-out years of $C_n^2$ across various sites, including complex urban environments, outperforming traditional analytical models. Non-urban models also show good geographical generalization compared to urban models, which captured non-general site-specific dependencies. A feature importance analysis confirms the physical consistency of the trained models. It also indicates the potential to uncover new insights into the physical processes governing $C_n^2$ from data. OTCliM's ability to derive reliable $C_n^2$ climatologies from just one year of observations can potentially reduce resources required for future site surveys or enable studies for additional sites with the same resources.</description>

      <title>Earth ECS Upper Limit using Modified Energy Budget Methods and Trend Analyses v.3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11869v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth global and regional effective thermal "conductance" G(eff) (in (W/m^2)/C and often labeled lambda in climate research) and the related Equilibrium Climate Sensitivity (ECS) are evaluated by applying a modified version of the Energy Budget method, and using data only after 1970. By removing Periodic Interfering temperature components (using a novel PIR process) and applying high frequency filtering, an extraordinarily near linear temperature response is revealed, enhancing accurate G(eff) calculation and avoiding the pre-1970 aerosol forcing and ocean energy per area (E*) absorption uncertainties. A formal/empirical method is used to determine more reliable values of Q(t)=d[E*(Ocean.energy)]/dt . Using NOAA data, and after PIR, it is shown that: 1) The Energy Budget Method can be realistically applied to the Ocean and Land regions independently, 2) the effective volcanic forcing is &lt;= 1/5 the IPCC AR5 estimate, 3) the "historical" 1980-2020 ECS(eff) values for Global, global Ocean, and global Land regions values are &lt;= 2.16, 1.69, 2.96 C/2xCO2 respectively; where the updated IPCC AR5 orthodox independent global Forcing value of 0.4 (W/m^2)/Decade and F/2xCO2= 3.7 W/m^2 were used. Uncertainty is about 10%. The Global average ECS(true) value of &lt;= 2.10 C is 70% of the IPCC AR6 ECS estimate of 3.0 C, but 127% of the ECS(eff) value reported by Lewis (1.66 C). The estimated oceans average TCR/ECS ratio = 0.71 and the global average TCR/ECS ratio = 0.83, and ECS(land)/ECS(Ocean) = 1.78 . [Results using HADCRUT temperature data instead are similar, but 6% "cooler" over land, and 8% "warmer" over oceans.] A simplified physically realistic formal/empirical Coarse 2-D Global Climate Model is derived wherein variation of Geff(t) until equilibrium (i.e. "pattern effects") are proven to be negligible or "cooling", using these Methods. And so it is likely ECS(true)&lt;= ECS(eff).</description>

      <title>A Likelihood-Based Generative Approach for Spatially Consistent Precipitation Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as a promising tool for precipitation downscaling. However, current models rely on likelihood-based loss functions to properly model the precipitation distribution, leading to spatially inconsistent projections when sampling. This work explores a novel approach by fusing the strengths of likelihood-based and adversarial losses used in generative models. As a result, we propose a likelihood-based generative approach for precipitation downscaling, leveraging the benefits of both methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Physically Consistent Deep Learning For Climate Model Parameterizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Climate models play a critical role in understanding and projecting climate change. Due to their complexity, their horizontal resolution of about 40-100 km remains too coarse to resolve processes such as clouds and convection, which need to be approximated via parameterizations. These parameterizations are a major source of systematic errors and large uncertainties in climate projections. Deep learning (DL)-based parameterizations, trained on data from computationally expensive short, high-resolution simulations, have shown great promise for improving climate models in that regard. However, their lack of interpretability and tendency to learn spurious non-physical correlations result in reduced trust in the climate simulation. We propose an efficient supervised learning framework for DL-based parameterizations that leads to physically consistent models with improved interpretability and negligible computational overhead compared to standard supervised training. First, key features determining the target physical processes are uncovered. Subsequently, the neural network is fine-tuned using only those relevant features. We show empirically that our method robustly identifies a small subset of the inputs as actual physical drivers, therefore, removing spurious non-physical relationships. This results in by design physically consistent and interpretable neural networks while maintaining the predictive performance of unconstrained black-box DL-based parameterizations.</description>

      <title>Discrete element method model of soot aggregates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14254v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Soot is a component of atmospheric aerosols that affects climate by scattering and absorbing the sunlight. Soot particles are fractal aggregates composed of elemental carbon. In the atmosphere, the aggregates acquire coatings by condensation and coagulation, resulting in significant compaction of the aggregates that changes the direct climate forcing of soot. Currently, no models exist to rigorously describe the process of soot restructuring, reducing prediction accuracy of atmospheric aerosol models. We develop a discrete element method contact model to simulate restructuring of fractal soot aggregates, represented as assemblies of spheres joined by cohesion and by sintered necks. The model is parametrized based on atomic force spectroscopy data and is used to simulate soot restructuring, showing that the fraction of necks in aggregates determines the restructuring pathway. Aggregates with fewer necks undergo local compaction, while aggregates with nearly-full necking prefer global compaction. Additionally, full compaction occurs within tens of nanoseconds, orders of magnitude faster than the time scale of soot aging through condensation. An important implication is that in atmospheric soot aggregates, the rate of condensation determines how many necks are fractured simultaneously, affecting the restructuring pathway, e.g., producing highly compact, thinly-coated soot as observed in recent studies.</description>
