      <title>Assessment of the Rankine Vortex Model for Modeling the Gas Entrainment in a Representative Mock-up of a Sodium Fast Reactor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since decades, the CEA has been involved in the development of 4th generation reactors cooled by sodium. The dedicated experimental platform PLATEAU was erected to study the different issues and built a results database for the code validation. As experiments with sodium are complex, the tests are led in mock-ups using water as a simulant fluid. The MICAS mock-up, model of the upper plenum, aims at studying the gas entrainment at the free surface. Gas is prohibited in the reactor core due to neutron effects, which may induce reactivity variations. Since vortices are difficult to handle by numerical codes in complex geometries such as reactor ones, criteria have been developed based on the Rankine vortex model to forecast the air entrainment. However, in some case, numerical results do not correlate the experimental ones and those discrepancies are may be due to the vortex model. This article aims at comparing the vortices characteristics calculated using the Rankine vortex model with experimental results in order to improve the gas entrainment criteria. The parameters of the Rankine model are determined using the velocity fields measured by the Particle Image Velocity (PIV) method and the vortices diameter is calculated using the raw PIV images.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Phase-Lag and Geometric Precedence in Turbulent Vortex Stretching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the causal timeline of vortex stretching in high-Reynolds-number turbulence ($Re_\lambda \approx 433$) using Lagrangian tracking in $1024^3$ direct numerical simulations. While classical theories often assume an instantaneous alignment between strain and vorticity, the present analysis identifies a systematic Lagrangian phase lag governing the onset of intense dissipation. By conditionally averaging the dynamics of fluid parcels, a distinct phase-space hysteresis is revealed. Trajectories are captured by the saddle-point topology of the pressure field ($\lambda_{min}^p &lt; 0$) prior to experiencing peak enstrophy amplification. This temporal ordering ($\tau &gt; 0$) demonstrates that the pressure topology acts as a deterministic geometric precursor, organizing the flow structure before the bursting event occurs. The robustness of this mechanism is verified in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, where the Lorentz force is found to suppress the hysteresis loop, forcing a transition from causal precedence to simultaneous locking.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Behavior of Tandem Perforated Elastic Vortex Generators Using Two-Way Coupled Fluid-Structure Interaction Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents high-fidelity, two-way coupled fluid-structure interaction simulations to investigate the dynamic behavior of tandem perforated elastic vortex generators across a wide range of bending rigidity, mass ratio, and porosity, at a fixed Reynolds number and interspacing. Comparative simulations with non-perforated EVGs are also performed. Three response modes, lodging, vortex-induced vibration, and static reconfiguration, are observed in both configurations, while a distinct cavity oscillation mode emerges exclusively in non-perforated tandem EVGs. This mode is entirely suppressed with porosity due to disruption of the low-pressure cavity and increased flow transmission through pores. Frequency analyses reveal that vortex-induced vibration is consistently locked onto the second natural frequency, whereas the cavity oscillation mode is locked onto the first natural frequency and closely aligns with the first Rossiter mode, underscoring its distinct physical origin. Perforation modifies the natural frequency of the EVGs, shifting the lock-in and mode transitions toward lower bending rigidity and higher mass ratio values, and reducing oscillation amplitudes due to motion damping. Drag analysis shows consistently higher upstream drag due to wake shielding, while porosity reduces upstream drag and increases downstream drag by restoring streamwise momentum. Flow visualizations demonstrate that vortex shedding originates at the EVG tips, with perforated configurations producing smaller, more dissipative vortical structures. These results establish that porosity fundamentally alters dynamic regimes, suppresses cavity-driven instabilities, and enables passive modulation of wake dynamics in tandem EVG systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Purely Elasto-Plastic Turbulence in Shear Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe the emergence of a distinct, elasticity-driven flow state in a yield-stress fluid in the absence of inertia. Numerical simulations show that this elasto-plastic turbulent state is characterized by a broad spectrum of fluctuations in velocity and stress. Results show a non-monotonic relationship between the volume fraction of the unyielded flow and plasticity. Surprisingly, we find that above a critical value of plasticity, the system can fluidize. Our results reveal the complex interplay between elasticity and plasticity in simple shear flows, indicating that plasticity can enhance rather than hinder momentum transport.</description>

      <title>Generalized Formulation to Predict Rossiter Modes for Subsonic to Hypersonic Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper describes the development of a generalized physics-based model to accurately estimate Rossiter modes for flow over rectangular cavities for regimes ranging from subsonic to hypersonic without the a priori knowlege of flow physics. The Heller-Bliss model is shown to diverge from direct numerical simulation (DNS) results, while the adapted model shows close alignment (within 10\%) with the DNS data at higher Mach numbers, and is physically reasoned on the basis of energy modes. Using an effective temperature to evaluate the speed of sound calculations and then using it to calculate the Strouhal number yields closer predictions to DNS data. The present work also establishes asymptotic limits for Strouhal numbers.</description>

      <title>Progressive Mixture-of-Experts with autoencoder routing for continual RANS turbulence modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) turbulence models that remain accurate across diverse flow regimes remains a long-standing challenge. In this work, we propose a novel framework, termed the progressive mixture-of-experts (PMoE), designed to enable continual learning for RANS turbulence modelling. The framework employs a modular autoencoder-based router to associate each flow scenario with a specialised turbulence model, referred to as an expert. When an unseen flow regime cannot be adequately represented by the existing router and expert set, a new expert together with its routing component can be introduced at low cost, without modifying or degrading previously trained ones, thereby naturally avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The framework is applied to a range of flows with distinct physical characteristics, including baseline airfoil wakes, wall-attached flows, separated flows and corner-induced secondary flows. The resulting PMoE model effectively integrates multiple experts and achieves improved predictive accuracy across both seen and unseen test cases. Owing to sparse activation, model expansion does not incur additional computational cost during inference. The proposed framework therefore provides a scalable pathway towards lifelong-learning turbulence models for industrial computational fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Slip viscosity and strain-rate viscosity in Taylor-Couette laminar flows: Experimental falsification and end-wall effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The viscous force should be shear force, the difference between the strain-rate viscosity and the slip viscosity is that the former has conjugate shear force, while the latter does not. The study in this paper verifies the physical authenticity of two viscosity models through Taylor Couette laminar flow experiments with inner and outer cylinders rotating at the same angular velocity, and numerically investigate the influence of relative cylinder spacing and rotational speed on the circumferential velocity under the slip model. The experimental results of LDV measurement with a relative cylinder spacing of 0.3 indicate that the maximum deviation from rigid-body rotation is about 0.86%, which is consistent with the theoretical prediction of slip viscosity model. The numerical simulations show that the end-walls have no effect under the strain-rate viscosity model; but when the slip viscosity model is introduced, the end-walls inevitably bring about the circumferential velocity profile changing along the axial direction, and result in a three-dimensional (3D) spiral streamline pattern influenced by the relative cylinder spacing and angular speed of cylinders.</description>

      <title>Finite-system size effects in gravity-capillary wave turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate the effects of finite-system size on the dynamics of weakly nonlinear random gravity-capillary surface waves. Experiments are conducted in rectangular tanks with varying aspect ratios, in which the fluid surface is perturbed locally and erratically by small, partially submerged magnets. Driven by an oscillating vertical electromagnetic field, these magnets generate a statistically homogeneous and isotropic random wave field. This setup enables us to probe finite-size effects without the dominant influence of global forcing present in horizontally oscillated tanks. Spatiotemporal measurements of the wave field reveal multiple branches in the wave-energy spectrum along the unconfined direction, corresponding to sloshing modes in the confined direction. We show that the spectral properties of these modes can be tuned by varying either the wave steepness or the confinement. Signatures of discrete wave turbulence in the confined direction and mesoscopic continuous wave turbulence in the unconfined direction are observed. As the confinement is gradually relaxed, we further demonstrate a smooth transition from discrete to continuous wave turbulence, consistent with the nonlinear-to-discreteness timescale ratio. Using high-order correlation analysis, we also show that finite-size effects alter wave dynamics by depleting two-dimensional three-wave resonant interactions along the confined direction.</description>

      <title>Determination of active forces in actomyosin systems as inverse source problems for the Stokes equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of forces and stresses is a central task in biophysics research: Knowledge on forces is key to understanding dynamic processes in active biological systems that are able to self-organize and display emergent properties by converting energy into mechanical work. The aim of this paper is to identify forces generated by a filament-motor network of F-actin and myosin -- actomyosin -- and exerted on the surrounding fluid, therefore causing a fluid flow. In particular, we evaluate optical microscopy data stemming from two different physical settings, confined and non-confined active gels. As a theoretical model, we use the Stokes equation together with an incompressibility condition and suitable boundary conditions reflecting the physical settings. The problem of determining the forces from knowledge on the fluid flow is formulated as an inverse source problem. Due to experimental limitations, only incomplete data are available. We provide a rigorous analysis of the forward problems and the impact of missing data, derive the adjoints of the forward operators needed for regularization, and demonstrate our methods on both synthetic and experimentally measured data.</description>

      <title>Semi-convection in rotating spherical shells: flows, layers and dynamos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large regions of gaseous planets are thought to be stratified with an unstable thermal gradient, but a stabilising gradient of heavy element composition. Fluid in these regions is unstable to semi-convection, with motions driven by differences in the molecular diffusivity of temperature and composition, and could play a role in supporting planetary magnetic fields. Previous studies focus largely on local models in Cartesian boxes; here, we investigate semi-convection in rotating spherical shells. The onset of linear instability shows a transition between the two limits of rotating convection and non-rotating semi-convection. Non-linear simulations evolve into a system of concentric layers of relatively constant density, separated by narrow high-gradient regions. These layers gradually merge, resulting in a statistically steady state dominated by either a single convection region or a narrower convective zone beneath a stably stratified layer (SSL), depending on the strength of the thermal forcing compared to the rotation. When magnetic field generation is considered, our magnetohydrodynamic simulations exhibit self-sustained dynamo action. In cases where the turbulent convective region generates magnetic fields that are smoothed by zonal flows within the overlying SSL, the resulting field is strongly dipolar and axisymmetric, in encouraging agreement with Saturn's observed magnetic field. Within the regimes explored, both the Rossby number and the thickness of the SSL are well predicted by a single combination of control parameters. This enables the identification of a parameter range in which the generated magnetic fields resemble those of planetary dynamos.</description>

      <title>Analysis and simulations of droplet generation regimes in a coaxial microfluidic device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of microdroplets via segmentation in microfluidic devices is of interest in many applications, from biochemical to pharmaceutical. This technique permits indeed much higher control on the droplet size, uniformity and generation rate than in standard batch generation processes. In this work we have evaluated the suitability of the open-source software Basilisk to accurately predict microdroplet generation by segmentation. We have validated the numerical tool with analytical solutions for the dynamics of droplets in confined flows, namely with Bretherton theory, and by comparison with literature experimental results. We have then performed several campaigns of numerical simulations for a coaxial device, analyzing the different regimes of droplet generation, and evaluating how the physical and flow parameters affect the production mechanisms and {the diameters of the generated droplets}. Finally we have proposed new scaling laws for the prediction of droplet diameters in the dripping and jetting regimes, refining existing ones by taking into account additional physical effects, like the viscosity ratio.</description>

      <title>Effects of correlated collisions and intermittency on the growth of lucky droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To trigger precipitation, water droplets in warm clouds need to attain a sufficient size. Theoretical estimates based on condensation and gravitational collisions alone fail to explain the observed timescales for the onset of precipitation for a range of droplet sizes. This suggests the involvement of collisional growth mediated by turbulence to resolve the so-called ``size-gap problem''. For the onset of rain, it is sufficient that statistical outliers, coined ``lucky droplets'', cross the size gap. In this study, we explore the influence of turbulence on droplet growth, focusing on correlated collisions and intermittency. Using direct numerical simulations of droplets in turbulent flow, we constrain a non-Markovian stochastic framework that allows us to assess memory effects on the droplet-size distribution arising from correlations between consecutive collisions. Using our framework, we find that correlated collisions accelerate the initial growth of lucky droplets but have sub-leading effect at later stages. Consequently, we neglect correlations from collisions and model an ensemble of cloud parcels representing fluctuations in the volume-averaged dissipation rate. Here, the distribution of droplet sizes in each parcel is described by a linear master equation with a time-dependent collision rate according to the volume-averaged dissipation rate. Our analyses of this toy model show that intermittency can significantly reduce the time required by lucky droplets to cross the size gap.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the Combination of Reduced Order Models and Domain Decomposition: State of the Art and Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reduced Order Models (ROMs) have been regarded as an efficient alternative to conventional high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) for accelerating the design and optimization processes in engineering applications. Many industrial geometries feature repeating subdomains or contain sub-regions governed by distinct physical phenomena, making them well-suited to Domain Decomposition (DD) techniques. The integration of ROM and DD is promising to further reduce computational costs by constructing local ROMs and assembling them into global solutions. Due to the complexity and necessity of coupling ROMs, many approaches have been proposed in recent years. This review provides a concise overview of existing methodologies combining ROM and DD. We categorize existing methods into intrusive (projection-based) and non-intrusive (data-driven) frameworks. Various strategies for generating local reduced bases and coupling them across subdomains are illustrated. Particular emphasis is placed on intrusive techniques, including equations, numerical algorithms, and practical implementations. The non-intrusive framework is also discussed, highlighting its general procedures, basic formulations, and underlying principles. Finally, we summarise the state of the literature, identify open challenges, and present perspectives on future implementation from an engineering viewpoint.</description>

      <title>Simulating acoustically-actuated flows in complex microchannels using the volume penalization technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a volume penalization technique for simulating acoustically-actuated flows in geometrically complex microchannels. Using a perturbation approach, the nonlinear response of an acoustically-actuated compressible Newtonian fluid moving over obstacles or flowing in a geometrically complex domain is segregated into two sub-problems: a harmonic first-order problem and a time-averaged second-order problem, where the latter utilizes forcing terms and boundary conditions arising from the first-order solution. This segregation results in two distinct volume penalized systems of equations. The no-slip boundary condition at the fluid-solid interface is enforced by prescribing a zero structure velocity for the first-order problem, while spatially varying Stokes drift -- which depends on the gradient of the first-order solution -- is prescribed as the structure velocity for the second-order problem. The harmonic first-order system is solved via MUMPS direct solver, whereas the steady state second-order system is solved iteratively using a novel projection method-based preconditioner. The preconditioned iterative solver for the second-order system is demonstrated to be highly effective and scalable with respect to increasing penalty force and grid resolution, respectively. A novel contour integration technique to evaluate the acoustic radiation force on an immersed object is also proposed. Through test cases featuring representative microfluidic geometries, we demonstrate excellent agreement between the volume penalized and body-fitted grid. We also identify suitable penalty factors and interfacial smearing widths to accurately capture the first- and second-order solutions. These results provide first-of-its-kind empirical evidence of the efficacy of the volume penalization method for simulating acoustic streaming problems that have so far been analyzed using body-fitted methods in literature.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Data Assimilation in Turbulent Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential of Data-Assimilation (DA) within the multi-scale framework of a shell model of turbulence, with a focus on the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF). The central objective is to understand how measuring mesoscales (i.e., inertial-range scales) enhances the prediction of both large-scale and small-scale intermittent variables, by systematically varying observation frequency and the set of measured scales. We demonstrate that measurements conducted at frequencies that exceed those of the observed scales enable full synchronization of larger scales, provided that at least two adjacent mesoscale are measured. In addition, we benchmark the EnKF against two other DA methods, namely Nudging and Ensemble 4D-Var. EnKF is clearly superior to the former, and comparable with the latter but achieving the result with a lower computational complexity. Moreover, our results underscore the need for a tailored, scale-aware inflation technique to stabilize the assimilation process, preventing filter divergence and ensuring robust convergence.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution reconstruction of turbulent flows from a single Lagrangian trajectory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the reconstruction of turbulent flow fields from trajectory data recorded by actively migrating Lagrangian agents. We propose a deep-learning model, track-to-flow (T2F), which employs a vision transformer as the encoder to capture the spatiotemporal features of a single agent trajectory, and a convolutional neural network as the decoder to reconstruct the flow field. To enhance the physical consistency of the T2F model, we further incorporate a physics-informed loss function inspired by the framework of physics-informed neural network (PINN), yielding a variant model referred to as T2F+PINN. We first evaluate both models in a laminar cylinder wake flow at a Reynolds number of $Re = 800$ as a proof of concept. The results show that the T2F model achieves velocity reconstruction accuracy comparable to that of existing flow reconstruction methods, while the T2F+PINN model reduces the normalised error in vorticity reconstruction relative to the T2F model. We then apply the models in a turbulent Rayleigh-B\'enard convection at a Rayleigh number of $Ra = 10^8$ and a Prandtl number of $Pr = 0.71$. The results show that the T2F model accurately reconstructs both the velocity and temperature fields, whereas the T2F+PINN model further improves the reconstruction accuracy of gradient-related physical quantities, such as temperature gradients, vorticity and the Q value, with a maximum improvement of approximately 60 % compared to the T2F model. Overall, the T2F model is better suited for reconstructing primitive flow variables, while the T2F+PINN model provides advantages in reconstructing gradient-related quantities. Our models open a promising avenue for accurate flow reconstruction from a single Lagrangian trajectory.</description>

      <title>X-CAL: Explaining latent causality in physical space for fluid mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03311v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present X-CAL, a pipeline that combines a $\beta$-variational autoencoder ($\beta$-VAE) with the synergistic-unique-redundant decomposition (SURD)~\cite{surd} approach for causality analysis to interpret low-dimensional latent representations of turbulent fluid flows. Combining $\beta$-VAE compression with SURD and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) yields interpretable latent representations and structure-level attributions in physical space, offering a general methodology for causal analysis of high-dimensional flows. Using direct numerical simulation (DNS) data of the flow around a wall-mounted square cylinder at $Re_h=2000$, we (i) learn a compact latent space with near-orthogonal variables, (ii) quantify directed information flows among these variables via the SURD approach, and (iii) map latent-space causality back to physical space through gradient-SHAP fields . By means of percolation analysis of the SHAP fields, we extract the coherent, time-resolved structures that most influence each latent variable. The analysis connects coherent structures with latent variables which are in turn associated with wake-boundary-layer interactions. This method enables translating the insight obtained through causal analysis in the latent space into interpretable phenomena in physical space.</description>

      <title>Multiscale geometric analysis of dynamic wettability on complex, fractal-like, anisotropic surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces novel insights into the development of procedures for identifying the most relevant scales for observing the interactions of dynamic wettability and surface complexities. The experimental procedures presented for measuring dynamic contact angle hysteresis in multiscale correlation with the geometric characteristics of anisotropic surfaces contribute to a new perspective on measurement practice. In this study, microtexturing with a pyramidal structured abrasive belt is applied for precisely forming area- and length-scale anisotropic surface complexities, and consequently, topographically dependent functional features. The significant role of anisotropic topographies in modeling dynamic wettability behavior is highlighted through multiscale measurement-based analysis. These studies verify the relationship between dynamic wettability and the finest surface microgeometry (microroughness) and also the coarsest texture components (waviness). The size of topographic features, ranging from microroughness to waviness, significantly influences droplet pinning and liquid entrapment. Furthermore, the influence of material hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity on the calculated multiscale relationships is assessed. The results indicated specific scales that best correlate with dynamic wettability, with length- and area-scale complexities of 6.9 um and 28 um2, respectively. A novel measurement-based approach to scale-dependent surface-functionality interactions offers new insights for designing dynamic wettability on anisotropic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Bridging Elastic and Active Turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remarkably, even under negligible inertia, the addition of microstructural agents can generate chaotic flow fields. Such behavior can arise in polymer solutions, leading to elastic turbulence, or from active, self-driven particles, which generate active turbulence. Here, we demonstrate a close and hitherto unrecognized connection between these two classes of turbulence. Specifically, we reveal that their continuum descriptions are analogous at the macroscopic level, such that polymeric fluids can be interpreted as a deformable analogue of contractile active matter. Moreover, our numerical results for Kolmogorov flow demonstrate that the transition into the well-known traveling arrowhead structures in elastic turbulence is marked by the emergence of $\pm 1/2$ topological defects, long recognized as a defining feature of active turbulence, in the polymer director field. Importantly, these coherent structures originate from a transverse instability driven by activity-like gradients generated by anisotropically stretched, contractile polymers. At sufficiently strong activity, the system undergoes a transition into a flow-suppressed state characterized by weak polymer stretching and ordering, a behavior that can be explained by analogy with the spontaneous-flow transition observed in channel-confined active nematics.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent numerical model of internal wave-induced mean flow oscillations in polar geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Earth's Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) is a natural example of wave-mean flow interaction and corresponds to the alternating directions of winds in the equatorial stratosphere. It is due to internal gravity waves (IGW) generated in the underlying convective troposphere. In stars, a similar situation is predicted to occur, with the interaction of a stably-stratified radiative zone and a convective zone. In this context, we investigate the dynamics of this reversing mean flow by modelling a stably-stratified envelope and a convectively unstable core in polar geometry. Here, the coupling between the two zones is achieved self-consistently, and IGW generated through convection lead to the formation of a reversing azimuthal mean flow in the upper layer. We characterise the mean-flow oscillations by their periods, velocity amplitudes, and regularity. Despite a continuous broad spectrum of IGW, our work show good qualitative agreement with the monochromatic model of Plumb and McEwan (1978). If the latter was originally developed in the context of the Earth's QBO, our study could prove relevant for its stellar counterpart in massive stars, which host convective cores and radiative envelopes.</description>
