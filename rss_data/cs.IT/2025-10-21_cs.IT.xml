      <title>A Semantic Generalization of Shannon's Information Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Does semantic communication require a semantic information theory parallel to Shannon's information theory, or can Shannon's work be generalized for semantic communication? This paper advocates for the latter and introduces a semantic generalization of Shannon's information theory (G theory for short). The core idea is to replace the distortion constraint with the semantic constraint, achieved by utilizing a set of truth functions as a semantic channel. These truth functions enable the expressions of semantic distortion, semantic information measures, and semantic information loss. Notably, the maximum semantic information criterion is equivalent to the maximum likelihood criterion and similar to the Regularized Least Squares criterion. This paper shows G theory's applications to daily and electronic semantic communication, machine learning, constraint control, Bayesian confirmation, portfolio theory, and information value. The improvements in machine learning methods involve multilabel learning and classification, maximum mutual information classification, mixture models, and solving latent variables. Furthermore, insights from statistical physics are discussed: Shannon information is similar to free energy; semantic information to free energy in local equilibrium systems; and information efficiency to the efficiency of free energy in performing work. The paper also proposes refining Friston's minimum free energy principle into the maximum information efficiency principle. Lastly, it compares G theory with other semantic information theories and discusses its limitation in representing the semantics of complex data.</description>

      <title>Cluster-wise processing in fronthaul-aware cell-free massive MIMO systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exploit a general cluster-based network architecture for a fronthaul-limited user-centric cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system under different degrees of cooperation among the access points (APs) to achieve scalable implementation. In particular, we consider a CF-mMIMO system wherein the available APs are grouped into multiple processing clusters (PCs) to share channel state information (CSI), ensuring that they have knowledge of the CSI for all users assigned to the given cluster for the purposes of designing resource allocation and precoding. We utilize the sum pseudo-SE metric, which accounts for intra-cluster interference and intercluster-leakage, providing a close approximation to the true sum achievable SE. For a given PC, we formulate two optimization problems to maximize the cluster-wise weighted sum pseudo-SE under fronthaul constraints, relying solely on local CSI. These optimization problems are associated with different computational complexity requirements. The first optimization problem jointly designs precoding, user association, and power allocation, and is performed at the small-scale fading time scale. The second optimization problem optimizes user association and power allocation at the large-scale fading time scale. Accordingly, we develop a novel application of modified weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE)-based approach to solve the challenging formulated non-convex mixed-integer problems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid CNN-Transformer Based Sparse Channel Prediction for High-Mobility OTFS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-mobility scenarios in next-generation wireless networks, such as those involving vehicular communications, require ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC). However, rapidly time-varying channels pose significant challenges to traditional OFDM-based systems due to the Doppler effect and channel aging. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation offers resilience by representing channels in the quasi-static delay-Doppler (DD) domain. This letter proposes a novel channel prediction framework for OTFS systems using a hybrid convolutional neural network and transformer (CNN-Transformer) architecture. The CNN extracts compact features that exploit the DD-domain sparsity of the channel matrices, while the transformer models temporal dependencies with causal masking for consistency. Simulation experiments under extreme $500$ \si{km/h} mobility conditions demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing the root mean square error and mean absolute error by $12.2\%$ and $9.4\%$, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of DD-domain representations and the proposed model in accurately predicting channels in high-mobility scenarios, thereby supporting the stringent URLLC requirements in future wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Channel Estimation in RIS-aided Systems via Observation Matrix Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a promising technology for enhancing wireless communications through dense antenna arrays. Accurate channel estimation is critical to unlocking their full performance potential. To enhance RIS channel estimators, this paper proposes a novel observation matrix design scheme. Bayesian optimization framework is adopted to generate observation matrices that maximize the mutual information between received pilot signals and RIS channels. To solve the formulated problem efficiently, we develop an alternating Riemannian manifold optimization (ARMO) algorithm to alternately update the receiver combiners and RIS phase-shift matrices. An adaptive kernel training strategy is further introduced to iteratively refine the channel covariance matrix without requiring additional pilot resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ARMO-enhanced estimator achieves substantial gains in estimation accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Feedback Lunch: Deep Feedback Codes for Wiretap Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider reversely-degraded wiretap channels, for which the secrecy capacity is zero if there is no channel feedback. This work focuses on a seeded modular code design for the Gaussian wiretap channel with channel output feedback, combining universal hash functions for security and learned feedback-based codes for reliability to achieve positive secrecy rates. We study the trade-off between communication reliability and information leakage, illustrating that feedback enables agreeing on a secret key shared between legitimate parties, overcoming the security advantage of the wiretapper. Our findings also motivate code designs for sensing-assisted secure communication, to be used in next-generation integrated sensing and communication methods.</description>

      <title>Non-Orthogonal Pilot Sequence Design for Multi-Cells Interference Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In wireless communications, the performance of non-orthogonal sequence sets significantly affects the level of multi-user interference when the number of users surpasses the sequence length. The design of non-orthogonal sequences plays a crucial role in both the non-orthogonality of the pilots in multi-cell systems and the signature sequences in overloaded code-division multiple-access (CDMA) systems. In multi-cell systems, considering the strength disparity between channels originating from the home cell and the neighboring cells, the extended total squared correlation (ETSC) is proposed as a new sequence design criterion, which is defined as the sum of squares of the weighted correlations among sequences. In this paper, we derive a closed-form expression for the lower bound of ETSC for multi-cell systems with a given sequence length $\tau$, where $\tau \leq K$ and $K$ is the number of users per cell. This can be regarded as a generalization of the well-known Welch bound (Welch, 1974, IEEE TIT) and the extended Welch bound (Wang et al., 2021, IEEE TWC). Additionally, from the necessary conditions of the bound, the optimal sequence set can be easily obtained when the interference power factor matrix is positive definite. On the other hand, to address the lack of sequence generation methods under certain parameter conditions, we propose the ETSC-MM algorithm, which generates sequence sets with low ETSC based on a Majorization-Minimization (MM) optimization framework.</description>

      <title>Unlocking Off-the-Grid Sparse Recovery with Unlimited Sensing: Simultaneous Super-Resolution in Time and Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recovery of Dirac impulses, or spikes, from filtered measurements is a classical problem in signal processing. As the spikes lie in the continuous domain while measurements are discrete, this task is known as super-resolution or off-the-grid sparse recovery. Despite significant theoretical and algorithmic advances over the past decade, these developments often overlook critical challenges at the analog-digital interface. In particular, when spikes exhibit strong-weak amplitude disparity, conventional digital acquisition may result in clipping of strong components or loss of weak ones beneath the quantization noise floor. This motivates a broader perspective: super-resolution must simultaneously resolve both amplitude and temporal structure. Under a fixed bit budget, such information loss is unavoidable. In contrast, the emerging theory and practice of the Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF) demonstrate that these fundamental limitations can be overcome. Building on this foundation, we demonstrate that modulo encoding within USF enables digital super-resolution by enhancing measurement precision, thereby unlocking temporal super-resolution beyond conventional limits. We develop new theoretical results that extend to non-bandlimited kernels commonly encountered in practice and introduce a robust algorithm for off-the-grid sparse recovery. To demonstrate practical impact, we instantiate our framework in the context of time-of-flight imaging. Both numerical simulations and hardware experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach under low-bit quantization, enabling super-resolution in amplitude and time.</description>

      <title>Channel Capacity for FMCW-based Optical Wireless Integrated Sensing and Communication: Asymptotic Analysis and Envelope Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical wireless integrated sensing and communication (OW-ISAC) is rapidly burgeoning as a complement and augmentation to its radio-frequency counterpart. In this paper, the channel capacity is analyzed to guide the design of a coherent OW-ISAC system based on frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW). Firstly, the system model of FMCW-based OW-ISAC is recast into an information-theoretic formulation, where an additional harmonic-mean constraint is imposed to ensure the sensing performance. Subsequently, both lower and upper bounds for channel capacity are derived under the imposed sensing constraint, based on which asymptotic expressions for channel capacity are presented for both low and high signal-to-noise-ratio regions. Moreover, the analysis of channel capacity provides guidance for the envelope design based on pulse amplitude modulation, whose capacity-achieving capabilities are demonstrated by numerical results. Furthermore, simulations reveal the trade-off between communication and sensing functionalities. In summary, the analysis of channel capacity under the sensing constraint provides insights into both the optimality and the practicality of OW-ISAC design.</description>

      <title>Delay-Doppler Pulse Shaping in Zak-OTFS Using Hermite Basis Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of Zak-OTFS modulation is critically dependent on the choice of the delay-Doppler (DD) domain pulse shaping filter. The design of pulses for $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ is constrained by the Balian-Low Theorem, which imposes an inescapable trade-off between time-frequency localization and orthogonality for spectrally efficient systems. In Zak-OTFS, this trade-off requires balancing the need for localization for input/output (I/O) relation estimation with the need for orthogonality for reliable data detection when operating without time or bandwidth expansion. The well-known sinc and Gaussian pulse shapes represent the canonical extremes of this trade-off, while composite constructions such as the Gaussian-sinc (GS) pulse shape offer a good compromise. In this work, we propose a systematic DD pulse design framework for Zak-OTFS that expresses the pulse as a linear combination of Hermite basis functions. We obtain the optimal coefficients for the Hermite basis functions that minimize the inter-symbol interference (ISI) energy at the DD sampling points by solving a constrained optimization problem via singular value decomposition. For the proposed class of Hermite pulses, we derive closed-form expressions for the I/O relation and noise covariance in Zak-OTFS. Simulation results of Zak-OTFS with embedded pilot and model-free I/O relation estimation in Vehicular-A channels with fractional DDs demonstrate that the optimized pulse shape achieves a bit error rate performance that is significantly superior compared to those of the canonical sinc and Gaussian pulses and is on par with that of the state-of-the-art GS pulse, validating the proposed framework which provides greater design flexibility in terms of control of ISI and sidelobe energies.</description>

      <title>Multihead Finite-State Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops multihead finite-state compression, a generalization of finite-state compression, complementary to the multihead finite-state dimensions of Huang, Li, Lutz, and Lutz (2025). In this model, an infinite sequence of symbols is compressed by a compressor that produces outputs according to finite-state rules, based on the symbols read by a constant number of finite-state read heads moving forward obliviously through the sequence. The main theorem of this work establishes that for every sequence and every positive integer $h$, the infimum of the compression ratios achieved by $h$-head finite-state information-lossless compressors equals the $h$-head finite-state predimension of the sequence. As an immediate corollary, the infimum of these ratios over all $h$ is the multihead finite-state dimension of the sequence.</description>

      <title>Mode Switching-based STAR-RIS with Discrete Phase Shifters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for cost-effective, high-speed Internet of Things (IoT) applications in the coming sixth-generation (6G) networks has driven research toward maximizing spectral efficiency and simplifying hardware designs. In this context, we investigate the sum rate maximization problem for a mode-switching discrete-phase shifters simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided multi-antenna access point network, emphasizing hardware efficiency and reduced cost. A mixed-integer nonlinear optimization framework is formulated for joint optimization of the active beamforming matrix, user power allocation, and STAR-RIS phase shift vectors, including binary transmission/reflection amplitudes and discrete phase shifters. To solve the formulated problem, we employ a block coordinate descent method, dividing it into three subproblems tackled using difference-of-concave programming and combinatorial optimization techniques. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed joint optimization approach, consistently achieving superior sum rate performance compared to partial optimization methods, thereby underscoring its potential for efficient and scalable 6G IoT systems.</description>

      <title>Space-Time Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for Multibeam LEO Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel space-time rate-splitting multiple access (ST-RSMA) framework for multibeam low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications (SATCOM) systems, where space-time coding is integrated into the common stream transmission. This design enables full diversity gain in the common stream transmission for all users, regardless of the uncertainty of the channel state information (CSI) and network load conditions, thereby overcoming the performance limitations of conventional RSMA that employs a single beamforming vector for all users. To further enhance performance, we develop a weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE)-based algorithm tailored to ST-RSMA that jointly optimizes the power allocation for the common stream and the power/beamforming vectors for private streams, aiming to maximize the minimum user rate. Numerical results show that ST-RSMA significantly outperforms conventional RSMA and other multiple access techniques, offering a robust and scalable solution for LEO SATCOM.</description>

      <title>On the Capacity of Erasure-prone Quantum Storage with Erasure-prone Entanglement Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum message is encoded into $N$ storage nodes (quantum systems $Q_1\dots Q_N$) with assistance from $N_B$ maximally entangled bi-partite quantum systems $A_1B_1, \dots, A_{N_B}B_{N_B}$, that are prepared in advance such that $B_1\dots B_{N_B}$ are stored separately as entanglement assistance (EA) nodes, while $A_1\dots A_{N_B}$ are made available to the encoder. Both the storage nodes and EA nodes are erasure-prone. The quantum message must be recoverable given any $K$ of the $N$ storage nodes along with any $K_B$ of the $N_B$ EA nodes. The capacity for this setting is the maximum size of the quantum message, given that the size of each EA node is $\lambda_B$. All node sizes are relative to the size of a storage node, which is normalized to unity. The exact capacity is characterized as a function of $N,K,N_B,K_B, \lambda_B$ in all cases, with one exception. The capacity remains open for an intermediate range of $\lambda_B$ values when a strict majority of the $N$ storage nodes, and a strict non-zero minority of the $N_B$ EA nodes, are erased. As a key stepping stone, an analogous classical storage (with shared-randomness assistance) problem is introduced. A set of constraints is identified for the classical problem, such that classical linear code constructions translate to quantum storage codes, and the converse bounds for the two settings utilize similar insights. In particular, the capacity characterizations for the classical and quantum settings are shown to be identical in all cases where the capacity is settled.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Framework For Cascaded Channel Estimation in RIS-Aided mmWave Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate cascaded channel estimation for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided millimeter-wave multi-user communication systems. Since the complex channel gains of the cascaded RIS channel are generally non-Gaussian, the use of the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) estimator leads to inevitable performance degradation. To tackle this issue, we propose a variational inference-based framework that approximates the complex channel gains using a complex adaptive Laplace prior, which effectively captures their probability distributions in a tractable way. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed estimator outperforms conventional estimators including least squares and LMMSE in terms of cascaded channel estimation error.</description>

      <title>Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for MIMO with Quantized b-bit Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is critical for 6G communication, offering improved spectral efficiency and reliability. However, conventional fully digital designs face significant challenges due to high hardware complexity and power consumption. Low-bit MIMO architectures, such as those employing b-bit quantized phase shifters, provide a cost-effective alternative but introduce NP-hard combinatorial problems in the pre- and post-coding design. This paper explores the use of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and alternating optimization to address the problem of b-bit quantized phase shifters both at the transmitter and the receiver. We demonstrate that the structure of this quantized beamforming problem aligns naturally with hybrid-classical methods like QAOA, as the phase shifts used in beamforming can be directly mapped to rotation gates in a quantum circuit. Notably, this paper is the first to show that theoretical connection. Then, the Hamiltonian derivation analysis for the b-bit case is presented, which could have applications in different fields, such as integrated sensing and communication, and emerging quantum algorithms such as quantum machine learning. In addition, a warm-start QAOA approach is studied which improves computational efficiency. Numerical results highlight the effectiveness of the proposed methods in achieving an improved quantized beamforming gain over their classical optimization benchmarks from the literature.</description>

      <title>Spatial-to-Spectral Harmonic-Modulated Arrays for 6G Multi-Beam MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents an overview and analysis of spatial-to-spectral harmonic-modulated arrays (SHAs). Compared to traditional analog or digital beamforming arrays, SHAs enable concurrent multi-beamforming without requiring substantial hardware replication. SHAs replace the need for hardware replication with frequency-domain multiplexing. Furthermore, SHAs have the potential to become key contributors to future 6G networks by enabling scalable multi-user communications, joint communication and sensing, and spatial interference mitigation. In addition, an analysis of the SHA's harmonic-modulation waveform and its effects on gain, noise and bandwidth is presented. A comb-like modulation waveform for SHAs that minimizes spectral inefficiency is proposed. Further, an analysis of the SHA's capability to independently steer multiple beams is presented. This capability is quantified in terms of the SHA's spatial-to-spectral degrees of freedom. Lastly, this work introduces a novel SHA architecture that provides three spatial-to-spectral degrees of freedom with minimal hardware replication.</description>

      <title>Predictability of Complex Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of complex systems has attracted widespread attention from researchers in the fields of natural sciences, social sciences, and engineering. Prediction is one of the central issues in this field. Although most related studies have focused on prediction methods, research on the predictability of complex systems has received increasing attention across disciplines--aiming to provide theories and tools to address a key question: What are the limits of prediction accuracy? Predictability itself can serve as an important feature for characterizing complex systems, and accurate estimation of predictability can provide a benchmark for the study of prediction algorithms. This allows researchers to clearly identify the gap between current prediction accuracy and theoretical limits, thereby helping them determine whether there is still significant room to improve existing algorithms. More importantly, investigating predictability often requires the development of new theories and methods, which can further inspire the design of more effective algorithms. Over the past few decades, this field has undergone significant evolution. In particular, the rapid development of data science has introduced a wealth of data-driven approaches for understanding and quantifying predictability. This review summarizes representative achievements, integrating both data-driven and mechanistic perspectives. After a brief introduction to the significance of the topic in focus, we will explore three core aspects: the predictability of time series, the predictability of network structures, and the predictability of dynamical processes. Finally, we will provide extensive application examples across various fields and outline open challenges for future research.</description>

      <title>On Robust hypothesis testing with respect to Hellinger distance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the hypothesis testing problem where the observed samples need not come from either of the specified hypotheses (distributions). In such a situation, we would like our test to be robust to this misspecification and output the distribution closer in Hellinger distance. If the underlying distribution is close to being equidistant from the hypotheses, then this would not be possible. Our main result is quantifying how close the underlying distribution has to be to either of the hypotheses. We also study the composite testing problem, where each hypothesis is a Hellinger ball around a fixed distribution. A generalized likelihood ratio test is known to work for this problem. We give an alternate test for the same.</description>

      <title>Single-letter Chain Rule for Quantum Relative Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is the standard measure of distinguishability in classical and quantum information theory. In the classical case, its loss under channels admits an exact chain rule, while in the quantum case only asymptotic, regularized chain rules are known. We establish new chain rules for quantum relative entropy that apply already in the single-copy regime. The first inequality is obtained via POVM decompositions, extending the point distributions in the classical chain rule to quantum ensemble partitions. The second gives a sufficient condition for the most natural extension of the classical result, which uses projectors as a analog for the classical point distributions. We additionally find a semiclassical chain rule where the point distributions are replaced with the projectors of the initial states, and, finally, we find a relation to previous works on strengthened data processing inequalities and recoverability. These results show that meaningful chain inequalities are possible already at the single-copy level, but they also highlight that tighter bounds remain to be found.</description>

      <title>A Unified Approach to Statistical Estimation Under Nonlinear Observations: Tensor Estimation and Matrix Factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the estimation of some parameter $\mathbf{x}$ living in a cone from the nonlinear observations of the form $\{y_i=f_i(\langle\mathbf{a}_i,\mathbf{x}\rangle)\}_{i=1}^m$. We develop a unified approach that first constructs a gradient from the data and then establishes the restricted approximate invertibility condition (RAIC), a condition that quantifies how well the gradient aligns with the ideal descent step. We show that RAIC yields linear convergence guarantees for the standard projected gradient descent algorithm, a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm for low Tucker-rank tensor estimation, and a factorized gradient descent algorithm for asymmetric low-rank matrix estimation. Under Gaussian designs, we establish sharp RAIC for the canonical statistical estimation problems of single index models, generalized linear models, noisy phase retrieval, and one-bit compressed sensing. Combining the convergence guarantees and the RAIC, we obtain a set of optimal statistical estimation results, including, to our knowledge, the first minimax-optimal and computationally efficient algorithms for tensor single index models, tensor logistic regression, (local) noisy tensor phase retrieval, and one-bit tensor sensing. Moreover, several other results are new or match the best known guarantees. We also provide simulations and a real-data experiment to illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Error-correcting codes and absolutely maximally entangled states for mixed dimensional Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major difficulty in quantum computation is the ability to implement fault tolerant computations, protecting information against undesired interactions with the environment. Stabiliser codes were introduced as a means to protect information when storing or applying computations in Hilbert spaces where the local dimension is fixed, i.e. in Hilbert spaces of the form $({\mathbb C}^D)^{\otimes n}$. If $D$ is a prime power then one can consider stabiliser codes over finite fields \cite{KKKS2006}, which allows a deeper mathematical structure to be used to develop stabiliser codes. However, there is no practical reason that the subsystems should have the same local dimension and in this article we introduce a stabiliser formalism for mixed dimensional Hilbert spaces, i.e. of the form ${\mathbb C}^{D_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes {\mathbb C}^{D_n}$. More generally, we define and prove a Singleton bound for quantum error-correcting codes of mixed dimensional Hilbert spaces. We redefine entanglement measures for these Hilbert spaces and follow \cite{HESG2018} and define absolutely maximally entangled states as states which maximise this entanglement measure. We provide examples of absolutely maximally entangled states in spaces of dimensions not previously known to have absolutely maximally entangled states.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Local Combining with Decentralized Decoding for Distributed Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major bottleneck in uplink distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output networks is the sub-optimal performance of local combining schemes, coupled with high fronthaul load and computational cost inherent in centralized large scale fading decoding (LSFD) architectures. This paper introduces a decentralized decoding architecture that fundamentally breaks from the conventional LSFD, by allowing each AP calculates interference-suppressing local weights independently and applies them to its data estimates before transmission. Furthermore, two generalized local zero-forcing (ZF) framework, generalized partial full-pilot ZF (G-PFZF) and generalized protected weak PFZF (G-PWPFZF), are introduced, where each access point (AP) adaptively and independently determines its combining strategy through a local sum spectral efficiency optimization that classifies user equipments (UEs) as strong or weak using only local information, eliminating the fixed thresholds used in PFZF and PWPFZF. To further enhance scalability, pilot-dependent combining vectors instead of user-dependent ones are introduced and are shared among users with the same pilot. The corresponding closed-form spectral efficiency expressions are derived. Numerical results show that the proposed generalized schemes consistently outperform fixed-threshold counterparts, while the introduction of local weights yields lower overhead and computation costs with minimal performance penalty compared to them.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity Analysis of Multi-Target Detection via Markovian and Hard-Core Multi-Reference Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we study the sample complexity of the multi-target detection (MTD) problem, in which an unknown signal appears multiple times at unknown locations within a long, noisy observation. We propose a patching scheme that reduces MTD to a non-i.i.d. multi-reference alignment (MRA) model. In the one-dimensional setting, the latent group elements form a Markov chain, and we show that the convergence rate of any estimator matches that of the corresponding i.i.d. MRA model, up to a logarithmic factor in the number of patches. Moreover, for estimators based on empirical averaging, such as the method of moments, the convergence rates are identical in both settings. We further establish an analogous result in two dimensions, where the latent structure arises from an exponentially mixing random field generated by a hard-core placement model. As a consequence, if the signal in the corresponding i.i.d. MRA model is determined by moments up to order $n_{\min}$, then in the low-SNR regime the number of patches required to estimate the signal in the MTD model scales as $\sigma^{2n_{\min}}$, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the noise variance.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Randomness in Continuous-Time Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13620</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.13620v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop the elements of the theory of algorithmic randomness in continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs). Our main contribution is a rigorous, useful notion of what it means for an individual trajectory of a CTMC to be random. CTMCs have discrete state spaces and operate in continuous time. This, together with the fact that trajectories may or may not halt, presents challenges not encountered in more conventional developments of algorithmic randomness.
  Although we formulate algorithmic randomness in the general context of CTMCs, we are primarily interested in the computational} power of stochastic chemical reaction networks, which are special cases of CTMCs. This leads us to embrace situations in which the long-term behavior of a network depends essentially on its initial state and hence to eschew assumptions that are frequently made in Markov chain theory to avoid such dependencies.
  After defining the randomness of trajectories in terms of martingales (algorithmic betting strategies), we prove equivalent characterizations in terms of algorithmic measure theory and Kolmogorov complexity. As a preliminary application we prove that, in any stochastic chemical reaction network, every random trajectory with bounded molecular counts has the non-Zeno property that infinitely many reactions do not occur in any finite interval of time.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate additive complementary dual (ACD) codes and their construction over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ with respect to the trace inner products, where $q$ is a prime power. First, we associate an additive code with a matrix known as a generator matrix. After that, we describe ACD codes in terms of generator matrices for the trace Hermitian and the trace Euclidean inner products. We also construct ACD codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ from linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_q.$ Additionally, we present techniques for constructing ACD codes with various parameters from a given ACD code over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}.$ By applying these methods, we construct numbers of trace Euclidean and trace Hermitian ACD codes that exhibit better parameters compared to the best known linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_9$ and $\mathbb{F}_4$ of the same size and length.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inter-symbol interference (ISI) limits reliability in diffusion-based molecular communication (MC) channels. We propose RLIM, a family of run-length-limited (RLL) codes that form fixed-size codebooks by minimizing the total number of 1-bits, increasing the per-symbol molecule budget under standard power normalizations and thus improving reliability. We develop a provably optimal linear-time greedy decoder that is equivalent to Viterbi decoding under a deterministic last-wins tie-break and has lower computational complexity; empirically, it outperforms first-wins and random Viterbi variants on RLL baselines. Extensive binomial and particle-tracking simulations show that RLIM achieves lower bit error rate (BER) than classical RLL and other prominent coding schemes across a broad range of scenarios.</description>

      <title>Many-User Multiple Access with Random User Activity: Achievability Bounds and Efficient Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Gaussian multiple access channel with random user activity, in the regime where the number of users is proportional to the code length. The receiver may know some statistics about the number of active users, but does not know the exact number nor the identities of the active users. We derive two achievability bounds on the probabilities of missed detection, false alarm, and active user error, and propose an efficient CDMA-type scheme whose performance can be compared against these bounds. The first bound is a finite-length result based on Gaussian random codebooks and maximum-likelihood decoding. The second is an asymptotic bound, established using spatially coupled Gaussian codebooks and approximate message passing (AMP) decoding. These bounds can be used to compute an achievable tradeoff between the active user density and energy-per-bit, for a fixed user payload and target error rate. The efficient CDMA scheme uses a spatially coupled signature matrix and AMP decoding, and we give rigorous asymptotic guarantees on its error performance. Our analysis provides the first state evolution result for spatially coupled AMP with matrix-valued iterates, which may be of independent interest. Numerical experiments demonstrate the promising error performance of the CDMA scheme for both small and large user payloads, when compared with the two achievability bounds.</description>

      <title>What should a neuron aim for? Designing local objective functions based on information theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02482v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In modern deep neural networks, the learning dynamics of the individual neurons is often obscure, as the networks are trained via global optimization. Conversely, biological systems build on self-organized, local learning, achieving robustness and efficiency with limited global information. We here show how self-organization between individual artificial neurons can be achieved by designing abstract bio-inspired local learning goals. These goals are parameterized using a recent extension of information theory, Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes the information that a set of information sources holds about an outcome into unique, redundant and synergistic contributions. Our framework enables neurons to locally shape the integration of information from various input classes, i.e. feedforward, feedback, and lateral, by selecting which of the three inputs should contribute uniquely, redundantly or synergistically to the output. This selection is expressed as a weighted sum of PID terms, which, for a given problem, can be directly derived from intuitive reasoning or via numerical optimization, offering a window into understanding task-relevant local information processing. Achieving neuron-level interpretability while enabling strong performance using local learning, our work advances a principled information-theoretic foundation for local learning strategies.</description>

      <title>Sum Rate Maximization for NOMA-Assisted Uplink Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an uplink communication scenario in which multiple users communicate with an access point (AP) employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). A pinching antenna, which can be activated at an arbitrary point along a dielectric waveguide, is deployed at the AP to dynamically reconfigure user channels. The objective is to maximize the system sum rate by jointly optimizing the pinching-antenna's position and the users' transmit powers. Two scenarios are considered: one without quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees, and the other with QoS guarantees. In the former case, users transmit at full power, and the antenna position is determined using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In the latter, an alternating optimization approach is adopted, where a low-complexity solution is derived for power allocation, and a modified PSO algorithm is applied to optimize the antenna position. Numerical results show that the proposed pinching-antenna-assisted system significantly improves the sum rate compared to the conventional fixed-antenna architecture. Furthermore, the NOMA-based approach consistently outperforms its TDMA-based counterpart. Finally, the proposed PSO-based method achieves near-optimal performance, particularly when the QoS constraints are moderate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we bound the rate of linear codes in $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ with the property that any $k\leq q$ codewords are all simultaneously distinct in at least $d_k$ coordinates. For the case of particular interest $q=k=3$ we recover, with a simpler proof, state of the art results in the case $d_3=1$ and new bounds for $d_3&gt;1$. We finally discuss some related open problems on the list-decoding zero-error capacity of discrete memoryless channels.</description>

      <title>Optimal Frames for Phase Retrieval from Edge Vectors of Optimal Polygons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to characterize the optimal frame for phase retrieval, defined as the frame whose condition number for phase retrieval attains its minimal value. In the context of the two-dimensional real case, we reveal the connection between optimal frames for phase retrieval and the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem, originally proposed by Reinhardt in 1922. Our work establishes that every optimal solution to the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem inherently leads to an optimal frame in ${\mathbb R}^2$. By recasting the optimal polygons problem as one concerning the discrepancy of roots of unity, we characterize all optimal polygons. Building upon this connection, we then characterize all optimal frames with $m$ vectors in ${\mathbb R}^2$ for phase retrieval when $m \geq 3$ has an odd factor. As a key corollary, we show that the harmonic frame $E_m$ is {\em not} optimal for any even integer $m \geq 4$. This finding disproves a conjecture proposed by Xia, Xu, and Xu (Math. Comp., 94(356): 2931-2960). Previous work has established that the harmonic frame $E_m \subset {\mathbb R}^2$ is indeed optimal when $m$ is an odd integer.
  Exploring the connection between phase retrieval and discrete geometry, this paper aims to illuminate advancements in phase retrieval and offer new perspectives on the perimeter-maximizing isodiametric problem.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Estimation via Score-to-Fisher Bridge for Nonlinear Gaussian Noise Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical method to evaluate mutual information (MI) in nonlinear Gaussian noise channels by using denoising score matching (DSM) learning for estimating the score function of channel output. Via de Bruijn's identity, Fisher information estimated from the learned score function yields accurate estimates of MI through a Fisher integral representation for a variety of priors and channel nonlinearities. In this work, we propose a comprehensive theoretical foundation for the Score-to-Fisher bridge methodology, along with practical guidelines for its implementation. We also conduct extensive validation experiments, comparing our approach with closed-form solutions and a kernel density estimation baseline. The results of our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is both practical and efficient for MI estimation in nonlinear Gaussian noise channels.</description>

      <title>Simulating Mediumband Wireless Communication Systems: A Concise Description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the necessary procedures for accurately simulating digital wireless communication systems operating in the mediumband, aimed at both beginners and experts. In the research literature, digital wireless communication systems are typically simulated in the discrete-time complex baseband domain, where pulse shaping, upconversion, mixing, carrier synchronization, and symbol timing synchronization are often ignored. These assumptions are indeed sufficient in most cases, but to capture the essence of communication in the mediumband, certain physical layer (PHY) operations should be simulated in detail. In this paper, we concisely describe how to simulate a mediumband wireless communication scenario from a single transmitter (TX) to a single receiver (RX) in MATLAB, elaborating the operation of key PHY subsystems. The approach described here ensures that the simulated system captures the delicate dynamics of mediumband wireless communication, including the effect of deep fading avoidance.</description>

      <title>Online Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04602v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of integrating sequentially arriving data within the quantile regression framework, where the number of features is allowed to grow with the number of observations, the horizon is unknown, and memory is limited. We employ stochastic sub-gradient descent to minimize the empirical check loss and study its statistical properties and regret performance. In our analysis, we unveil the delicate interplay between updating iterates based on individual observations versus batches of observations, revealing distinct regularity properties in each scenario. Our method ensures long-term optimal estimation irrespective of the chosen update strategy. Importantly, our contributions go beyond prior works by achieving exponential-type concentration inequalities and attaining optimal regret and error rates that exhibit only \textsf{ short-term} sensitivity to initial errors. A key insight from our study is the delicate statistical analyses and the revelation that appropriate stepsize schemes significantly mitigate the impact of initial errors on subsequent errors and regrets. This underscores the robustness of stochastic sub-gradient descent in handling initial uncertainties, emphasizing its efficacy in scenarios where the sequential arrival of data introduces uncertainties regarding both the horizon and the total number of observations. Additionally, when the initial error rate is well-controlled, there is a trade-off between short-term error rate and long-term optimality. Due to the lack of delicate statistical analysis for squared loss, we also briefly discuss its properties and proper schemes. Extensive simulations support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Semi-definite optimization of the measured relative entropies of quantum states and channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The measured relative entropies of quantum states and channels find operational significance in quantum information theory as achievable error rates in hypothesis testing tasks. They are of interest in the near term, as they correspond to hybrid quantum--classical strategies with technological requirements far less challenging to implement than required by the most general strategies allowed by quantum mechanics. In this paper, we prove that these measured relative entropies can be calculated efficiently by means of semi-definite programming, by making use of variational formulas for the measured relative entropies of states and semi-definite representations of the weighted geometric mean and the operator connection of the logarithm. Not only do the semi-definite programs output the optimal values of the measured relative entropies of states and channels, but they also provide numerical characterizations of optimal strategies for achieving them, which is of significant practical interest for designing hypothesis testing protocols.</description>

      <title>Radiance Field Delta Video Compression in Edge-Enabled Vehicular Metaverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11857v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offload computationally intensive tasks to multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, enabling applications within the vehicular metaverse, which transforms physical environment into the digital space enabling advanced analysis or predictive modeling. A core challenge is physical-to-virtual (P2V) synchronization through digital twins (DTs), reliant on MEC networks and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). To address this, we introduce radiance field (RF) delta video compression (RFDVC), which uses RF-encoder and RF-decoder architecture using distributed RFs as DTs storing photorealistic 3D urban scenes in compressed form. This method extracts differences between CAV-frame capturing actual traffic and RF-frame capturing empty scene from the same camera pose in batches encoded and transmitted over the MEC network. Experiments show data savings up to 71% against H.264 codec and 44% against H.265 codec under different conditions as lighting changes, and rain. RFDVC also demonstrates resilience to transmission errors, significantly outperforming the standard codec in non-rainy conditions with up to a +0.26 structural similarity index measure (SSIM) improvement over H.264 codec, and maintaining a +0.18 SSIM improvement even in challenging rainy conditions, both measured at a block error rate (BLER) of 0.25.</description>

      <title>Informativity Conditions for Multiple Signals: Properties, Experimental Design, and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10030v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies highlight the importance of persistently exciting condition in single signal sequence for model identification and data-driven control methodologies. However, maintaining prolonged excitation in control signals introduces significant challenges, as continuous excitation can reduce the lifetime of mechanical devices. In this paper, we introduce three informativity conditions for various types of multi-signal data, each augmented by weight factors. We explore the interrelations between these conditions and their rank properties in linear time-invariant systems. Furthermore, we introduce open-loop experimental design methods tailored to each of the three conditions, which can synthesize the required excitation conditions either offline or online, even in the presence of limited information within each signal segment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these informativity conditions in least-squares identification. Additionally, all three conditions can extend Willems' fundamental lemma and are utilized to assess the properties of the system. Illustrative examples confirm that these conditions yield satisfactory outcomes in both least-squares identification and the construction of data-driven controllers.</description>

Abstract: We propose a novel exact algorithm for generating connected Erdos-Renyi random graphs $G(n,p)$. The method couples the graph exploration process to an inhomogeneous Poisson random walk, which yields an exact sampler that runs in $O(n)$ time in the sparse regime $p=c/n$. We also show how the method extends to the $G(n,M)$ model via an additional acceptance-rejection step.</description>

      <title>Distance-Domain Degrees of Freedom in Near-Field Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01227v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extremely large aperture arrays operating in the near-field regime unlock additional spatial resources, which can be exploited to simultaneously serve multiple users even when they share the same angular direction. This work investigates the distance-domain degrees of freedom (DoF), defined as the DoF when a user varies only its distance to the base station and not the angle. To obtain the distance-domain DoF, we study a line-of-sight (LoS) channel with a source representing a base station and an observation region representing users, where the source is a large two-dimensional transmit (Tx) array with arbitrary shape and the observation region is an arbitrarily long linear receive (Rx) array with collinearly aligned elements located at different distances from the Tx array. We assume that both the Tx and Rx arrays have continuous apertures with an infinite number of elements and infinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the distance-domain DoF in the case of a finite number of elements. First, we analyze an ideal case where the Tx array is a single piece and the Rx array is on the broadside of the Tx array. By reformulating the channel as an integral operator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form expression for the distance-domain DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows that the distance-domain DoF is predominantly determined by the extreme boundaries of both the Tx and Rx arrays rather than their detailed interior structure. We further extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a projection method that converts the problem to an equivalent broadside case. Finally, we extend the analytical framework to modular arrays and show the distance-domain DoF gain over a single-piece array under a fixed total physical length.</description>

      <title>Bounding quantum uncommon information with quantum neural estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In classical information theory, uncommon information refers to the amount of information that is not shared between two messages, and it admits an operational interpretation as the minimum communication cost required to exchange the messages. Extending this notion to the quantum setting, quantum uncommon information is defined as the amount of quantum information necessary to exchange two quantum states. While the value of uncommon information can be computed exactly in the classical case, no direct method is currently known for calculating its quantum analogue. Prior work has primarily focused on deriving upper and lower bounds for quantum uncommon information. In this work, we propose a new approach for estimating these bounds by utilizing the quantum Donsker-Varadhan representation and implementing a gradient-based optimization method. Our results suggest a pathway toward efficient approximation of quantum uncommon information using variational techniques grounded in quantum neural architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parallel Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols are suggested to improve the safety guarantees, transaction throughput and confirmation latencies of Nakamoto consensus. In this work, we first consider the existing parallel PoW protocols and develop hard-coded incentive attack structures. Our theoretical results and simulations show that the existing parallel PoW protocols are more vulnerable to incentive attacks than the Nakamoto consensus, e.g., attacks have smaller profitability threshold and they result in higher relative rewards. Next, we introduce a voting-based semi-parallel PoW protocol that outperforms both Nakamoto consensus and the existing parallel PoW protocols from most practical perspectives such as communication overheads, throughput, transaction conflicts, incentive compatibility of the protocol as well as a fair distribution of transaction fees among the voters and the leaders. We use state-of-the-art analysis to evaluate the consistency of the protocol and consider Markov decision process (MDP) models to substantiate our claims about the resilience of our protocol against incentive attacks.</description>

      <title>Structure-Fair Quantum Circuit Complexity: An Auditable Information-Theoretic Lower Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the complexity of quantum states that possess intrinsic structure, such as symmetry or encoding, in a fair manner constitutes a core challenge in the benchmarking of quantum technologies. This paper introduces the Reference-Contingent Complexity (RCC), an information-theoretic measure calibrated by the available quantum operations. The core idea is to leverage the quantum relative entropy to quantify the deviation of a quantum state from its "structured vacuum"-namely, the maximum entropy state within its constrained subspace-thereby only pricing the process of creating non-trivial information. Our central result is a key theorem that rigorously proves the RCC serves as a lower bound for the complexity of any universal quantum circuit. This lower bound is comprised of a linear dominant term, a universal logarithmic correction, and a precise physical correction term that accounts for non-uniformity in the spectral distribution. Crucially, we establish a set of operational protocols, grounded in tasks like quantum hypothesis testing, which make this theoretical lower bound experimentally "auditable." This work provides a "ruler" for quantum technology that is structure-fair and enables cross-platform comparison, thereby establishing a strictly verifiable constraint between the computational cost of the process and the structured information of the final state.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models are Kelly Gamblers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We draw a connection between diffusion models and the Kelly criterion for maximizing returns in betting games. We find that conditional diffusion models store additional information to bind the signal $X$ with the conditioning information $Y$, equal to the mutual information between them. Classifier-free guidance effectively boosts the mutual information between $X$ and $Y$ at sampling time. This is especially helpful in image models, since the mutual information between images and their labels is low, a fact which is intimately connected to the manifold hypothesis. Finally, we point out some nuances in the popular perspective that diffusion models are infinitely deep autoencoders. In doing so, we relate the denoising loss to the Fermi Golden Rule from quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Deception based on Semantic Distortion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physical layer deception (PLD) is a framework we previously introduced that integrates physical layer security (PLS) with deception techniques, enabling proactive countermeasures against eavesdropping rather than relying solely on passive defense. We extend this framework to a semantic communication model and conduct a theoretical analysis using semantic distortion as the performance metric. In this work, we further investigate the receiver's selection of decryption strategies and the transmitter's optimization of encryption strategies. By anticipating the decryption strategy likely to be employed by the legitimate receiver and eavesdropper, the transmitter can optimize resource allocation and encryption parameters, thereby maximizing the semantic distortion at the eavesdropper while maintaining a low level of semantic distortion for the legitimate receiver. We present a rigorous analysis of the resulting optimization problem, propose an efficient optimization algorithm, and derive closed-form optimal solutions for multiple scenarios. Finally, we corroborate the theoretical findings with numerical simulations, which also confirm the practicality of the proposed algorithm.</description>
