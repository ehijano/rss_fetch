      <description>arXiv:2410.05716v1 Announce Type: new

      <title>Compact groups in which commutators have finite right Engel sinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A right Engel sink of an element $g$ of a group $G$ is a subset containing all sufficiently long commutators $[...[[g,x],x],\dots ,x]$. We prove that if $G$ is a compact group in which, for some $k$, every commutator $[...[g_1,g_2],\dots ,g_k]$ has a finite right Engel sink, then $G$ has a locally nilpotent open subgroup. If in addition, for some positive integer $m$, every commutator $[...[g_1,g_2],\dots ,g_k]$ has a right Engel sink of cardinality at most $m$, then $G$ has a locally nilpotent subgroup of finite index bounded in terms of $m$ only.</description>

      <title>On pre-Lie rings related to some non-Lazard braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let A be a brace of cardinality $p^{n}$ for some prime number $p$. Suppose that either (i) the additive group of brace $A$ has rank smaller than $p-3$, or (ii) $A^{\frac {p-1}2}\subseteq pA$ or (iii) $p^{i}A$ is an ideal in in $A$ for each $i$.
  It is shown that there is a pre-Lie ring associated to brace $A$. The left nilpotency index of this pre-Lie ring can be arbitrarily large.</description>

      <title>Smoothing countable group actions on metrizable spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06077v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that every topological action of a countable group on a metrizable space can be realized as a bi-Lipschitz action with respect to some compatible metric. This extends a result due to U. Hamenst\"{a}dt regarding finitely generated groups, and our proof is based upon her idea. This also gives a simple proof of a theorem due to Deroin, Kleptsyn and Navas regarding one-manifolds. We also establish an analogous result for closed subgroups of locally compact groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper helps explain the prevalence of soluble groups among the automorphism groups of regular maps (at least for `small' genus), by showing that every non-perfect hyperbolic ordinary triangle group $\Delta^+(p,q,r) = \langle\, x,y \ | \ x^p = y^q = (xy)^r = 1 \,\rangle$ has a smooth finite soluble quotient of derived length $c$ for some $c \le 3$, and infinitely many such quotients of derived length $d$ for every $d &gt; c$.</description>

      <title>Pragmatic finiteness properties of locally compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compare finiteness properties of locally compact groups that generalize the properties of being compactly generated and of being compactly presented. Three such families of properties have been proposed: Abels--Tiemeyer's type $C_n$, coarse $(n-1)$-connectedness, and Castellano--Corob-Cook's type $F_n$. The first was defined for locally compact groups, the second can be defined for general topological groups, while the third was defined only for tdlc groups. We prove that all three families lead to the same notion for locally compact groups. This justifies working with these properties despite the fact that it is still unclear in which sense they describe finiteness properties of free classifying spaces for locally compact groups. Various parts of the arguments are well-known to various experts. By putting them together we hope to clarify the literature.</description>

      <title>Short positive loxodromics in graph products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a method for effectively generating generalised loxodromics in subgroups of graph products, using positive words. This has several consequences for the growth of subsets of these groups. In particular, we show that graph products of groups with strong product set growth properties also share those properties. We additionally show that the set of growth rates of a class of subgroups of any graph product of equationally noetherian groups is well-ordered.</description>

      <title>Maximal subgroups in torsion branch groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the maximal subgroups of branch groups and obtain a criterion that ensures that certain spinal groups are contained in the class $\mathcal{MF}$ of groups with all maximal subgroups of finite index. This allows us to construct branch groups within $\mathcal{MF}$ exhibiting novel properties, for example groups that possess non-normal maximal subgroups. Furthermore, we give new concrete examples of branch groups outside $\mathcal{MF}$, with explicitly given maximal subgroups of infinite index. Most prominently, we construct a periodic branch group outside $\mathcal{MF}$.</description>

      <title>Subgroup separability of twisted right-angled Artin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise twisted right-angled Artin groups that are subgroup separable using only their defining mixed graphs; we deduce that the group is subgroup separable if and only if the underlying simplicial graph of the mixed graph does not contain paths or squares in 4 vertices. Our work generalises the results of Metaftsis - Raptis on classical right-angled Artin groups.</description>

      <title>Normal covering numbers for $S_n$ and $A_n$ and additive combinatorics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The normal covering number $\gamma(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is the minimum number of proper subgroups whose conjugates cover the group. We give various estimates for $\gamma(S_n)$ and $\gamma(A_n)$ depending on the arithmetic structure of $n$. In particular we determine the limsups over $\gamma(S_n) / n$ and $\gamma(A_n) / n$ over the sequences of even and odd integers, as well as the liminf of $\gamma(S_n) / n$ over even integers. In general we explain how the values of $\gamma(S_n) / n$ and $\gamma(A_n) / n$ are related to problems in additive combinatorics. These results answer most of the questions posed by Bubboloni, Praeger, and Spiga as Problem 20.17 of the Kourovka Notebook.</description>

      <title>Functorial languages in homological algebra and the lower central series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This approach is based on the idea used to construct the so-called ${\bf fr}$-language. We construct such functorial languages as the ${\bf fr_{\infty}}$-language and other versions of it on categories of groups using the lower central series of groups of relations. In addition, we compute higher limits of the coinvariants of exterior powers, free Lie powers of modules of relations associated to free representations of groups. We show that such ${\bf fr_{\infty}}$-languages have remarkable properties when restricted to groups of finite homological dimension, torsion-free groups, and groups having no torsion up to $n$. Finally, we show how one can use functorial languages to transform categories/varieties of groups into certain spectra, which we call flux-spectra.</description>

      <title>Conditioned random walks on linear groups I: construction of the target harmonic measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our objective is to explore random walks on the general linear group, constrained to a specific domain, with a primary focus on establishing the conditioned local limit theorem. This paper marks the initial stride toward achieving this goal, specifically entailing the construction of a novel entity -- the target harmonic measure. This measure, together with the harmonic function, serves as a pivotal component in shaping the conditioned local limit theorem. Using a reversal identity, we introduce a reversed sequence characterized as a dual random walk with a perturbation depending on future observations. The investigation of such walks, which rely on future information, lies at the heart of this paper. To carry out this study, we develop an approach grounded in the finite-size approximation of perturbations, enabling us to simplify the investigation to an array of Markov chains with increasing dimensions.</description>

      <title>Omega-categorical limits of betweenness relations and $D$-sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore two constructions of oligomorphic Jordan permutation groups preserving a `limit of betweenness relations' and a `limit of $D$-relations', from \cite{bhattmacph2006jordan} and \cite{almazaydeh2021jordan} respectively. Several issues left open in \cite{almazaydeh2021jordan} are resolved. In particular it is shown that the `limit of $D$-relations' is not homogeneous in the given language, but is `homogenizable', that is, there is a homogeneous structure over a finite relational language with the same universe and the same automorphism group. The structure is NIP, but not monadically NIP, its age is not well-quasi-ordered under embeddability, and the growth rate of the sequence enumerating orbits on $k$-sets grows faster than exponentially. The automorphism group is maximal-closed in the symmetric group. Similar results are shown for the construction in \cite{bhattmacph2006jordan}.</description>

We deduce a graph theoretical approach to the problem of enumerating transfer systems. As an application we find a lower bound for the number of transfer systems on a boolean lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a locally finite, connected graph $\Gamma$, let $\operatorname{Map}(\Gamma)$ denote the group of proper homotopy equivalences of $\Gamma$ up to proper homotopy. Excluding sporadic cases, we show $\operatorname{Aut}(S(M_\Gamma)) \cong \operatorname{Map}(\Gamma)$, where $\mathcal{S}(M_\Gamma)$ is the sphere complex of the doubled handlebody $M_\Gamma$ associated to $\Gamma$. We also construct an exhaustion of $S(M_\Gamma)$ by finite strongly rigid sets when $\Gamma$ has finite rank and finitely many rays, and an appropriate generalization otherwise.</description>

      <title>Aperiodic Flows on Finite Semigroups: Foundations and First Examples</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theory of flows was used as a crucial tool in the recent proof by Margolis, Rhodes and Schilling that Krohn-Rhodes complexity is decidable. In this paper we begin a systematic study of aperiodic flows. We give the foundations of the theory of flows and give a unified approach to the Presentation Lemma and its relations to flows and the Slice Theorem. We completely describe semigroups having a flow over the trivial semigroup and connect this to classical results in inverse semigroup theory. We reinterpret Tilson's Theorem on the complexity of small monoids in terms of flows. We conclude with examples of semigroups built from the character table of Abelian Groups that have an aperiodic flows.</description>

      <title>On automorphisms of affine superspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we propose a super version of Jacobian conjecture on the automorphisms of affine superspaces over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $0$, which predicts that for a homomorphism $\varphi$ of the polynomial superalgebra $\mathcal{R}:=\mathbb{F}[x_1,\ldots,x_m; \xi_1,\ldots,\xi_m]$ over $\mathbb{F}$, if $\varphi$ satisfies the super version of Jacobian condition (SJ for short), then $\varphi$ gives rise to an automorphism of the affine superspace $\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{F}}^{m|n}$. We verify the conjecture if additionally, the set $\mathscr{M}$ of maximal $\mathbb{Z}_2$-homogeneous ideals of $\mathcal{R}$ is assumed to be preserved under $\varphi$. The statement is actually proved in any characteristic, i.e. a homomorphism $\varphi$ gives rise to an automorphism of $\mathbb{A}_{\mathbb{F}}^{m|n}$ if SJ is satisfied with $\varphi$ and the set $\mathscr{M}$ is preserved under $\varphi$ for an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{F}$ of any characteristic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the study of group algebras of finite groups in which the socle of the center is an ideal. We provide a detailed analysis of the structure of these groups. In a particular case, we reach a complete characterization of the groups with this property.</description>

      <title>Local Hilbert--Schmidt stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a notion of local Hilbert--Schmidt stability, motivated by the recent definition by Bradford of local permutation stability, and give examples of (non-residually finite) groups that are locally Hilbert--Schmidt stable but not Hilbert--Schmidt stable. For amenable groups, we provide a criterion for local Hilbert--Schmidt stability in terms of group characters, by analogy with the character criterion of Hadwin and Shulman for Hilbert--Schmidt stable amenable groups. Furthermore, we study the (very) flexible analogues of local Hilbert--Schmidt stability, and we prove several results analogous to the classical setting. Finally, we prove that infinite sofic, respectively hyperlinear, property (T) groups are never locally permutation stable, respectively locally Hilbert--Schmidt stable. This strengthens the result of Becker and Lubotzky for classical stability, and answers a question of Lubotzky.</description>

      <title>On finite groups isospectral to groups with abelian Sylow $2$-subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spectrum of a finite group is the set of orders of its elements. We are concerned with finite groups having the same spectrum as a direct product of nonabelian simple groups with abelian Sylow $2$-subgroups. For every positive integer $k$, we find $k$ nonabelian simple groups with abelian Sylow 2-subgroups such that their direct product is uniquely determined by its spectrum in the class of all finite groups. On the other hand, we prove that there are infinitely many finite groups having the same spectrum as the direct cube of the small Ree group $^2G_2(q)$, $q&gt;3$, or the direct fourth power of the sporadic group $J_1$.</description>

      <title>Local limit theorem for random walks on symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reduce the local limit theorem for a non-compact semisimple Lie group acting on its symmetric space to establishing that a natural operator associated to the measure is quasicompact. Under strong Diophantine assumptions on the underlying measure, we deduce the necessary spectral results for the operator in question. We thereby give the first examples of finitely supported measures satisfying such a local limit theorem. Moreover, quantitative error rates for the local limit theorem are proved under additional assumptions.</description>

      <title>Groups without unitary representations, submeasures, and the escape property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give new examples of topological groups that do not have non-trivial continuous unitary representations, the so-called exotic groups. We prove that all groups of the form $L^0(\phi, G)$, where $\phi$ is a pathological submeasure and $G$ is a topological group, are exotic. This result extends, with a different proof, a theorem of Herer and Christensen on exoticness of $L^0(\phi,\mathbb{R})$ for $\phi$ pathological. It follows that every topological group embeds into an exotic one. In our arguments, we introduce the escape property, a geometric condition on a topological group, inspired by the solution to Hilbert's fifth problem and satisfied by all locally compact groups, all non-archimedean groups, and all Banach--Lie groups. Our key result involving the escape property asserts triviality of all continuous homomorphisms from $L^0(\phi, G)$ to $L^0(\mu, H)$, where $\phi$ is pathological, $\mu$ is a measure, $G$ is a topological group, and $H$ is a topological group with the escape property.</description>

      <title>Groups of matrices with approximately submultiplicative spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We say that a semigroup of matrices has a submultiplicative spectrum if the spectrum of the product of any two elements of the semigroup is contained in the product of the two spectra in question (as sets). In this note we explore an approximate version of this condition.</description>
