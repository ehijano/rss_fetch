      <title>The Philosophy and Physics of Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This monograph discusses dualities in physics: what dualities are, their main examples--from quantum mechanics and electrodynamics to statistical mechanics, quantum field theory and string theory--and the philosophical questions they raise. Part I first conceptualises dualities and discusses their main roles and themes, including how they are related to familiar notions like symmetry and interpretation. It also discusses the main simple examples of dualities: position-momentum, wave-particle, electric-magnetic, and Kramers-Wannier dualities. Part II discusses advanced examples and their inter-relations: particle-soliton dualities, electric-magnetic dualities in quantum field theories, dualities in string theory, and gauge-gravity duality. This Part ends with discussions of the hole argument, and how string theory counts the microstates of a black hole. Part III is an in-depth discussion of general philosophical issues on which dualities bear: theoretical equivalence (two theories 'saying the same thing, in different words'), scientific realism and the under-determination of theories by data, theory succession and the M-theory programme, explanation, and scientific understanding. It proposes a view of scientific theories that it dubs 'the geometric view of theories'. The book's treatment of the examples is at the advanced undergraduate and graduate level, starting from elementary and progressing to more advanced examples. The discussions of philosophical topics, such as referential semantics, theoretical equivalence, scientific realism and scientific understanding, are both self-contained and in-depth. Thus the book is aimed at students and researchers with an interest in the physical examples and philosophical questions about dualities, and also in how physics and philosophy can fruitfully interact with each other.</description>

      <title>Newtons First Law Is Not a Special Case of the Second Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Newtons Laws of Motion form the basis of classical mechanics, but misconceptions about their interrelationships persist in pedagogy. A prevalent misunderstanding is that Newtons First Law is a trivial consequence of the Second Law. This paper argues that the First Law serves a logically distinct foundational role that defines the context in which the Second Law is valid. This conceptual distinction is clarified through classical thought experiments and further supported by insights from relativistic mechanics. Furthermore, the paper discusses the notion of the zeroth Law. It evaluates several candidates, including the absoluteness of space and time, the conservation and additivity of mass, and the locality of force in time. By articulating the details of the logical structure of Newtons Laws, this article offers theoretical clarity and pedagogical value for the teaching and interpretation of Newtonian mechanics.</description>

      <title>Time as a Cosmological Phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the arrow of time is intimately related to the geometry and topology of the whole universe, and is therefore best understood as a cosmological phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Taming Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In statistics and causal modeling it is common for a selection process to induce correlations in a subset of an uncorrelated ensemble. We propose that EPR and Bell correlations are selection artefacts of this kind. The selection process is preparation of the initial state of the relevant experiments. Choice of initial state amounts to preselection of a subensemble of a larger, uncorrelated, virtual ensemble of possible histories. Because it is preselection rather than postselection, the resulting correlations support the intuitive counterfactuals of the EPR argument and Bell nonlocality. In this respect, and in its temporal orientation, the case differs from familiar forms of selection bias. Given the ubiquity of quantum entanglement, the result may thus be of independent interest to students of causal modeling. The paper concludes with a discussion of its novel implications in that field.</description>
