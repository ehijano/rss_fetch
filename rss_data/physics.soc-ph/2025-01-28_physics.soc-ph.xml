      <title>Doppelg\"anger Model: Emergence of polarization in opinion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, contrary to the early popular expectation that large-scale discourse in online communities would foster greater consensus, the large-scale structure of online discourse has been measured to be strongly polarized. Though it was posited that this effect was driven mainly by the algorithmic curation of content by social platforms (the "Filter Bubble") it appears that polarization is mainly driven by the tendency of interactions among users to be homophilic; users strongly prefer to endorse content and other users that are similar to them. Users organize into homophilic clusters or "echo chambers" where interactions within clusters are more likely to be positive and interactions between clusters are more likely to be negative. This motivates studying polarization in online discourse through modeling as an example of self organized dynamics. Models of opinion formation on networks have tended to only encode positive interactions (attraction) between users - as a consequence consensus or non-interacting clusters of users are ubiquitous behaviors. In this research a model of network-based opinion formation is introduced that includes a novel dynamic of negative interaction; instead of modeling negative interaction as repulsion in the opinion space it is modeled as an attraction to a "Doppelg\"anger" user. It is demonstrated that this model exhibits rich behavior. Four distinct regimes of local interaction correspond to different population-wide dynamics - Neutral Consensus, Extreme Consensus, Polarization and Undecided. In the Polarization regime, local interactions are modeled to be homophilic and the structure of discourse that emerges replicates what is seen in empirical data; clustered users where interactions within clusters is positive and interaction between clusters is negative.</description>

      <title>Community-centric modeling of citation dynamics explains collective citation patterns in science, law, and patents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15552v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many human knowledge systems, such as science, law, and invention, are built on documents and the citations that link them. Citations, while serving multiple purposes, primarily function as a way to explicitly document the use of prior work and thus have become central to the study of knowledge systems. Analyzing citation dynamics has revealed statistical patterns that shed light on knowledge production, recognition, and formalization, and has helped identify key mechanisms driving these patterns. However, most quantitative findings are confined to scientific citations, raising the question of universality of these findings. Moreover, existing models of individual citation trajectories fail to explain phenomena such as delayed recognition, calling for a unifying framework. Here, we analyze a newly available corpus of U.S. case law, in addition to scientific and patent citation networks, to show that they share remarkably similar citation patterns, including a heavy-tailed distribution of sleeping beauties. We propose a holistic model that captures the three core mechanisms driving collective dynamics and replicates the elusive phenomenon of delayed recognition. We demonstrate that the model not only replicates observed citation patterns, but also better predicts future successes by considering the whole system. Our work offers insights into key mechanisms that govern large-scale patterns of collective human knowledge systems and may provide generalizable perspectives on discovery and innovation across domains.</description>

      <title>Emergence of cooperation promoted by higher-order strategy updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooperation is fundamental to human societies, and the interaction structure among individuals profoundly shapes its emergence and evolution. In real-world scenarios, cooperation prevails in multi-group (higher-order) populations, beyond just dyadic behaviors. Despite recent studies on group dilemmas in higher-order networks, the exploration of cooperation driven by higher-order strategy updates remains limited due to the intricacy and indivisibility of group-wise interactions. Here we investigate four categories of higher-order mechanisms for strategy updates in public goods games and establish their mathematical conditions for the emergence of cooperation. Such conditions uncover the impact of both higher-order strategy updates and network properties on evolutionary outcomes, notably highlighting the enhancement of cooperation by overlaps between groups. Interestingly, we discover that the strategical mechanism alternating optimality and randomness -- selecting an outstanding group and then imitating a random individual within this group -- can prominently promote cooperation. Our analyses further unveil that, compared to pairwise interactions, higher-order strategy updates generally improve cooperation in most higher-order networks. These findings underscore the pivotal role of higher-order strategy updates in fostering collective cooperation in complex social systems.</description>

      <title>Vienna Mosaic: Navigating Social Borders in a Melting Pot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban segregation poses a critical challenge in cities, exacerbating inequalities, social tensions, fears, and polarization. It emerges from a complex interplay of socioeconomic disparities and residential preferences, disproportionately impacting migrant communities. In this paper, using a comprehensive administrative data from Vienna, where nearly 40% of the population consists of international migrants, we analyse co-residence preferences between migrants and locals at the neighbourhood level. Our findings reveal two major clusters in Vienna shaped by wealth disparities, district diversity, and nationality-based homophily. These insights shed light on the underlying mechanisms of urban segregation and designing policies for better integration.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods to probe for spatial correlations in temporal networks and infer their topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motifs are thought to be some fundamental components of social face-to-face interaction temporal networks. However, the motifs previously considered are either limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles, which are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of social systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these triangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be mined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the edge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods motifs of [A. Longa, G. Cencetti, B. Lepri, and A. Passerini, An efficient procedure for mining egocentric temporal motifs, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery 36, 355 (2022)]. We also confirm in empirical data that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to the Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show how mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for spatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that network. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the edge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions. In the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the edge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network they were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development, that we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory.</description>

      <title>Who is the root in a syntactic dependency structure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The syntactic structure of a sentence can be described as a tree that indicates the syntactic relationships between words. In spite of significant progress in unsupervised methods that retrieve the syntactic structure of sentences, guessing the right direction of edges is still a challenge. As in a syntactic dependency structure edges are oriented away from the root, the challenge of guessing the right direction can be reduced to finding an undirected tree and the root. The limited performance of current unsupervised methods demonstrates the lack of a proper understanding of what a root vertex is from first principles. We consider an ensemble of centrality scores, some that only take into account the free tree (non-spatial scores) and others that take into account the position of vertices (spatial scores). We test the hypothesis that the root vertex is an important or central vertex of the syntactic dependency structure. We confirm that hypothesis and find that the best performance in guessing the root is achieved by novel scores that only take into account the position of a vertex and that of its neighbours. We provide theoretical and empirical foundations towards a universal notion of rootness from a network science perspective.</description>

      <title>Epidemics on the Move: How Public Transport Demand and Capacity Shape Disease Spread</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamics of passenger interactions and their epidemiological impact throughout public transportation systems is crucial for both service efficiency and public health. High passenger density and close physical proximity has been shown to accelerate the spread of infectious diseases. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many public transportation companies took measures to slow down and minimize disease spreading. One of these measures was introducing spacing and capacity constraints to public transit vehicles. Our objective is to explore the effects of demand changes and transportation measures from an epidemiological point of view, offering alternative measures to public transportation companies to keep the system alive while minimizing the epidemiological risk as much as possible.</description>

      <title>A data-driven kinetic model for opinion dynamics with social network contacts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Opinion dynamics is an important and very active area of research that delves into the complex processes through which individuals form and modify their opinions within a social context. The ability to comprehend and unravel the mechanisms that drive opinion formation is of great significance for predicting a wide range of social phenomena such as political polarization, the diffusion of misinformation, the formation of public consensus, and the emergence of collective behaviors. In this paper, we aim to contribute to that field by introducing a novel mathematical model that specifically accounts for the influence of social media networks on opinion dynamics. With the rise of platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram and many others, social networks have become significant arenas where opinions are shared, discussed, and potentially altered. To this aim after an analytical construction of our new model and through incorporation of real-life data from Twitter, we calibrate the model parameters to accurately reflect the dynamics that unfold in social media, showing in particular the role played by the so-called influencers in driving individual opinions towards predetermined directions.</description>

      <title>Community detection in bipartite signed networks is highly dependent on parameter choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decision-making processes often involve voting. Human interactions with exogenous entities such as legislations or products can be effectively modeled as two-mode (bipartite) signed networks-where people can either vote positively, negatively, or abstain from voting on the entities. Detecting communities in such networks could help us understand underlying properties: for example ideological camps or consumer preferences. While community detection is an established practice separately for bipartite and signed networks, it remains largely unexplored in the case of bipartite signed networks. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of community detection methods on projected bipartite signed networks using a synthetic benchmark and real-world datasets. Our findings reveal that when no communities are present in the data, these methods often recover spurious user communities. When communities are present, the algorithms exhibit promising performance, although their performance is highly susceptible to parameter choice. This indicates that researchers using community detection methods in the context of bipartite signed networks should not take the communities found at face value: it is essential to assess the robustness of parameter choices or perform domain-specific external validation.</description>

      <title>Emergence of social hierarchies in a society with two competitive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agent-based models describing social interactions among individuals can help to better understand emerging macroscopic patterns in societies. One of the topics which is worth tackling is the formation of different kinds of hierarchies that emerge in social spaces such as cities. Here we propose a Bonabeau-like model by adding a second group of agents. The fundamental particularity of our model is that only a pairwise interaction between agents of the opposite group is allowed. Agent fitness can thus only change by competition among the two groups, while the total fitness in the society remains constant. The main result is that for a broad range of values of the model parameters, the fitness of the agents of each group show a decay in time except for one or very few agents which capture almost all the fitness in the society. Numerical simulations also reveal a singular shift from egalitarian to hierarchical society for each group. This behaviour depends on the control parameter $\eta$, playing the role of the inverse of the temperature of the system. Results are invariant with regard to the system size, contingent solely on the quantity of agents within each group. Finally, scaling laws are provided thus showing a data collapse from different model parameters and they follow a shape which can be related to the presence of a phase transition in the model.</description>

      <title>Opinion dynamics in bounded confidence models with manipulative agents: Moving the Overton window</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the opinion dynamics under the influence of manipulative agents. This type of agents is characterized by the fact that their opinions follow a trajectory that does not respond to the dynamics of the model, although it does influence the rest of the normal agents. Simulation has been implemented to study how one manipulative group modifies the natural dynamics of some opinion models of bounded confidence. It is studied what strategies based on the number of manipulative agents and their common opinion trajectory can be carried out by a manipulative group to influence normal agents and attract them to their opinions. In certain weighted models, some effects are observed in which normal agents move in the opposite direction to the manipulator group. Moreover, the conditions which ensure the influence of a manipulative group on a group of normal agents over time are also established for the Hegselmann-Krause model.</description>
