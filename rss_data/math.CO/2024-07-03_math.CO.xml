      <title>Eccentricity and algebraic connectivity of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ nodes with algebraic connectivity $\lambda_{2}$. The eccentricity of a node is defined as the length of a longest shortest path starting at that node. If $s_\ell$ denotes the number of nodes of eccentricity at most $\ell$, then for $\ell \ge 2$, $$\lambda_{2} \ge \frac{ 4 \, s_\ell }{ (\ell-2+\frac{4}{n}) \, n^2 }.$$ As a corollary, if $d$ denotes the diameter of $G$, then $$\lambda_{2} \ge \frac{ 4 }{ (d-2+\frac{4}{n}) \, n }.$$ It is also shown that $$\lambda_{2} \ge \frac{ s_\ell }{ 1+ \ell \left(e(G^{\ell})-m\right) },$$ where $m$ and $e(G^\ell)$ denote the number of edges in $G$ and in the $\ell$-th power of $ G $, respectively.</description>

      <title>Hoffman colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study equality in the Hoffman bound for the chromatic number and Hoffman colorings in regular and irregular graphs. We investigate the connection between Hoffman colorability and several graph operations, of which the tensor product is especially interesting in this context. We then introduce the Decomposition Theorem revealing structural properties that Hoffman colorings must obey. Using the Decomposition Theorem we are able to completely classify Hoffman colorability of cone graphs and line graphs. We also prove a partial converse, the Composition Theorem, allowing us to find various new infinite families of Hoffman colorable graphs, many of which are irregular. Lastly we introduce a new parameterization and type system for strongly regular graphs, that show connections between Hoffman colorability, spreadability, pseudo-geometricity and unique vector colorability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we extend results about unique $n^{\textrm{th}}$ roots and cancellation of finite disconnected graphs with respect to the Cartesian, the strong and the direct product, to the rooted hierarchical products, and to a modified lexicographic product. We show that these results also hold for graphs with countably many finite connected components, as long as every connected component appears only finitely often (up to isomorphism). The proofs are via monoid algebras and generalized power series rings.</description>

      <title>On $\{1,2\}$-distance-balancedness of generalized Petersen graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A connected graph $G$ of diameter ${\rm diam}(G) \ge \ell$ is $\ell$-distance-balanced if $|W_{xy}|=|W_{yx}|$ for every $x,y\in V(G)$ with $d_{G}(x,y)=\ell$, where $W_{xy}$ is the set of vertices of $G$ that are closer to $x$ than to $y$. It is proved that if $k\ge 3$ and $n&gt;k(k+2)$, then the generalized Petersen graph $GP(n,k)$ is not distance-balanced and that $GP(k(k+2),k)$ is distance-balanced. This significantly improves the main result of Yang et al.\ [Electron.\ J.\ Combin.\ 16 (2009) \#N33]. It is also proved that if $k\ge 6$, where $k$ is even, and $n&gt;\frac{5}{4}k^2+2k$, or if $k\ge 5$, where $k$ is odd, and $n&gt;\frac{7}{4}k^2+\frac{3}{4}k$, then $GP(n,k)$ is not $2$-distance-balanced. These results partially resolve a conjecture of Miklavi\v{c} and \v{S}parl [Discrete Appl.\ Math.\ 244 (2018) 143--154].</description>

      <title>A Refutation of the Pach-Tardos Conjecture for 0-1 Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of forbidden 0-1 matrices generalizes Turan-style (bipartite) subgraph avoidance, Davenport-Schinzel theory, and Zarankiewicz-type problems, and has been influential in many areas, such as discrete and computational geometry, the analysis of self-adjusting data structures, and the development of the graph parameter twin width.
  The foremost open problems in this area is to resolve the Pach-Tardos conjecture from 2005, which states that if a forbidden pattern $P\in\{0,1\}^{k\times l}$ is the bipartite incidence matrix of an acyclic graph (forest), then $\mathrm{Ex}(P,n) = O(n\log^{C_P} n)$, where $C_P$ is a constant depending only on $P$. This conjecture has been confirmed on many small patterns, specifically all $P$ with weight at most 5, and all but two with weight 6.
  The main result of this paper is a clean refutation of the Pach-Tardos conjecture. Specifically, we prove that $\mathrm{Ex}(S_0,n),\mathrm{Ex}(S_1,n) \geq n2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})}$, where $S_0,S_1$ are the outstanding weight-6 patterns. We also prove sharp bounds on the entire class of alternating patterns $(P_t)$, specifically that for every $t\geq 2$, $\mathrm{Ex}(P_t,n)=\Theta(n(\log n/\log\log n)^t)$. This is the first proof of an asymptotically sharp bound that is $\omega(n\log n)$.</description>

      <title>Metric dimension and Zagreb indices of essential ideal graph of a finite commutative ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring with unity. The essential ideal graph $\mathcal{E}_{R}$ of $R$ is a graph whose vertex set consists of all nonzero proper ideals of \textit{R}. Two vertices $\hat{I}$ and $\hat{J}$ are adjacent if and only if $\hat{I}+ \hat{J}$ is an essential ideal. In this paper, we characterize the graph $\mathcal{E}_{R}$ as having a finite metric dimension.
  Additionally, we identify that the essential ideal graph and annihilating ideal graph of the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$ are isomorphic whenever $n$ is a product of distinct primes. Also, we estimate the metric dimension of the essential ideal graph of the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$. Furthermore, we determine the topological indices, namely the first and the second Zagreb indices, of $\mathcal{E}_{\mathbb Z_n}$.</description>

      <title>Erd\H{o}s-Rogers functions for arbitrary pairs of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $f_{F,G}(n)$ be the largest size of an induced $F$-free subgraph that every $n$-vertex $G$-free graph is guaranteed to contain. We prove that for any triangle-free graph $F$, \[ f_{F,K_3}(n) = f_{K_2,K_3}(n)^{1 + o(1)} = n^{\frac{1}{2} + o(1)}.\] Along the way we give a slight improvement of a construction of Erd\H os-Frankl-R\"odl for the Brown-Erd\H os-S\'os $(3r-3,3)$-problem when $r$ is large.
  In contrast to our result for $K_3$, for any $K_4$-free graph $F$ containing a cycle, we prove there exists $c_F &gt; 0$ such that $$f_{F,K_4}(n) &gt; f_{K_2,K_4}(n)^{1 + c_F} = n^{\frac{1}{3}+c_F+o(1)}.$$ \iffalse We also observe that our earlier proof for $F=K_3$ generalizes to $f_{F,K_4}(n) = O(\sqrt{n}\log n)$ for all $F$ containing a cycle. \fi
  For every graph $G$, we prove that there exists $\varepsilon_G &gt;0$ such that whenever $F$ is a non-empty graph such that $G$ is not contained in any blowup of $F$, then $f_{F,G}(n) = O(n^{1-\varepsilon_G})$. On the other hand, for graph $G$ that is not a clique, and every $\varepsilon&gt;0$, we exhibit a $G$-free graph $F$ such that $f_{F,G}(n) = \Omega(n^{1-\varepsilon})$.</description>

      <title>On a classification of planar functions in characteristic three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar functions are functions over a finite field that have optimal combinatorial properties and they have applications in several branches of mathematics, including algebra, projective geometry and cryptography. There are two relevant equivalence relations for planar functions, that are isotopic equivalence and CCZ-equivalence. Classification of planar functions is performed via CCZ-equivalence which arises from cryptographic applications. In the case of quadratic planar functions, isotopic equivalence, coming from connections to commutative semifields, is more general than CCZ-equivalence and isotopic transformations can be considered as a construction method providing up to two CCZ-inequivalent mappings. In this paper, we first survey known infinite classes and sporadic cases of planar functions up to CCZ-equivalence, aiming to exclude equivalent cases and to identify those with the potential to provide additional functions via isotopic equivalence. In particular, for fields of order $3^n$ with $n\le 11$, we completely resolve if and when isotopic equivalence provides different CCZ-classes for all currently known planar functions. Further, we perform an extensive computational investigation on some of these fields and find seven new sporadic planar functions over $\mathbb{F}_{3^6}$ and two over $\mathbb{F}_{3^9}$. Finally, we give new simple quadrinomial representatives for the Dickson family of planar functions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting sums and products in countable and finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a polynomial ergodic theorem for actions of the affine group of a countable field $K$. As an application, we deduce--via a variant of Furstenberg's correspondence principle--that for fields of characteristic zero, any "large" set $E\subset K$ contains "many" patterns of the form $\{p(x)+y,xy\}$, for every non-constant polynomial $p(x)\in K[x]$.
  Our methods are flexible enough that they allow us to recover analogous density results in the setting of finite fields and, with the aid of a new finitistic variant of Bergelson's "colouring trick", show that for $r\in \mathbb{N}$ fixed, any $r-$colouring of a large enough finite field will contain monochromatic patterns of the form $\{x,p(x)+y,xy\}$.
  In a different direction, we obtain a double ergodic theorem for actions of the affine group of a countable field. An adaptation of the argument for affine actions of finite fields leads to a generalisation of a theorem of Shkredov. Finally, to highlight the utility of the aforementioned finitistic "colouring trick", we provide a conditional, elementary generalisation of Green and Sanders' $\{x,y,x+y,xy\}$ theorem.</description>

      <title>Unimodality and peak location of the characteristic polynomials of two distance matrices of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unimodality of the normalized coefficients of the characteristic polynomial of distance matrices of trees are known and bounds on the location of its peak (the largest coefficient) are also known. Recently, an extension of these results to distance matrices of block graphs was given. In this work, we extend these results to two additional distance-type matrices associated with trees: the Min-4PC matrix and the 2-Steiner distance matrix. We show that the sequences of coefficients of the characteristic polynomials of these matrices are both unimodal and log-concave. Moreover, we find the peak location for the coefficients of the characteristic polynomials of the Min-4PC matrix of any tree on $n$ vertices. Further, we show that the Min-4PC matrix of any tree on $n$ vertices is isometrically embeddable in $\mathbb{R}^{n-1}$ equipped with the $\ell_1$ norm.</description>

      <title>The Signed Goldman-Iwahori Space and Real Tropical Linear Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Goldman-Iwahori space of seminorms on a finite-dimensional vector space over a non-Archimedean field is a non-Archimedean analogue of a symmetric space. If, in addition, $K$ is real closed, we define a signed analogue of the Goldman-Iwahori space consisting of signed seminorms. This new space can be seen as the linear algebraic version of the real analytification of projective space over $K$. We study this space with methods from real tropical geometry by constructing natural real tropicalization maps from the signed Goldman-Iwahori space to all real tropicalized linear spaces. We prove that this space is the limit of all real tropicalized linear embeddings. We give a combinatorial interpretation of this result by showing that the signed Goldman-Iwahori space is the real tropical linear space associated to the universal realizable oriented matroid. In the constant coefficient case for $K = \mathbb{R}$, we describe this space explicitly and relate it to real Bergman fans.</description>

      <title>A new heuristic approach for contextuality degree estimates and its four- to six-qubit portrayals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and describe a new heuristic method for finding an upper bound on the degree of contextuality and the corresponding unsatisfied part of a quantum contextual configuration with three-element contexts (i.e., lines) located in a multi-qubit symplectic polar space of order two. While the previously used method based on a SAT solver was limited to three qubits, this new method is much faster and more versatile, enabling us to also handle four- to six-qubit cases. The four-qubit unsatisfied configurations we found are quite remarkable. That of an elliptic quadric features 315 lines and has in its core three copies of the split Cayley hexagon of order two having a Heawood-graph-underpinned geometry in common. That of a hyperbolic quadric also has 315 lines but, as a point-line incidence structure, is isomorphic to the dual $\mathcal{DW}(5,2)$ of $\mathcal{W}(5,2)$. Finally, an unsatisfied configuration with 1575 lines associated with all the lines/contexts of the four-qubit space contains a distinguished $\mathcal{DW}(5,2)$ centered on a point-plane incidence graph of PG$(3,2)$. The corresponding configurations found in the five-qubit space exhibit a considerably higher degree of complexity, except for a hyperbolic quadric, whose 6975 unsatisfied contexts are compactified around the point-hyperplane incidence graph of PG$(4,2)$. The most remarkable unsatisfied patterns discovered in the six-qubit space are a couple of disjoint split Cayley hexagons (for the full space) and a subgeometry underpinned by the complete bipartite graph $K_{7,7}$ (for a hyperbolic quadric).</description>

      <title>Finding Spanning Trees with Perfect Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the tractability of a simple fusion of two fundamental structures on graphs, a spanning tree and a perfect matching. Specifically, we consider the following problem: given an edge-weighted graph, find a minimum-weight spanning tree among those containing a perfect matching. On the positive side, we design a simple greedy algorithm for the case when the graph is complete (or complete bipartite) and the edge weights take at most two values. On the negative side, the problem is NP-hard even when the graph is complete (or complete bipartite) and the edge weights take at most three values, or when the graph is cubic, planar, and bipartite and the edge weights take at most two values.
  We also consider an interesting variant. We call a tree strongly balanced if on one side of the bipartition of the vertex set with respect to the tree, all but one of the vertices have degree $2$ and the remaining one is a leaf. This property is a sufficient condition for a tree to have a perfect matching, which enjoys an additional property. When the underlying graph is bipartite, strongly balanced spanning trees can be written as matroid intersection, and this fact was recently utilized to design an approximation algorithm for some kind of connectivity augmentation problem. The natural question is its tractability in nonbipartite graphs. As a negative answer, it turns out NP-hard to test whether a given graph has a strongly balanced spanning tree or not even when the graph is subcubic and planar.</description>

      <title>The extended zero-divisor graph of the amalgamated duplication of a ring along an ideal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative ring and $I$ be an ideal of $R$. The amalgamated duplication of $R$ along $I$ is the subring $R\Join I:=\{(r,r+i)| r\in R, i\in I\}$ of $R\times R$. This paper investigates the extended zero-divisor graph of the amalgamated duplication of $R$ along $I$. The purpose of this work is to study when $\overline{\Gamma}(R\Join I)$ and $\Gamma(R\Join I)$ coincide, to characterize when $\overline{\Gamma}(R\Join I)$ is complete, and to compute the diameter and the girth of $\overline{\Gamma}(R\Join I)$.</description>

Abstract: We consider sequences of finite weighted random graphs that converge locally to unimodular i.i.d. weighted random trees. When the weights are atomless, we prove that the matchings of maximal weight converge locally to a matching on the limiting tree. For this purpose, we introduce and study unimodular matchings on weighted unimodular random trees as well as a notion of optimality for these objects. In this context, we prove that, in law, there is a unique optimal unimodular matching for a given unimodular tree. We then prove that this law is the local limit of the sequence of matchings of maximal weight. Along the way, we also show that this law is characterised by an equation derived from a message passing algorithm.</description>

      <title>Matroid Intersection under Minimum Rank Oracle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the tractability of the matroid intersection problem under the minimum rank oracle. In this model, we are given an oracle that takes as its input a set of elements, and returns as its output the minimum of the ranks of the given set in the two matroids. For the unweighted matroid intersection problem, we show how to construct a necessary part of the exchangeability graph, which enables us to emulate the standard augmenting path algorithm. Furthermore, we reformulate Edmonds' min-max theorem only using the minimum rank function, providing a new perspective on this result. For the weighted problem, the tractability is open in general. Nevertheless, we describe several special cases where tractability can be achieved, and we discuss potential approaches and the challenges encountered. In particular, we present a solution for the case where no circuit of one matroid is contained within a circuit of the other. Additionally, we propose a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm, parameterized by the maximum circuit size. We also show that a lexicographically maximal common independent set can be found by the same approach, which leads to at least $1/2$-approximation for finding a maximum-weight common independent set.</description>

Abstract: Feynman gave a famous elementary introduction to quantum theory by discussing the thin-film reflection of light. We make his discussion mathematically rigorous, keeping it elementary, using his other idea. The resulting model leads to accurate quantitative results and allows us to derive a well-known formula from optics. In the process, we get acquainted with mathematical tools such as Smirnov's fermionic observables, transfer matrices, and spectral radii. Quantum walks and the six-vertex model arise as the next step in this direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1607.04144v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exposition on the Fuss--Catalan numbers, which are a generalization of the well known Catalan numbers. The literature on the subject is scattered (especially for the case of multiple independent parameters, as will be explained in the text), with overlapping definitions by different authors and duplication of proofs. This paper collects the main theorems and identities, with a consistent notation. Contact is made with the works of numerous authors, including the early works of Lambert and Euler. We demonstrate the application of the formalism to solve algebraic equations by infinite series. Our main result in this context is a new necessary and sufficient formula for the domain of absolute convergence of the series solutions of algebraic equations, which corrects and extends previous work in the field. Some historical material is placed in an Appendix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.03033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the maximum multiplicity $\mathcal{M}(k,n)$ of a simple transposition $s_k=(k \: k+1)$ in a reduced word for the longest permutation $w_0=n \: n-1 \: \cdots \: 2 \: 1$, a problem closely related to much previous work on sorting networks and on the "$k$-set" problem. After reinterpreting the problem in terms of monotone weakly separated paths, we show that, for fixed $k$ and sufficiently large $n$, the optimal density is realized by paths which are periodic in a precise sense, so that \[ \mathcal{M}(k,n)=c_k n + p_k(n) \] for a periodic function $p_k$ and constant $c_k$. In fact we show that $c_k$ is always rational, and compute several bounds and exact values for this quantity with "repeatable patterns", which we introduce.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the "stratified Ehrhart ring theory" for periodic graphs, which gives an algorithm for determining the growth sequences of periodic graphs. The growth sequence $(s_{\Gamma, x_0, i})_{i \ge 0}$ is defined for a graph $\Gamma$ and its fixed vertex $x_0$, where $s_{\Gamma, x_0, i}$ is defined as the number of vertices of $\Gamma$ at distance $i$ from $x_0$. Although the sequences $(s_{\Gamma, x_0, i})_{i \ge 0}$ for periodic graphs are known to be of quasi-polynomial type, their determination had not been established, even in dimension two. Our theory and algorithm can be applied to arbitrary periodic graphs of any dimension. As an application of the algorithm, we determine the growth sequences in several new examples.</description>

Abstract: We introduce coloring groups, which are permutation groups obtained from a proper edge coloring of a graph. These groups generalize the generalized toggle groups of Striker (which themselves generalize the toggle groups introduced by Cameron and Fon-der-Flaass). We present some general results connecting the structure of a coloring group to the structure of its graph coloring, providing graph-theoretic characterizations of the centralizer and primitivity of a coloring group. We apply these results particularly to generalized toggle groups arising from trees as well as coloring groups arising from the independence posets introduced by Thomas and Williams.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a well-known bijection between finite binary sequences and integer partitions. Sequences of length r correspond to partitions of perimeter r+1. Motivated by work on rational numbers in the Calkin-Wilf tree, we classify partitions whose corresponding binary sequence is a palindrome. We give a generating function that counts these partitions, and describe how to efficiently generate all of them. Atypically for partitions generating functions, we find an unusual significance to prime degrees. Specifically, we prove there are nontrivial palindrome partitions of n except when n=3 or n+1 is prime. We find an interesting new "branching diagram" for partitions, similar to Young's lattice, with an action of the Klein four group corresponding to natural operations on the binary sequences.</description>

      <title>A unified approach to the spectral radius, connectivity and edge-connectivity of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For two integers $r\geq 2$ and $h\geq 0$, the \emph{$h$-extra $r$-component connectivity} $\kappa^h_r(G)$ of a graph $G$ is defined to be the minimum size of a subset of vertices whose removal disconnects $G$, and there are at least $r$ connected components in $G\!-\!S$ and each component has at least $h+1$ vertices. Denote by $\mathcal{G}_{n,\delta}^{\kappa_r^h}$ the set of graphs with $h$-extra $r$-component connectivity $\kappa^h_r(G)$ and minimum degree $\delta$. The following problem concerning spectral radius was proposed by Brualdi and Solheid [On the spectral radius of complementary acyclic matrices of zeros and one, SIAM J. Algebra Discrete Methods 7 (1986) 265-272]: Given a set of graphs $\mathscr{S}$, find an upper bound for the spectral radius of graphs in $\mathscr{S}$ and characterize the graphs in which the maximal spectral radius is attained. We study this question for $\mathscr{S}=\mathcal{G}_{n,\delta}^{\kappa_r^h}$ where $r\geq 2$ and $h\geq 0$. Fan, Gu and Lin [$l$-connectivity, $l$-edge-connectivity and spectral radius of graphs, \emph{arXiv}:2309.05247] give the answer to $r\geq 2$ and $h=0$. In this paper, we solve this problem completely for $r\geq 2$ and $h\geq1$. Moreover, we also investigate analogous problems for the edge version. Our results can break the restriction of the extremum structure of the conditional connectivity. This implies some previous results in connectivity and edge-connectivity.</description>

      <title>A note on the threshold numbers of cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G=(V,E)$ is said to be a \textit{$k$-threshold graph} with \textit{thresholds} $\theta_1&lt;\theta_2&lt;...&lt;\theta_k$ if there is a map $r: V \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}$ such that $uv\in E$ if and only if $\theta_i\le r(u)+r(v)$ holds for an odd number of $i\in [k]$. The \textit{threshold number} of $G$, denoted by $\Theta(G)$, is the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $G$ is a $k$-threshold graph. In this paper, we determine the exact threshold numbers of cycles by proving
  \[ \Theta(C_n)=\begin{cases}
  1 &amp; if\ n=3,
  2 &amp; if\ n=4,
  4 &amp; if\ n\ge 5,
  \end{cases}
  \]
  where $C_n$ is the cycle with $n$ vertices. In our proof, the edge coloring method plays a key role.</description>

      <title>Enumeration of minimal transversals of hypergraphs of bounded VC-dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of enumerating all minimal transversals (also called minimal hitting sets) of a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$. An equivalent formulation of this problem known as the \emph{transversal hypergraph} problem (or \emph{hypergraph dualization} problem) is to decide, given two hypergraphs, whether one corresponds to the set of minimal transversals of the other. The existence of a polynomial time algorithm to solve this problem is a long standing open question. In \cite{fredman_complexity_1996}, the authors present the first sub-exponential algorithm to solve the transversal hypergraph problem which runs in quasi-polynomial time, making it unlikely that the problem is (co)NP-complete.
  In this paper, we show that when one of the two hypergraphs is of bounded VC-dimension, the transversal hypergraph problem can be solved in polynomial time, or equivalently that if $\mathcal{H}$ is a hypergraph of bounded VC-dimension, then there exists an incremental polynomial time algorithm to enumerate its minimal transversals. This result generalizes most of the previously known polynomial cases in the literature since they almost all consider classes of hypergraphs of bounded VC-dimension. As a consequence, the hypergraph transversal problem is solvable in polynomial time for any class of hypergraphs closed under partial subhypergraphs. We also show that the proposed algorithm runs in quasi-polynomial time in general hypergraphs and runs in polynomial time if the conformality of the hypergraph is bounded, which is one of the few known polynomial cases where the VC-dimension is unbounded.</description>

      <title>Finding irrelevant vertices in linear time on bounded-genus graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:1907.05940v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The irrelevant vertex technique provides a powerful tool for the design of parameterized algorithms for a wide variety of problems on graphs. A common characteristic of these problems, permitting the application of this technique on surface-embedded graphs, is the fact that every graph of large enough treewidth contains a vertex that is irrelevant, in the sense that its removal yields an equivalent instance of the problem. The straightforward application of this technique yields algorithms with running time that is quadratic in the size of the input graph. This running time is due to the fact that it takes linear time to detect one irrelevant vertex and the total number of irrelevant vertices to be detected is linear as well. Using advanced techniques, sub-quadratic algorithms have been designed for particular problems, even in general graphs. However, designing a general framework for linear-time algorithms has been open, even for the bounded-genus case. In this paper we introduce a general framework that enables finding in linear time an entire set of irrelevant vertices whose removal yields a bounded-treewidth graph, provided that the input graph has bounded genus. Our technique consists in decomposing any surface-embeddable graph into a tree-structured collection of bounded-treewidth subgraphs where detecting globally irrelevant vertices can be done locally and independently. Our method is applicable to a wide variety of known graph containment or graph modification problems where the irrelevant vertex technique applies. Examples include the (Induced) Minor Folio problem, the (Induced) Disjoint Paths problem, and the $\mathcal{F}$-Minor-Deletion problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06056v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The left and right $q$-deformed rational numbers were introduced by Bapat, Becker and Licata via regular continued fractions, and they gave a homological interpretation for left and right $q$-deformed rational numbers. In the present paper, we focus on negative continued fractions and defined left $q$-deformed negative continued fractions. We give a formula for computing the $q$-deformed Farey sum of the left $q$-deformed rational numbers based on it. We use this formula to give a combinatorial proof of the relationship between the left $q$-deformed rational number and the Jones polynomial of the corresponding rational knot which was proved by Bapat, Becker and Licata using a homological technique. Finally, we combine their work and the $q$-deformed Farey sum, and give a homological interpretation of the $q$-deformed Farey sum. We also give an approach to finding a relationship between real quadratic irrational numbers and homological algebra.</description>

      <title>Explicit Directional Affine Extractors and Improved Hardness for Linear Branching Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.11495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent work, Gryaznov, Pudl\'{a}k, and Talebanfard (CCC' 22) introduced a stronger version of affine extractors known as directional affine extractors, together with a generalization of $\mathsf{ROBP}$s where each node can make linear queries, and showed that the former implies strong lower bound for a certain type of the latter known as strongly read-once linear branching programs ($\mathsf{SROLBP}$s). Their main result gives explicit constructions of directional affine extractors for entropy $k &gt; 2n/3$, which implies average-case complexity $2^{n/3-o(n)}$ against $\mathsf{SROLBP}$s with exponentially small correlation. A follow-up work by Chattopadhyay and Liao (ECCC' 22) improves the hardness to $2^{n-o(n)}$ at the price of increasing the correlation to polynomially large.
  In this paper we show:
  An explicit construction of directional affine extractors with $k=o(n)$ and exponentially small error, which gives average-case complexity $2^{n-o(n)}$ against $\mathsf{SROLBP}$s with exponentially small correlation, thus answering the two open questions raised in previous works.
  An explicit function in $\mathsf{AC}^0$ that gives average-case complexity $2^{(1-\delta)n}$ against $\mathsf{ROBP}$s with negligible correlation, for any constant $\delta&gt;0$. Previously, no such average-case hardness is known, and the best size lower bound for any function in $\mathsf{AC}^0$ against $\mathsf{ROBP}$s is $2^{\Omega(n)}$.
  One of the key ingredients in our constructions is a new linear somewhere condenser for affine sources, which is based on dimension expanders. The condenser also leads to an unconditional improvement of the entropy requirement of explicit affine extractors with negligible error. We further show that the condenser also works for general weak random sources, under the Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa Theorem in $\mathsf{F}_2^n$.</description>

      <title>A combinatorial $K$-theory perspective on the Edge Reconstruction Conjecture in graph theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a framework for abstract reconstruction problems using the $K$-theory of categories with covering families, which we then apply to reformulate the edge reconstruction conjecture in graph theory. Along the way, we state some fundamental theorems for the $K$-theory of categories with covering families.</description>

      <title>Permutation invariant matrix quantum thermodynamics and negative specific heat capacities in large N systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13150v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamic properties of the simplest gauged permutation invariant matrix quantum mechanical system of oscillators, for general matrix size $N$. In the canonical ensemble, the model has a transition at a temperature $T$ given by $x = e^{ -1/ T } \sim x_c=e^{-1/T_c}=\frac{\log N}{N}$, characterised by a sharp peak in the specific heat capacity (SHC), which separates a high temperature from a low temperature region. The peak grows and the low-temperature region shrinks to zero with increasing $N$. In the micro-canonical ensemble, for finite $N$, there is a low energy phase with negative SHC and a high energy phase with positive SHC. The low-energy phase is dominated by a super-exponential growth of degeneracies as a function of energy which is directly related to the rapid growth in the number of directed graphs, with any number of vertices, as a function of the number of edges. The two ensembles have matching behaviour above the transition temperature. We further provide evidence that these thermodynamic properties hold in systems with $U(N)$ symmetry such as the zero charge sector of the 2-matrix model and in certain tensor models. We discuss the implications of these observations for the negative specific heat capacities in gravity using the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>The Lamplighter groups and Thompson's group $F$ have infinite weak-cop number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The weak-cop number of a graph, introduced by Lee et al (2023), is a quasi-isometric invariant of graphs and hence of finitely generated groups via their Cayley graphs. While for any $m\in\mathbb{Z}_+\cup\{\infty\}$ there exist graphs with weak-cop number $m$, it is an open question whether there exists finitely generated groups whose weak-cop number is different than $1$ and $\infty$. We prove that wreath products of nontrivial groups by infinite groups have infinite weak-cop number. We also prove that Thompson's group $F$ has infinite weak-cop number. The results are proved by defining two new pursuit and evasion games and proving the existence of strategies for the evader. In the case of Thompson's group $F$, we also present an alternative and more algebraic argument proving that it has infinite weak-cop number.</description>
