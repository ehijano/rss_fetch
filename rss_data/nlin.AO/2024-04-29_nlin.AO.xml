      <title>Fractional damping enhances chaos in the nonlinear Helmholtz oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of this paper is to study both the underdamped and the overdamped dynamics of the nonlinear Helmholtz oscillator with a fractional order damping. For that purpose, we use the Grunwald-Letnikov fractional derivative algorithm in order to get the numerical simulations. Here, we investigate the effect of taking the fractional derivative in the dissipative term in function of the parameter a. Our main findings show that the trajectories can remain inside the well or can escape from it depending on a which plays the role of a control parameter. Besides, the parameter a is also relevant for the creation or destruction of chaotic motions. On the other hand, the study of the escape times of the particles from the well, as a result of variations of the initial conditions and the undergoing force F, is reported by the use of visualization techniques such as basins of attraction and bifurcation diagrams, showing a good agreement with previous results. Finally, the study of the escape times versus the fractional parameter a shows an exponential decay which goes to zero when a is larger than one. All the results have been carried out for weak damping where chaotic motions can take place in the non-fractional case and also for a stronger damping (overdamped case), where the influence of the fractional term plays a crucial role to enhance chaotic motions. We expect that these results can be of interest in the field of fractional calculus and its applications.</description>

      <title>Non-Spatial Hash Chemistry as a Minimalistic Open-Ended Evolutionary System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is an increasing level of interest in open-endedness in the recent literature of Artificial Life and Artificial Intelligence. We previously proposed the cardinality leap of possibility spaces as a promising mechanism to facilitate open-endedness in artificial evolutionary systems, and demonstrated its effectiveness using Hash Chemistry, an artificial chemistry model that used a hash function as a universal fitness evaluator. However, the spatial nature of Hash Chemistry came with extensive computational costs involved in its simulation, and the particle density limit imposed to prevent explosion of computational costs prevented unbounded growth in complexity of higher-order entities. To address these limitations, here we propose a simpler non-spatial variant of Hash Chemistry in which spatial proximity of particles are represented explicitly in the form of multisets. This model modification achieved a significant reduction of computational costs in simulating the model. Results of numerical simulations showed much more significant unbounded growth in both maximal and average sizes of replicating higher-order entities than the original model, demonstrating the effectiveness of this non-spatial model as a minimalistic example of open-ended evolutionary systems.</description>

      <title>Penrose method for Kuramoto model with inertia and noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the Penrose method of instability analysis, we consider the synchronization transition in the Kuramoto model with inertia and noise with all-to-all couplings. Analyzing the Penrose curves, we identify the appearance of cluster and chimera states in the presence of noise. We observe that noise can destroy chimera and biclusters states. The critical coupling describing bifurcation from incoherent to coherent state is found analytically. To confirm our propositions based on the Penrose method, we perform numerical simulations.</description>
