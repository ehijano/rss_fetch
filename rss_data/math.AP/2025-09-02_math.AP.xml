      <title>Boundary Value Problems for the Magnetic Laplacian in Semiclassical Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the magnetic Laplacian $P^h (\A)=(h D+\A)^2$ in semiclassical analysis, where $h$ is a semiclassical parameter. We study the $L^2$ Neumann and Dirichlet problems for the equation $P^h(\A)u=0$ in a bounded Lipschitz domain $\Omega$. Under the assumption that the magnetic field $\nabla \times \A$ is of finite type on $\overline{\Omega}$, we establish the nontangential maximal function estimates for $(h D+\A)u$, which are uniform for $0&lt; h&lt; h_0$. This extends a well-known result due to D. Jerison and C. Kenig for the Laplacian in Lipschitz domains to the magnetic Laplacian in the semiclassical setting. Our results are new even for smooth domains.</description>

      <title>Non-symmetric solutions to an overdetermined problem for the Helmholtz equation in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we construct smooth bounded domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb R^2$, other than disks, for which the overdetermined problem $$
  \left\{
  \begin{alignedat}{2}
  \Delta u + \lambda u &amp;= 0 &amp;\qquad&amp; \text{ in } \Omega, \newline
  u &amp;= b &amp;\qquad&amp; \text{ on } \partial \Omega, \newline
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial n} &amp;= c &amp;\qquad&amp; \text{ on } \partial \Omega
  \end{alignedat}
  \right. $$ has a solution for some constants $\lambda,b,c \ne 0$. These appear to be the first counterexamples to a conjecture of Willms and Gladwell [WG94].</description>

      <title>$p$-biharmonic Kirchhoff equations with critical Choquard nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we deal with the following involving $p$-biharmonic critical Choquard-Kirchhoff equation
  $$
  \left(a+b\left(\int_{\mathbb R^N}|\Delta u|^p dx\right)^{\theta-1}\right) \Delta_{p}^{2}u = \alpha \left(|x|^{-\mu}*u^{p^*_\mu}\right)|u|^{p^*_\mu-2}u+ \lambda f(x) |u|^{r-2} u \; \text{in}\; \mathbb R^N,
  $$
  where $a\geq 0$, $b&gt; 0$, $0&lt;\mu&lt;N$, $N&gt;2p$, $p\geq 2$, $\theta\geq1$, $\alpha$ and $\lambda$ are positive real parameters, $p_{\mu}^{*}= \frac{p(2N-\mu)}{2(N-2p)}$ is the upper critical exponent in the sense of Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality. The function $f \in L^{t}(\mathbb R^N)$ with $t= \frac{p^{*}}{(p^* -r)}$ if $p&lt;r&lt;p^*:=\frac{Np}{N-2p}$ and $t=\infty$ if $r\geq p^{*}$. We first prove the concentration compactness principle for the $p$-biharmonic Choquard-type equation. Then using the variational method together with the concentration-compactness, we established the existence and multiplicity of solutions to the above problem with respect to parameters $\lambda$ and \(\alpha\) for different values of $r$. The results obtained here are new even for $p-$Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Caccioppoli-type inequalities for the Dunkl-$A$-Laplacian and their application to nonexistence result</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a suitable function $A:\mathbb{R}^n\to \mathbb{R}^n$, we introduce the $A$-Laplacian in the Dunkl framework as $\Delta_{k,A}(u) =\text{div}_k(A(\nabla_ku))$, where $\nabla_k$ is the Dunkl-gradient operator associated with the multiplicity function $k$ and the root system $\mathcal{R}$. We derive the local and global Caccioppoli-type inequality for an element $u$ in the Dunkl-Orlicz-Sobolev space, satisfying the Dunkl-differential inequality $$ -\Delta_{k, A}(u) \geq b\Phi(u)\chi_{\{u&gt;0\}}. $$ Using the Caccioppoli inequality, we establish a sufficient condition for the nonexistence of a nonzero solution $u$ to the Dunkl-differential inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-phase free boundary problem involving fractional Laplacian $(-\Delta)^s$, $0&lt;s&lt;1$. D. De Silva, O. Savin, and Y.

      <title>Improved stability threshold for 2D Navier-Stokes Couette flow in a infinite channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonlinear stability of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations around the Couette shear flow in the channel domain $\mathbb{R}\times[-1,1]$ subject to Navier slip boundary conditions. We establish a quantitative stability threshold for perturbations of the initial vorticity $\omega_{in}$, showing that stability holds for perturbations of order $\nu^{1/2}$ measured in an anisotropic Sobolev space. This sharpens the recent work of Arbon and Bedrossian [Comm. Math. Phys., 406 (2025), Paper No. 129] who proved stability under the threshold $\nu^{1/2}(1+\ln(1/\nu))^{-1/2}$. Our result removes the logarithmic loss and identifies the natural scaling $\nu^{1/2}$ as the critical size of perturbations for nonlinear stability in this setting.</description>

      <title>$\Gamma$-convergence and stochastic homogenization for functionals in the $\mathcal{A}$-free setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a compactness result for $\Gamma$-convergence of integral functionals defined on $\mathcal{A}$-free vector fields. This is used to study homogenization problems for these functionals without periodicity assumptions. More precisely, we prove that the homogenized integrand can be obtained by taking limits of minimum values of suitable minimization problems on large cubes, when the side length of these cubes tends to $+\infty$, assuming that these limit values do not depend on the center of the cube. Under the usual stochastic periodicity assumptions, this result is then used to solve the stochastic homogenization problem by means of the subadditive ergodic theorem.</description>

      <title>Orbital Stability of First Laplacian Eigenstates for the Euler Equation on Flat 2-Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a two-dimensional flat torus, the Laplacian eigenfunctions can be expressed explicitly in terms of sinusoidal functions. For a rectangular or square torus, it is known that every first eigenstate is orbitally stable up to translation under the Euler dynamics. In this paper, we extend this result to flat tori of arbitrary shape. As a consequence, we obtain for the first time a family of orbitally stable sinusoidal Euler flows on a hexagonal torus. The proof is carried out within the framework of Burton's stability criterion and consists of two key ingredients: (i) establishing a suitable variational characterization for each equimeasurable class in the first eigenspace, and (ii) analyzing the number of translational orbits within each equimeasurable class. The second ingredient, particularly for the case of a hexagonal torus, is very challenging, as it requires analyzing a sophisticated system of polynomial equations related to the symmetry of the torus and the structure of the first eigenspace.</description>

      <title>Sharp gradient stability for a class of Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stability problem for a class of Hardy-Sobolev-Maz'ya inequalities with non-radial extremal functions. We prove that the Euler-Lagrange equations are non-degenerate and obtain a sharp global quantitative stability. The presence of partial (stronger) singular weight brings substantial new challenges, requiring us to significantly refine the techniques from \cite{DT1,FN,FZ} and introduce some new ideas to handle both the cylindrical symmetry of non-radial extremal functions and the partial (stronger) singular weight structure. Key technical innovations include new compact embedding with strong singularity and new refined spectral inequalities that are crucial for our analysis.</description>

      <title>Superlinear problems involving nonlinear superposition operators of mixed fractional order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study a class of elliptic problems involving nonlinear superpositions of fractional operators of the form \[ A_{\mu,p}u := \int_{[0,1]} (-\Delta)_{p}^{s} u \, d\mu(s), \] where $\mu$ is a signed measure on $[0,1]$, coupled with nonlinearities of superlinear type. Our analysis covers a variety of superlinear growth assumptions, beginning with the classical Ambrosetti--Rabinowitz condition. Within this framework, we construct a suitable variational setting and apply the Fountain Theorem to establish the existence of infinitely many weak solutions. The results obtained are novel even in the special cases of superpositions of fractional $p$-Laplacians, or combinations of the fractional $p$-Laplacian with the $p$-Laplacian. More generally, our approach applies to finite sums of fractional $p$-Laplacians with different orders, as well as to operators in which fractional Laplacians appear with ``wrong'' signs. A distinctive contribution of the paper lies in providing a unified variational framework that systematically accommodates this broad class of operators.</description>

      <title>Non-minimizing Axially Symmetric Cavity Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity flow problems in two dimensions, as well as in the axially symmetric three-dimensional case, have been extensively studied in the literature from a qualitative perspective. While numerous results exist concerning minimizers or stable solutions-particularly regarding the regularity of the free boundary and the analysis of singularities-much less is known about the critical points of the corresponding energy functional. In this paper, we focus on investigating the properties of such critical points in the axially symmetric cavity flow problem with a free boundary, in relation to the known variational solutions. Moreover, our approach extends naturally to the case of jet flow problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate finite-energy solutions to Kazdan-Warner type equations in 2-dimensional integer lattice graph $$ - \Delta u= \varepsilon e^{\kappa u} +\beta\delta_0\quad {\rm in}\ \mathbb{Z}^2,$$ where $\varepsilon=\pm1$, $\kappa&gt;0$ and $\beta\in\mathbb{R}$.
  When $\varepsilon=1$, we prove the existence of a continuous family of finite-energy solutions for some parameter $\kappa$. This provides a partial resolution of the open problem on the existence of finite-energy solutions to the Liouville equation.
  When $\varepsilon=-1$ and $\beta&gt;\frac{4\pi}{\kappa}$, we prove that the set of finite-energy solutions exhibits a layer structure. Moreover, we derive the extremal solution in this case.</description>

      <title>Regularity and dynamics of weak solutions for one-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes equations with vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the spirit of D. Hoff's weak solution theory for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations (CNS) with bounded density, in this paper we establish the global existence and regularity properties of finite-energy weak solutions to an initial boundary value problem of one-dimensional CNS with general initial data and vacuum. The core of our proof is a global in time a priori estimate for one-dimensional CNS that holds for any $H^1$ initial velocity and bounded initial density not necessarily strictly positive: it could be a density patch or a vacuum bubble. We also establish that the velocity and density decay exponentially to equilibrium. As a by-product, we obtain the quantitative dynamics of aforementioned two vacuum states.</description>

      <title>Global Existence, Hamiltonian Conservation and Vanishing Viscosity for the Surface Quasi-Geostrophic Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any initial datum $\theta_0\in L^{\frac{4}{3}}_x$ it is proved the existence of a global-in-time weak solution $\theta \in L^\infty_t L^{\frac43}_x$ to the surface quasi-geostrophic equation whose Hamiltonian, i.e. the $\dot{H}^{-\frac{1}{2}}_x$ norm, is constant in time. The solution is obtained as a vanishing viscosity limit. Outside the classical strong compactness setting, the main idea is to propagate in time the non-concentration of the $L^{\frac{4}{3}}_x$ norm of the initial data, from which strong compactness in the Hamiltonian norm is deduced. General no anomalous dissipation results under minimal Onsager supercritical assumptions are also obtained.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we discuss the continuous version of the generalized exchange-driven growth model which is a variant of the coagulation model in which a smaller size particle is detached from a bigger one and merges with another particle. This new model is a continuous extension of the generalized exchange-driven growth model originally formulated in a discrete context [4]. In this work, we examine the existence of weak solutions to the continuous version of the generalized exchange-driven growth model under a suitable reaction rate. Under an additional condition on the reaction rates, a uniqueness result is established. Finally, we prove that solutions satisfy the mass-conserving property and the conservation of the total number of particles for coagulation rates with linear bounds.</description>

      <title>Regularizing effect of the natural growth term in quasilinear problems with sign-changing nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the existence and nonexistence of solutions to the Dirichlet problem \begin{equation*} \tag{$P$} \label{pba} \left\{ \begin{alignedat}{2} -\Delta_p u + g(u) |\nabla u|^p &amp;= \lambda f(u) \quad &amp;&amp;\mbox{in} \;\; \Omega, \\ u &amp;= 0 \quad &amp;&amp;\mbox{on} \;\; \partial\Omega, \end{alignedat} \right. \end{equation*} where $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is a smooth bounded domain, $p\in (1,\infty)$, $\lambda&gt;0$ and $g\in C(\mathbb{R})$. Our main assumption is that $:f \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function such that $f(s)&gt;0$ for all $s\in (\alpha,\beta)$, where $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\beta$ are two zeros of $f$.
  If $f(0)\geq 0$, we show that an area condition involving $f$ and $g$ is both sufficient and necessary in order to have a pair $(\lambda,u)\in \mathbb{R}^+\times C_0^1(\overline{\Omega})$, with $u\geq 0$ and $\|u\|_{C(\overline{\Omega})}\in (\alpha,\beta]$, solving~\eqref{pba}.
  We also study how the presence of the gradient term affects the existence of solution. Roughly speaking, the more negative $g$ is, the stronger its regularizing effect on~\eqref{pba}. We prove that, regardless of the shape of $f$, for any fixed $\lambda$, there always exists a function $g$ such that~\eqref{pba} admits a nonnegative solution with maximum in $(\alpha,\beta]$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the nonlinear version of the Fisher information along the quasilinear heat equation. We also provide a nonlinear version of a recent functional inequality (Cie\'slak--Fuest--Hajduk--Sier\.z\k{e}ga, 2024), corresponding to the nonlinear heat equation. Next, applications of our version of nonlinear Fisher information to the 1D critical quasilinear fully parabolic Keller--Segel system are given. In particular, the global existence of solutions to the critical nonlinear diffusion/nonlinear sensitivity 1D fully parabolic Keller--Segel system is obtained for certain type of diffusion. Last, but not least, we also study the version of the Fisher information along the $p$-Laplace equation.</description>

      <title>Scattering norm estimate near the threshold for the energy-subcrtical NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the focusing energy-subcritical Schr\"odinger equations. In earlier works by Holmer-Roudenko \cite{holmer}, Duyckaerts-Holmer-Roudenko \cite{duyckaerts2}, Fang-Xie-Cazenave \cite{fang}, Guevara \cite{guevara} and later by Dodson-Murphy \cite{dodson1,dodson2} and Arora-Dodson-Murphy \cite{arora}, they proved that scattering is the only dynamical behavior if the $H^1$ initial data satisfies $M(u_0)^{1-s_c}E(u_0)^{s_c}&lt;M(Q)^{1-s_c}E(Q)^{s_c}$ and $\| u\|^{1-s_c}_{L^2}\| u\|^{s_c}_{\dot{H}^1}&lt;\| Q\|^{1-s_c}_{L^2}\|Q\|^{s_c}_{\dot{H}^1}$, where $Q$ is the ground state. In this paper, we establish asymptotic estimates for the upper bound of the scattering norms as $M(u_0)^{1-s_c}E(u_0)^{s_c}$ approaches the threshold mass-energy threshold $M(Q)^{1-s_c}E(Q)^{s_c}$, which generalizes the work of Duyckaerts-Merle \cite{duyckaerts} on the energy-critical Schr\"odinger equation($s_c=1$).</description>

      <title>Sharp unconditional well-posedness of the 2-$d$ periodic cubic hyperbolic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study semilinear local well-posedness of the two-dimensional periodic cubic hyperbolic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (HNLS) in Fourier-Lebesgue spaces. By employing the Fourier restriction norm method, we first establish sharp semilinear local well-posedness of HNLS in Fourier-Lebesgue spaces (modulo the endpoint case), including almost scaling-critical Fourier-Lebesgue spaces. Then, by adapting the normal form approach, developed by the second author with Guo and Kwon (2013) and by the second and third authors (2021), to the current hyperbolic setting, we establish sharp unconditional uniqueness of HNLS within the semilinear local well-posedness regime. As a key ingredient to both results, we establish sharp counting estimates for the hyperbolic Schr\"odinger equation. As a byproduct of our analysis, we also obtain sharp unconditional uniqueness of the (usual) two-dimensional periodic cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in Fourier--Lebesgue spaces for $p \ge 3$.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness and Finite Time Singularity for Touching g-SQG Patches on the Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove local well-posedness as well as singularity formation for the g-SQG patch model on the plane (so on a domain without a boundary), with $\alpha\in(0,\frac 16]$ and patches being allowed to touch each other. We do this by bypassing any auxiliary contour equations and tracking patch boundary curves directly instead of their parametrizations. In our results, which are sharp in terms of $\alpha$, the patch boundaries have $L^2$ curvatures and a singularity occurs when at least one of these $L^2$-norms blows up in finite time.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Growth Model with Discontinuity: A Link between Monostable and Bistable Traveling Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify traveling waves and stationary solutions of a reaction-diffusion equation arising in population dynamics with Allee-type effects. The reaction term is given by a quadratic polynomial with a discontinuity at zero, which captures finite-time extinction for sub-threshold populations. This discontinuity induces a free boundary in the wave profile, a phenomenon that distinguishes the model from the classical logistic or Allen-Cahn equations. A complete scenario is presented that connects monostable and bistable traveling waves through the wave speed parameter, thereby providing a unified framework for their dynamics.</description>

      <title>Embedding Results and Fractional $p(x,.)$-Laplacian Problem in Unbounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a new continuous embedding theorem for fractional Sobolev spaces with variable exponents into variable exponent Lebesgue spaces on unbounded domains. As an application, we study a class of nonlocal elliptic problems driven by the fractional $p(x, \cdot)$-Laplacian operator. Using variational methods combined with the established embedding result, we prove the existence of nontrivial weak solutions under suitable growth and regularity conditions on the nonlinearity.\\ A significant analytical challenge addressed in this work arises from both the nonlocal behavior of the fractional $p(x, \cdot)$-Laplacian and the lack of compactness induced by the unboundedness of the domain.</description>

      <title>Rate of convergence of the vanishing viscosity method for Hamilton-Jacobi equations with Neumann boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantitative small noise limit in the $L^\infty$ norm of certain time-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi equations equipped with Neumann boundary conditions, depending on the regularity of the data and the geometric properties of the domain. We first provide a $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\eps})$ rate of convergence for Hamilton-Jacobi equations with locally Lipschitz Hamiltonians posed on convex domains of the Euclidean space. We then enhance this speed of convergence in the case of quadratic Hamiltonians proving one-side rates of order $\mathcal{O}(\eps)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\eps^\beta)$, $\beta\in(1/2,1)$. The results exploit recent $L^1$ contraction estimates for Fokker-Planck equations with bounded velocity fields on unbounded domains used to derive differential Harnack estimates for the corresponding Neumann heat flow.</description>

      <title>Global existence of the irrotational Euler-Norstrom equations with a positive cosmological constant: The gravitational field equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our objective is to demonstrate the global existence of classical solutions for the nonlinear irrotational Euler-Nordstroem system, which includes a linear equation of state and a cosmological constant. In this framework, the gravitational field is represented by a single scalar function that satisfies a specific semi-linear wave equation. We focus on spatially periodic deviations from the background metric, which is why we study the semi-linear wave equation on the three-dimensional torus $\mathbb{T}^3$ within the Sobolev spaces $H^m(\mathbb{T}^3)$. This work is divided into two parts. First, we examine the Nordstroem equation with a source term generated by an irrotational fluid governed by a linear equation of state. In the second part, we analyze the full coupled system. One reason for this separation is that an irrotational fluid with a linear equation of state introduces a source term for the Nordstroem equation containing a nonlinear term of fractional order. This nonlinearity precludes the direct application of the techniques used in our earlier work \cite{Brauer_Karp_23}, where we relied on symmetric hyperbolic systems, energy estimates, and homogeneous Sobolev spaces. Instead, we develop an appropriate energy functional and establish the corresponding energy estimates tailored to the wave equation under consideration.</description>

      <title>Relativistic BGK model for reactive gas mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a BGK-type kinetic model for relativistic reactive gas mixtures. This model serves as a computationally tractable yet physically consistent alternative to the corresponding Boltzmann equation. The relaxation operator is constructed to ensure that the model correctly satisfies the conservation laws and relaxes to the proper equilibrium: a J\"{u}ttner distribution characterized by a common temperature, velocity, and chemical potentials that obey the law of mass action. Furthermore, we prove that the model satisfies an H-theorem with the same entropy functional as the original Boltzmann equation. Finally, numerical simulations are presented, which confirm that the model preserves the conserved quantities and exhibits entropy decay towards the proper J\"{u}ttner equilibrium.</description>

In 2D, we construct a velocity field in $L^\infty_{t,x}$ and exhibit a solution that decays with double exponential rate $e^{-C^{-1} e^{C^{-1}t}}$. In 3D, we construct a velocity field in $L^\infty_t W^{1,\infty}_x$ and exhibit a solution that decays with rate $e^{-C^{-1} t^2}$. In 4D, we construct a velocity field in $L^\infty_t C^\infty_x$ and exhibit a solution that decays with *some* superexponential rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with the following elliptic equation $$ ( SC_\varepsilon ) \qquad
  \begin{cases} -\Delta u = |u|^{4/(n-2)}u [\ln (e+|u|)]^\varepsilon &amp; \hbox{ in } \Omega,\\ u = 0 &amp; \hbox{ on }\partial \Omega, \end{cases} $$ where $\Omega $ is a smooth bounded open domain in $\mathbb{R}^n, \ n\geq 3$ and $\varepsilon &gt;0$. In Comm. Contemp. Math. (2003), Ben Ayed et al. showed that the slightly supercritical usual elliptic problem has no single peaked solution. Here we extend their result for problem $( SC_\varepsilon )$ when $\varepsilon$ is small enough, and that by assuming a new assumption.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness and scattering of odd solutions for the defocusing INLS in one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the defocusing inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation
  $i\partial_tu+\Delta u= |x|^{-b}|u|^{\alpha}u,$
  where $0&lt;b&lt;1$ and $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\infty$. This problem has been extensively studied for initial data in $H^1(\R^N)$ with $N\geq 2$. However, in the one-dimensional setting, due to the difficulty in dealing with the singularity factor $|x|^{-b}$, the well-posedness and scattering in $H^1(\R)$ are scarce, and almost known results have been established in $H^s(\R)$ with $s&lt;1$. In this paper, we focus on the odd initial data in $H^1(\R)$. For this case, we establish local well-posedness for $0&lt;\alpha&lt;\infty$, as well as global well-posedness and scattering for $4-2b&lt;\alpha&lt;\infty$, which corresponds to the mass-supercritical case. The key ingredient is the application of the one-dimensional Hardy inequality for odd functions to overcome the singularity induced by $|x|^{-b}$. Our proof is based on the Strichartz estimates and employs the concentration-compactness/rigidity method developed by Kenig-Merle as well as the technique for handling initial data living far from the origin, as proposed by Miao-Murphy-Zheng. Our results fill a gap in the theory of well-posedness and energy scattering for the inhomogeneous nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation in one dimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review recent advances in solving problems of mathematical physics on domains with irregular boundaries in Rn. We distinguish two frameworks: a measure-free approach in the image of the trace operator spaces for extension domains and an L2-approach depending on a d-upper regular boundary measure. In both cases, the domains can have boundaries with different Hausdorff dimensions inside the interval (n -- 2, n). The generalization of the Poincar{\'e}-Steklov/Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator for these two contexts is given. To illustrate the established convergence of spectral problems for elliptic operators with Robin boundary conditions, we give a numerical example of the stability of localized eigenfunctions, using results of M. Graffin.</description>

      <title>From Nash to Cournot--Nash via $\Gamma$-convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the issue of the convergence of an $N$-player game towards a limit model involving a continuum of players, as the number of agents $N$ goes to infinity. More precisely, we investigate the convergence of Nash equilibria to a Cournot--Nash equilibrium of the limit model. When the cost function of the players is the first variation of some potential function, equilibria can be characterized by a stationarity condition, satisfied in particular by the minimizers of the potential. We demonstrate such a characterization under low regularity assumptions. Then we focus on the case where the players interact in a pairwise fashion; in this case we show that the original sequence of $N$-player games also admit a potential structure and prove that their corresponding potential functions converge in the sense of $\Gamma$-convergence to the potential function of the limit game.</description>

      <title>Stability of viscous shock for the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system: outflow and impermeable wall problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the time-asymptotic stability of solutions to the one-dimensional Navier-Stokes-Fourier system in the half space, focusing on the outflow and impermeable wall problems. When the asymptotic profile determined by the prescribed constant states at the boundary and at the far field is a viscous shock, we show that the solution converges asymptotically to the viscous shock profile, up to a dynamical shift, provided the initial perturbation and the shock amplitude are sufficiently small. In order to obtain our results, we employ the method of a-contraction with shifts. Although the impermeable wall problem is technically simpler to analyze in Lagrangian mass coordinates, the outflow problem leads to a free boundary in that framework. Therefore, we use Eulerian coordinates to provide a unified approach to both problems. This is the first result on the time-asymptotic stability of viscous shocks for initial-boundary value problems of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system for the outflow and impermeable wall cases.</description>

      <title>A numerical study of stability for solitary waves of a quasi-linear Schr{\"o}dinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the (in)stability of solitary waves for a quasi-linear Schr{\"o}dinger equation. The equation contains a quasi-linear term, responsible for a saturation effect, as well as a power nonlinearity. For different exponents of the nonlinearity, we determine analytically the asymptotic behavior of the $L^2$-mass of the solution as a function of the frequency close to the critical frequencies, which leads to natural conjectures concerning their stability. Depending on the exponent and the dimension, we expect all solitary waves to be stable, or the emergence of both a stable and an unstable branch of solutions. We investigate our conjectures numerically, and find compatible results both for the mass-energy relation and the dynamics. We observe that perturbations of solitary waves on the unstable branch may converge dynamically to the stable solution of a similar mass, or disperse. More general initial conditions show a similar behavior.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the unique solvability in weighted mixed-norm Sobolev spaces for a class of degenerate parabolic and elliptic equations in the upper half space. The operators are in nondivergence form, with the leading coefficients given by $x_d^2a_{ij}$, where $a_{ij}$ is bounded, uniformly nondegenerate, and measurable in $(t,x_d)$ except $a_{dd}$, which is measurable in $t$ or $x_d$. In the remaining spatial variables, they have weighted small mean oscillations. In addition, we investigate the optimality of the function spaces associated with our results.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic well-posedness of dispersive PDEs beyond variance blowup I: Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a possible extension of probabilistic well-posedness theory of nonlinear dispersive PDEs with random initial data beyond variance blowup. As a model equation, we study the Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation (BBM) with Gaussian random initial data. By introducing a suitable vanishing multiplicative renormalization constant on the initial data, we show that solutions to BBM with the renormalized Gaussian random initial data beyond variance blowup converge in law to a solution to the stochastic BBM forced by the derivative of a spatial white noise. By considering alternative renormalization, we show that solutions to the renormalized BBM with the frequency-truncated Gaussian initial data converges in law to a solution to the linear stochastic BBM with the full Gaussian initial data, forced by the derivative of a spatial white noise. This latter result holds for the Gaussian random initial data of arbitrarily low regularity. We also establish analogous results for the stochastic BBM forced by a fractional derivative of a space-time white noise.</description>

Abstract: We consider the complex moment problem, that is the problem of constructing a positive Borel measure on $\mathbb{C}$ from a given set of moments. We relate this problem to the dynamic inverse problem for the discrete system associated with the complex Jacobi matrix. We show how the characterization of dynamic inverse data in solving the inverse problem provides sufficient conditions for solving the complex moment problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sharp boundary regularity results for solutions to kinetic Fokker-Planck equations under prescribed inflow boundary conditions, providing precise quantification of the boundary hypoelliptic regularization effect. For equations with rough coefficients, we characterize the behaviours for solutions on grazing and incoming boundaries. In particular, in the absence of influxes and sources, an explicit exponential infinite-order vanishing estimate is derived near incoming boundaries. When the coefficients are regular, we obtained the optimal H\"older regularity on grazing boundaries and general Schauder-type estimates away from them.</description>

      <title>On the stability of Ricci flow on hyperbolic 3-manifolds of finite volume</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a hyperbolic 3-manifold of finite volume, we prove that if the initial metric is sufficiently close to the hyperbolic metric $h_0$, then the normalized Ricci-DeTurck flow exists for all time and converges exponentially fast to $h_0$ in a weighted H\"older norm. A key ingredient of our approach is the application of interpolation theory.
  Furthermore, this result is a valuable tool for investigating minimal surface entropy, which quantifies the growth rate of the number of closed minimal surfaces in terms of genus. We explore this in [17].</description>

      <title>On Hardy spaces associated with the twisted Laplacian and sharp estimates for the corresponding wave operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove various equivalent characterisations of the Hardy space $H^p_{\mathcal{L}}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ for $0&lt;p&lt;1$ associated with the twisted Laplacian $\mathcal{L}$ which generalises the result of [MPR81] for the case $p=1$. Using the atomic characterisation of $H^p_{\mathcal{L}}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ corresponding to the twisted convolution, we prove sharp boundedness result for the wave operator $\mathcal{L}^{-\delta/2}e^{\pm it\sqrt{\mathcal{L}}}$ for a fixed $t&gt;0$ on $H^p_{\mathcal{L}}(\mathbb{C}^n)$. More precisely we prove that it is a bounded operator from $H^p_{\mathcal{L}}(\mathbb{C}^n)$ to $L^p(\mathbb{C}^n)$ for $ 0&lt;p\leq 1$ and $\delta\geq (2n-1)\left(1/p-1/2\right)$.</description>

      <title>Robust and fast iterative method for the elliptic Monge-Amp\`ere equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a fast and robust iterative scheme for the elliptic Monge-Amp\`ere equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The Monge-Amp\`ere equation is a nonlinear and degenerate equation, with applications in optimal transport, geometric optics, and differential geometry. The proposed method linearises the equation and uses a fixed-point iteration (L-scheme), solving a Poisson problem in each step with a weighted residual as the right-hand side. This algorithm is robust against discretisation, nonlinearities, and degeneracies. For a weight greater than the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian, contraction in $H^2$ and $L^\infty$ is proven for both classical and generalised solutions, respectively. The method's performance can be enhanced by using preconditioners or Green's functions. Test cases demonstrate that the scheme outperforms Newton's method in speed and stability.</description>

      <title>Dynamic control of stochastic matching systems in heavy traffic: An effective computational method for high-dimensional problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipartite matching systems arise in many settings where agents or tasks from two distinct sets must be paired dynamically under compatibility constraints. We consider a high-dimensional bipartite matching system under uncertainty and seek an effective dynamic control policy that maximizes the expected discounted total value generated by the matches minus the congestion-related costs. To derive a tractable approximation, we focus attention on balanced, high-volume systems, i.e., the heavy-traffic regime, and derive an approximating Brownian control problem. We then develop a computational method that relies on deep neural network technology for solving this problem. To show the effectiveness of the policy derived from our computational method, we compare it to the benchmark policies available in the extant literature in the context of the original matching problem. In the test problems attempted thus far, our proposed policy outperforms the benchmarks, and its derivation is computationally feasible for dimensions up to 100 or more.</description>

Abstract: We use a Harnack-type inequality on exit times and spectral bounds to characterize upper bounds of the heat kernel associated with any regular Dirichlet form without killing part, where the scale function may vary with position. We further show that this Harnack-type inequality is preserved under quasi-symmetric changes of metric on uniformly perfect metric spaces. This generalised the work of Mariano and Wang [Stochastic Process. Appl. 189 (2025) 104707)].</description>

Abstract: We establish sharp microlocal Kakeya--Nikodym estimates for H\"ormander operators with positive-definite Carleson--Sj\"olin phases and for spectral projectors on smooth, compact Riemannian manifolds. As an application, we obtain sharp $L^q\to L^p$ estimates for the aforementioned H\"ormander operators in odd dimensions, thereby completing the analysis in the odd-dimensional case. Further applications include $L^q\to L^p$ estimates for the Fourier extension operator, $L^p$ estimates for the Bochner--Riesz operator, microlocal Kakeya--Nikodym estimates for Laplace eigenfunctions, and $L^p$ estimates for Hecke--Maass forms on compact $3$-dimensional arithmetic hyperbolic manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a new version of the well-known Birkhoff-Kellogg invariant-direction Theorem in product spaces. Our results concern operator systems and give the existence of component-wise eigenvalues, instead of scalar eigenvalues as in the classical case, that have corresponding eigenvectors with all components nontrivial and localized by their norm. We also show that, when applied to nonlinear eigenvalue problems for differential equations, this localization property of the eigenvectors provides, in turn, qualitative properties of the solutions. This is illustrated in two context of systems of PDEs and ODEs. We illustrate the applicability of our theoretical results with two explicit examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $k$-cylindrical singular set of mean curvature flow in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ for each $1\leq k\leq n-1$. We prove that they are locally contained in a $k$-dimensional $C^{2,\alpha}$-submanifold after removing some lower-dimensional parts. Moreover, if the $k$-cylindrical singular set is a $k$-submanifold, then its curvature is determined by the asymptotic profile of the flow at these singularities. As a byproduct, we provide a detailed asymptotic profile and graphical radius estimate at these singularities. The proof is based on a new $L^2$-distance non-concentration property that we introduced in [SWX25], modified into a relative version that allows us to modulo those low eigenmodes that are not decaying fast enough and do not contribute to the curvature of the singular set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We pursue a computational analysis of the biomedical problem on the identification of the cancerous tumor at an early stage of development based on the Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) and optimal control of elliptic partial differential equations. Relying on the fact that the electrical conductivity of the cancerous tumor is significantly higher than the conductivity of the healthy tissue, we consider an inverse EIT problem on the identification of the conductivity map in the complete electrode model based on the $m$ current-to-voltage measurements on the boundary electrodes. A variational formulation as a PDE-constrained optimal control problem is introduced based on the novel idea of increasing the size of the input data by adding "voltage-to-current" measurements through various permutations of the single "current-to-voltage" measurement. The idea of permutation preserves the size of the unknown parameters on the expense of increase of the number of PDE constraints. We apply a gradient projection (GPM) method based on the Fr\'echet differentiability in Besov-Hilbert spaces. Numerical simulations of 2D and 3D model examples demonstrate the sharp increase of the resolution of the cancerous tumor by increasing the number of measurements from $m$ to $m^2$</description>

      <title>Canonical Forms as Dual Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study dual volume representations of canonical forms for positive geometries in projective spaces, expressing their rational canonical functions as Laplace transforms of measures supported on the convex dual of the semialgebraic set. When the measure is non-negative, we term the geometry completely monotone, reflecting the property of its canonical function. We identify a class of positive geometries whose canonical functions admit such dual volume representations, characterized by the algebraic boundary cut out by a hyperbolic polynomial, for which the geometry is a hyperbolicity region. In particular, simplex-like minimal spectrahedra are completely monotone, with representing measures related to the Wishart distribution, capturing volumes of spectrahedra or their boundaries. We explicitly compute these measures for positive geometries in the projective plane bounded by lines and conics or by a nodal cubic, revealing periods evaluating to transcendental functions. This dual volume perspective reinterprets positive geometries by replacing logarithmic differential forms with probability measures on the dual, forging new connections to partial differential equations, hyperbolicity, convexity, positivity, algebraic statistics, and convex optimization.</description>

Abstract: We prove that not every harmonic map from $S^{2}$ to $S^{2}$ can arise as a limit of Ginzburg--Landau critical points. More precisely, we show that the only degree-one harmonic maps that can be approximated in this way are rotations.
  This conclusion follows from a rigidity theorem: we show that for every $\gamma&gt;0$ and $\varepsilon$ small enough, the only critical points $u_\varepsilon:S^{2}\to\mathbb R^{3}$ of the Ginzburg--Landau energy $E_\varepsilon$ with energy below $8\pi-\gamma$ are (up to conjugation) rotations, that is $u_\varepsilon(x)=\sqrt{1-2\varepsilon^{2}}\;R_\varepsilon\,x$.</description>

      <title>A Convolutional Hierarchical Deep-learning Neural Network (C-HiDeNN) Framework for Non-linear Finite Element/Meshfree Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for the Convolutional Hierarchical Deep Neural Network (C-HiDeNN) tailored for nonlinear finite element and meshfree analysis. Building upon the structured foundation of HiDeNN, which includes the evaluation of shape function derivatives, adaptivity, and material derivatives, C-HiDeNN introduces a convolution operator to enhance the HiDeNN approximation. A distinctive feature of C-HiDeNN is its expanded set of optimization parameters, such as the polynomial order 'p,' dilation parameter 'a,' patch size 's,' and nodal position 'X'. These parameters function as the weights and biases within the C-HiDeNN patch. In addition, C-HiDeNN can be prescribed in regions where high resolution is desired to adaptively improve prediction accuracy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, we provide numerical examples in the context of nonlinear finite element and meshfree analysis. The results show that our approach achieves significantly higher accuracy compared to the standard Finite Element Method (FEM) while substantially reducing computational costs.</description>

      <title>Quantitative positivity of transition densities for random perturbations of Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of diffusion processes arising from random perturbations of conservative Hamiltonian systems. Under a set of abstract hypotheses -- including basic structural assumptions on the Hamiltonian, a weak Lyapunov structure, and a quantitative notion of hypoellipticity -- we prove that transition densities satisfy a sharp, uniform pointwise lower bound over Hamiltonian sublevel sets in the small noise limit $\epsilon \to 0$. By applying our general theorem, we obtain quantitative minorization estimates for a variety of models including Langevin dynamics, chains of oscillators coupled to heat bathes at different temperatures, and finite-dimensional fluid models such as stochastically forced Galerkin truncations of the Navier-Stokes equations and the Lorenz '96 system. As a corollary, assuming a stronger Lyapunov structure, our main result yields a sharp exponential rate of convergence to equilibrium for $0 &lt; \epsilon \ll 1$ in a weighted total variation norm. A central feature of our approach is that it does not require knowledge of the explicit form of the invariant measure, nor even its existence, and hence is broadly applicable to deduce minorization for physically relevant systems where invariant measures are inaccessible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the trace-free Einstein tensor of a pseudo-Riemannian metric cannot arise by variation of a local diffeomorphism-invariant action functional with the (inverse) metric as field variable. We show that this statement remains true even for general local actions, without the assumption of diffeomorphism invariance.</description>

      <title>Strong existence for free discontinuity problems in linear elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09396v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we show Ahlfors-regularity for a large class of quasiminimizers of the Griffith functional. This allows us to prove that, for a range of free discontinuity problems in linear elasticity with anisotropic, cohesive, or heterogeneous behavior, minimizers have an essentially closed jump set and are thus strong minimizers. Our notion of quasiminimality is inspired by and generalizes previous notions in the literature for the Mumford-Shah functional, and comprises functions which locally close to the crack have at most a fixed percentage of excess crack relative to minimizers. As for the case of minimizers of the Griffith functional, our proof of Ahlfors-regularity relies on contradiction-compactness and an approximation result for GSBD functions, showing the robustness of this approach with respect to generalization of bulk and surface densities.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the defocusing, cubic nonlinear wave equation outside of the ball with radial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the defocusing, cubic nonlinear wave equation with zero Dirichlet boundary value in the exterior $\Omega = \mathbb{R}^3\backslash \bar{ B}(0,1)$. We make use of the distorted Fourier transform in \cite{LiSZ:NLS, Taylor:PDE:II} to establish the dispersive estimate and the global-in-time (endpoint) Strichartz estimate of the linear wave equation outside of the ball with radial data. As an application, we combine the Fourier truncation method as those in \cite{Bourgain98:FTM, GallPlan03:NLW, KenigPV00:NLW} with the energy method to show global well-posedness of radial solution to the defoucusing, cubic nonlinear wave equation outside of a ball in the Sobolev space $\left(\dot H^{s}_{D}(\Omega) \cap L^4(\Omega) \right)\times \dot H^{s-1}_{D}(\Omega)$ with $s&gt;3/4$. To the best of the author's knowledge, it is first result about low regularity of semilinear wave equation with zero Dirichlet boundary value on the exterior domain.</description>

      <title>SBV regularity of Entropy Solutions for Hyperbolic Systems of Balance Laws with General Flux function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06087v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that vanishing viscosity solutions to smooth non-degenerate systems of balance laws having small bounded variation, in one space dimension, must be functions of special bounded variation. For more than one equation, this is new also in the case of systems of conservation laws out of the context of genuine nonlinearity. For general smooth strictly hyperbolic systems of balance laws, this regularity fails, as known for systems of balance laws: we generalize the SBV-like regularity of the eigenvalue functions of the Jacobian matrix of flux from conservation to balance laws. Proofs are based on extending Oleinink-type balance estimates, with the introduction of new source measures, classical localization arguments, and observations in real analysis.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the logarithmically regularized $2$D Euler system \eqref{e1}, which is derived by regularizing the Euler equation for the vorticity. We establish local well-posedness of the logarithmically regularized $2$D Euler equations in the subcritical space $H^s(\mathbb{R}^2)$ with $s&gt;2$ for $\gamma \ge 0$. Furthermore, we show that for $\gamma$ close to $0$, the data-to-solution map is not uniformly continuous in the Sobolev $H^s(\mathbb{R}^2)$ topology for any $s&gt;2$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we prove the existence of an optimal domain $\Omega_{opt}$ for the shape optimization problem $$\max\Big\{\lambda_q(\Omega)\ :\ \Omega\subset D,\ \lambda_p(\Omega)=1\Big\},$$ where $q&lt;p$ and $D$ is a prescribed bounded subset of ${\bf R}^d$. Here $\lambda_p(\Omega)$ (respectively $\lambda_q(\Omega)$) is the first eigenvalue of the $p$-Laplacian $-\Delta_p$ (respectively $-\Delta_q$) with Dirichlet boundary condition on $\partial\Omega$. This is related to the existence of optimal sets that minimize the generalized Cheeger ratio $${\mathcal F}_{p,q}(\Omega)=\frac{\lambda_p^{1/p}(\Omega)}{\lambda_q^{1/q}(\Omega)}.$$</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the quantitative weak unique continuation property (QWUCP) for a class of high-dimensional elliptic equations with interior point degeneracy. First, we establish well-posedness results in weighted function spaces. Then, using an innovative approximation method, we derive the three-ball theorem at the degenerate point. Finally, we apply the three-ball theorem to prove QWUCP for two different cases.</description>

      <title>Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems on compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08504v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish new Strichartz estimates for orthonormal systems on compact Riemannian manifolds in the case of wave, Klein-Gordon and fractional Schr\"odinger equations. Our results generalize the classical (single-function) Strichartz estimates on compact manifolds by Kapitanski, Burq-G\'erard-Tzvetkov, Dinh, and extend the Euclidean orthonormal version by Frank-Lewin-Lieb-Seiringer, Frank-Sabin, Bez-Lee-Nakamura. On the flat torus, our new results for the Schr\"odinger equation cover prior work of Nakamura, which exploits the dispersive estimate of Kenig-Ponce-Vega. We achieve sharp results on compact manifolds by combining the frequency localized dispersive estimates for small time intervals with the duality principle due to Frank-Sabin. We construct examples to show these results can be saturated on the sphere, and we can improve them on the flat torus by using Bourgain-Demeter's decoupling theorem to obtain new decoupling inequalities for certain non-smooth hypersurfaces. As an application, we obtain the well-posedness of infinite systems of dispersive equations with Hartree-type nonlinearity.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the inviscid limit problem to the higher dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the whole space. It was proved in \cite[J. Funct. Anal., 276 (2019)]{GZ} that given initial data $u_0\in B^{s}_{p,r}$ with $1\leq r&lt;\infty$, the solution of the Navier-Stokes equations converges strongly in $B^{s}_{p,r}$ to the solution of the Euler equations as the viscosity parameter tends to zero. In the case when $r=\infty$, we prove the failure of the $B^{s}_{p,\infty}$-convergence of the Navier-Stokes equations toward the Euler equations in the inviscid limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove new moment-preserving polynomially weighted convolution estimates for the gain operator of the Boltzmann equation with hard potentials, including the critical case of hard-spheres. Our approach relies crucially on a novel cancellation mechanism dealing with the pathological case of energy-absorbing collisions (that is, collisions that accumulate energy to only one of the outgoing particles). These collisions distinguish hard potentials from Maxwell molecules. Our method quantifies the heuristic that, while energy-absorbing collisions occur with non-trivial probability, they are statistically rare, and therefore do not affect the overall averaging behavior of the gain operator. At the technical level, our proof relies solely on tools from kinetic theory, such as geometric identities and angular averaging.</description>

Abstract: We establish the existence of compactly supported solutions of the inviscid incompressible 2D Boussinesq equation with $C^{1,\sqrt{\frac{4}{3}}-1-\varepsilon}\cap L^{2}$ force that develop a singularity in finite time. Importantly, the force preserves this regularity at the blow-up time. Moreover, the forces in the vorticity and density equations have compact support. The mechanism behind the blow-up is an accumulated hysteresis effect on the vorticity caused by an infinite chain of "degenerate" pendula and flickering density.</description>

By employing conserved quantities in terms of the momentum variable $m$, we show that the 2-soliton, when regarded as a solution to the initial-value problem for the modified Camassa-Holm equation, is nonlinearly stable to perturbations with respect to the momentum variable in the Sobolev space $H^2$.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we study the following Hamiltonian system: \begin{equation*}
  \begin{cases}
  \begin{aligned}
  &amp;-\varepsilon^{2}\Delta_{g} u +u = |v|^{q-1}v,
  &amp;-\varepsilon^{2}\Delta_{g} v +v = |u|^{p-1}u &amp;&amp; \text{ in } \mathcal{M},
  &amp; \quad u,v &gt;0 &amp;&amp; \text{ in } \mathcal{M},
  \end{aligned}
  \end{cases} \end{equation*} where $\mathcal{M}$ is a smooth, compact and connected Riemannian manifold of dimension $N\geq 3$ without boundary. The exponents $p,q&gt;1$ are assumed to lie below the critical hyperbola, ensuring subcritical growth conditions. We investigate a sequence of least energy critical points of the associated dual functional and analyze their concentration behavior as $\varepsilon \to 0$. Our main result shows that the sequence of solutions exhibits point concentration, with the concentration occurring at a point where the scalar curvature of $\mathcal{M}$ attains its maximum.</description>

      <title>Regularity of velocity averages in kinetic equations with heterogeneity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the regularity of kinetic equations with spatial heterogeneity. Recent progress has shown that velocity averages of weak solutions $h$ in $L^p$ ($p&gt;1$) are strongly $L^1_{\text{loc}}$ compact under the natural non-degeneracy condition. We establish regularity estimates for equations with an $\boldsymbol{x}$-dependent drift vector $\mathfrak{f} = \mathfrak{f}(\boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{\lambda})$, which satisfies a quantitative version of the non-degeneracy condition. We prove that $(t,\boldsymbol{x}) \mapsto \int \rho(\boldsymbol{\lambda}) h(t,\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{\lambda})\, d\boldsymbol{\lambda}$, for any sufficiently regular $\rho(\cdot)$, belongs to the fractional Sobolev space $W_{\text{loc}}^{\beta,r}$, for some regularity $\beta\in (0,1)$ and integrability $r \geq 1$ exponents. While such estimates have long been known for $\boldsymbol{x}$-independent drift vectors $\mathfrak{f}=\mathfrak{f}(\boldsymbol{\lambda})$, this is the first quantitative regularity estimate in a general heterogeneous setting. As an application, we obtain a regularity estimate for entropy solutions to heterogeneous conservation laws with nonlinear flux and $L^\infty$ initial data.</description>

      <title>Structurally damped semilinear evolution equation for positive operators on Hilbert space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we analyze a semilinear damped evolution equation under different damping conditions, including the undamped $(\theta=0)$, effectively damped $(0&lt;2\theta&lt;\sigma)$, critically damped $(2\theta=\sigma)$, and non-effectively damped $(\sigma&lt;2\theta\leq 2\sigma)$. The analysis is conducted in two parts; the present article is devoted to examining decay estimates of solutions to the linear evolution equation governed by a self-adjoint, positive operator $\mathcal{L}$ with discrete spectrum subject to initial Cauchy data of minimal regularity. Specifically, we consider the Cauchy problem: \begin{equation*}
  \left\{\begin{array}{l}
  u_{tt}(t)+\mathcal{L}^{\theta}u_{t}(t)+\mathcal{L}^{\sigma}u(t) =0, \quad t&gt;0,
  u(0)=u_{0}\in\mathcal{H},\quad
  u_{t}(0)=u_{1}\in\mathcal{H},
  \end{array}\right. \end{equation*} in different damping conditions. %More precisely, we study decay estimates for a solution, its time derivative, and space derivative in both cases. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the decay rates of the associated solutions improve with the regularity of the initial Cauchy data. As an application of the decay estimates, we also demonstrate the global existence (in time) of the solution in certain cases, taking into account polynomial-type nonlinearity. In the 2nd article, we will address the remaining instances where global existence cannot be assured and instead present findings on local existence and possible blow-up results.</description>

      <title>Existence, uniqueness, and long-time asymptotic behavior of regular solutions in multidimensional thermoelasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a simplified nonlinear thermoelasticity model on two- and three-dimensional tori. A novel functional involving the Fisher information associated with temperature is introduced, extending the previous one-dimensional approach from the first two authors (SIAM J.\ Math.\ Anal.\ \textbf{55} (2023), 7024--7038)) to higher dimensions. Using this functional, we prove global/local existence of unique regular solutions for small/large initial data. Furthermore, we analyze the asymptotic behavior as time approaches infinity and show that the temperature stabilizes to a constant state, while the displacement naturally decomposes into two distinct components: a divergence-free part oscillating indefinitely according to a homogeneous wave equation and a curl-free part converging to zero. Analogous results for the Lam\'e operator are also stated.</description>

      <title>On some typicality and density results for nonsmooth vector fields and the associated ODE and continuity equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These notes address two problems. First, we investigate the question of ``how many'' are (in Baire sense) vector fields in $L^1_t L^q_x$, $q \in [1, \infty)$, for which existence and/or uniqueness of local, distributional solutions to the associated continuity equation holds. We show that, in certain regimes, existence of solutions (even locally in time, for at least one nonzero initial datum) is a meager property, whereas, on the contrary, uniqueness of solutions is a generic property. Secondly, despite the fact that non-uniqueness is a meager property, we prove that (Sobolev) counterexamples to uniqueness, both for the continuity equation and for the ODE, in the spirit of [Bru\`e, Colombo, Kumar 2024] and [Kumar 2024] respectively, form a dense subset of the natural ambient space they live in.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the Benjamin Ono equation is globally well-posed in $H^s(\mathbb{R})$ for $s &gt; 1/2$. Our approach does not rely on the global gauge transformation introduced by Tao (arXiv:math/0307289). Instead, we employ a modified version of the standard parabolic regularization method. In particular, this technique also enables us to establish global well-posedness, in the same Sobolev space, for the dispersion-generalized Benjamin Ono (DGBO) equation.</description>

      <title>Parabolic-elliptic and indirect-direct simplifications in chemotaxis systems driven by indirect signalling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singular limits for the following indirect signalling chemotaxis system \begin{align*}
  \left\{ \begin{array}{lllllll}
  \partial_t n = \Delta n - \nabla \cdot (n \nabla c ) &amp; \text{in } \Omega\times(0,\infty) ,
  \varepsilon \partial_t c = \Delta c - c + w &amp; \text{in } \Omega\times(0,\infty),
  \varepsilon \partial_t w = \tau \Delta w - w + n &amp; \text{in } \Omega\times (0,\infty),
  \partial_\nu n = \partial_\nu c = \partial_\nu w = 0, &amp;\text{on } \partial\Omega\times (0,\infty)
  %(n,c,w)_{t=0} = (n_0,c_0,w_0) &amp; \text{on } \Omega,
  \end{array} \right. \end{align*} are investigated. More precisely, we study parabolic-elliptic simplification, or PES, $\varepsilon\to 0^+$ with fixed $\tau&gt;0$ up to the critical dimension $N=4$, and indirect-direct simplification, or IDS, $(\varepsilon,\tau)\to (0^+,0^+)$ up to the critical dimension $N=2$. These are relevant in biological situations where the signalling process is on a much faster time scale compared to the species diffusion and all interactions. Showing singular limits in critical dimensions is challenging. To deal with the PES, we carefully combine the entropy function, an Adam-type inequality, the regularisation of slow evolution, and an energy equation method to obtain strong convergence in representative spaces. For the IDS, a bootstrap argument concerning the $L^p$-energy function is devised, which allows us to obtain suitable uniform bounds for the singular limits. Moreover, in both scenarios, we also present the convergence rates, where the effect of the initial layer and the convergence to the critical manifold are also revealed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07181v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish hypocoercivity for the semiconductor Boltzmann equation with the presence of an external electrical potential under the Maxwell boundary condition. We will construct a modified entropy Lyapunov functional, which is proved to be equivalent to some weighted norm of the corresponding function space. We then show that the entropy functional dissipates along the solutions, and the exponential decay to the equilibrium state of the system follows by a Gronwall type inequality. We also generalize our arguments to situations where uncertainties in our model arise,and the hypocoercivity method we have established is adopted to analyze the regularity of the solutions along the random space.</description>

      <title>Prey-taxis VS a Shortwave External Signal in Multiple Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a model of the predator--prey community with prey-taxis. By that we mean the capability of the predators to get moving in a certain direction on the macroscopic level in response to the prey density gradients. Additionally, we suppose the same kind of sensitivity with respect to one more signal, called external, the production of which goes on independently of the community state. Such a signal can be due to the spatiotemporal inhomogeneity of the environment that results from the natural or artificial reasons. The model employs the Patlak--Keller--Segel law for responses to both ones. We assume that the external signal takes a general short-wave form, and we construct the complete asymptotic expansions of the short-wave solutions. This result generalizes the prior one by Morgulis \&amp; Malal (2025) in two respects. First, we have addressed the case of multiple dimensions. Second, we have got rid of assuming the signal and corresponding solutions to take the form of a traveling wave, that makes our result novel even in one dimension. Further, we apply the short wave asymptotic to studying the stability or instability imposed by the external signal following Kapitza' theory for upside-down pendulum.</description>

      <title>A State-Space Representation of Coupled Linear Multivariate PDEs and Stability Analysis using SDP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical processes evolving in both time and space are often modeled using Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Recently, it has been shown how stability analysis and control of coupled PDEs in a single spatial variable can be more conveniently performed using an equivalent Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. The construction of this PIE representation is based on an analytic expression for the inverse of the spatial differential operator, $\partial_s^{d}$, on the domain defined by boundary conditions. In this paper, we show how this univariate representation may be extended inductively to multiple spatial variables by representing the domain as the intersection of lifted univariate domains. Specifically, we show that if each univariate domain is well-posed, then there exists a readily verified consistency condition which is necessary and sufficient for existence of an inverse to the multivariate spatial differential operator, $D^\alpha=\partial_{s_1}^{\alpha_1}\cdots\partial_{s_N}^{\alpha_N}$, on the PDE domain. Furthermore, we show that this inverse is an element of a $*$-algebra of Partial Integral (PI) operators defined by polynomial semi-separable kernels. Based on this operator algebra, we show that the evolution of any suitably well-posed linear multivariate PDE may be described by a PIE, parameterized by elements of the PI algebra. A convex computational test for PDE stability is then proposed using a positive matrix parameterization of positive PI operators, and software (PIETOOLS) is provided which automates the process of representation and stability analysis of such PDEs. This software is used to analyze stability of 2D heat, wave, and plate equations, obtaining accurate bounds on the rate of decay.</description>

      <title>Inverse problem for fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equations with drift on closed Riemannian manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned about the inverse coefficient problems of variable-coefficient fractional Schr\"{o}dinger equations with drift on connected closed Riemannian manifolds. We prove that the knowledge of the underlying equation on any non-empty open subset of the underlying manifold determines the Riemannian metric, the drift and the potential, simultaneously and uniquely, up to a gauge transformation. This paper extends the result in \cite{feizmohammadi2021fractionalanisotropiccalderonproblem} for principal terms. Not only can we retrieve lower order terms, but we are also able to achieve the simultaneous inversion of all terms. The key ingredient is a novel Runge approximation of fractional PDEs on Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Mirror Gradient Flow as the limit of the Sinkhorn Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the sequence of marginals obtained from the iterations of the Sinkhorn algorithm or the iterative proportional fitting procedure (IPFP) on joint densities, converges to an absolutely continuous curve on the $2$-Wasserstein space, as the regularization parameter $\varepsilon$ goes to zero and the number of iterations is scaled as $1/\varepsilon$ (and other technical assumptions). This limit, which we call the Sinkhorn flow, is an example of a Wasserstein mirror gradient flow, a concept we introduce here inspired by the well-known Euclidean mirror gradient flows. In the case of Sinkhorn, the gradient is that of the relative entropy functional with respect to one of the marginals and the mirror is half of the squared Wasserstein distance functional from the other marginal. Interestingly, the norm of the velocity field of this flow can be interpreted as the metric derivative with respect to the linearized optimal transport (LOT) distance. An equivalent description of this flow is provided by the parabolic Monge-Amp\`{e}re PDE whose connection to the Sinkhorn algorithm was noticed by Berman (2020). We derive conditions for exponential convergence for this limiting flow. We also construct a Mckean-Vlasov diffusion whose marginal distributions follow the Sinkhorn flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Gibbs measures on the $d$-dimensional torus with $L^2$-(super)critical focusing interaction potentials. We establish a precise divergence rate of the partition function as we remove regularization, where the optimal constant is given by (i) (the negative of) the minimum value of the Hamiltonian given an $L^2$-constraint in the $L^2$-critical case and (ii) the optimal constant for certain Bernstein's inequality in the mass-supercritical case. In particular, our result in the $L^2$-critical case precisely quantifies the phase transition of the focusing Gibbs measure at the critical $L^2$ threshold, previously studied by Lebowitz, Rose, and Speer (1988) and Sosoe, Tolomeo, and the fourth author (2022).</description>

      <title>Finite Element Approximation of the Fractional Porous Medium Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18901v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a finite element method for the numerical solution of a fractional porous medium equation on a bounded open Lipschitz polytopal domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{d}$, where $d = 2$ or $3$. The pressure in the model is defined as the solution of a fractional Poisson equation, involving the fractional Neumann Laplacian in terms of its spectral definition. We perform a rigorous passage to the limit as the spatial and temporal discretization parameters tend to zero and show that a subsequence of the sequence of finite element approximations defined by the proposed numerical method converges to a bounded and nonnegative weak solution of the initial-boundary-value problem under consideration. This result can be therefore viewed as a constructive proof of the existence of a nonnegative, energy-dissipative, weak solution to the initial-boundary-value problem for the fractional porous medium equation under consideration, based on the Neumann Laplacian. The convergence proof relies on results concerning the finite element approximation of the spectral fractional Laplacian and compactness techniques for nonlinear partial differential equations, together with properties of the equation, which are shown to be inherited by the numerical method. We also prove that the total energy associated with the problem under consideration exhibits exponential decay in time.</description>

      <title>Weyl Law and convergence in the classical limit for min-max nonlocal minimal surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12162v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonlocal minimal surfaces as a new approximation theory for the area functional, and more specifically in the context of Yau's conjecture on the existence of minimal surfaces in closed three-dimensional manifolds.
  In recent work, the author and collaborators constructed infinitely many nonlocal $s$-minimal hypersurfaces (via min-max methods) on any closed $n$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $M$, establishing a full analogue of Yau's conjecture for $s\in(0,1)$.
  The present article first proves a Weyl Law for the fractional perimeters of these hypersurfaces. The rest -- and main part -- of the article is devoted to obtaining effective estimates (as $s\to 1$) for min-max $s$-minimal surfaces in closed three-dimensional manifolds, including classical perimeter and mean curvature estimates, and eventually establishing their convergence to smooth, classical minimal surfaces. We recover in particular recent results on generic density and equidistribution of minimal surfaces, which are a strong form of Yau's conjecture in this setting.</description>

      <title>A second order approach to the Kato square root problem on open sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain the Kato square root property for coupled second-order elliptic systems in divergence form subject to mixed boundary conditions on an open and possibly unbounded set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ under two simple geometric conditions: The Dirichlet boundary parts for the respective components are Ahlfors--David regular and a quantitative connectivity property in the spirit of locally uniform domains holds near the remaining Neumann boundary parts. In contrast to earlier work, our proof is not based on the first-order approach due to Axelsson--Keith--McIntosh but uses a second-order approach in the spirit of the original solution to the Kato square root problem on Euclidean space. This way, the proof becomes substantially shorter and technically less demanding.</description>

      <title>Theoretical analysis of a finite-volume scheme for a stochastic Allen-Cahn problem with constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this contribution is to address the convergence study of a time and space approximation scheme for an Allen-Cahn problem with constraint and perturbed by a multiplicative noise of It\^o type. The problem is set in a bounded domain of $\mathbb{R}^d$ (with $d=2$ or $3$) and homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions are considered. The employed strategy consists in building a numerical scheme on a regularized version \`a la Moreau-Yosida of the constrained problem, and passing to the limit simultaneously with respect to the regularization parameter and the time and space steps, denoted respectively by $\epsilon$, $\Delta t$ and $h$. Combining a semi-implicit Euler-Maruyama time discretization with a Two-Point Flux Approximation (TPFA) scheme for the spatial variable, one is able to prove, under the assumption $\Delta t=\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{2+\theta})$ for a positive $\theta$, the convergence of such a $(\epsilon, \Delta t, h)$ scheme towards the unique weak solution of the initial problem, \textit{ a priori} strongly in $L^2(\Omega;L^2(0,T;L^2(\Lambda)))$ and \textit{a posteriori} also strongly in $L^{p}(0,T; L^2(\Omega\times \Lambda))$ for any finite $p\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>On the hot spots conjecture in higher dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00816v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a strong form of the hot spots conjecture for a class of domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$ which are a natural generalization of the lip domains of Atar and Burdzy [J. Amer. Math. Soc. 17 (2004), 243-265] in dimension two, as well as for a class of symmetric domains in $\mathbb{R}^d$ generalizing the domains studied by Jerison and Nadirashvili [J. Amer. Math. Soc. 13 (2000), 741-772]. Our method of proof is based on studying a vector-valued Laplace operator whose spectrum contains the spectrum of the Neumann Laplacian. This proof is essentially variational and does not require tools from stochastic analysis, nor does it use deformation arguments. In particular, it contains a new proof of the main result of Jerison and Nadirashvili.</description>

      <title>The elastic ray transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18686v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new family of tensor tomography problems. At rank 2 it corresponds to linearization of travel time of elastic waves, measured for all polarizations. We provide a kernel characterization for ranks up to 2. The kernels consist of potential tensors, but in an unusual sense: the associated differential operators have degree 2 instead of the familiar 1. The proofs are based on Fourier analysis, Helmholtz decompositions, and cohomology.</description>

      <title>Extension principles for the Einstein Yang--Mills system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19403v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the local existence theorem and establish an extension principle for the spherically symmetric Einstein Yang--Mills system (SSEYM) with $H^1$ data. This in addition implies Cauchy stability for the system.
  In contrast to a massless scalar field, the purely magnetic Yang--Mills field in spherical symmetry satisfies a wave-type equation with a singular potential. As a consequence, the proof of Christodoulou [10], based on an $L^\infty-L^\infty$ estimate, fails in the Yang--Mills context. Instead, we employ an $L^2$-based method, which is valid for both massless and massive scalar matter fields as well.</description>

      <title>$C^1$ invariant, stable and inertial manifolds for non-autonomous dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00165v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the version of the Lyapunov--Perron method operating on individual solutions to investigate the existence of invariant manifolds for non-autonomous dynamical systems, focusing in particular on inertial and stable manifolds. We establish a characterization of both types of manifolds in terms of solutions exhibiting a common growth behavior, analogous to the classical characterization involving hyperbolicity. Furthermore, we introduce a unified formulation of the gap condition, from which known sharp versions are derived. Finally, we show that the constructed inertial manifolds have $C^1$ regularity.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of oscillations for axisymmetric solar backgrounds with differential rotation and gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Local helioseismology comprises of imaging and inversion techniques employed to reconstruct the dynamic and interior of the Sun from correlations of oscillations observed on the surface, all of which require modeling solar oscillations and computing Green's kernels. In this context, we implement and investigate the robustness of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method in solving the equation modeling stellar oscillations for realistic solar backgrounds containing gravity and differential rotation. While a common choice for modeling stellar oscillations is the Galbrun's equation, our working equations are derived from an equivalent variant, involving less regularity in its coefficients, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure perturbation as unknowns. Under differential rotation and axisymmetric assumption, the system is solved in azimuthal decomposition with the HDG method. Compared to no-gravity approximations, the mathematical nature of the wave operator is now linked to the profile of the solar buoyancy frequency N which encodes gravity, and leads to distinction into regions of elliptic or hyperbolic behavior of the wave operator at zero attenuation. While small attenuation is systematically included to guarantee theoretical well-posedness, the above phenomenon affects the numerical solutions in terms of amplitude and oscillation pattern, and requires a judicious choice of stabilization. We investigate the stabilization of the HDG discretization scheme, and demonstrate its importance to ensure the accuracy of numerical results, which is shown to depend on frequencies relative to N, and on the position of the Dirac source. As validations, the numerical power spectra reproduce accurately the observed effects of the solar rotation on acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>The Hasse Principle for Geometric Variational Problems: An Illustration via Area-minimizing Submanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hasse principle in number theory states that information about integral solutions to Diophantine equations can be pieced together from real solutions and solutions modulo prime powers. We show that the Hasse principle holds for area-minimizing submanifolds: information about area-minimizing submanifolds in integral homology can be fully recovered from those in real homology and mod $n$ homology for all $n\in \mathbb{Z}_{\ge 2}.$ As a consequence we derive several surprising conclusions, including: area-minimizing submanifolds in mod $n$ homology are asymptotically much smoother than expected and area-minimizing submanifolds are not generically calibrated. We conjecture that the Hasse principle holds for all geometric variational problems that can be formulated on chain space over different coeffiicients, e.g., Almgren-Pitts min-max, mean curvature flow, Song's spherical Plateau problem, minimizers of elliptic and other general functionals, etc.</description>
