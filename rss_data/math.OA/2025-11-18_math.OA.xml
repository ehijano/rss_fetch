      <title>Matrix Duality and a Bipolar Theorem for Completely Positive Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a matrix bipolar theorem for families of completely positive maps between operator systems. Given operator systems $\mathscr{S}$ and $\mathscr{T}$, we introduce a canonical pairing between CP maps $\Phi:\mathscr{S}\to \mathscr{T}$ and \emph{matrix tests} $(k,f,s)$, where $k\in\mathbb{N}$, $f$ is a state on $M_k(\mathscr{T})$, and $s\in M_k(\mathscr{S})$. This pairing induces a duality between subsets of $\CP(\mathscr{S},\mathscr{T})$ and collections of matrix tests through a \emph{saturated polar} construction that preserves $C^*$--convexity. Our main theorem identifies the double polar $(\mathcal K^{\circ_{C^*}})^{\circ_{C^*}}$ with the $\tau$--closed $C^*$--convex hull of $\mathcal K$, where $\tau$ is the locally convex topology generated by the test functionals. The result extends the classical matrix bipolar theorem of Effros--Winkler for matrix-convex sets (the case $\mathscr{T}=\mathbb{C}$) and the tracial bipolar theorem of Helton--Klep--McCullough (for tracial $\mathscr{T}$), while providing the first complete dual characterization of $C^*$--convex subsets of $\CP(\mathscr{S},\mathscr{T})$. In finite dimensions, the theorem corresponds, via the Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism, to the matrix bipolar theorem for cones of positive semidefinite matrices.</description>

      <title>Dimension-Free Estimates for Noncommutative Discrete Maximal Spherical Means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish dimension-free $L_p$-estimates for operator-valued maximal spherical means on cyclic groups $\Z_{m+1}^d$ for all $p&gt;1$ and $m\geq1$. The key ingredient is a noncommutative extension of the spectral technique developed by Nevo and Stein. As an application, we obtain a noncommutative spherical maximal inequality for automorphism actions of von Neumann algebras.</description>

Abstract: We investigate commutators of free variables of the form \( i[x, s] \), where \( s \) is a semicircular element. We show that although \( s \) and \( i[x, s] \) are not free, their sum nevertheless satisfies the free additive convolution identity \[ \mu_{s + i[x, s]} = \mu_s \boxplus \mu_{i[x, s]}. \] Furthermore, we prove that the polynomial \( x + i[x, s] \) is freely infinitely divisible whenever \( x \) itself is freely infinitely divisible.</description>

      <title>Block Positivity and Optimal Mixed-Schwarz Inequalities on Hilbert $C^*$-Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose two interrelated advances in the theory of adjointable operators on Hilbert C*-modules. First, we give a set of equivalent, verifiable conditions characterizing positivity of general $n\times n$ block operator matrices acting on finite direct sums of Hilbert C*-modules. Our conditions generalize and remove several classical range-closedness and Moore-Penrose assumptions by expressing positivity in terms of a finite family of mixed inner-product inequalities and an explicit Gram-type factorization. Second, we investigate a parametric family of mixed-Schwarz inequalities for adjointable operators and determine optimal factor functions and constants which make these inequalities sharp; we characterize the extremal operators attaining equality in key cases. The two developments are tied together: the optimal mixed-Schwarz bounds are used to obtain sharp, computable tests in the $n\times n$ positivity criterion, and conversely the block-factorizations yield structural information used in the extremal analysis. We include applications to solvability of operator equations without Moore-Penrose inverses and spectral gap estimates for block operator generators.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates conditions for the boundedness of Forelli-Rudin type operators on weighted Lebesgue spaces associated with tubular domains over the generalized light cone. We establish a complete characterization of the boundedness for two classes of Forelli-Rudin type operators from $L_{\boldsymbol{\alpha}}^{p}$ to $L_{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^{q}$, in the range $1 &lt; p \leq q &lt; \infty$.

      <title>Norm additive mappings between commutative $C^{*}$-algebras in the range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let \( A_i \) be a commutative \( C^{*} \)-algebra for \( i = 1, 2 \), and denote by \( A_i^{+} \) its positive cone, consisting of all positive elements of \( A_i \). In this paper, we investigate surjective, not necessarily continuous mappings \( T: A_1^{+} \to A_2^{+} \) that satisfy the norm equality \[ \| T(a + b) \| = \| T(a) + T(b) \| \quad (a, b \in A_1^{+}). \] We prove that such a mapping \( T \) is necessarily additive and positive homogeneous. Furthermore, we show that if the mapping $T:A_{1}^{+}\to A_{2}^{+}$ between the positive cones of two unital commutative $C^{*}$-algebras $A_{i}$ with the unit element \( 1_{A_i} \) for \( i = 1, 2 \), and if \( T \) is also injective, then $T(1_{A_1})^{-1}T$ is a composition operator.

Abstract: Bisch and Jones established a bijection between the intermediate subfactors of an irreducible subfactor and certain idempotents satisfying exchange relations. In this paper, we generalize this result to abelian monoidal categories through Frobenius subalgebras. As an application, we show that certain morphisms on a C*-correspondence arise from intermediate C*-subalgebras if and only if they are averaging operators.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Banach-bundle germs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a continuous bundle $\mathcal{E}\to X$ of Banach/Hilbert spaces or Banach/$C^*$-algebras over a paracompact base space, equivariant for a compact Lie group $\mathbb{U}$ operating on all structures involved. We prove that in all cases homogeneous equivariant subbundles extend equivariantly from $\mathbb{U}$-invariant closed subsets of $X$ to closed invariant neighborhoods thereof (provided the fibers are semisimple in the Banach-algebra variant). This extends a number of results in the literature (due to Fell for non-equivariant local extensibility around a single point for $C^*$-algebras and the author for semisimple Banach algebras). The proofs are based in part on auxiliary results on (a) the extensibility of equivariant compact-Lie-group principal bundles locally around invariant closed subsets of paracompact spaces, as a consequence of equivariant-bundle classifying spaces being absolute neighborhood extensors in the relevant setting and (b) an equivariant-bundle version of Johnson's approximability of almost-multiplicative maps from finite-dimensional semisimple Banach algebras with Banach morphisms.</description>

      <title>HilbMult: A Banach-Enriched Multicategory for Operator Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Category and multicategory theory provide abstract frameworks for describing structures and their compositions, with multicategories extending traditional categories to handle multi-input operations. These theories enable modular reasoning and coherent composition of complex systems, and have found applications in computer science, physics, and mathematics, including programming language semantics, quantum processes, tensor networks, operads, and higher algebra. Operator theory, in contrast, studies linear and multilinear transformations in functional spaces, forming the analytic backbone of modern analysis and quantum mechanics, with applications ranging from signal processing and control theory to data science. This paper explores the synergy between these two areas by showing how operator theory provides concrete analytic structures that naturally enrich multicategories, while multicategory theory supplies a unifying framework for organizing multi-input operators and ensuring coherence in complex networks. We develop a comprehensive categorical framework integrating operator theory with multicategories, introducing a symmetric monoidal multicategory of Hilbert spaces with bounded multilinear maps and establishing its enrichment and coherence properties. The framework includes a functorial spectral theorem, covariance under unitary transformations, and universality as a semantic target, providing a unified language for linking analytic structure, categorical semantics, and operator representations. This work lays the foundation for a broader research program uniting operator theory, category theory, and noncommutative geometry.</description>

      <title>Fourier--Stieltjes category for twisted groupoid actions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the theory of Fourier--Stieltjes algebras to the category of twisted actions by \'etale groupoids on arbitrary C*-bundles, generalizing theories constructed previously by B\'{e}dos and Conti for twisted group actions on unital C*-algebras, and by Renault and others for groupoid C*-algebras, in each case motivated by the classical theory of Fourier--Stieltjes algebras of discrete groups. To this end we develop a toolbox including, among other things, a theory of multiplier C*-correspondences, multiplier C*-correspondence bundles, Busby--Smith twisted groupoid actions, and the associated crossed products, equivariant representations and Fell's absorption theorems. For a fixed \'etale groupoid $G$ a Fourier--Stieltjes multiplier is a family of maps acting on fibers, arising from an equivariant representation. It corresponds to a certain fiber-preserving strict completely bounded map between twisted full (or reduced) crossed products. We establish a KSGNS-type dilation result which shows that the correspondence above restricts to a bijection between positive-definite multipliers and a particular class of completely positive maps. Further we introduce a subclass of Fourier multipliers, that enjoys a natural absorption property with respect to Fourier--Stieltjes multipliers and gives rise to `reduced to full' multiplier maps on crossed products. Finally we provide several applications of the theory developed, for example to the approximation properties, such as weak containment or nuclearity, of the crossed products and actions in question, and discuss outstanding open problems.</description>

      <title>Quantum metric Choquet simplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04368v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precipitating a notion emerging from recent research, we formalise the study of a special class of compact quantum metric spaces. Abstractly, the additional requirement we impose on the underlying order unit spaces is the Riesz interpolation property. In practice, this means that a 'quantum metric Choquet simplex' arises as a unital $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebra $A$ whose trace space is equipped with a metric inducing the $w^*$-topology, such that tracially Lipschitz elements are dense in $A$. This added structure is designed for measuring distances in and around the category of stably finite classifiable $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebras, and in particular for witnessing metric and statistical properties of the space of approximate unitary equivalence classes of unital embeddings of $A$ into a stably finite classifiable $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebra $B$. As for examples, we recall the construction of classifiable $\mathrm{C}^*$-algebraic quantum metric Bauer simplices that function as noncommutative spaces of observables of compact connected metric spaces $(X,\rho)$. We also explain how to build non-Bauer examples by forming 'tracial quantum crossed products' associated with topological dynamical systems on $(X,\rho)$, and we use classification to show that continuous fields of quantum spaces are obtained by continuously varying either the dynamics or the metric. In the case of deformed isometric actions, we show that equivariant Gromov-Hausdorff continuity implies fibrewise continuity of the quantum structures with respect to Rieffel's quantum Gromov-Hausdorff distance. As an example, we present a field of deformed tracial rotation algebras whose fibres are continuous with respect to a quasimetric that we call the quantum intertwining gap.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07558v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that, for many choices of finite tuples of generators $X = (x_1, \dots , x_d)$ of a tracial von Neumann algebra $(M, \tau)$ satisfying certain decomposition properties (non-primeness, possessing a Cartan subalgebra, or property $\Gamma$), one can find a diffuse, hyperfinite subalgebra $N \subseteq (W^*(X))^{\omega}$ (often in $W^*(X)$ itself), such that $W^*(N,X+\sqrt{t}S) = W^*(N,X,S)$ for all $t &gt; 0$. (Here $S$ is a free semicircular family, free from $\{X\} \cup N$). This gives a short non-microstates proof of strong 1-boundedness for such algebras.</description>

Abstract: We show that Mumford's Approximately Macroscopically Unique (AMU) states exist for quantum systems consisting of unbounded self-adjoint operators when the commutators are small. In particular, AMU states always exist in position and momentum systems when the Planck constant $|\hbar|$ is sufficiently small. However, we show that these standard quantum mechanical systems are far away from classical mechanical (commutative) systems even when $|\hbar|\to 0.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a method for the transfer of perfect strategies between various classes of two-player, one round cooperative non-local games with quantum inputs and outputs using the simulation paradigm in quantum information theory. We show that such a transfer is possible when canonically associated operator spaces for each game are quantum homomorphic or isomorphic, as defined in the joint work of H. and Todorov (2024). We examine a new class of QNS correlations, needed for the transfer of strategies between games, and characterize them in terms of states on tensor products of canonical operator systems. We define jointly tracial correlations and show they correspond to traces acting on tensor products of canonical ${\rm C}^{*}$-algebras associated with individual game parties. We then make an inquiry into the initial application of such results to the study of concurrent quantum games.</description>

      <title>Hilbert $*$-categories: Where limits in analysis and category theory meet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17432</link>

Abstract: This article introduces Hilbert $*$-categories: an abstraction of categories with similar algebraic and analytic properties to the categories of real, complex, and quaternionic Hilbert spaces and bounded linear maps. Other examples include categories of Hilbert W*-modules and of unitary group-representations. Hilbert $*$-categories are "analytically" complete in two ways: every bounded increasing sequence of Hermitian endomorphisms has a supremum, and every suitably bounded orthogonal family of parallel morphisms is summable. These "analytic" completeness properties are not assumed outright; rather, they are derived, respectively, from two new universal constructions: codirected $\ell^2$-limits of contractions and $\ell^2$-products. In turn, these are built from directed colimits in the wide subcategory of isometries.</description>

      <title>Positive maps and extendibility hierarchies from copositive matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15201v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces and systematically studies a new convex cone of PCOP (pairwise copositive). We establish that this cone is dual to the cone of PCP (pairwise completely positive) and, critically, provides a complete characterization for the positivity of the broad class of covariant maps. We provide a way to lift matrices from the cone of COP to PCOP, thereby creating a powerful bridge between the theory of copositive forms and the positive maps. We develop an analogous framework for decomposable maps, introducing the cone PDEC.
  As a primary application of this framework, we define a novel family of linear maps $\Phi_t^G$ parameterized by a graph $G$ and a real parameter $t$. We derive exact thresholds on $t$ that determine when these maps are positive or decomposable, linking these properties to fundamental graph-theoretic parameters. This construction yields vast new families of positive indecomposable maps, for which we provide explicit examples derived from infinite classes of graphs, most notably rank 3 strongly regular graphs such as Paley graphs.
  On the dual side, we investigate the entanglement properties of large classes of (symmetric) states. We prove that the SOS hierarchies used in polynomial optimization to approximate the cone of copositive matrices correspond precisely to dual cones of witnesses for different levels of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy}-. In the setting of the DPS hierarchy for separability, we construct a large family of optimal entanglement witnesses that are not certifiable by any level of the PPT bosonic extendibility hierarchy, answering a long standing open question from [DPS04]. Leveraging the duality, we also provide an explicit construction of (mixture of) bipartite Dicke states that are simultaneously entangled and $K_r$-PPT bosonic extendible for any desired hierarchy level $r \geq 2$ and local dimension $n \geq 5$.</description>

      <title>Quantum-rigid random quantum graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A quantum graph $\mathcal{G}$ housed by a matrix algebra $M_n$ can be encoded as an operator system $\mathcal S=\mathcal{S}_{\mathcal{G}}\le M_n$. There are two sensible notions of quantum automorphism group for any such: $\mathrm{Qut}(\mathcal G)$, capturing the quantum symmetries of the adjacency matrix $A:M_n\to M_n$ attached to $\mathcal{G}$, and $\mathrm{Qut}(\mathcal S\le M_n)$, the quantum group acting universally on $M_n$ so as to preserve its $C^*$ structure, standard trace, and subspace $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$. The two quantum groups coincide classically, but diverge in general. We nevertheless show that both are generically trivial in the sense that they are so for $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$ ranging over a non-empty Zariski-open set under all reasonable dimensional constraints on $\dim \mathcal{S}$ and $n$.
  This extends analogous prior results by the first and third authors to the effect that classical symmetry groups of still-quantum graphs are generically trivial, and offers a fully quantum counterpart to the familiar probabilistic almost-rigidity of finite graphs. An auxiliary result sheds some light on the relationship between the two notions of quantum automorphism group, identifying the universal preserver of the quantum adjacency matrix of $\mathcal{G}$ with the quantum automorphism group not of $\mathcal{S}\le M_n$, but rather of the complex conjugate $\overline{\mathcal{S}}\le M_n$.</description>

      <title>On the best constants of Schur multipliers of higher order divided difference functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f \in C^n(\mathbb{R})$ be such that $\Vert f^{(n)} \Vert_\infty &lt; \infty$. Let $f^{[n]} \in C(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$ be the $n$th order divided difference. A special case of our main result states that for $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ we have \[\Vert T_{f^{[n]}}: S_{np} \times \ldots \times S_{np} \rightarrow S_{p} \Vert \lesssim p^\ast p^n \Vert f^{(n)} \Vert_\infty, \] where $p^\ast = p/(p-1)$ is the H\"older conjugate of $p$ and $T_{f^{[n]}}$ is the multilinear Schur multiplier with symbol $f^{[n]}$. In case of the generalized absolute value map $f(\lambda) = \lambda^{n-1} \vert \lambda \vert, \lambda \in \mathbb{R}$, we show that \[p^\ast p^{\min(2,n)} \lesssim \Vert T_{f^{[n]}}: S_{np} \times \ldots \times S_{np} \rightarrow S_{p} \Vert.\] This provides an alternative proof to one of the key theorems in the solution of Koplienko's problem on higher order spectral shift [Invent. Math. 193, No. 3, 501-538 (2013)], which is moreover sharp as $p \searrow 1$ (for any $n$) and as $p \to\infty$ (at least if $n = 1,2$).</description>
