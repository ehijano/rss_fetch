      <title>A Temporal Graph Model to Study the Dynamics of Collective Behavior and Performance in Team Sports: An Application to Basketball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a temporal graph model is designed to model the behavior of collective sports teams based on the networks of player interactions. The main motivation for the model is to integrate the temporal dimension into the analysis of players' passing networks in order to gain deeper insights into the dynamics of system behavior, particularly how a system exploits the degeneracy property to self-regulate. First, the temporal graph model and the entropy measures used to assess the complexity of the dynamics of the network structure are introduced and illustrated. Second, an experiment using basketball data is conducted to investigate the relationship between the complexity level and team performance. This is accomplished by examining the correlations between the entropy measures in a team's behavior and the team's final performance, as well as the link between the relative score compared to that of the opponent and the entropy in the team's behavior. Results indicate positive correlations between entropy measures and final team performance, and threshold values of relative score associated with changes in team behavior -- thereby revealing common and unique team signatures. From a complexity science perspective, the model proves useful for identifying key performance factors in team sports and for studying the effects of given constraints on the exploitation of degeneracy to organize team behavior through various network structures. Future research can easily extend the model and apply it to other types of social networks.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Combinatorial Maximization: Beyond Approximate Greedy Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study adaptive combinatorial maximization, which is a core challenge in machine learning, with applications in active learning as well as many other domains. We study the Bayesian setting, and consider the objectives of maximization under a cardinality constraint and minimum cost coverage. We provide new comprehensive approximation guarantees that subsume previous results, as well as considerably strengthen them. Our approximation guarantees simultaneously support the maximal gain ratio as well as near-submodular utility functions, and include both maximization under a cardinality constraint and a minimum cost coverage guarantee. In addition, we provided an approximation guarantee for a modified prior, which is crucial for obtaining active learning guarantees that do not depend on the smallest probability in the prior. Moreover, we discover a new parameter of adaptive selection policies, which we term the "maximal gain ratio". We show that this parameter is strictly less restrictive than the greedy approximation parameter that has been used in previous approximation guarantees, and show that it can be used to provide stronger approximation guarantees than previous results. In particular, we show that the maximal gain ratio is never larger than the greedy approximation factor of a policy, and that it can be considerably smaller. This provides a new insight into the properties that make a policy useful for adaptive combinatorial maximization.</description>

      <title>Conditional Separation as a Binary Relation. A Coq Assisted Proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.03018v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of d-separation holds a pivotal role in causality theory, serving  as a fundamental tool for deriving conditional independence properties from  causal graphs. Pearl defined the d-separation of two subsets conditionally on  a third one. In this study, we present a novel perspective by showing  i) how the d-separation can be extended beyond acyclic graphs,  possibly infinite, and ii) how it can be  expressed and characterized as a binary relation between vertices. Compared  to the typical perspectives in causality theory, our equivalence opens the  door to more compact and computational proofing techniques, because the  language of binary relations is well adapted to equational reasoning.  Additionally, and of independent interest, the proofs  of the results presented in this paper are checked with the Coq proof  assistant.</description>

      <title>On (Random-order) Online Contention Resolution Schemes for the Matching Polytope of (Bipartite) Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Online Contention Resolution Schemes (OCRS's) represent a modern tool for selecting a subset of elements, subject to resource constraints, when the elements are presented to the algorithm sequentially. OCRS's have led to some of the best-known competitive ratio guarantees for online resource allocation problems, with the added benefit of treating different online decisions -- accept/reject, probing, pricing -- in a unified manner. This paper analyzes OCRS's for resource constraints defined by matchings in graphs, a fundamental structure in combinatorial optimization. We consider two dimensions of variants: the elements being presented in adversarial or random order; and the graph being bipartite or general. We improve the state of the art for all combinations of variants, both in terms of algorithmic guarantees and impossibility results. Some of our algorithmic guarantees are best-known even compared to Contention Resolution Schemes that can choose the order of arrival or are offline. All in all, our results for OCRS directly improve the best-known competitive ratios for online accept/reject, probing, and pricing problems on graphs in a unified manner.</description>
