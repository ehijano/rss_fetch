      <title>Spin wave propagation in a ring-shaped magnonic waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We experimentally investigate frequency-selective spin wave (SW) transmission in a micrometre-scale, ring-shaped magnonic resonator integrated with a linear Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) stripe. Using super-Nyquist-sampling magneto-optical Kerr effect microscopy (SNS-MOKE) and micro-focused Brillouin light scattering ({\mu}-BLS), we probe SW dynamics in the dipolar regime under in-plane magnetisation. Spatially resolved measurements reveal a sharp transmission peak at 3.92 GHz for an external field of 74 mT, demonstrating strong frequency selectivity.
  Our results show that this selectivity arises from scattering and interference between multiple SW modes within the ring. These modes are governed by the anisotropic dispersion relation, transverse mode quantisation due to geometric confinement, and inhomogeneities of the effective magnetic field. In addition, the anisotropy enforces fixed group velocity directions, leading to caustic-like propagation that limits efficient out-coupling. Fourier analysis reveals discrete wavevector components consistent with quantised transverse eigenmodes. Additional {\mu}-BLS measurements at 70 mT show a shift of the transmission peak, confirming that the filtering characteristics are tunable by external parameters.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Resonance Imaging of Single Organic Radicals with Sub-Molecular Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interest in the magnetism of organic compounds is growing because of new organic magnets, spin-based electronics and the diverse properties of magnetic edge states in graphene nanoribbons. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy combined with the scanning tunneling microscopy has recently been developed as a powerful tool to address individual magnetic atoms and molecules at the atomic scale. Here we demonstrate electron spin resonance and magnetic resonance imaging of all-organic radical anions adsorbed on a protective thin insulating film grown on a metal support. We show that using the highly localized exchange field of the magnetic tip apex allows visualization of the delocalized spin density with sub-molecular resolution, enabling spin-density tomography that can distinguish similar molecular species. These results provide new opportunities for visualizing spin density and magnetic interactions at the atomic scale.</description>

      <title>DFT Investigations of Major Defects in Quartz Crystal: Implications for Luminescence and ESR Dosimetry and Dating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quartz is extensively used for luminescence and ESR dosimetry as well as dating. These techniques use inherent defects introduced in quartz crystal during its crystallization in nature. The defect comprises both intrinsic as well as extrinsic defects. These defects give important luminescence properties to quartz but are not yet well understood from a theoretical perspective. Specifically, in case of luminescence dosimetry the nature of traps and their involvement in luminescence production is not exactly known. Thus, present work attempts to understand the basic physics of defects and their implication for luminescence and ESR techniques via Density Functional Theory (DFT) modelling. The work uses DFT to model the presence of some possible major impurities in quartz. Several interesting novel results are obtained that will have implications for ongoing research in Luminescence and ESR methods. The DFT modelling suggested that Oxygen deficiency in quartz crystal results in the formation of both electron and hole trapping centres. However, it is observed that these centres can be passivated by the introduction of charge compensating OH or H ions. Further, it is found that peroxy defects can be formed in the presence of either excess Oxygen or due to the absence of Silicon (Si4+), however, the nature of the traps formed in both cases is different. Besides these intrinsic defects, Al and Fe are the major impurities which are observed as defects in quartz. The modelling of these impurities suggested that negligible change in DOS is observed for Al defect and Fe generally forms a recombination centre or hole trap. In addition to these, there are several interesting first-time observations that are not reported and will be helpful for progressing luminescence and ESR dosimetry research.</description>

      <title>Effect of 2$^\text{nd}$ harmonic current--phase relation on a behavior of a Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the behavior of a Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier assuming a current-phase relation with a second--harmonic contribution. We find that varying the weight of harmonic terms in the Josephson current affects the gain profile. The analysis of gain characteristics, phase-space portraits, Poincar\'e sections, and Fourier spectra demonstrates that the nonsinusoidal contribution influences the operating mode and stability of the device. In particular, we identify the optimal weighting of harmonic contributions that maximizes amplification, achieving gains up to $\sim 13\;\text{dB}$ in a device without dispersion engineering.</description>
