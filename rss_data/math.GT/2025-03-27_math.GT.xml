      <title>Extending families of homeomorphisms over 4-dimensional handlebodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H_g$ denote the 4-dimensional handlebody of genus $g$ and $U_g$ its boundary. We show that for all $g \ge 0$ the map from $B Homeo(H_g)$ to $B Homeo(U_g)$ induced by restriction to the boundary admits a section.</description>

      <title>Projective deformations of hyperbolic 3-orbifolds with turnover ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study projective deformations of (topologically finite) hyperbolic 3-orbifolds whose ends have turnover cross section. These deformations are examples of projective cusp openings, meaning that hyperbolic cusps are deformed in the projective setting such that they become totally geodesic generalized cusps with diagonal holonomy. We find that this kind of structure is the only one that can arise when deforming hyperbolic turnover cusps, and that turnover funnels remain totally geodesic. Therefore, we argue that, under no infinitesimal rigidity assumptions, the deformed projective 3-orbifold remains properly convex. Additionally, we give a complete description of the character variety of the turnover $S^2(3,3,3)$ in SL(4,R).</description>

      <title>Convex structures of the unit tangent spheres in Teichm{\"u}ller space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse the convex structure of the Finsler infinitesimal balls of the Thurston metric on Teichm{\"u}ller space.  We obtain a characterisation of faces, exposed faces and extreme points of the unit spheres. In particular, we prove  that with every face a unique chain-recurrent geodesic lamination is naturally associated in such a way that  this face consists of unit tangent vectors expressed as linear combinations of stretch vectors along maximal geodesic laminations containing the given one. We show that this face is exposed if and only if its associated chain-recurrent geodesic lamination is an unmeasured lamination, that is, the  support of a measured lamination. Furthermore, we show that a point on a unit tangent sphere  is an extreme point if and only if it is a unit stretch vector along some maximal chain-recurrent geodesic lamination. The last gives an affirmative answer to a conjecture whose answer was known positively in the case where the surface is either the once-punctured torus or the 4-punctured sphere. Our main results give an alternative approach to the topological part of the infinitesimal rigidity of Thurston's metric and the equivariance property of stretch vectors.</description>

      <title>Counting components of moduli space of HCMU spheres via weighted trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HCMU surfaces are compact Riemann surfaces equipped with the Calabi extremal K\"{a}hler metric and a finite number of singularities. By using both the classical football decomposition introduced by Chen-Chen-Wu and the description of the geometric structure of HCMU surfaces by Lu-Xu, we can use weighted plane trees to characterize HCMU spheres with a single integral conical angle. Moreover, we obtain an explicit counting formula for the components of the moduli space of such HCMU spheres by enumerating some class of weighted plane trees.</description>

      <title>Torus surguries on knot traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of torus surgeries on knot traces. Our key technical insight is realizing the annulus twisting construction of Osoinach as a torus surgery on a knot trace. We present several applications of this idea. We find exotic elliptic surfaces that can be realized as surgery on null-homologously embedded traces in a manner similar to that proposed by Manolescu and Piccirillo. Then we exhibit exotic traces with novel properties and improve upon the known geography for exotic Stein fillings. Finally, we construct new potential counterexamples to the smooth 4-dimensional Poincar\'e Conjecture.</description>

      <title>Surface subgroups for cocompact lattices of isometries of $H^{2n}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given any cocompact lattice $\Gamma$ in $\mathrm{SO}(2n,1)$ for $n\geq2$, we find surface subgroups in $\Gamma$. This fills the gap in the work of Hamenst\"adt in 2015, where she constructed surface subgroups in cocompact lattices of every other rank 1 semisimple Lie group of non-compact type.</description>

      <title>Hardness of computation of quantum invariants on 3-manifolds with restricted topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum invariants in low dimensional topology offer a wide variety of valuable invariants of knots and 3-manifolds, presented by explicit formulas that are readily computable. Their computational complexity has been actively studied and is tightly connected to topological quantum computing. In this article, we prove that for any 3-manifold quantum invariant in the Reshetikhin-Turaev model, there is a deterministic polynomial time algorithm that, given as input an arbitrary closed 3-manifold $M$, outputs a closed 3-manifold $M'$ with same quantum invariant, such that $M'$ is hyperbolic, contains no low genus embedded incompressible surface, and is presented by a strongly irreducible Heegaard diagram. Our construction relies on properties of Heegaard splittings and the Hempel distance. At the level of computational complexity, this proves that the hardness of computing a given quantum invariant of 3-manifolds is preserved even when severely restricting the topology and the combinatorics of the input. This positively answers a question raised by Samperton.</description>
