      <title>On non-existence of bifurcations in one-dimensional Bratu equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the classical problem of Bratu differential equation in one-dimension. While it is known that the finite difference discretized form of continuous Bratu equation gives rise to spurious bifurcations, we show that spurious bifurcation points exist even when the finite element approach is employed. We then present an analytical proof demonstrating that there are no bifurcations when the continuous Bratu equation is considered.</description>

      <title>Continuous-Time Homeostatic Dynamics for Reentrant Inference Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate the Fast-Weights Homeostatic Reentry Network (FHRN) as a continuous-time neural-ODE system, revealing its role as a norm-regulated reentrant dynamical process. Starting from the discrete reentry rule $x_t = x_t^{(\mathrm{ex})} + \gamma\, W_r\, g(\|y_{t-1}\|)\, y_{t-1}$, we derive the coupled system $\dot{y}=-y+f(W_ry;\,x,\,A)+g_{\mathrm{h}}(y)$ showing that the network couples fast associative memory with global radial homeostasis. The dynamics admit bounded attractors governed by an energy functional, yielding a ring-like manifold. A Jacobian spectral analysis identifies a \emph{reflective regime} in which reentry induces stable oscillatory trajectories rather than divergence or collapse. Unlike continuous-time recurrent neural networks or liquid neural networks, FHRN achieves stability through population-level gain modulation rather than fixed recurrence or neuron-local time adaptation. These results establish the reentry network as a distinct class of self-referential neural dynamics supporting recursive yet bounded computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the second article in a series that aims at classifying partial sections of flows, that is a general family of transverse surfaces. In this part, we classify partial cross-sections for all continuous flows, in the spirit of Schwartzman-Fried-Sullivan theory.
  We give a dynamical criterion for the existence of partial cross-sections, which is a direct consequence of part I of the series. Then we describe all partial cross-sections using a cohomological criterion, resembling Fried's criterion. We also characterize the cardinality of the set of partial cross-sections in a given cohomology class.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Order Reduction of Power Grid Networks using Quadratic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing size and complexity of modern power systems have led to a high-dimensional mathematical model for transient stability studies, rendering full-scale simulations computationally burdensome. While dimensionality reduction is essential for reducing this complexity, conventional approaches in power systems predominantly rely on linear projection methods. Such linear subspaces have limited capability for representing the inherently nonlinear swing dynamics of synchronous machines, often resulting in poor approximations and inefficient compression. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a quadratic manifold-based model order reduction (MOR) framework to accelerate the transient dynamic simulations in power systems. The proposed method combines the linear proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) basis with a learned quadratic correction term that minimizes the reconstruction error. This yields a scalable MOR strategy capable of handling strongly nonlinear behaviors, particularly those arising during fast-acting faults, where linear techniques typically fail. The method is tested on a range of benchmark power system models of increasing size and complexity. In addition, we provide a detailed numerical algorithm for constructing the quadratic manifold, along with the corresponding implementation code.</description>

      <title>Discovering Power Grid Dynamics from Data Using Low-Rank Sparse Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing integration of renewable energy sources has significantly reduced grid inertia, making modern power systems more vulnerable to instabilities. Accurate estimation of dynamic parameters such as inertia constants and damping coefficients is critical, yet traditional model-based methods struggle with scalability and adaptiveness in large, low-inertia networks. This paper presents a novel data-driven framework that integrates Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) with Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) to estimate system parameters directly from time-series data. By reducing dimensionality before applying sparse regression, the proposed Latent-SINDy (L-SINDy) method mitigates overfitting while preserving essential system dynamics. The framework is validated on IEEE benchmark systems, including the 118-bus, 300-bus, and a large-scale 2869-bus European grid. The results demonstrate an accurate recovery of the inertia and damping values, with identified models that closely match the true dynamics of the system. The approach offers scalability, interpretability, and computational efficiency, highlighting its potential for real-time monitoring and control in renewable-rich grids.</description>

      <title>An output scaling layer boosts deep neural networks for multiscale ODE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating complex diffusion-reaction systems is often prohibitively expensive due to the high dimensionality and stiffness of the underlying ODEs, where state variables may span tens of orders of magnitude. Deep learning has recently emerged as a powerful tool in scientific computing, achieving remarkable progress in modeling and sampling stiff systems. However, data scaling techniques remain largely underexplored, despite their crucial role in addressing the frequency bias of deep neural networks when handling multi-magnitude or high-frequency data. In this work, we propose the Generalized Box-Cox Transformation (GBCT), a novel nonlinear scaling method designed to mitigate multiscale challenges by rescaling inherent multi-magnitude components toward a more consistent order of magnitude. We integrate GBCT into our previous data-driven framework and evaluate its performance against the original baseline surrogate model across six representative scenarios: a 21-species chemical reaction kinetics, a 13-isotope nuclear reaction model, the well-known Robertson problem coupled with diffusion, and practically relevant simulations of two-dimensional turbulent reaction-diffusion systems as well as one- and two-dimensional nuclear reactive flows. Numerical experiments demonstrate that GBCT reduces prediction errors by up to two orders of magnitude compared with the baseline model - particularly in the long-term evolution of dynamical systems - and achieves comparable performance with only about one-sixth of the training epochs. Frequency analysis further reveals that GBCT rescales high-frequency components of the objective function toward lower frequencies to align with the neural network's natural low frequency bias, thereby boosting training and generalization. The source code to reproduce the results in this paper is available at https://github.com/Seauagain/GBCT.</description>

      <title>Analytic conjugation between planar reversible and Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the local structure of analytic planar vector fields that are reversible with respect to the linear involution $R(u,v)=(u,-v)$. We show that every analytic reversible vector field with a nondegenerate equilibrium is locally analytically conjugate to a Hamiltonian system. More precisely, we prove that, in a neighbourhood of the origin, the system is analytically equivalent to a Hamiltonian vector field whose Hamiltonian assumes the classical normal form associated with the type of the equilibrium: $H(x,y)=F(x^{2}+y^{2})$ in the elliptic case and $H(x,y)=-F(x^{2}-y^{2})$ in the hyperbolic case, where $F$ is real-analytic and completely determined by the dynamics. We also show that the conjugacy can be chosen equivariant, that is, commuting with the reversing involution.
  We further discuss the problem of \emph{global} equivalence, which in general remains open, even in the planar case. In dimensions greater than $2$ the situation becomes even more delicate: the equivalence between reversible and Hamiltonian systems is known only at the \emph{formal} level, and the existence of an analytic conjugacy, even locally, is still a widely open problem.</description>

      <title>How to Tame Your LLM: Semantic Collapse in Continuous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of semantic dynamics for large language models by formalizing them as Continuous State Machines (CSMs): smooth dynamical systems whose latent manifolds evolve under probabilistic transition operators. The associated transfer operator $P: L^2(M,\mu) \to L^2(M,\mu)$ encodes the propagation of semantic mass. Under mild regularity assumptions (compactness, ergodicity, bounded Jacobian), $P$ is compact with discrete spectrum. Within this setting, we prove the Semantic Characterization Theorem (SCT): the leading eigenfunctions of $P$ induce finitely many spectral basins of invariant meaning, each definable in an o-minimal structure over $\mathbb{R}$. Thus spectral lumpability and logical tameness coincide. This explains how discrete symbolic semantics can emerge from continuous computation: the continuous activation manifold collapses into a finite, logically interpretable ontology. We further extend the SCT to stochastic and adiabatic (time-inhomogeneous) settings, showing that slowly drifting kernels preserve compactness, spectral coherence, and basin structure.</description>

      <title>From the discrete to the continuous, from simplicial complexes to Riemannian manifolds. Approximating flows and cuts on manifolds by discrete versions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many fundamental structures of Riemannian geometry have found discrete counterparts for graphs or combinatorial ones for simplicial complexes. These include those discussed in this survey, Hodge theory, Morse theory, the spectral theory of Laplace type operators and Cheeger inequalities, and their interconnections. This raises the question of the relation between them, abstractly as structural analogies and concretely what happens when a graph constructed from random sampling of a Riemannian manifold or a simplicial complex triangulating such a manifold converge to that manifold. We survey the current state of research, highlighting some recent developments like Cheeger type inequalities for the higher dimensional geometry of simplicial complexes, Floer type constructions in the presence of periodic or homoclinic orbits of dynamical systems or the disorientability of simplicial complexes.</description>

Abstract: This survey focuses on strong closing lemmas in Hamiltonian dynamics that are proved using spectral invariants (also known as action selectors) in symplectic geometry. We review strong closing lemmas in low-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics (Reeb flows on contact three-manifolds and area-preserving maps on symplectic surfaces) and outline the key ideas behind their proofs. We also discuss results concerning strong closing lemmas in high-dimensional Hamiltonian dynamics, as well as analogous results for minimal hypersurfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a non-Archimedean analogue of Koksma's theorem. For a local field F of characteristic zero, we prove that the sequence ([{\alpha}x^n]) is uniformly distributed in the valuation ring O for almost every x with |x|_p&gt;1. In the case of positive characteristic, ([x^n]) fails to be uniformly distributed, but it becomes {\mu}*-uniformly distributed for some weighted measure {\mu}*. These results are derived from a general metric theorem for sequences generated by expanding scaling maps. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the exceptional set of parameters x for which these sequences are not uniformly distributed is large (i.e. having full Hausdorff dimension) and share a rich q-homogeneous fractal structure.</description>

      <title>Opinion dynamics modelling: distinct attraction and repulsion topologies highlight quantitative effects of trolling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of opinion dynamics based on networked non-linear differential equations. The model combines a linear attraction with a repulsive hyperbolic tangent interaction, labeled controversialness. For low controversialness the model displays universal consensus, which is typical of opinion models. As controversialness increases, opinion behaviours such as polarisation, clustering and dissensus emerge, dependent on the network topology. By placing attractive and repulsive interactions on distinct networks, this model is able to simulate the manipulative effects of trolls by introducing controversy, which may be associated with mis/disinformation, toxic messaging, and encouraging provocative questioning and/or emotional posting. This work offers an analytical and statistical analysis of model results, under a wide variety of topologies and initial conditions, whilst also generalising cluster detection algorithms typically applied to discrete models.</description>

      <title>Limit Theorems for a class of unbounded observables with an application to "Sampling the Lindel\"of hypothesis"</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.13807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), the first order Edgeworth Expansion and a Mixing Local Central Limit Theorem (MLCLT) for Birkhoff sums of a class of unbounded heavily oscillating observables over a family of full-branch piecewise $C^2$ expanding maps of the interval. As a corollary, we obtain the corresponding results for Boolean-type transformations on $\mathbb{R}$. The class of observables in the CLT and the MLCLT on $\mathbb{R}$ include the real part, the imaginary part and the absolute value of the Riemann zeta function. Thus obtained CLT and MLCLT for the Riemann zeta function are in the spirit of the results of Lifschitz &amp; Weber (2009) and Steuding (2012) who have proven the Strong Law of Large Numbers for "Sampling the Lindel\"of hypothesis".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01593v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a compact three-dimensional smooth Riemannian manifold of strictly 1/4-pinched negative sectional curvature, we establish exponential mixing of the frame flow with respect to the normalized volume. More generally this result extends to a class of torus extensions of Anosov flows, subject to assumptions on the Brin transitivity group and the smoothness of the stable subbundle. Our approach is based on a simplified dynamical model for studying the extension flow, constructed via a Young tower of the underlying Anosov flow. Exponential mixing is then obtained through a strengthened Dolgopyat type estimate on the corresponding transfer operators.</description>

Abstract: We obtain new entropy rigidity results for $u$-Gibbs measures by showing that whenever a $u$-Gibbs measure of a partially hyperbolic diffeomorphism admits an unstable Margulis family, the unstable Jacobian data of the system must to be constant. We apply our result to center isometries and flow type diffeomorphisms showing that if a measure of maximal entropy is also $u$-Gibbs then Jacobian periodic data along the unstable bundle are constant. In the case of smooth jointly integrable partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms of $\mathbb{T}^3$, assuming that there exists some $u$-Gibbs measure which is also a measure of maximal unstable entropy, we obtain smooth conjugacy along the center-unstable foliation and uniqueness of $u$-Gibbs measures in this case.</description>

Abstract: This paper further studies the matroid realization space of a specific deformation of the regular $n$-gon with its lines of symmetry. Recently, we obtained that these particular realization spaces are birational to the elliptic modular surfaces $\Xi_{1}(n)$ over the modular curve $X_1(n)$. Here, we focus on the peculiar cases when $n=7,8$ in more detail. We obtain concrete quartic surfaces in $\mathbb{P}^3$ equipped with a dominant rational self-map stemming from an operator on line arrangements, which yields K3 surfaces with a dynamical system that is semi-conjugated to the plane.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by Benoist, we study objects linked to integrable tangent vectors on the character variety of a semi-group $\Gamma$ with values in a semi-simple real-algebraic group $\mathsf G$. We prove the \emph{cone of Jordan variations} has non-empty interior and, when $\mathsf G$ is split, establish non-empty interior of the set of \emph{length-normalized variations}. We apply these techniques to pressure forms on Anosov representations and higher-rank Teichm\"uller spaces. We identify an explicit functional $\varphi\in\mathfrak a^*$ whose pressure form is compatible with Goldman's symplectic form at Fuchsian points in the Hitchin component. Finally, we show the degeneration of the Hausdorff dimension of \emph{higher}-quasi-circles is governed by a Diophantine equation.</description>
