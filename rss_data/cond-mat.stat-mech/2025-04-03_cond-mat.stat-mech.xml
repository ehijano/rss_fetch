      <title>Reset Induced Multimodality in Unbounded Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resetting, as a protocol that restarts the evolution of a system, can significantly influence stochastic dynamics. One notable effect is the emergence of stationary states in unbounded potentials, where such states would otherwise be absent without resetting. In this work, we explore unbounded potentials for which resetting not only induces stationary states but also leads to their multimodality, despite the repulsive nature of the potential. We present examples of potentials that, despite lacking local minima, can generate trimodal and pentamodal states, and we investigate how the modal structure of these states varies with noise intensity and resetting frequency.</description>

      <title>Multicriticality in stochastic dynamics protected by self-duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical large deviations (LD) of a class of one-dimensional kinetically constrained models whose (tilted) generators can be mapped into themselves via duality transformations. We consider four representative models in detail: the domain-wall (DW) Fredrickson-Andersen (FA), the DW East, the ZZZ-FA, and the XOR-FA models. Using numerical tensor networks, we build the LD phase diagrams of these models in terms of the softness of the constraint and the counting field conjugate to the dynamical activity. In all cases, we find distinct dynamical phases separated by phase transitions along the self-dual lines, revealing the presence of multi-critical points that delimit first-order from continuous active-inactive transitions. We discuss connections to supersymmetry and possible extensions to higher spin and space dimensions.</description>

      <title>Bayesian critical points in classical lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boltzmann distribution encodes our subjective knowledge of the configuration in a classical lattice model, given only its Hamiltonian. If we acquire further information about the configuration from measurement, our knowledge is updated according to Bayes' theorem. We examine the resulting "conditioned ensembles", finding that they show many new phase transitions and new renormalization-group fixed points. (Similar conditioned ensembles also describe "partial quenches" in which some of the system's degrees of freedom are instantaneously frozen, while the others continue to evolve.) After describing general features of the replica field theories for these problems, we analyze the effect of measurement on illustrative critical systems, including: critical Ising and Potts models, which show surprisingly rich phase diagrams, with RG fixed points at weak, intermediate, and infinite measurement strength; various models involving free fields, XY spins, or flux lines in 2D or 3D; and geometrical models such as polymers or clusters. We make connections with quantum dynamics, in particular with "charge sharpening" in 1D, by giving a formalism for measurement of classical stochastic processes: e.g. we give a purely hydrodynamic derivation of the known effective field theory for charge sharpening. We discuss qualitative differences between RG flows for the above measured systems, described by $N\to 1$ replica limits, and those for disordered systems, described by $N\to 0$ limits. In addition to discussing measurement of critical states, we give a unifying treatment of a family of inference problems for non-critical states. These are related to the Nishimori line in the phase diagram of the random-bond Ising model, and are relevant to various quantum error correction problems. We describe distinct physical interpretations of conditioned ensembles and note interesting open questions.</description>

      <title>Fate of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Paired Phase in Coupled $XY$ Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intriguing phases may emerge when two-dimensional systems are coupled in a bilayer configuration. In particular, a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) paired superfluid phase was predicted and claimed to be numerically observed in a coupled $XY$ model with ferromagnetic interlayer interactions, as reported in [\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.123.100601}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 100601 (2019)}]. However, both our Monte Carlo simulations and analytical analysis show that this model does not exhibit a BKT paired phase. We then propose a new model incorporating four-body interlayer interactions to realize the BKT paired phase. Moreover, we observe that the anomalous magnetic dimension varies along the phase transition line between the disordered normal phase and the BKT paired phase. This finding requires an understanding beyond the conventional phase transition theory.</description>

      <title>Partition function zeros of quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for calculating the Yang-Lee partition function zeros of a translationally invariant model of lattice fermions, exemplified by the Hubbard model. The method rests on a theorem involving the single electron self-energy $\Sigma_\sigma(k, i \omega_n)$ in the imaginary time Matsubara formulation. The theorem maps the Yang-Lee zeros to a set of wavevector and spin labeled virtual energies $\xi_{k \sigma}$. These, thermodynamically derived virtual energies, are solutions of equations involving the self-energy at corresponding $k\sigma$'s. Examples of the method in simplified situations are provided.</description>

      <title>Clustering Does Not Always Imply Latent Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latent space approach to complex networks has revealed fundamental principles and symmetries, enabling geometric methods. However, the conditions under which network topology implies geometricity remain unclear. We provide a mathematical proof and empirical evidence showing that the multiscale self-similarity of complex networks is a crucial factor in implying latent geometry. Using degree-thresholding renormalization, we prove that any random scale-free graph in a $d$-dimensional homogeneous and isotropic manifold is self-similar when interactions are pairwise. Hence, both clustering and self-similarity are required to imply geometricity. Our findings highlight that correlated links can lead to finite clustering without self-similarity, and therefore without inherent latent geometry. The implications are significant for network mapping and ensemble equivalence between graphs and continuous spaces.</description>

      <title>Bio-heat regimes in fractal-based models of tumors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomalous heat diffusion is investigated for biological tissues displaying a fractal structure and long-term thermal memory, which is modeled via a fractional derivative. For increasing values of the fractional derivation order, the tissue temperature displays three kinds of bio-heat regimes: damped (or sub-diffusive), critical damping and under-damped oscillations. The temperature profiles depend on the fractal dimension of the tissue but notably also on a parameter related to its topology: the spectral dimension. The parametric analysis reveals that these two parameters have antagonistic effects on the pseudo period of the temperature oscillations and their amplitudes. We discuss how our results might impact some treatment protocols.</description>

      <title>Role of Riemannian geometry in double-bracket quantum imaginary-time evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double-bracket quantum imaginary-time evolution (DB-QITE) is a quantum algorithm which coherently implements steps in the Riemannian steepest-descent direction for the energy cost function. DB-QITE is derived from Brockett's double-bracket flow which exhibits saddle points where gradients vanish. In this work, we perform numerical simulations of DB-QITE and describe signatures of transitioning through the vicinity of such saddle points. We provide an explicit gate count analysis using quantum compilation programmed in Qrisp.</description>

      <title>Learning and criticality in a self-organizing model of connectome growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exploration of brain networks has reached an important milestone as relatively large and reliable information has been gathered for connectomes of different species. Analyses of connectome data sets reveal that the structural length and the distributions of in- and out-node strengths follow heavy-tailed lognormal statistics, while the functional network properties exhibit powerlaw tails, suggesting that the brain operates close to a critical point where computational capabilities and sensitivity to stimulus is optimal. Because these universal network features emerge from bottom-up (self-)organization, one can pose the question of whether they can be modeled via a common framework, particularly through the lens of criticality of statistical physical systems. Here, we simultaneously reproduce the powerlaw statistics of connectome edge weights and the lognormal distributions of node strengths from an avalanche-type model with learning that operates on baseline networks that mimic the neuronal circuitry. We observe that the avalanches created by a sandpile-like model on simulated neurons connected by a hierarchical modular network (HMN) produce robust powerlaw avalanche size distributions with critical exponents of 3/2 characteristic of neuronal systems. Introducing Hebbian learning, wherein neurons that `fire together, wire together,' recovers the powerlaw distribution of edge weights and the lognormal distributions of node degrees, comparable to those obtained from connectome data. Our results strengthen the notion of a critical brain, one whose local interactions drive connectivity and learning without a need for external intervention and precise tuning.</description>

      <title>Topological Feature of Real-time Fisher Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There are numerous methods to characterize topology and its boundary zero modes, yet their statistical mechanical properties have not received as much attention as other approaches. Here, we investigate the Fisher zeros and thermofield dynamics of topological models, revealing that boundary zero modes can be described by an overlooked real-time Fisher zero pairing effect. This effect is validated in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Kitaev chain model, with the latter exhibiting a Fisher zero braiding picture. Topological zero modes exhibit robustness even when non-Hermiticity is introduced into the system and display characteristics of imaginary-time crystals when the energy eigenvalues are complex. We further examine the real-time Fisher zeros of the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model, which maps to the Kitaev chain. We present a fractal picture of the Fisher zeros, illustrating how interactions eliminate topology. The mechanism of zero-pairing provides a natural statistical mechanical approach to understanding the connection between topology and many-body physics.</description>

Abstract: Rare events play a crucial role in understanding complex systems. Characterizing and analyzing them in scale-invariant situations is challenging due to strong correlations. In this work, we focus on characterizing the tails of probability distribution functions (PDFs) for these systems. Using a variety of methods, perturbation theory, functional renormalization group, hierarchical models, large $n$ limit, and Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate universal rare events of critical $O(n)$ systems. Additionally, we explore the crossover from universal to nonuniversal behavior in PDF tails, extending Cram\'er's series to strongly correlated variables. Our findings highlight the universal and nonuniversal aspects of rare event statistics and challenge existing assumptions about power-law corrections to the leading stretched exponential decay in these tails.</description>

      <title>Nonanalytic Landau functionals shaping the finite-size scaling of fluctuations and response functions in and out of equilibrium</title>

Abstract: Landau theory relates phase transitions to the minimization of the Landau functional (e.g., free energy functional), which is expressed as a power series of the order parameter. It has been shown that the critical behavior of certain physical systems can be described using Landau functionals that include nonanalytic terms, corresponding to odd or even noninteger powers of the absolute value of the order parameter. In particular, these nonanalytic terms can determine the order of the phase transition and the values of the critical exponents. Here, we show that such terms can also shape the finite-size scaling behavior of fluctuations of observables (e.g., of energy or magnetization) or the response functions (e.g., heat capacity or magnetic susceptibility) at the continuous phase transition point. We demonstrate this on two examples, the equilibrium molecular zipper and the nonequilibrium version of the Curie--Weiss model.</description>

Abstract: We study the evolution of a quantum many-body system driven by two competing measurements, which induces a topological entanglement transition between two distinct area law phases. We employ a positive operator-valued measurement with variable coupling between the system and detector within free fermion dynamics. This approach allows us to continuously track the universal properties of the transition between projective and continuous monitoring. Our findings suggest that the percolation universality of the transition in the projective limit is unstable when the system-detector coupling is reduced.</description>

      <title>Memory Kernel Coupling Theory: Obtain Time Correlation Function from Higher-order Moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dynamical observables can often be described by time correlation functions (TCFs). However, efficiently calculating TCFs for complex quantum systems is a significant challenge, which generally requires solving the full dynamics of the systems. This Letter presents the memory kernel coupling theory (MKCT), a general formalism for evaluating TCFs. The MKCT builds upon Mori's memory kernel formalism for TCFs. Our theory further decomposes the memory kernel into auxiliary kernels. Rapid decay of auxiliary kernels allows us to truncate the coupled equations of motion with high accuracy. Notably, only higher-order moments are sufficient as the input for obtaining TCFs. While this formalism is general, we carry out the numerical demonstration for a typical open quantum system--the spin-boson model.</description>

      <title>Approximate inverse measurement channel for shallow shadows</title>

Abstract: Classical shadows are a versatile tool to probe many-body quantum systems, consisting of a combination of randomised measurements and classical post-processing computations. In a recently introduced version of the protocol, the randomization step is performed via unitary circuits of variable depth $t$, defining the so-called shallow shadows. For sufficiently large $t$, this approach allows one to get around the use of non-local unitaries to probe global properties such as the fidelity with respect to a target state or the purity. Still, shallow shadows involve the inversion of a many-body map, the measurement channel, which requires non-trivial computations in the post-processing step, thus limiting its applicability when the number of qubits $N$ is large. In this work, we put forward a simple approximate post-processing scheme where the infinite-depth inverse channel is applied to the finite-depth classical shadows and study its performance for fidelity and purity estimation. The scheme allows for different circuit connectivity, as we illustrate for geometrically local circuits in one and two spatial dimensions and geometrically non-local circuits made of two-qubit gates. For the fidelity, we find that the resulting estimator coincides with a known linear cross-entropy, achieving an arbitrary small approximation error $\delta$ at depth $t=O(\log (N/\delta))$ (independent of the circuit connectivity). For the purity, we show that the estimator becomes accurate at a depth $O(N)$. In addition, at those depths, the variances of both the fidelity and purity estimators display the same scaling with $N$ as in the case of global random unitaries. We establish these bounds by analytic arguments and extensive numerical computations in several cases of interest. Our work extends the applicability of shallow shadows to large system sizes and general circuit connectivity.</description>

Abstract: Biological cells exhibit a hierarchical spatial organization, where various compartments harbor condensates that form by phase separation. Cells can control the emergence of these condensates by affecting compartment size, the amount of the involved molecules, and their physical interactions. While physical interactions directly affect compartment binding and phase separation, they can also cause oligomerization, which has been suggested as a control mechanism. Analyzing an equilibrium model, we illustrate that oligomerization amplifies compartment binding and phase separation, which reinforce each other. This nonlinear interplay can also induce multistability, which provides additional potential for control. Our work forms the basis for deriving thermodynamically consistent kinetic models to understand how biological cells can regulate phase separation in their compartments.</description>

      <title>Momentum-space modulated symmetries in the Luttinger liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chiral Luttinger liquid develops quantum chaos as soon as a -- however slight -- nonlinear dispersion is introduced for the microscopic electronic degrees of freedom. For this nonlinear version of the model, we identify an infinite family of translation-invariant interaction potentials with corresponding modulated symmetries. These symmetries are highly unconventional: they are modulated in momentum space (and do not seem to have an easy physical interpretation). We develop a systematic understanding of these symmetries and study the resulting blocks in the Hamiltonian. In particular, this approach allows us to predict the analytic Hamiltonian block sizes and derive asymptotic scaling laws in the limit of large total momentum. These blocks are reminiscent of Hilbert space fragmentation in that, even though they are labeled by a symmetry, this symmetry is highly nonlocal and does not have a simple interpretation. We corroborate this result by studying entanglement entropy and level statistics.</description>

      <title>Phase vs coin vs position disorder as a probe for the resilience and revival of single particle entanglement in cyclic quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum states exhibiting single-particle entanglement (SPE) can encode and process quantum information more robustly than their multi-particle analogs. Understanding the vulnerability and resilience of SPE to disorder is therefore crucial. This letter investigates phase, coin, and position disorder via discrete-time quantum walks on odd and even cyclic graphs to study their effect on SPE. The reduction in SPE is insignificant for low levels of phase or coin disorder, showing the resilience of SPE to minor perturbations. However, SPE is seen to be more vulnerable to position disorder. We analytically prove that maximally entangled single-particle states (MESPS) at time step $t=1$ are impervious to phase disorder regardless of the choice of the initial state. Further, MESPS at timestep $t=1$ is also wholly immune to coin disorder for phase-symmetric initial states. Position disorder breaks odd-even parity and distorts the physical time cone of the quantum walker, unlike phase or coin disorder. SPE saturates towards a fixed value for position disorder, irrespective of the disorder strength at large timestep $t$. Furthermore, SPE can be enhanced with moderate to significant phase or coin disorder strengths at specific time steps. Interestingly, disorder can revive single-particle entanglement from absolute zero in some instances, too. These results are crucial in understanding single-particle entanglement evolution and dynamics in a lab setting.</description>

      <title>Addendum: Long-range multi-scalar models at three loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We correct the computation of one Feynman diagram in the three-loop beta functions for the long-range quartic multi-scalar model, originally presented in (2020 J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 53 445008) [arXiv:2007.04603]. The correction requires the use of a different method than in the original paper, and we give here full details about the method. We then report the updated numerics for critical exponents of the Ising model, vector model, cubic model and bifundamental model. Mathematica files for the numerical evaluation of the corrected diagram are provided in ancillary.</description>

      <title>Role of electron-electron interaction in the Mpemba effect in quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18456v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect has initially been noticed in macroscopic systems -- namely that hot water can freeze faster than cold water -- but recently its extension to open quantum systems has attracted significant attention. This phenomenon can be explained in the context of nonequilibrium thermodynamics of Markovian systems, relying on the amplitudes of different decay modes of the system dynamics. Here, we study the Mpemba effect in a single-level quantum dot coupled to a thermal bath, highlighting the role of the sign and magnitude of the electron-electron interaction in the occurrence of the Mpemba effect. We gain physical insights into the decay modes from a dissipative symmetry of this system called fermionic duality. Based on this analysis of the relaxation to equilibrium of the dot, we derive criteria for the occurrence of the Mpemba effect using two thermodynamically relevant measures of the distance to equilibrium, the nonequilibrium free energy and the dot energy. We furthermore compare this effect to a possible exponential speedup of the relaxation. Finally, we propose experimentally relevant schemes for the state preparation and explore different ways of observing the Mpemba effect in quantum dots in experiments.</description>

      <title>Modeling biases in binary decision-making within the generalized nonlinear q-voter model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10172v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective decision-making is a process by which a group of individuals determines a shared outcome that shapes societal dynamics; from innovation diffusion to organizational choices. A common approach to model these processes is using binary dynamics, where the choices are reduced to two alternatives. One of the most popular models in this context is the $q$-voter model, which assumes that opinion changes are driven by peer pressure from a unanimous group. However, real-world decisions are also shaped by prior personal choices and external influences, such as mass media, which introduce biases that can favor certain options over others. To address this, we propose a generalized $q$-voter model that incorporates these biases. In our model, when the influence group is not unanimous, the probability that an individual changes its opinion depends on its current state, breaking the symmetry between opinions. In limiting cases, our model recovers both the original $q$-voter model and several recently introduced modifications of the $q$-voter model, while extending the framework to capture a broader range of scenarios. We analyze the model on a complete graph using analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations. Our results highlight two key findings: (1) for larger influence groups ($q&gt;3$), a phase emerges where both adopted and partially adopted states coexist, (2) in small systems, greater initial support for an opinion does not necessarily increase its likelihood of widespread adoption, as reflected in the unique form of the exit probability. These results point to one of the key issues in social science, the importance of group size in collective action.</description>
