      <title>Do SETI Optimists Have a Fine-Tuning Problem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In ecological systems, be it a garden or a galaxy, populations evolve from some initial value (say zero) up to a steady state equilibrium, when the mean number of births and deaths per unit time are equal. This equilibrium point is a function of the birth and death rates, as well as the carrying capacity of the ecological system itself. The growth curve is S-shaped, saturating at the carrying capacity for large birth-to-death rate ratios and tending to zero at the other end. We argue that our astronomical observations appear inconsistent with a cosmos saturated with ETIs, and thus SETI optimists are left presuming that the true population is somewhere along the transitional part of this S-curve. Since the birth and death rates are a-priori unbounded, we argue that this presents a fine-tuning problem. Further, we show that if the birth-to-death rate ratio is assumed to have a log-uniform prior distribution, then the probability distribution of the ecological filling fraction is bi-modal - peaking at zero and unity. Indeed, the resulting distribution is formally the classic Haldane prior, conceived to describe the prior expectation of a Bernoulli experiment, such as a technological intelligence developing (or not) on a given world. Our results formally connect the Drake Equation to the birth-death formalism, the treatment of ecological carrying capacity and their connection to the Haldane perspective.</description>

      <title>LuSEE-Night power requirements and power generation strategy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lunar Surface Electromagnetics Experiment at Night (LuSEE-Night) is a project designed to investigate the feasibility of observing the Cosmic Dark Ages using an instrument on the lunar far-side. LuSEE-Night will measure the redshifted 21 cm transition of neutral hydrogen over a frequency range of 0.1-50 MHz, covering the redshift range 27 &lt; z &lt; 1100. The LuSEE-Night instrument is a radio frequency spectrometer, consisting of four horizontal monopole antennas, arranged to give wide zenith-pointing beams with two orthogonal linear polarizations. This combination of polarization, spectral, and angular sensitivity will be necessary to separate the cosmological signal from significantly stronger foreground emissions. LuSEE-Night will observe in drift scan during lunar night while the moon shields it from radio frequency interference from both the Earth and sun, and will transmit science and telemetry data back to Earth via an orbital relay during the lunar day. LuSEE-Night will have to operate in a challenging environment: its electronics must operate under hard radiation, the instrument must be thermally isolated during the cold 100~K lunar night, and have a thermal rejection path to survive the 390~K daytime temperature, and its photovoltaic and battery systems must provide sufficient power to operate during two weeks of lunar night. Furthermore, the instrument spectrometer must be powered throughout the lunar night using only a 7~kWh battery, due to mass limitations. Here we describe the power generation, storage, and delivery subsystems of the LuSEE-Night instrument, and the simulations which were performed to design the power subsystems and ensure instrument survival and operation throughout the long lunar night. We also describe the Concept of Operations (ConOps) developed for the LuSEE-Night mission, which derives from the power management simulations.</description>

      <title>Real-time adaptive optics control with a high level programming language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive optics systems are usually prototyped in a convenient but slow language like MATLAB or Python, and then re-written from scratch using high-performance C/C++ to perform real-time control. This duplication of effort adds costs and slows the experimentation process. We present instead a technical demonstration of performing real time, sub-millisecond latency control with an adaptive optics system using the high-level Julia programming language. This open-source software demonstrates support for multiple cameras, pixel streaming, and network-transparency distributed computing. Furthermore, it is easy to interface it with other programming languages as desired.</description>

      <title>Using Galaxy Evolution as Source of Physics-Based Ground Truth for Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models producing images have enormous potential to advance discoveries across scientific fields and require metrics capable of quantifying the high dimensional output. We propose that astrophysics data, such as galaxy images, can test generative models with additional physics-motivated ground truths in addition to human judgment. For example, galaxies in the Universe form and change over billions of years, following physical laws and relationships that are both easy to characterize and difficult to encode in generative models. We build a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) and a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and test their ability to generate realistic galaxies conditioned on their redshifts (galaxy ages). This is one of the first studies to probe these generative models using physically motivated metrics. We find that both models produce comparable realistic galaxies based on human evaluation, but our physics-based metrics are better able to discern the strengths and weaknesses of the generative models. Overall, the DDPM model performs better than the CVAE on the majority of the physics-based metrics. Ultimately, if we can show that generative models can learn the physics of galaxy evolution, they have the potential to unlock new astrophysical discoveries.</description>

      <title>Laboratory demonstration of an all-fiber-based focal plane nulling interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starlight suppression techniques for High-Contrast Imaging (HCI) are crucial to achieving the demanding contrast ratios and inner working angles required for detecting and characterizing exoplanets with a wide range of masses and separations. The advent of photonic technologies provides new opportunities to control the amplitude and phase characteristics of light, with the potential to enhance and control starlight suppression. Here, we present a focal plane optical-fiber-based nulling interferometer working with commercially available components for amplitude and phase modulation. The instrument implements single-mode fiber-coupled elements: a MEMS variable optical attenuator (VOA) matches the on-axis and off-axis starlight amplitude, while a piezoelectric-driven fiber stretcher modifies the optical path difference between the channels to achieve the $\pi$ phase shift condition for destructive interference. We show preliminary lab results using a narrowband light source working at 632 nm and discuss future opportunities for testing on-sky with the Astrophotonics Advancement Platform at Lick Observatory (APALO) at the Shane 3-m Telescope.</description>

      <title>ler : LVK (LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration) event (compact-binary mergers) rate calculator and simulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: '$ler$' is a statistics-based Python package specifically designed for computing detectable rates of both lensed and unlensed GW events, catering to the requirements of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Scientific Collaboration and astrophysics research scholars. The core functionality of '$ler$' intricately hinges upon the interplay of various components which include sampling the properties of compact-binary sources, lens galaxies characteristics, solving lens equations to derive properties of resultant images, and computing detectable GW rates. This comprehensive functionality builds on the leveraging of array operations and linear algebra from the $numpy$ library, enhanced by interpolation methods from $scipy$ and Python's $multiprocessing$ capabilities. Efficiency is further boosted by the $numba$ library's Just-In-Time ($njit$) compilation, optimizing extensive numerical computations and employing the inverse transform sampling method to replace more cumbersome rejection sampling. The modular design of '$ler$' not only optimizes speed and functionality but also ensures adaptability and upgradability, supporting the integration of additional statistics as research evolves. Currently, '$ler$' is an important tool in generating simulated GW events, both lensed and unlensed, and provides astrophysically accurate distributions of event-related parameters for both detectable and non-detectable events. This functionality aids in event validation and enhances the forecasting of detection capabilities across various GW detectors to study such events. The architecture of the '$ler$' API facilitates seamless compatibility with other software packages, allowing researchers to integrate and utilize its functionalities based on specific scientific requirements.</description>

      <title>Intensity-sensitive quality assessment of extended sources in astronomical images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio astronomy studies the Universe by observing the radio emissions of celestial bodies. Different methods can be used to recover the sky brightness distribution (SBD), which describes the distribution of celestial sources from recorded data, with the output dependent on the method used. Image quality assessment (IQA) indexes can be used to compare the differences between restored SBDs produced by different image reconstruction techniques to evaluate the effectiveness of different techniques. However, reconstructed images (for the same SBD) can appear to be very similar, especially when observed by the human visual system (HVS). Hence current structural similarity methods, inspired by the HVS, are not effective. In the past, we have proposed two methods to assess point source images, where low amounts of concentrated information are present in larger regions of noise-like data. But for images that include extended source(s), the increase in complexity of the structure makes the IQA methods for point sources over-sensitive since the important objects cannot be described by isolated point sources. Therefore, in this article we propose augmented Low-Information Similarity Index (augLISI), an improved version of LISI, to assess images including extended source(s). Experiments have been carried out to illustrate how this new IQA method can help with the development and study of astronomical imaging techniques. Note that although we focus on radio astronomical images herein, these IQA methods are also applicable to other astronomical images, and imaging techniques.</description>

      <title>Rapid Parameter Estimation for Merging Massive Black Hole Binaries Using ODE-Based Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting the coalescences of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) is one of the primary targets for space-based gravitational wave observatories such as LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin. The fast and accurate parameter estimation of merging MBHBs is of great significance for both astrophysics and the global fitting of all resolvable sources. However, such analyses entail significant computational costs. To address these challenges, inspired by the latest progress in generative models, we proposed a novel artificial intelligence (AI) based parameter estimation method called Variance Preserving Flow Matching Posterior Estimation (VPFMPE). Specifically, we utilize triangular interpolation to maintain variance over time, thereby constructing a transport path for training continuous normalization flows. Compared to the simple linear interpolation method used in flow matching to construct the optimal transport path, our approach better captures continuous temporal variations, making it more suitable for the parameter estimation of MBHBs. Additionally, we creatively introduce a parameter transformation method based on the symmetry in the detector's response function. This transformation is integrated within VPFMPE, allowing us to train the model using a simplified dataset, and then perform parameter estimation on more general data, hence also acting as a crucial factor in improving the training speed. In conclusion, for the first time, within a comprehensive and reasonable parameter range, we have achieved a complete and unbiased 11-dimensional rapid inference for MBHBs in the presence of astrophysical confusion noise using ODE-based generative models. In the experiments based on simulated data, our model produces posterior distributions comparable to those obtained by nested sampling.</description>

      <title>Across the soft gamma-ray regime: utilizing simultaneous detections in the Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) and the Background and Transient Observer (BTO) to understand astrophysical transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a NASA funded Small Explorer (SMEX) mission slated to launch in 2027. COSI will house a wide-field gamma-ray telescope designed to survey the entire sky in the 0.2--5 MeV range. Using germanium detectors, the instrument will provide imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetry of astrophysical sources with excellent energy resolution and degree-scale localization capabilities. In addition to the main instrument, COSI will fly with a student collaboration project known as the Background and Transient Observer (BTO). BTO will extend the COSI bandpass to energies lower than 200 keV, thus enabling spectral analysis across the shared band of 30 keV--2 MeV range. The BTO instrument will consist of two NaI scintillators and student-designed readout electronics. Using spectral information from both the COSI and BTO instruments, physics such as the energy peak turnover in gamma-ray bursts, the characteristics of magnetar flares, and the event frequency of a range of transient phenomena will be constrained. In this paper, we present the expected science returnables from BTO and comment on the shared returnables from the COSI and BTO missions. We include simulations of gamma-ray bursts, magnetar giant flares, and terrestrial gamma-ray flashes using BTO's spectral response. Additionally, we estimate BTO's gamma-ray burst detection rate and find that BTO will detect ~150 gamma-ray bursts per year, with most of these events being long bursts.</description>

      <title>Targeting low micro-roughness for 3D printed aluminium mirrors using a hot isostatic press</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing (AM; 3D printing) in aluminium using laser powder bed fusion provides a new design space for lightweight mirror production. Printing layer-by-layer enables the use of intricate lattices for mass reduction, as well as organic shapes generated by topology optimisation, resulting in mirrors optimised for function as opposed to subtractive machining. However, porosity, a common AM defect, is present in printed aluminium and it is a result of the printing environment being either too hot or too cold, or gas entrapped bubbles within the aluminium powder. When present in an AM mirror substrates, porosity manifests as pits on the reflective surface, which increases micro-roughness and therefore scattered light. There are different strategies to reduce the impact of porosity: elimination during printing, coating the aluminium print in nickel phosphorous, or to apply a heat and pressure treatment to close the pores, commonly known as a hot isostatic press (HIP).
  This paper explores the application of HIP on printed aluminium substrates intended for mirror production using single point diamond turning (SPDT). The objective of the HIP is to reduce porosity whilst targeting a small grain growth within the aluminium, which is important in allowing the SPDT to generate surfaces with low micro-roughness. For this study, three disks, 50 mm diameter by 5 mm, were printed in AlSi10Mg at 0 deg, 45 deg, and 90 deg with respect to the build plate. X-ray computed tomography (XCT) was conducted before and after the HIP cycle to confirm the effectiveness of HIP to close porosity. The disks were SPDT and the micro-roughness evaluated. Mechanical testing and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) was used to quantify the mechanical strength and the grain size after HIP.</description>

      <title>Estimation of the lateral mis-registrations of the GRAVITY + adaptive optics system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The GRAVITY+ upgrade implies a complete renewal of its adaptive optics (AO) systems. Its complex design, featuring moving components between the deformable mirrors and the wavefront sensors, requires the monitoring and auto-calibrating of the lateral mis-registrations of the system while in operation. Aims. For preset and target acquisition, large lateral registration errors must be assessed in open loop to bring the system to a state where the AO loop closes. In closed loop, these errors must be monitored and corrected, without impacting the science. Methods. With respect to the first requirement, our method is perturbative, with two-dimensional modes intentionally applied to the system and correlated to a reference interaction matrix. For the second requirement, we applied a non-perturbative approach that searches for specific patterns in temporal correlations in the closed loop telemetry. This signal is produced by the noise propagation through the AO loop. Results. Our methods were validated through simulations and on the GRAVITY+ development bench. The first method robustly estimates the lateral mis-registrations, in a single fit and with a sub-subaperture resolution while in an open loop. The second method is not absolute, but it does successfully bring the system towards a negligible mis-registration error, with a limited turbulence bias. Both methods proved to robustly work on a system still under development and not fully characterised. Conclusions. Tested with Shack-Hartmann wavefront sensors, the proposed methods are versatile and easily adaptable to other AO instruments, such as the pyramid, which stands as a baseline for all future AO systems. The non-perturbative method, not relying on an interaction matrix model and being sparse in the Fourier domain, is particularly suitable to the next generation of AO systems for extremely large telescopes that will present an unprecedented level of complexity and numbers of actuators.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Criteria for Defining Planets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The current IAU definition of "planet" is problematic because it is vague and excludes exoplanets. Here, we describe aspects of quantitative planetary taxonomy and examine the results of unsupervised clustering of Solar System bodies to guide the development of possible classification frameworks. Two unsurprising conclusions emerged from the clustering analysis: (1) satellites are distinct from planets and (2) dynamical dominance is a natural organizing principle for planetary taxonomy. To generalize an existing dynamical dominance criterion, we adopt a universal clearing timescale applicable to all central bodies (brown dwarfs, stars, and stellar remnants). Then, we propose two quantitative, unified frameworks to define both planets and exoplanets. The first framework is aligned with both the IAU definition of planet in the Solar System and the IAU working definition of an exoplanet. The second framework is a simpler mass-based framework that avoids some of the difficulties ingrained in current IAU recommendations.</description>

      <title>New Gravitational Wave Discoveries Enabled by Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves has revolutionized our understanding of the universe, offering unprecedented insights into its dynamics. A major goal of gravitational wave data analysis is to speed up the detection and parameter estimation process using machine learning techniques, in light of an anticipated surge in detected events that would render traditional methods impractical. Here, we present the first detections of new gravitational-wave candidate events in data from a network of interferometric detectors enabled by machine learning. We discuss several new enhancements of our ResNet-based deep learning code, AresGW, that increased its sensitivity, including a new hierarchical classification of triggers, based on different noise and frequency filters. The enhancements resulted in a significant reduction in the false alarm rate, allowing AresGW to surpass traditional pipelines in the number of detected events in its effective training range (single source masses between 7 and 50 solar masses and source chirp masses between 10 and 40 solar masses), when the new detections are included. We calculate the astrophysical significance of events detected with AresGW using a logarithmic ranking statistic and injections into O3 data. Furthermore, we present spectrograms, parameter estimation, and reconstruction in the time domain for our new candidate events and discuss the distribution of their properties. In addition, the AresGW code exhibited very good performance when tested across various two-detector setups and on observational data from the O1 and O2 observing periods. Our findings underscore the remarkable potential of AresGW as a fast and sensitive detection algorithm for gravitational-wave astronomy, paving the way for a larger number of future discoveries.</description>

      <title>In-field phasing at the upgraded GMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06741</link>

Abstract: In time-domain radio astronomy with arrays, voltages from individual antennas are added together with proper delay and fringe correction to form the beam in real-time. In order to achieve the correct phased addition of antenna voltages one has to also correct for the ionospheric and instrumental gains. Conventionally this is done using observations of a calibrator source located near to the target field. This scheme is sub-optimal since it does not correct for the variation of the gains with time and position in the sky. Further, since the ionospheric phase variation is typically most rapid at the longest baselines, the most distant antennas are often excluded while forming the beam. We present here a different methodology ("in-field phasing"), in which the gains are obtained in real-time using a model of the intensity distribution in the target field, which overcomes all of these drawbacks. We present observations with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) which demonstrates that in-field phasing does lead to a significant improvement in sensitivity. We also show, using observations of the millisecond pulsar J1120$-$3618 that this in turn leads to a significant improvement of measurements of the Dispersion Measure and Time of Arrival. Finally, we present test observations of the GMRT discovered eclipsing black widow pulsar J1544+4937 showing that in-field phasing leads to improvement in the measurement of the cut-off frequency of the eclipse.</description>

      <title>Turbulence revealed by wavelet transform: power spectrum and intermittency for the velocity field of the cosmic baryonic fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use continuous wavelet transform techniques to construct the global and environment-dependent wavelet statistics, such as energy spectrum and kurtosis, to study the fluctuation and intermittency of the turbulent motion in the cosmic fluid velocity field with the IllustrisTNG simulation data. We find that the peak scales of the energy spectrum and the spectral ratio define two characteristic scales, which can be regarded as the integral scale and the dissipation scale of turbulence, respectively, so that the energy spectrum can be divided into the energy-containing range, the inertial range and the dissipation range of turbulence. The wavelet kurtosis is an increasing function of the wavenumber $k$, first grows rapidly then slowly with $k$, indicating that the cosmic fluid becomes increasingly intermittent with $k$. In the energy-containing range, the energy spectrum increases significantly from $z = 2$ to $1$, but remains almost unchanged from $z = 1$ to $0$. We find that both the environment-dependent spectrum and kurtosis are similar to the global ones, and the magnitude of the spectrum is smallest in the lowest-density and largest in the highest-density environment, suggesting that the cosmic fluid is more turbulent in a high-density than in a low-density environment. In the inertial range, the energy spectrum's exponent is steeper than both the Kolmogorov and Burgers exponents, indicating more efficient energy transfer compared to Kolmogorov or Burgers turbulence.</description>

      <title>Actuation system of the inertial sensor for high-precision space missions using torsion pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision space inertial sensors are imperative to Earth geodesy missions, gravitational wave observations and several fundamental physics experiments in space. In these missions, the residual acceleration noise of the test mass(TM) caused by the forces from inertial sensor components and environment is supposed to be kept below a certain level. As a number of forces contributing to residual acceleration are related to actuation system, developing a precise actuation system to exclude any erroneous force and obtain an ultra sensitive value for TM acceleration noise is necessary and essential. However, it is difficult to test the actuation system on ground. In this paper, a torsion pendulum is established to test the influence of actuation system on TM torque noise and a closed-loop control system combined torsion pendulum and parts of actuation modules is designed to assess the performance of actuation control algorithm. The experimental results show that the parameters in an actuation system will introduce additional torque noise and the maximum noise can reach as much as 10^{-13}Nm /Hz^{1/2} at 1 mHz. The stable tracking error for the closed-loop system is about 10^{-7}, indicating that the combination system achieves good tracking performance and robustness for TM rotation control in different conditions of inertial sensors.</description>
