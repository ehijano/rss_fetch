      <title>Deep learning of committor for ion dissociation and interpretable analysis of solvent effects using atom-centered symmetry functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The association and dissociation of ion pairs in water are fundamental to physical chemistry, yet their reaction coordinates are complex, involving not only interionic distance but also solvent-mediated hydration structures. These processes are often represented by free-energy landscapes constructed from collective variables (CVs), such as interionic distance and water bridging structures; however, it remains uncertain whether such representations reliably capture the transition pathways between the two associated and dissociated states. In this study, we employ deep learning to identify reaction coordinates for NaCl ion pair association and dissociation in water, using the committor as a quantitative measure of progress along the transition pathway through the transition state. The solvent environment surrounding the ions is encoded through descriptors based on atom-centered symmetry functions (ACSFs), which serve as input variables for the neural network. In addition, an explainable artificial intelligence technique is applied to identify ACSFs that contribute to the reaction coordinate. A comparative analysis of their correlation with CVs representing water bridging structures, such as interionic water density and the number of water molecules coordinating both ions, further provides a molecular-level interpretation of the ion association-dissociation mechanism in water.</description>

      <title>A State-Space-View of Atom-Diatom Reactions Relevant to Rarefied Gas Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A microscopically resolved picture of energy flow in atom-diatom collisions is essential for understanding the non-equilibrium chemistry in rarefied and hypersonic gas flow. Here, a comprehensive ensemble of quasi-classical trajectories on global, reactive, and ``vetted'' potential energy surfaces are employed to construct state-resolved probability maps and to determine the dependence of the outcomes on the initial ro-vibrational states $(v,j)$. The full range of processes, including elastic, inelastic, atom exchange, reactive, and atomization are quantified, revealing distinct structure reactivity relationships. For the [OOO] system consistent trends are obtained from two high-quality potential energy surfaces, despite their different electronic structure and representation techniques. The resulting state-space description provides a comprehensive picture of energy redistribution in high-energy atom-diatom collisions, forming a basis for improved modeling of non-equilibrium chemistry in hypersonic and rarefied environments.</description>

      <title>Dark-State-Mediated Efficient Energy Trapping in a Model GFP Chromophore</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The functional properties of photoactive proteins are governed by the interplay between bright and dark excited states. While the bright states are well-studied, the dark states, which are fundamental to photostability and light harvesting, are notoriously difficult to characterize. Here, we report the direct observation and full characterization of an optically dark, low-lying singlet excited state in the isolated anion of the meta green fluorescent protein (GFP) chromophore. Using a combination of ultrafast time-resolved action-absorption and photoelectron spectroscopy, we have captured the formation of this state in 100 fs and measured its remarkably long lifetime of 94 ps. We unambiguously assign its charge-transfer character and reveal the precise trapping mechanism through high-level ab initio calculations. Our findings uncover a photoprotective mechanism in biomolecular anions where ultrafast internal conversion quenches electron emission, stabilizing long-lived electronic excitation even when the energy exceeds the electron detachment threshold.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent ab__initio molecular-orbital decomposition for high-harmonic generation spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a real-time time-dependent ab__initio approach within a configuration-interaction-singles ansatz to decompose the high-harmonic generation (HHG) signal of molecules in terms of individual molecular-orbital (MO) contributions. Calculations have been performed by propagating the time-dependent Schr{\"o}dinger equation with complex energies, in order to account for ionization of the system, and by using tailored Gaussian basis sets for high-energy and continuum states. We have studied the strong-field electron dynamics and the HHG spectra in aligned CO2 and H2O molecules. Contribution from MOs in the strong-field dynamics depends on the interplay between the MO ionization energy and the coupling between the MO and the laser-pulse symmetries. Such contributions characterize different portions of the HHG spectrum, indicating that the orbital decomposition encodes nontrivial information on the modulation of the strong-field dynamics. Our results correctly reproduce the MO contributions to HHG for CO2 as described in the literature experimental and theoretical data and lead to an original analysis of the role of the highest occupied molecular orbitals HOMO, HOMO-1, and HOMO-2 of H2O according to the polarization direction of the laser pulse.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Dependent Polarization Propagator Calculation for Quantum Dots Using Optimized Inverse Krylov Subspace and Folded-Spectrum Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the frequency response of quantum dots under electromagnetic radiation is essential for investigating absorption spectra, excitonic effects, and nonlinear optical behavior in quantum dots and semiconductor nanoparticles. The polarization propagator provides a rigorous framework for evaluating these properties, but its construction is computationally demanding. Challenges arise from the level of electron correlation, the size of the excitonic basis, and the cost of evaluating two-electron integrals. This work addresses these difficulties by developing first- and second-order frequency-dependent polarization propagator calculations for PbS and CdS quantum dots. The propagator is formulated using the electron propagator approach and expressed as the resolvent of the Hamiltonian superoperator. Light-matter interaction is treated using the dipole approximation and represented in a particle-hole excitation operator basis. The correlated ground state is treated at the MP2 level, and all response-matrix terms up to second order in the fluctuating potential are included. A frequency-dependent inverse Krylov subspace method is derived and combined with the folded-spectrum technique to isolate excitation energies within a chosen frequency window. This strategy avoids full diagonalization of the response matrix and significantly reduces computational cost for large systems. The method is implemented in a matrix-free manner in which no explicit response matrix is assembled, and all operations rely on matrix-vector products. UV-VIS excitation spectra of PbS and CdS quantum dots were computed, demonstrating that the inverse Krylov subspace projection approach provides an efficient and accurate approximation for excitation spectra when full diagonalization is computationally prohibitive.</description>

      <title>Parallel accelerated electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy using diamond sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center can serve as a magnetic sensor for electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements. Benefiting from its atomic size, the diamond chip can integrate a tremendous amount of NV centers to improve the magnetic-field sensitivity. However, EPR spectroscopy using NV ensembles is less efficient due to inhomogeneities in both sensors and targets. Spectral line broadening induced by ensemble averaging is even detrimental to spectroscopy. Here we show a kind of cross-relaxation EPR spectroscopy at zero field, where the sensor is tuned by an amplitude-modulated control field to match the target. The modulation makes detection robust to the sensor's inhomogeneity, while zero-field EPR is naturally robust to the target's inhomogeneity. We demonstrate an efficient EPR measurement on an ensemble of roughly 30000 NV centers. Our method shows the ability to not only acquire unambiguous EPR spectra of free radicals, but also monitor their spectroscopic dynamics in real time.</description>

      <title>Routes of Transport in the Path Integral Lindblad Dynamics through State-to-State Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analyzing routes of transport for open quantum systems with non-equilibrium initial conditions is extremely challenging. The state-to-state approach [A. Bose, and P.L. Walters, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2023, 19, 15, 4828-4836] has proven to be a useful method for understanding transport mechanisms in quantum systems interacting with dissipative thermal baths, and has been recently extended to non-Hermitian systems to account for empirical loss. These non-Hermitian descriptions are, however, not capable of describing empirical processes of more general nature, including but not limited to a variety of pumping processes. We extend the state-to-state analysis to account for Lindbladian descriptions of generic dissipative, pumping and decohering processes acting on a system which is exchanging energy with a thermal bath. This Lindblad state-to-state method can elucidate routes of transport in systems coupled to a bath and additionally acted upon by Lindblad jump operators. The method is demonstrated using examples of excitonic aggregates subject to incoherent pumping and draining processes. Using this new state-to-state formalism, we demonstrate the establishment of steady-state excitonic currents across molecular aggregates, yielding a different first-principles approach to quantifying the same.</description>

      <title>Exact Screening-Ranged Expansions for Many-Body Electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09421v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact many-body framework for electrostatic interactions among $N$ arbitrarily charged spheres in an electrolyte, modeled by the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation. Building on a spectral analysis of nonstandard Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators introduced in a companion mathematical work~\cite{supplem_pre_math}, we construct convergent screening-ranged series for the potential, interaction energy, and forces, where each term is associated with a well-defined Debye--H\"uckel screening order and can be obtained evaluating an analytical expression rather than numerically solving an infinitely dimensional linear system. This formulation unifies and extends classical and recent approaches, providing a rigorous basis for electrostatic interactions among heterogeneously charged particles (including Janus colloids) and yielding many-body generalizations of analytical closed-form results previously available only for two-body systems. The framework captures and clarifies complex effects such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, and like-charge attraction, which remain largely analytically elusive in existing treatments. Beyond its fundamental significance, the method leads to numerically efficient schemes, offering a versatile tool for modeling colloids and soft/biological matter in electrolytic solution.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of $\gamma$-Belite(010)-Water Interfaces with High-Dimensional Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Belite -- dicalcium silicate Ca$_2$SiO$_4$ -- is a main constituent of low-carbon cement. In this work, we study several terminations of the (010) surface of $\gamma$-belite, its most stable polymorph, by molecular dynamics simulations. The energies and forces are provided by a high-dimensional neural network potential trained to density functional theory data. Water can interact in molecular form as well as dissociatively with the investigated interfaces, and the degree of dissociation is determined primarily by the protonation of SiO$_4$ groups accessible at the surface. A major part of the simultaneously formed hydroxide ions is adsorbed at surface calcium atoms, whose octahedral coordination spheres are completed by additional water molecules. The T3 termination, which is most stable in vacuum, shows only little reactivity in water. For the only slightly less stable T2 termination, however, two distinct types of surface defects are observed. The type I defect is even stable in vacuum and leads to a reconstruction of the entire surface, while the type II defect is only found in the presence of water. Overall, our results suggest that a variety of structures may be formed at the Ca$_2$SiO$_4$(010) surface, which are stabilized in the presence of water.</description>

      <title>Rotational excitation of molecules in the regime of strong ro-vibrational coupling: Comparison between an optical centrifuge and a transform-limited pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate theoretically the ability of an optical centrifuge - a laser pulse whose linear polarization is rotating at an accelerated rate, to control molecular rotation in the regime when the rigid-rotor approximation breaks down due to coupling between the vibrational and rotational degrees of freedom. Our analysis demonstrates that the centrifuge field enables controlled excitation of high rotational states while maintaining relatively low spread along the vibrational coordinate. We contrast this to the rotational excitation by a linearly polarized Gaussian pulse of equal spectral width and pulse energy which, although comparable to the centrifuge-induced rotation, is unavoidably accompanied by a substantial broadening of the vibrational wavepacket.</description>

      <title>Modified Marrone-Treanor model: parameterization and benchmarking for five-species air</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present updated parameters for five-species air (N2, O2, NO, N and O) reactions to be used with the Modified Marrone-Treanor two-temperature model. The vibrational relaxation and chemical reaction rates are derived from quasiclassical trajectory calculations and direct molecular simulations using ab initio potential energy surfaces. The resulting model enables efficient computational fluid dynamics simulations of nonequilibrium air chemistry in hypersonic flows. We show that the model reproduces direct molecular simulation benchmark solutions with high accuracy in zero-dimensional heat baths representative of strong nonequilibrium post-shock conditions. The model's analytical expressions for dissociation rate coefficient and vibrational energy change per reaction ensure that the correct amount of energy is transferred between the vibrational and trans-rotational modes. Detailed balance is imposed for three-body recombination reactions and our simulations exhibit quasi-steady-state dissociation rates and proper approach to thermochemical equilibrium. In direct comparison with the Park TTv model, the Modified Marrone-Treanor model predicts significantly slower conversion of N2 into N below 10000 K and significantly more NO production at all temperatures. This is likely due to its significantly higher Zeldovich reaction rates compared to Park.</description>

      <title>DeepMech: A Machine Learning Framework for Chemical Reaction Mechanism Prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Prediction of complete step-by-step chemical reaction mechanisms (CRMs) remains a major challenge. Whereas the traditional approaches in CRM tasks rely on expert-driven experiments or costly quantum chemical computations, contemporary deep learning (DL) alternatives ignore key intermediates and mechanistic steps and often suffer from hallucinations. We present DeepMech, an interpretable graph-based DL framework employing atom- and bond-level attention, guided by generalized templates of mechanistic operations (TMOps), to generate CRMs. Trained on our curated ReactMech dataset (~30K CRMs with 100K atom-mapped and mass-balanced elementary steps), DeepMech achieves 98.98+/-0.12% accuracy in predicting elementary steps and 95.94+/-0.21% in complete CRM tasks, besides maintaining high fidelity even in out-of-distribution scenarios as well as in predicting side and/or byproducts. Extension to multistep CRMs relevant to prebiotic chemistry, demonstrates the ability of DeepMech in effectively reconstructing 2 pathways from simple primordial substrates to complex biomolecules such as serine and aldopentose. Attention analysis identifies reactive atoms/bonds in line with chemical intuition, rendering our model interpretable and suitable for reaction design.</description>

      <title>WTMAD-4: A Fair Weighting Scheme for GMTKN55</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The GMTKN55 data set is a collection of standard benchmarks used in molecular quantum chemistry that spans small- and large-molecule thermochemistry, reaction barriers, and non-covalent interactions. Herein, we identify a flaw in the weighted mean absolute deviation (WTMAD) definitions commonly used to quantify performance of various electronic-structure methods for the GMTKN55 set, which under-weight some of its component benchmarks by orders of magnitude. A new WTMAD-4 metric is proposed, based on typical errors observed for a set of ten minimally empirical dispersion-corrected density-functional approximations (DFAs), ensuring fair treatment across all benchmarks. The performance of 115 DFAs is then reassessed using WTMAD-4 and we highlight a literature example where a DFA parametrised by minimising WTMAD-2 underperforms for benchmarks marginalised by that metric.</description>

      <title>Enhancing NMR Shielding Predictions of Atoms-in-Molecules Machine Learning Models with Neighborhood-Informed Representations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) shielding with machine learning (ML) models remains a central challenge for data-driven spectroscopy. We present atomic variants of the Coulomb matrix (aCM) and bag-of-bonds (aBoB) descriptors, and extend them using radial basis functions (RBFs) to yield smooth, per-atom representations (aCM-RBF, aBoB-RBF). Local structural information is incorporated by augmenting each atomic descriptor with contributions from the n nearest neighbors, resulting in the family of descriptors, aCM-RBF(n) and aBoB-RBF(n). For 13C shielding prediction on the QM9NMR dataset (831,925 shielding values across 130,831 molecules), aBoB-RBF(4) achieves an out-of-sample mean error of 1.69 ppm, outperforming models reported in previous studies. While explicit three-body descriptors further reduce errors at a higher cost, aBoB-RBF(4) offers the best balance of accuracy and efficiency. Benchmarking on external datasets comprising larger molecules (GDBm, Drug12/Drug40, and pyrimidinone derivatives) confirms the robustness and transferability of aBoB-RBF(4), establishing it as a practical tool for ML-based NMR shielding prediction.</description>

Abstract: A simple 4th order propagator [Ture and Jang, {\it J. Phys. Chem. A.} {\bf 128}, 2871 (2024)] based on the Magnus expansion (ME) is extended to the Liouville space for both closed-system and Lindbladian open-system quantum dynamics. For both dynamics, commutator free versions of 4th order propagators are provided as well. These propagators are then applied to the dynamics of a driven $\Lambda$-system, where Lindblad terms represent the effect of a photonic bath. For both dynamics, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) for the matter-radiation interaction is assessed. We confirmed reasonable performance of RWA for weak and resonant fields. However, small errors appear for moderate fields and substantial errors can be found for strong fields where coherent population trapping can still be expected. We also found that the presence of bath for open system quantum dynamics consistently reduces the errors of the RWA. These results provide a quantitative information on how the RWA breaks down beyond weak field or for non-resonant cases. Major results are benchmarked against results of our 6th order ME-based propagator. We also provide numerical comparison of our algorithms with other 4th order algorithms for the $\Lambda$-system. These confirm reasonable performance of out simple propagators and the improvement gained through commutator-free expressions.</description>

      <title>Minimising the Demand for High-Fidelity Training Data towards Chemically Accurate Adsorption Energy Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adsorption energy is a critical descriptor for high-throughput screening of heterogeneous catalysts and electrode materials. However, precise experimental data are scarce due to the complexity of experiments, while high-fidelity density functional theory (DFT) calculations remain computationally expensive for large-scale material screening. Machine learning models trained on DFT data have emerged as a promising alternative but face challenges such as functional dependency and limited high-fidelity labelled data. Herein, we present DOS Transformer for Adsorption (DOTA), a functional-independent deep learning model established on the map between local density of states (LDOS) and adsorption energy. DOTA integrates multi-head self-attention mechanisms with LDOS feature engineering to capture latent orbital interaction patterns, enabling it to unify multi-fidelity and multi-source data. This minimises the demand for high-fidelity training data. Consequently, the predictive adsorption energy could reach chemical accuracy, requiring less than five high-fidelity experimental adsorption energies for model training. DOTA also resolves long-standing challenges, such as the "CO puzzle", and outperforms traditional theories, including the d-band centre and Fermi softness models. It provides a robust framework for efficient catalyst and electrode screening, bridging the gap between computational and experimental data.</description>
