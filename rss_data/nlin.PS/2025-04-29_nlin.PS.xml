      <title>Anti-localization of non-stationary quasi-waves in a $\beta$-FPUT chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a new general wave phenomenon, namely "the anti-localization of non-stationary linear waves", has been introduced and discussed. This is zeroing of the propagating component for a non-stationary wave-field near a defect in infinitely long wave-guides. The phenomenon is known to be observed in both continuum and discrete mechanical systems with a defect, provided that the frequency spectrum for the corresponding homogeneous system possesses a stop-band. In this paper, we show that the anti-localization is also quite common for nonlinear systems. To demonstrate this, we numerically solve several non-stationary problems for an infinite $\beta$-FPUT chain with a defect.</description>

      <title>Phase-locking in dynamical systems and quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we discuss the Prufer transform that connects the dynamical system on the torus and the Hill equation, which is interpreted as either the equation of motion for the parametric oscillator or the Schrodinger equation with periodic potential. The structure of phase-locking domains in the dynamical system on torus is mapped into the band-gap structure of the Hill equation. For the parametric oscillator, we provide the relation between the non-adiabatic Hannay angle and the Poincare rotation number of the corresponding dynamical system. In terms of quantum mechanics, the integer rotation number is connected to the quantization number via the Milne quantization approach and exact WKB. Using recent results concerning the exact WKB approach in quantum mechanics, we discuss the possible non-perturbative effects in the dynamical systems on the torus and for parametric oscillator. The semiclassical WKB is interpreted in the framework of a slow-fast dynamical system. The link between the classification of the coadjoint Virasoro orbits and the Hill equation yields a classification of the phase-locking domains in the parameter space in terms of the classification of Virasoro orbits. Our picture is supported by numerical simulations for the model of the Josephson junction and Mathieu equation.</description>

      <title>Integrable black hole dynamics in the asymptotic structure of AdS$_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work deepens the study of integrable asymptotic symmetries for AdS$_{3}$. They are given by an infinite set of integrable nonlinear equations known as the Ablowitz-Kaup-Newell-Segur (AKNS) hierarchy, characterized by an also infinite set of abelian conserved charges. We present their field-dependent Killing vectors and the computation of the canonical charges associated to the asymptotic metric, together with their corresponding charge algebra. We study black hole thermodynamics and show that the temperature for stationary black holes falling in the AKNS asymptotics is always constant, even in the case where the solutions are not axisymmetric. This is related to the existence of a hyperelliptic curve, which appears as a fundamental object in many integrable systems. We also present a special solution associated with the Korteweg-de Vries equation, that is a particular case of the AKNS integrable hierarchy. It is presented in the form of a periodic soliton leading to a cnoidal KdV black hole, whose temperature is characterized by two copies of hyperelliptic curves.</description>

      <title>Turing pattern theory on homogeneous and heterogeneous higher-order temporal network system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes on networked systems have received mounting attention in the past two decades, and the corresponding theory of network dynamics has been continuously enriched with the advancement of network science. Recently, time-varying features and many-body interactions have been discovered on various and numerous real-world networks, such as biological and social systems, and the study of contemporary network science has gradually moved away from historically static network frameworks that are based on pairwise interactions. We aim to propose a general and rudimentary framework for Turing instability of reaction-diffusion processes on higher-order temporal networks. Firstly, we define a brand Laplacian to depict higher-order temporal diffusion behaviors on networks. Furthermore, the general form of higher-order temporal reaction-diffusion systems with frequency of oscillation is defined, and a time-independent and concise form is obtained by equivalent substitution and method of averaging. Next, we discuss the two cases of homogeneous and heterogeneous network systems and give equivalent conditions of Turing instability through linear stability analysis. Finally, in the numerical simulation part, we verify and discuss the validity of the above theoretical framework and study the effect of the frequency of oscillation of higher-order temporal networks on reaction-diffusion processes. Our study has revealed that higher-order temporal reaction-diffusion, which takes into account both time-varying feature and many-body interactions, can formulate innovative and diverse patterns. Moreover, there are significant differences between patterns in continuous space and patterns on traditional networks.</description>
