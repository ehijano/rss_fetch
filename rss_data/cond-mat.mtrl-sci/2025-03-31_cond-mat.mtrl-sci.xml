      <title>High thermoelectric power factor in Ni-Fe alloy for active cooling applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic thermoelectric materials are promising candidates for active cooling applications, where high thermal conductivity and a high thermoelectric power factor are essential to maximize effective thermal conductivity. While metals inherently possess high thermal and electrical conductivities, they typically exhibit low Seebeck coefficients. In this work, we create a database and apply machine learning techniques to identify metallic binary alloys with large Seebeck coefficients. Specifically, we identify Ni-Fe as a promising candidate for active cooling. We then fabricate Ni-Fe ingots and demonstrate thermoelectric power factor values as high as 120 {\mu}W/{cm.K^2} at 200 K for these stable alloys, which are composed of cost-effective and abundant elements. Furthermore, we show that the effective thermal conductivity of these alloys, under small temperature differences, can exceed that of pure copper at temperatures above 250 K.</description>

      <title>Metallicity-driven polar transitions in topological epilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polar metals, materials that exhibit both electric polarization and high conductivity, can also host topological phases. Because free carriers strongly suppress distortive polar order and change the Fermi level, controlling charge dynamics is crucial for simultaneously tuning ferroelectric and topological phases in the same material. Here, we explore the experimental conditions that enable access to these phases in bismuth-doped Pb$_{1-x}$Sn$_x$Te epilayers. For samples in the topological phase at $x = 0.5$, we use terahertz time-domain spectroscopy to evaluate their complex permittivity as a function of temperature. We observe a non-monotonic variation in carrier concentration with bismuth doping, indicating a change in carrier type. By tracking the transverse optical phonon mode, we identify a ferroelectric phase transition when distortive polar order emerges below a critical temperature that depends on carrier concentration. We show that bismuth doping controls the metallicity-dependent order parameters in the softening and hardening phases. Our work demonstrates a tunable platform for engineering exotic states of matter that integrate metallicity, ferroelectricity and topology.</description>

      <title>Dynasor 2: From Simulation to Experiment Through Correlation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Correlation functions, such as static and dynamic structure factors, offer a versatile approach to analyzing atomic-scale structure and dynamics. By having access to the full dynamics from atomistic simulations, they serve as valuable tools for understanding material behavior. Experimentally, material properties are commonly probed through scattering measurements, which also provide access to static and dynamic structure factors. However, it is not trivial to decode these due to complex interactions between atomic motion and the probe. Atomistic simulations can help bridge this gap, allowing for detailed understanding of the underlying dynamics. In this paper, we illustrate how correlation functions provide structural and dynamical insights from simulation and showcase the strong agreement with experiment. To compute the correlation functions, we have updated the Python package dynasor with a new interface and, importantly, added support for weighting the computed quantities with form factors or cross sections, facilitating direct comparison with probe-specific structure factors. Additionally, we have incorporated the spectral energy density method, which offers an alternative view of the dispersion for crystalline systems, as well as functionality to project atomic dynamics onto phonon modes, enabling detailed analysis of specific phonon modes from atomistic simulation. We illustrate the capabilities of dynasor with diverse examples, ranging from liquid Ni3Al to perovskites, and compare computed results with X-ray, electron and neutron scattering experiments. This highlights how computed correlation functions can not only agree well with experimental observations, but also provide deeper insight into the atomic-scale structure and dynamics of a material.</description>

      <title>Petal-Graphyne: A Novel 2D Carbon Allotrope for High-Performance Li and Na Ion Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using density functional theory simulations, this study introduces Petal-Graphyne (PLG), a novel multi-ring metallic structure composed of 4-, 8-, 10-, and 16-membered rings. Its structural, electronic, and lithium/sodium storage properties were comprehensively investigated. PLG exhibits a high theoretical capacity of 1004 mAh/g for Li, Na, and mixed Li/Na ions, surpassing conventional graphite anodes. The material remains metallic, with multiple band crossings at the Fermi level. The optimal energy barriers for Li (0.28 eV) and Na (0.25 eV) on PLG and favorable diffusion coefficients in both monolayer and multilayer configurations are unveiled. The open circuit voltages are 0.47 V for Li, 0.51 V for Na, and 0.54 V for mixed-ion storage, suggesting stable electrochemical performance. These results highlight PLG as a promising candidate for next-generation lithium and sodium-ion batteries, combining high storage capacity and efficient ion transport.</description>

      <title>Infrared Dielectric Function of Photochromic Thiazolothiazole Embedded Polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the infrared dielectric function of photochromic dipyridinium thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole embedded in polymer is reported. Bulk thiazolo[5,4-d]thiazole-embedded polymer samples were prepared by drop casting and dehydration in room temperature. The samples were investigated using spectroscopic ellipsometry before and after irradiation with a 405~nm diode laser in the infrared spectral range from 500 cm-1 to 1800 cm-1. The model dielectric functions of the thiazolothiazole embedded polymer film for its TTz2+ (unirradiated) and TTz0 (irradiated) states are composed of a series of Lorentz oscillators in the measured spectral range. A comparison of the obtained complex dielectric functions for the TTz2+ and TTz0 states shows that the oscillators located in the spectral ranges 500 cm-1 - 700 cm-1, 1300 cm-1 - 1400 cm-1, and 1500 cm-1 - 1700 cm-1 change in both amplitude and resonant frequency upon transition between the states. Additionally, a resonance at approximately 1050 cm-1 exhibited a change in oscillator amplitude but not resonant frequency due to the photochromic transition.</description>

      <title>Towards Interfacing Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy to Dislocation Dynamics Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deformation gradient tensor fields are reconstructed in three dimensions (mapping all 9 tensor components) using synthetic Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy data. Owing to the unique properties of the microscope, our results imply that the evolution of deformation fields can now be imaged non-destructively, in situ, and within deeply embedded crystalline elements. The derived regression framework and sampling scheme operate under the kinematic diffraction approximation and are well-suited for studying microstructure evolution during plastic deformation. We derive the deformation conditions under which diffraction vectors extracted from DFXM images can be uniquely associated to the deformation gradient tensor field of the sample. The analysis concludes that the deformation gradient tensor field must vary linearly over line segments defined by the X-ray beam width and the diffracted ray path. The proposed algorithms are validated against numerical simulations for realistic noise levels. Reconstructions of a simulated single straight-edge dislocation show that the Burgers vector components can be recovered with an error of &lt;2%. The mean absolute error of the reconstructed elastic distortion field was found to be &lt;10^-6. By taking the curl of the elastic distortion field, local dislocation densities are derived, yielding a reconstructed dislocation core position with sub-pixel accuracy. The significance of directly measuring the elastic distortion and the dislocation density tensor fields is discussed in the context of continuum theory of dislocations. Such measurements can also be interfaced with continuum dislocation dynamics by providing data that can guide the development and validation, thus extending the relevant models to finite strain regimes.</description>

      <title>Superior electrochemical performance of zinc-ion batteries with fine-grained and textured zinc anode produced by high-pressure torsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zinc-ion batteries are promising alternatives to lithium-ion batteries, offering advantages in safety, cost, and environmental impact. However, their performance is often limited by the functioning of the zinc anode. This study employs severe plastic deformation via the high-pressure torsion (HPT) method to enhance the electrochemical performance of zinc anodes. HPT reduced the grain size from &gt;1000 {\mu}m to 20 {\mu}m and introduced a (002) basal texture. The battery assembled with HPT-processed zinc demonstrated improved cycling stability, rate performance, and specific discharge capacity (&gt;500 mAh/g at 0.5 A/g after 50 cycles), particularly at high current densities. This performance enhancement was attributed to grain-boundary and texture effects on improved ion transfer (confirmed by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy), fast redox reaction kinetics (confirmed by cyclic voltammetry), and reduced corrosion (confirmed by microscopy and potentiodynamic polarization test). This study highlights the potential of severely deformed materials with textured fine grains for advanced rechargeable battery technologies.</description>

      <title>Structure, corrosion resistance and nanomechanical properties of CoCrFeNiX (X=Nb,Mo,B,Si) high entropy alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the four high entropy CoCrFeNiX alloys (X=Mo,Nb,B,Si) were prepared by induction melting to comparatively analyse their structure, nanomechanical properties, and corrosion resistance in the chloride ion environment. The CoCrFeNiNb and CoCrFeNiMo alloys are composed of FCC solid solution and intermetallic phases (TM)2Nb and Cr-Mo-TM. In the case of the CoCrFeNiB alloy, a complex phase structure was revealed, consisting of FCC solid solution and three types of borides. In turn, the addition of Si substantially altered the phase composition of the CoCrFeNi alloy, resulting in the formation of two intermetallic phases. The corrosion behaviour of the alloys was studied in 3.5 and 5% NaCl solutions. The highest corrosion resistance in both solutions used characterize the CoCrFeNiSi alloy, showing the lowest corrosion current density and the most positive corrosion potential values. For measurements in 5% NaCl solution, icorr and Ecorr were equal to 0.24 microA/cm2 and -0.136 V. Currently, the least favourable corrosion parameters were recorded for the CoCrFeNiMo alloy. The results of EIS measurements confirmed the high protective abilities of passive film formed on the CoCrFeNiSi alloy surface. The highest strength properties were shown by the alloys with the addition of metalloids. For the CoCrFeNiSi alloy, the highest nanohardness value was obtained (above 15 GPa), while the CoCrFeNiB showed the highest Young modulus (above 275 GPa).</description>

      <title>Growth of uniform helium submonolayers adsorbed on single-surface graphite observed by surface X-ray diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observed surface X-ray diffraction from He-4 submonolayers adsorbed on a single-surface graphite using synchrotron X-rays. Time evolutions of scattering intensities along the crystal truncation rod (CTR) were observed even after reaching the base low temperature in a selected condition of sample preparation. Our simulations for CTR scatterings based on the random double-layer model, in which helium atoms are distributed randomly in the first and second layers with a certain occupancy ratio, can consistently explain the observed intensity changes. These results support the scenario that He atoms are stratified initially as a nonequilibrium state and then relaxed into a uniform monolayer by surface diffusion, where the relaxation process was observed as a decrease in CTR scattering intensity. The observed time constant was, however, much longer than those estimated from quantum and thermal surface diffusions. This implies homogeneous processes in surface diffusions were strongly suppressed by local potentials in such as atomic steps or microcrystalline boundaries.</description>

      <title>Spin-Polarized Antiferromagnetic Spintronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-polarized antiferromagnets (AFMs), including altermagnets, noncollinear AFMs, and two-dimensional layer-polarized AFMs, have emerged as transformative materials for next-generation spintronic and optoelectronic technologies. These systems uniquely combine spin-polarized electronic states with vanishing net magnetization, enabling ultrafast spin dynamics, high-density integration, and robustness against stray magnetic fields. Their unconventional symmetry-breaking mechanisms-governed by crystal symmetry, chiral spin textures, or interlayer potential control-give rise to emergent phenomena previously exclusive to ferromagnets: nonrelativistic spin-momentum locking, spontaneous anomalous transport phenomena, gate-tunable magneto-optical responses, and nonrelativistic spin-polarized current. This review systematically examines the fundamental principles linking symmetry, band topology, and transport properties across these material classes, synthesizing recent breakthroughs in both theory and experiment. We further identify critical challenges in achieving room-temperature functionality, scalable Neel vector control, and coherent spin-current manipulation, while outlining pathways to harness these materials for ultra-low-power memory, spin-logic architectures, and quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Investigation of Auxetic Piezoelectric Effect in Nitride Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently reported auxetic piezoelectric effect, which acts as the electrical counterpart of the negative Poisson's ratio, is of significant technical importance for applications in acoustic wave devices. However, this electric auxetic effect has not yet been reported in perovskite systems. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the piezoelectric properties of six polar nitride perovskites with the chemical formula ABN3 (A = La, Sc, Y; B = W, Mo). Among these, all compounds except ScMoN3 exhibit the auxetic piezoelectric effect, which is characterized by an unusually positive transverse piezoelectric coefficient, along with a positive longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient. This behavior is in sharp contrast to previously reported results in HfO2, where both the longitudinal and transverse piezoelectric coefficients are negative. These unusual positive transverse piezoelectric coefficients originate from the domination of the positive internal-strain contribution. We further confirm the auxetic piezoelectric effect with finite electric field calculations. Our research enriches the understanding of the piezoelectric properties of nitride perovskites and provides a new compositional space for the design of novel auxetic piezoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Host dependence of PL5 ensemble in 4H-SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color center PL5 in 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC) has drawn significant attention due to its room-temperature quantum coherence properties and promising potential of quantum sensing applications. The preparation of PL5 ensemble is a critical prerequisite for practical applications. In this work, we investigated the formation of PL5 ensembles in types of 4H-SiC wafers, focusing on their suitability as hosts for PL5 ensemble. Results demonstrate that PL5 signals are exclusively observed in high-purity semi-insulating (HPSI) substrates, whereas divacancies PL1-PL4 can be detected in both HPSI and epitaxial samples. The type of in-plane stress in HPSI and epitaxial hosts is compressive in the same order of magnitude. Defects like stacking faults and dislocations are not observed simultaneously in the PL5 ensemble. Notably, the PL5 ensemble exhibits a relatively uniform distribution in the HPSI host, highlighting its readiness for integration into quantum sensing platforms. Furthermore, signal of PL5 can always be detected in the HPSI samples with different doses of electron irradiation, which suggests that HPSI wafers are more suitable hosts for the production of PL5 ensemble. This work provides critical insights into the material-specific requirements for PL5 ensemble formation and advances the development of 4H-SiC-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Strain distribution in GaN/AlN superlattices grown on AlN/sapphire templates: comparison of X-ray diffraction and photoluminescence studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Series of GaN/AlN superlattices (SLs) with various periods and the same thicknesses of GaN quantum wells and AlN barriers have been investigated. X-ray diffraction, photoluminescence (PL) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques were used to study the influence of thickness of AlN and GaN sublayers on strain distribution in GaN/AlN SL structures. Detailed X-ray diffraction measurements demonstrate that the strain occurring in SLs generally decreases with an increase of well/barrier thickness. Fitting of X-ray diffraction curves allowed determining the real thicknesses of the GaN wells and AlN barriers. Since blurring of the interfaces causes deviation of calculated data from experimental results the quality of the interfaces has been evaluated as well and compared with results of TEM measurements. For the samples with thinner wells/barriers the presence of pin-holes and threading dislocations has been observed in TEM measurements. The best quality of interfaces has been found for the sample with a well/barrier thickness of 3 nm. Finally, PL spectra showed that due to Quantum-Confined Stark Effect the PL peak energies of the SLs decreased with increasing the width of the GaN quantum wells and AlN barriers. The effect is well modelled by ab initio calculations based on the density functional theory applied for tetragonally strained structures of the same geometry using a full tensorial representation of the strain in the SLs.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification in Multiscale Models of Charge Transport in Organic Semiconductors: Influence of the Exhange-Correlation Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the impact of exchange-correlation functional choices on the predictive accuracy of multiscale models for charge transport in organic semiconductors (OSCs). A hybrid functional approach is applied to analyze uncertainties in key parameters influencing charge mobility, focusing on the Hartree--Fock exchange fraction. Using 2-methyl-9,10-bis(naphthalen-2-yl)anthracene (MADN) as a test system, molecular dynamics and density functional theory are combined to compute reorganization energies, site energies, and electronic coupling elements. Monte Carlo sampling quantifies the uncertainty propagation, revealing that site energy variations dominate transport property uncertainties, while coupling elements contribute minimally. The findings underscore the need for accurate parameter determination and functional selection, with implications for enhancing the reliability of first-principles-based multiscale modeling frameworks in OSC design.</description>

      <title>A Morphotropic Phase Boundary in MA$_{1-x}$FA$_x$PbI$_3$: Linking Structure, Dynamics, and Electronic Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the phase behavior of mixed-cation halide perovskites is critical for optimizing their structural stability and optoelectronic performance. Here, we map the phase diagram of MA$_{1-x}$FA$_x$PbI$_3$ using a machine-learned interatomic potential in molecular dynamics simulations. We identify a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) at approximately 27% FA content, delineating the transition between out-of-phase and in-phase octahedral tilt patterns. Phonon mode projections reveal that this transition coincides with a mode crossover composition, where the free energy landscapes of the M and R phonon modes become nearly degenerate. This results in nanoscale layered structures with alternating tilt patterns, suggesting minimal interface energy between competing phases. Our results provide a systematic and consistent description of this important system, complementing earlier partial and sometimes conflicting experimental assessments. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations show that band edge fluctuations peak near the MPB, indicating an enhancement of electron-phonon coupling and dynamic disorder effects. These findings establish a direct link between phonon dynamics, phase behavior, and electronic structure, providing a further composition-driven pathway for tailoring the optoelectronic properties of perovskite materials. By demonstrating that phonon overdamping serves as a hallmark of the MPB, our study offers new insights into the design principles for stable, high-performance perovskite solar cells.</description>

      <title>Insights on the role of the covalent Ni-O bonds in LiNiO2 positive electrodes: A combined hard X-ray spectroscopy study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interest in Ni-rich layered oxide positive electrode materials has been increasing due to its wide applicability particularly in electric vehicles as high capacity and high energy density electrode materials. However, the Ni-O bond array which builds the overall framework and plays a critical role in the charge compensation mechanism of the material requires deeper understanding. This work presents a correlative approach elucidating the role of the local highly covalent Ni-O bonds in LiNiO2 (LNO) model material. Pristine and electrochemically obtained LNO positive electrodes are analyzed using ex situ X-ray diffraction (XRD) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) to compare the average and local structural evolution upon Li+ ion de-intercalation. Insights from Ni K-edge X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and non-resonant Ni Kbeta X-ray emission spectroscopy (XES) spectra are combined to track the electronic environment of Ni. X-ray Raman scattering (XRS) spectra at the Ni L2,3-edges and O K-edge provide direct bulk electronic information with regards to the interplay between Ni 3d and O 2p states. The overall findings imply that O plays a significant role in the charge compensation process, contributing to the substantial negative charge transfer from the O 2p orbitals, because of the covalency in the Ni-O bonds inside the NiO2 framework within the edge-sharing NiO6 octahedra. The utilization of complementary X-ray spectroscopy techniques clarifies the intricate electronic environment of LNO, which is helpful in understanding Ni-rich positive electrode materials and offering new insights into their covalent nature.</description>

      <title>Observation of quasi bound states in open quantum wells of cesiated p-doped GaN surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantized electron states in the downward band bending region (BBR) at the surface of cesiated p-type GaN are investigated. We theoretically predict the existence of metastable resonant states in the BBR with an intrinsic life-time around 20 fs. Their experimental observation requires access to the empty conduction band of the cesiated semiconductor, which is possible with near-bandgap photoemission spectroscopy. The energy distribution of the photoemitted electrons shows contributions coming from electrons accumulated into the resonant states at energies which agree with calculations.</description>

      <title>Strain induced stabilization of high symmetry phase in MAPbBr3 perovskite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural phase transitions in the organic inorganic metal halide perovskites are driven via rearrangement of methylammonium cation and distortion in the PbX6 octahedra. Compositional tuning is usually incorporated for suppression of the structural phase transition in these systems with cation or anion tuning. Along with the compositional tuning, behaviour of strain present in the system can also lead to stabilization of single phase in these systems. In the present investigation, two different samples of CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite were studied and it is observed that structural phase transition is absent for one of the sample while it is present in the other sample. The non-observance of structural phase transition and stabilization of single phase has been attributed to the perceived tensile strain in the system contrary to the compressive strain observed in the system showing structural phase transitions. This observation is further supported by theoretical calculations. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure measurements revealed distorted octahedra with varying bond lengths along planar and axial directions in both samples, along with observed increase in bond lengths in one of the sample. This stabilization of the cubic phase can enhance device performance and increase overall environmental stability, making these systems more effective for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Plasmon-Induced Tuning of Cerium Oxidation States in Au@CeO$_x$ Core@Shell Nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CeO$_x$-based nanoforms are widely used in catalysis, or biomedical applications due to their redox activity and oxygen storage capacity. The key parameters determining their surface chemistry are the Ce$^{3+}$/Ce$^{4+}$ ratio and the ability to transition between Ce$^{4+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ states. We synthesized Au@CeO$_x$ core@shell nanoparticles with different thicknesses of CeO$_x$ shells and different Ce$^{3+}$/Ce$^{4+}$ ratios through a photothermal reaction driven by localized surface plasmon resonances (LSPRs) at the Au nanoparticle surface induced by visible light. We introduce a way to further enhance the Ce$^{3+}$/Ce$^{4+}$ ratio in the shell by exposing the Au@CeO$_x$ nanoparticles to visible light using a green laser (532 nm, 50 mW). Our findings based on photoelectron spectroscopy indicate that the Ce$^{4+}$-to-Ce$^{3+}$ transition results from LSPR-induced superheating of the Au@CeO$_x$ interface, leading to the formation of oxygen vacancies and reduction of Ce$^{4+}$ ions. This process is reversible upon air exposure suggesting that the ability to transition between the Ce$^{4+}$ and Ce$^{3+}$ states is retained in the Au@CeO$_x$ nanoparticles. Our study presents the CeO$_x$-based nanoforms with a tunable cerium valence state ratio, highlighting the potential of plasmonic control in optimizing their photocatalytic and enzyme-mimetic properties.</description>

      <title>Nanomolding single-crystalline CoIn3 and RhIn3 nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intermetallic compounds containing transition metals and group III-V metals tend to possess strong correlations and high catalytic activities, both of which can be enhanced via reduced dimensionality. Nanostructuring is an effective approach to explore this possibility, yet the synthesis of nanostructured intermetallics is challenging due to vast differences in melting points and vapor pressures of the constituent elements. In this work, we demonstrate that this challenge can be overcome with thermomechanical nanomolding (TMNM), exemplified by the synthesis of intermetallic CoIn3 and RhIn3 nanowires. We show that TMNM successfully extrudes single-crystalline nanowires of these compounds down to the 20 nm diameter range, and the nanowires remain metallic with resistivity values higher than calculated bulk resistivity. We discuss possible effects of surface roughness scattering, vacancy-induced scattering, and surface oxidation, on the measured resistivities of the nanowires. For CoIn3 nanowires, the measured resistivity values are the first reported values for this compound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single pulse All Optical Helicity-Independent Toggle Switching is observed in CoHo and CoDy alloys single layers. An original reversal mechanism is reported which contrasts with those observed to date. It is shown that the reversal process is on the {\mu}s timescale involving the reorganization / coalescence of domains and domain walls. The toggle switching is explained considering the unbalanced magnetization distribution stabilized after the ultrashort laser pulse.</description>

      <title>Nanoparticle Deposition Techniques for Silica Nanoparticles: Synthesis, Electrophoretic Deposition, and Optimization- A review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Silica nanoparticles have emerged as key building blocks for advanced applications in electronics, catalysis, energy storage, biomedicine, and environmental science. In this review, we focus on recent developments in both the synthesis and deposition of these nanoparticles, emphasizing the widely used St\"ober method and the versatile technique of electrophoretic deposition (EPD). The St\"ober method is celebrated for its simplicity and reliability, offering precise control over particle size, morphology, and surface properties to produce uniform, monodisperse silica nanoparticles that meet high-quality standards for advanced applications. EPD, on the other hand, is a cost-effective, room-temperature process that enables uniform coatings on substrates with complex geometries. When compared to traditional techniques such as chemical vapor deposition, atomic layer deposition, and spin coating, EPD stands out due to its scalability, enhanced material compatibility, and ease of processing. Moreover, Future research should integrate AI-driven optimization with active learning to enhance electrophoretic deposition (EPD) of silica nanoparticles, leveraging predictive modeling and real-time adjustments for improved film quality and process efficiency. This approach promises to accelerate material discovery and enable scalable nanofabrication of advanced functional films.</description>

      <title>Pressure-temperature phase diagram calculations using polynomial machine learning potentials: A comprehensive study based on global structure prediction and self-consistent phonon calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polynomial machine learning potentials (MLPs) based on polynomial rotational invariants have been systematically developed for various systems and applied to efficiently predict crystal structures. In this study, we propose a robust methodology founded on polynomial MLPs to comprehensively enumerate crystal structures under high-pressure conditions and to evaluate their phase stability at finite temperatures. The proposed approach involves constructing polynomial MLPs with high predictive accuracy across a broad range of pressures, conducting reliable global structure searches, and performing exhaustive self-consistent phonon calculations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by examining elemental silicon at pressures up to 100 GPa and temperatures up to 1000 K, revealing stable phases across these conditions. The framework established in this study offers a powerful strategy for predicting crystal structures and phase stability under high-pressure and finite-temperature conditions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a composite elastic meta-slab with exceptional transmission properties, particularly the presence of a W-shaped bandgap. A comprehensive study, utilizing experimental measurements, the finite element method, and an analytical approach, identifies this specific bandgap. The meta-slab design involves cutting an array of composite materials arranged in parallel with strategically placed incisions. This configuration ensures that the materials between the slits act as plate-like waveguides within the surrounding medium. The incorporation of steel into ABS-based Fabry-Perot cavities induces a notable coupling effect between longitudinal waves and localized modes traversing the structure, leading to the formation of two distinct Fabry-Perot resonators. These coupling effects generate a series of resonances and antiresonances, ultimately producing the W-band gap through the interaction of two symmetric Fano resonances.</description>

      <title>Sub-nm Curvature Unlocks Exceptional Inherent Flexoelectricity in Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity arises from strain-gradient-induced polarization and is pronounced in two-dimensional (2D) materials due to their mechanical flexibility and sensitivity to structural deformations. This phenomenon approaches its limit in highly curved nanostructures, where extreme charge redistribution and electrostatic modulation result in macroscopic manifestations, such as electronic band offsets, that can be measured. Here, we present the first experimental and theoretical demonstration of giant intrinsic flexoelectricity in graphene nanowrinkles. These nanowrinkles feature a consistent radius of curvature of ~5 {\AA} atop a flat MoS_{2} substrate, where strain gradients, mapped by sub-micron Raman spectroscopy, emerge from mismatched elastic properties between graphene and MoS_{2}. Conductive atomic force microscopy (c-AFM) reveals consistent flexoelectric currents over large-area, dense nanowrinkle networks. The observed asymmetric electromechanical behavior, characterized by a threshold potential ({\Phi}_{th}) of ~1 V, suggests an intrinsic energy barrier to activate a flexoelectric current. This threshold likely arises from combined band alignment effects and strain-induced polarization barriers, which modulate carrier transport at the wrinkle apex. Notably, this behavior aligns with our theoretical band offset predictions (~1.2 V), further supporting flexoelectric dipoles in modifying local electrostatic potential. This represents the strongest manifestations of flexoelectricity in nanostructures with intrinsic polarization densities 10^{5}-10^{7} times greater than meso/micro counterparts yielding P_{th} ~ 4 C/m^{2}, P_{exp} ~ 1 C/m^{2}. This work establishes graphene nanowrinkles as a model system for exploring giant nanoscale flexoelectric effects and highlights their potential for strain-engineered nanoscale electronic and electromechanical devices.</description>

Abstract: Electron transport driven by the phase coherence and interference of quantum many-body wavefunctions is a fascinating phenomenon with potential technological significance. Superconductivity, for example, enables dissipationless transport through macroscopic phase twisting. Similarly, in charge-density waves, once the phase degree of freedom-representing the collective position of electrons relative to the lattice-is depinned, it generates characteristic broadband noise and intriguing AC-DC interference patterns. In this work, we point out a phase-coherent transport phenomena in the intervalley coherent (IVC) state, also known as the bond-ordered or Kekule distorted state, frequently reported in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. Under a static magnetic field, the IVC state responds with an oscillating orbital magnetization, inducing an AC Hall effect similar to the AC Josephson effect in superconductors. In this analogy, the magnetic field acts as the DC voltage, while the oscillating magnetization acts as the AC Josephson current. We present detailed microscopic calculations for all the parameters of the phase-number free-energy in rhombohedral trilayer graphene, predicting an oscillation frequency of approximately 12 GHz at 0.1 Tesla. We comment on this phase-coherent transport in twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides, where the IVC state has been theoretically proposed.</description>

      <title>Emergent Hidden Multipolar State in the Triangular Lattice Magnet TmZn2GaO5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: TmZn2GaO5 is a newly synthesized triangular lattice magnet that exhibits a unique quantum phase characterized by strong Ising anisotropy, a pseudo-doublet crystal electric field ground state, and a low-energy gapped excitation at the K point. Unlike its well-known counterparts, TmMgGaO4 and YbMgGaO4, this material crystallizes in a distinct hexagonal structure, leading to a cleaner platform for investigating frustrated magnetism. Magnetic susceptibility, heat capacity, and inelastic neutron scattering measurements confirm the absence of long-range magnetic order down to 50 mK, placing TmZn2GaO5 in a distinct region of the transverse-field Ising model phase diagram. Theoretical calculations based on spin-wave theory and mean-field modeling reproduce key experimental observations, reinforcing the material's placement in a quantum disordered/multipolar state. These results highlight its potential for exploring quantum disordered states, anisotropic excitations, and exotic quantum phases in frustrated spin systems.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Nanotube/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ Heterojunction PIN Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ is gaining attention as a promising semiconductor for next-generation high-power, high-efficiency, and high-temperature electronic devices, thanks to its exceptional material properties. However, challenges such as the lack of viable p-type doping have hindered its full potential, particularly in the development of ambipolar devices. This work introduces a novel heterojunction diode (HD) that combines p-type carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with i/n-type $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ to overcome these limitations. For the first time, a CNT/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ hetero-p-n-junction diode is fabricated. Compared to a traditional Schottky barrier diode (SBD) with the same $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ epilayer, the CNT/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ HD demonstrates significant improvements, including a higher rectifying ratio ($1.2 \times 10^{11}$), a larger turn-on voltage (1.96 V), a drastically reduced leakage current at temperatures up to 300 {\deg}C, and a 26.7% increase in breakdown voltage. Notably, the CNT/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ HD exhibits a low ideality factor of 1.02, signifying an ideal interface between the materials. These results underline the potential of CNT/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ heterojunctions for electronic applications, offering a promising solution to current limitations in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$-based devices.</description>

      <title>Low-energy excitations in multiple modulation-doped CdTe/(CdMg)Te quantum wells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low energy excitations of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in modulation-doped multiple (ten) quantum wells (QWs) was studied using far-infrared magneto-transmission technique at liquid helium temperatures. A large distance between neighbouring QWs of 54 nm excluded a direct interaction of electron wave functions confined in the wells. In four samples which differed in the spacer width and the level of doping with iodine donors, supplied with a metallic grid coupler, a uniform picture of exitations of the 2DEG was observed. These involved the cyclotron resonance (CR), its second harmonic (2CR) and magnetoplasmon modes (MPMs). MPMs with a small amplitude originated from excitations of the 2DEG in a single QW and these with a high amplitude resulted from a coherent excitation of the 2DEG in all wells. A polaron effect resulting from the interaction of the CR, 2CR and MPMs with an optical phonon was observed and discribed with appropriate models. Both types of MPMs exhibited gaps in the disperion relations at the frequency close to the 2CR, leading to Bernstein modes, which was discribed with an appropriate (non-local) theoretical model.</description>

      <title>Quantum transport in SnTe nanowire devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a variety of quantum transport experiments in SnTe nanowire devices. Research on these particular nanowire devices is relevant because of their topological properties and their potential to distinguish surface states owing to their high surface-to-volume ratio that suppresses the bulk contribution to the conductance. We observe a low-resistance and a high-resistance regime. The highly resistive devices display semiconducting and quantum dot behavior caused by microscopic differences in the fabrication, while devices with low resistance show partial superconductivity when in a hybrid superconductor-nanowire configuration or Fabry-P\'erot oscillations. The latter suggests quantum interference in a ballistic transport channel, attributed to the 2D surface states in SnTe. The wide variety of quantum transport phenomena demonstrate SnTe nanowires as a promising platform for diverse follow-up experiments and novel device architectures, including the exploration of topological superconductivity and the development of low-energy spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconductivity in LaRu3Si2 by chemical pressure tuning of kagome flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In kagome metals, flat bands induced by frustrated hopping serve as a platform for strong electronic correlation, while often exhibiting substantial dispersion along the $k_z$ direction due to interlayer coupling. Here, we investigate the superconductivity of the kagome metal LaRu$_3$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$ by chemical pressure tuning while preserving the Ru-$4d$ states that constitute the kagome flat bands. We observe a sizable enhancement in the density of states up to $x = 0.07$, as determined by the specific heat, with a concomitant increase in the superconducting transition temperature. As supported by our first-principles calculations, the lattice expansion along the $c$-axis by chemical pressure mitigates a detrimental effect of hybridization between kagome layers, thereby reinforcing the three-dimensional localization of flat-band electrons. Providing evidence for LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ as a flat-band hosting superconductor, we demonstrate a simple, yet effective, route to engineer flat bands by uniaxial lattice expansion.</description>

      <title>Terahertz frequency-domain 4x4 Mueller matrix ellipsometer instrument designed for high-frequency magnetic resonance measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a Mueller matrix ellipsometer design using dual continuously rotating anisotropic meta wave plates which determines the full set of Mueller matrix elements in the terahertz spectral range. The instrument operates in the frequency domain and employs a frequency tunable, solid state synthesizer based, continuous wave terahertz source with sub-MHz bandwidth. The implemented source permits operation within 82-125 GHz and 170-250 GHz, without and with an additional frequency doubler, respectively. The terahertz transparent meta wave plates consist of 3D-printed polymer based columnar thin film structures with subwavelength dimensions. The rotating wave plates produce sufficient modulation of the Stokes vector components of transmitted terahertz light to use the wave plates in polarization state generator and polarization state detector devices. Fast terahertz light detection rate of a quasi optical solid state detector permits acquisition with few microsecond temporal resolution and electronic sweeping control of the source frequency. We develop a fast frequency sweeping scheme while continuously rotating the terahertz wave plates. Subsequent sorting of measured data permits measurements of Mueller matrix elements at hundreds of different wavelengths. The Mueller matrix elements are obtained by forward numerical reduction of the measured data using an algorithm developed by Ruder et al.[Opt. Lett. 45, 3541 (2020)]. The instrument is combined with a magnetocryostat capable of reaching magnetic field strengths at the sample position of -8 T...8 T and sample temperatures from 4 K...400 K. Hence, the instrument is suitable to measure the full Mueller matrix of samples with magnetic resonances as demonstrated recently by Rindert et al. [Phys. Rev. B 110, 054413 (2024)]. We discuss design, calibration, and example applications.</description>

      <title>Cracking Down on Fracture to Functionalise Damage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we propose a novel relationship between topology and damage propagation in Maxwell lattices that redefines fracture as a functional design feature rather than mere degradation. We demonstrate that topologically protected modes, inherently robust against perturbations, localise along lattice discontinuities and govern the mechanical response. By precisely engineering the microstructure, we direct these modes to control stress distributions and trigger predictable, controlled damage. Our findings -- validated through comprehensive numerical simulations and experiments -- advance our understanding of nontrivial mechanical responses in Maxwell lattices and establish a clear framework for designing materials with improved fracture energy. This work paves the way for further exploration of topology-driven phenomena in mechanical systems and promises a new direction in the design of robust materials.</description>

      <title>Analog Computing with Heat: Matrix-vector Multiplication with Inverse-designed Metastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22603v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing computational demand has spurred interest in energy-efficient frameworks such as neuromorphic and analog computing. A core building block of modern applications is matrix-vector multiplication (MVM), which underpins a wide range of algorithms in both signal processing and machine learning. In this work, we propose performing MVM using inverse-designed metastructures, with heat serving as the signal carrier. The proposed approach is based on a generalization of effective thermal conductivity to systems with multiple input and output ports: The input signal is encoded as a set of applied temperatures, while the output is represented by the power collected at designated terminals. The metastructures are designed using density-based topology optimization, enabled by a differentiable thermal transport solver and automatic differentiation. We apply our methodology to optimize structures that approximate MVM for matrices of various dimensions, achieving 95.9\% accuracy for a 3$\times$3 matrix. These results highlight the potential of leveraging heat conduction for analog computing, with applications in scenarios where temperature gradients naturally occur, such as in electronic device hotspots, thermal mapping, and electronic skin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a recent Letter, Shirai and Sakumichi [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 148101 (2023), arXiv:2202.12483] presented a study focusing on the origin of a temperature-dependent negative contribution $G_U(T)$ to the elastic modulus $G(T)$ of hydrogels [Yoshikawa et al., Phys. Rev. X 11, 011045 (2021)]. The authors support their findings through an energy-related stiffness $k_U(r,T)$ obtained from a single chain, with $r$ being the end-to-end distance of a random walk on a 3D lattice. It is argued that the parameter $\varepsilon$ related to polymer-solvent interactions is positive, so the energy $E_s$ of an elongated state should be smaller than the energy $E_b$ of a more compact state. We believe that the analogy between $G_U(T)$ and $k_U(r,T)$ might have misled their claim that $G_U(T)&lt;0$ when $\varepsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a non-linear and non-empirical (nLanE) double hybrid density functional derived from an accurate interpolation of the adiabatic connection in density functional theory, incorporating the correct asymptotic expansions. By bridging the second-order perturbative weak correlation limit with the fully interacting limit from the semi-local SCAN functional, nLanE-SCAN is free of fitted parameters while providing improved energetic predictions compared to SCAN for moderately and strongly correlated systems alike. It delivers accurate predictions for atomic total energies and multiple reaction datasets from the GMTKN55 benchmark while significantly outperforming traditional linear hybrids and double hybrids for non-covalent interactions without requiring dispersion corrections. Due to the exact constraints at the weak correlation limit, nLanE-SCAN has reduced delocalization errors as evident through SIE4x4 and bond dissociations of H\(_2^+\) and He\(_2^+\). Its proper asymptotic behavior ensures stability in strongly correlated systems, improving H\(_2\) and N\(_2\) bond dissociation profiles compared to conventional functionals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) based on few-layer NbSe$_2$ fully encapsulated with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), demonstrating single-photon sensitivity. Our fabrication process preserves the superconducting properties of NbSe$_2$ in nanowires, as confirmed by low-temperature transport measurements that show a critical temperature of $T_c \approx 6.5$ K, comparable to the reported values for unpatterned sheets, and it maintains a contact resistance of $\sim 50 \, \Omega$ at $T = 4$ K. Meandered NbSe$_2$ nanowires exhibit a responsivity of up to $4.9 \times 10^4$ V/W over a spectral range of 650-1550 nm in a closed-cycle cryostat at 4 K, outperforming planar and short-wire devices. The devices achieve a $1/e$ recovery time of $\tau = (135 \pm 36)$ ns, system timing jitter of $j_\text{sys} = (1103 \pm 7)$ ps, and detection efficiency of $\sim 0.01\%$ at $0.95I_c$, with a linear increase in detection probability confirming the single-photon operation. Furthermore, measurements under attenuated pulsed laser (1 MHz) indicate a success rate of up to $33\%$ in detecting individual optical pulses, establishing the platform as a promising candidate for developing efficient single-photon detectors.</description>

Abstract: Rock weathering is a common phenomenon in most engineering applications, such as underground storage or geothermal energy. This work offers a discrete element modelization of the problem considering cohesive granular material and debonding effect. Oedometer conditions are applied during the weathering and the evolution of the coefficient of lateral earth pressure, a proxy of the state of stress, is tracked. Especially, the influence of the degree of cementation, the confining pressure, the initial value of k0 and the history of load are investigated. It has been emphasized that the granular media aims to reach an attractor configuration. And the grain reorganization occurring is divided into two main phenomena: the collapse of the unstable chain forces (stable only thanks to the cementation) and the softening of the grains.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of thermal hysteresis in the molecular dynamics of barocaloric neopentyl glycol</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17869v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Barocalorics (BCs) are emerging as promising alternatives to vapour-phase refrigerants, which are problematic as they exacerbate climate change when they inevitably leak into the atmosphere. However, the commercialisation of BC refrigerants is significantly hindered by hysteresis in the solid-solid phase transition that would be exploited in a refrigeration cycle. Here, we provide new insight into the hysteresis that is a critical step towards the rational design of viable BCs. By studying the benchmark BC plastic crystal, neopentyl glycol (NPG), we observe directly the liberation of the hydroxyl rotational modes that unlock the hydrogen bond network, distinguishing for the first time the molecular reorientation and hydroxymethyl rotational modes. We showcase the use high-resolution inelastic fixed-window scans in combination with quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements to build a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the NPG phase transition, directly tracking the molecular dynamics of the phase transition. Hysteresis previously observed in calorimetric studies of NPG is now observed directly as hysteresis in molecular rotational modes, and hence in the formation and disruption of hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, by tracking the thermal activation of three main reorientation modes, we suggest that their fractional excitations may resolve an outstanding discrepancy between measured and calculated entropy change. These results allow for direct study of the molecular dynamics that govern the thermal hysteresis of small molecule energy materials. They will be broadly applicable, as many promising BC material families possess first-order transitions involving molecular reorientations.</description>

      <title>Is the gain-voltage dependence of SiPMs linear?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gain-voltage dependence for SiPMs from V. Chmill et al., Study of the breakdown voltage of SiPMs, is reanalyzed and a non-linearity at the sub-percent level is observed. Simulations show that he non-linearity can be explained by the increase of the depletion depth of the avalanche region with over-voltage. A consequence of the non-linearity is that the voltage at which the discharge stops is systematically underestimated if a linear extrapolation is used. However, the shift is too small to explain the difference between the break-down voltage from the current-voltage dependence and the one obtained from the extrapolation of the gain-voltage dependence to gain one. The results are confirmed by measurement of a different MPPC produced by Hamamatsu which has a break-down voltage which is about a factor two higher.</description>

      <title>Actively-trained magnetic Moment Tensor Potentials for mechanical, dynamical, and thermal properties of paramagnetic CrN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a protocol for automated fitting of magnetic Moment Tensor Potential explicitly including magnetic moments in its functional form. For the fitting of this potential we use energies, forces, stresses, and magnetic forces (negative derivatives of energies with respect to magnetic moments) of configurations selected with an active learning algorithm. These selected configurations are computed using constrained density functional theory, which enables calculating energies and their derivatives for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium (excited) magnetic states. We test our protocol on the system of B1-CrN and demonstrate that the automatically trained magnetic Moment Tensor Potential reproduces mechanical, dynamical, and thermal properties, of B1-CrN in the paramagnetic state with respect to density functional theory and experiments.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous mapping of the ultrafast time and fluence dependence of the laser-induced insulator-to-metal transition in magnetite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pump-probe methods are a ubiquitous tool in the field of ultrafast dynamic measurements. In recent years, x-ray free-electron laser experiments have gained importance due to their ability to probe with high chemical selectivity and at atomic length scales. Measurements are typically repeated many thousands of times to collect sufficient statistics and vary parameters like delay or fluence, necessitating that initial conditions are restored each time. An alternative is presented by experiments which measure the relevant parameters in a single shot. Here, we present a time-to-space mapping imaging scheme that enables us to record a range of delays and laser fluences in any single shot of the x-ray probe. We demonstrate the use of this scheme by mapping the ultrafast dynamics of the optically induced insulator-to-metal Verwey transition in a magnetite thin film, probed by soft x-ray resonant diffraction. By extrapolating our results toward the conditions found at x-ray free-electron lasers with higher photon energy, we demonstrate that the presented data could be recorded in a single shot.</description>

      <title>Semiconductor-compatible topological digital alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, GeSn alloys have attracted much interest for direct-gap infrared photonics and as potential topological materials which are compatible with the semiconductor industry. However, for photonics, the high-Sn content required leads to low detectivity, associated with poor material quality, and the (&gt;35%) Sn required for topological properties have been out of reach experimentally. Here, we demonstrate that by patterning the Sn distribution within Ge, the electronic properties have a far greater tunability than is possible with the random alloy. For the GeSn \delta-digital alloy (DA) formed by confining Sn atoms in atomic layer(s) along the [111] direction of Ge, we show that ~10% Sn can lead to a triple-point semimetal. These findings are understood in terms of Sn ordering causing spatial separation of Sn and Ge band edges, leading to band inversion. This mechanism can also lead to a weak topological insulator, Weyl semimetal, and enables tunable direct bandgaps down to 2 meV, covering the entire infrared range. This DA induced topological properties are also identified in compound semiconductors, such as InAs1-xSbx, showing the general applicability of the DA design for realizing topological properties on conventional semiconductor platforms. Our findings not only point to a new class of currently unexplored topological systems accessible by epitaxy, but also establish the promise of low-Sn GeSn DAs for application as infrared laser diodes and photodetectors in Si photonic integrated circuits and infrared image sensors.</description>

      <title>Phase selection and texturing in molybdenum oxide films grown by reactive magnetron sputtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molybdenum oxide films offer a rich variety of properties for diverse applications, but exclusive synthesis of desired phases is a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate that oxygen flow ratio fO2 = [O2]/[Ar+O2] is crucial not only for phase selection of non-layered monoclinic MoO2 and layered orthorhombic alpha-MoO3 but also for controlling grain size and preferred orientation. Both mica and sapphire support exclusive MoO2 formation in the 0.15 &lt; fO2 &lt; 0.25 window at deposition temperatures Tdep = 400 and 500 degree C and alpha-MoO3 formation in the 0.35 &lt; fO2 &lt; 0.5 window at 400 degree C. Within fO2 windows favoring exclusive phase formation, high fO2 fosters large grains with out-of-plane 0k0 texture, except for MoO2 films on c-sapphire that show no systematic trends. These findings provide a framework for rational synthesis of phase-pure monoclinic MoO2 and orthorhombic MoO3 with control over texture and microstructure to access desired properties.</description>

      <title>Inefficiency of orbital Hall effect on the spin torque in transition metal/ferromagnet bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current induced spin torque is essential and crucial in spintronics. In this work, we systematically investigate the spin torque in transition metal(TM)/ferromagnet(FM) bilayers by using first-principles calculations and taking into account the phonon scattering at room temperature. To examine the spin and orbital Hall contribution, the studied transition metals include 5d heavy metals Pt, W, Au as well as 3d light metals Ti, V, Cr, Cu etc. We found that in TM/CoFe bilayers with typical 3d and 5d transition metals, the spin torque on CoFe mainly originates from spin Hall mechanism with the magnitude and sign of damping like torque efficiency consistent with the spin Hall conductivity. In TM/Ni bilayers, the spin torque is contributed by three mechanisms including spin and orbital Hall current in TM, as well as self-torque in Ni. The orbital Hall contribution in TM is accompanied by noteworthy opposite self spin torque in Ni, which leads to inapparent torque efficiency in Ti/Ni and V/Ni bilayers. For TM(5d heavy metal)/Ni bilayers, the spin torque induced by orbital Hall and self-torque in Ni nearly cancel each other, which makes the spin torque on Ni still align with that of the spin Hall effect in TM. Our work reveals much less efficient contribution of orbital Hall than spin Hall effect on the spin torque in transition metal/ferromagnet bilayers.</description>

      <title>Dome-like pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: NaNiO$_2$ is a Ni$^{3+}$-containing layered material consisting of alternating triangular networks of Ni and Na cations, separated by octahedrally-coordinated O anions. At ambient pressure, it features a collinear Jahn--Teller distortion below $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}\approx480$ K, which disappears in a first-order transition on heating to $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{end}\approx500$ K, corresponding to the increase in symmetry from monoclinic to rhombohedral. It was previously studied by variable-pressure neutron diffraction [ACS Inorganic Chemistry 61.10 (2022): 4312-4321] and found to exhibit an increasing $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$ with pressure up to ~5 GPa. In this work, powdered NaNiO$_2$ was studied via variable-pressure synchrotron x-ray diffraction up to pressures of ~67 GPa at 294 K and 403 K. Suppression of the collinear Jahn--Teller ordering is observed via the emergence of a high-symmetry rhombohedral phase, with the onset pressure occurring at ~18 GPa at both studied temperatures. Further, a discontinuous decrease in unit cell volume is observed on transitioning from the monoclinic to the rhombohedral phase. These results taken together suggest that in the vicinity of the transition, application of pressure causes the Jahn--Teller transition temperature, $T^\mathrm{JT}_\mathrm{onset}$, to decrease rapidly. We conclude that the pressure-temperature phase diagram of the cooperative Jahn--Teller distortion in NaNiO$_2$ is dome-like.</description>

      <title>Defect Engineering in Large-Scale CVD-Grown Hexagonal Boron Nitride: Formation, Spectroscopy, and Spin Relaxation Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, numerous techniques have been reported for generating optically active defects in exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which hold transformative potential for quantum photonic devices. However, achieving on-demand generation of desirable defect types in scalable hBN films remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate that formation of negative boron vacancy defects, VB-, in suspended, large-area CVD-grown hBN is strongly dependent on the type of bombarding particles (ions, neutrons, and electrons) and irradiation conditions. In contrast to suspended hBN, defect formation in substrate-supported hBN is more complex due to the uncontrollable generation of secondary particles from the substrate, and the outcome strongly depends on the thickness of the hBN. We identify different defect types by correlating spectroscopic and optically detected magnetic resonance features, distinguishing boron vacancies (formed by light ions and neutrons) from other optically active defects emitting at 650 nm assigned to anti-site nitrogen vacancy (NBVN) and reveal the presence of additional dark paramagnetic defects that influence spin-lattice relaxation time (T1) and zero-field splitting parameters, all of which strongly depend on the defect density. These results underscore the potential for precisely engineered defect formation in large-scale CVD-grown hBN, paving the way for the scalable fabrication of quantum photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Sign changes of the thermoelectric transport coefficient across the metal-insulator crossover in the doped Fermi Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the doping-dependence of the Seebeck coefficient, as calculated from the Kelvin formula, for the Fermi Hubbard model using determinantal quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our key findings are: (1) Besides the expected hole to electron-like behavior change around half filling, we show that the additional sign change at an electronic density $n_s$ (and correspondingly a hole density $p_s$) is controlled by the opening of a charge gap in the thermodynamic density of states or compressibility and not by the pseudogap scale in the single particle density of states. (2) We find that $n_s(T,U)$ depends strongly on the interaction $U$ and shows an unusual non-monotonic dependence on temperature with a maximum at a temperature $T\approx t$, on the order of the hopping scale. (3) We identify local moment formation close to half filling as the main driver for the anomalous behavior of the thermoelectric transport coefficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02293v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, the melting phase transitions of $Fe_{n}$ nanoclusters with $10 \leq n \leq 100$ atoms are investigated using classical many-body molecular dynamics simulations. For many cluster sizes, surface melting occurs at much lower temperatures than core melting. Surface and core melting points, and energetic melting points (temperatures of maximum heat capacity, $C_v$) are calculated for all cluster sizes. Melting properties are found to be strong functions of cluster structure. Cluster sizes with closed-shell structures always have first-order-like phase transitions. Almost one-third of cluster sizes in the analyzed range exhibit second-order-like phase transitions due to the presence of multiple structural configurations close in energy. 1-shell clusters with one to a few more atoms than a neighboring closed-shell structure have very low surface melting points and very high energetic melting points compared to their closed-shell counterparts. In clusters above 50 atoms with certain core structures, melting of the surface before the core was observed.</description>

      <title>Experimental Investigation of Variations in Polycrystalline Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO)-based MFIM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Device-to-device variations in ferroelectric (FE) hafnium oxide (HfO2)-based devices pose a crucial challenge that limits the otherwise promising capabilities of this technology. Although previous simulation-based studies have identified polarization (P) domain nucleation and polycrystallinity as key contributors to variations in HfO2, experimental validation remains limited. Here, we experimentally investigate variations in remanent polarization (PR) of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO)-based metal-ferroelectric-insulator-metal (MFIM) capacitors across different set voltages (VSET) and FE thicknesses (TFE). Our measurements reveal a non-monotonic behavior of the standard deviation of PR with VSET peaking around coercive voltage (VC), which is consistent with previous simulation-based predictions. In the low- and high-VSET regions, PR variations are primarily dictated by saturation polarization (PS) variations, mainly originating from charge trap effects at the interface between the FE-dielectric (DE) layer and the polycrystallinity of FE. On the other hand, in the mid-VSET region peak, the PR variations are attributed to the VC variation, which comes from a combined effect of multi-domain (MD) P switching and polycrystallinity. Notably, sharp P switching associated with domain nucleation amplifies the variations, resulting in a peak of PR variations in this VSET range. Further, we observe that as HZO thickness (TFE) is scaled, the non-monotonicity in variations with VSET is reduced, primarily due to reduced domain nucleation and smaller grain sizes. We experimentally establish a strong correlation of PR with PS in the low- and high-VSET regions and with VC in the mid-VSET region across various TFE. Finally, our experimental findings are corroborated with simulations using a 3D phase-field model.</description>

      <title>Effective Medium Theory for Time-modulated Subwavelength Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a general framework for deriving effective material properties of one-dimensional time-modulated systems of subwavelength resonators. It applies to subwavelength resonator systems with a general form of time-dependent parameters. We show that the resonators can be accurately described by a point-scattering formulation when the width of the resonators is small. In contrast to the static setting, where this point interaction approximation yields a Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the effective material properties, the mode coupling in the time-modulated case instead yields an infinite linear system of Lippmann-Schwinger-type equations. The effective equations can equivalently be written as a system of differential equations. Moreover, we introduce a numerical scheme to approximately solve the system of coupled equations and illustrate the validity of the effective equation.</description>
