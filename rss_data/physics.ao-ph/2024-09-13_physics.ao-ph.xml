      <title>Hamiltonian Lorenz-like models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The reduced-complexity models developed by Edward Lorenz are widely used in atmospheric and climate sciences to study nonlinear aspect of dynamics and to demonstrate new methods for numerical weather prediction. A set of inviscid Lorenz models describing the dynamics of a single variable in a zonally-periodic domain, without dissipation and forcing, conserve energy but are not Hamiltonian. In this paper, we start from a general continuous parent fluid model, from which we derive a family of Hamiltonian Lorenz-like models through a symplectic discretization of the associated Poisson bracket that preserves the Jacobi identity. A symplectic-split integrator is also formulated. These Hamiltonian models conserve energy and maintain the nearest-neighbor couplings inherent in the original Lorenz model. As a corollary, we find that the Lorenz-96 model can be seen as a result of a poor discretization of a Poisson bracket. Hamiltonian Lorenz-like models offer promising alternatives to the original Lorenz models, especially for the qualitative representation of non-Gaussian weather extremes and wave interactions, which are key factors in understanding many phenomena of the climate system.</description>

      <title>Modeling Snow on Sea Ice using Physics Guided Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Snow is a crucial element of the sea ice system, affecting sea ice growth and decay due to its low thermal conductivity and high albedo. Despite its importance, present-day climate models have an idealized representation of snow, often including only single-layer thermodynamics and omitting several processes that shape its properties. Although advanced snow process models like SnowModel exist, they are often excluded from climate modeling due to their high computational costs. SnowModel simulates snow depth, density, blowing-snow redistribution, sublimation, grain size, and thermal conductivity in a multi-layer snowpack. It operates with high spatial (1 meter) and temporal (1 hour) resolution. However, for large regions like the Arctic Ocean, these high-resolution simulations face challenges such as slow processing and large resource requirements. Data-driven emulators are used to address these issues, but they often lack generalizability and consistency with physical laws. In our study, we address these challenges by developing a physics-guided emulator that incorporates physical laws governing changes in snow density due to compaction. We evaluated three machine learning models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Physics-Guided LSTM, and Random Forest across five Arctic regions. All models achieved high accuracy, with the Physics-Guided LSTM showing the best performance in accuracy and generalizability. Our approach offers a faster way to emulate SnowModel with a speedup of over 9000 times, maintaining high fidelity.</description>

      <title>An Earth-System-Oriented View of the S2S Predictability of North American Weather Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is largely understood that subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) predictability arises from the atmospheric initial state during early lead times, the land during intermediate lead times, and the ocean during later lead times. We examine whether this hypothesis holds for the S2S prediction of weather regimes by training a set of XGBoost models to predict weekly weather regimes over North America at 1-to-8-week lead times. Each model used a different predictor from one of the three considered Earth system components (atmosphere, ocean, or land) sourced from reanalyses. Three additional models were trained using land-, ocean-, or atmosphere-only predictors to capture process interactions and leverage multiple signals within the respective Earth system component. We found that each Earth system component performed more skillfully at different forecast horizons, with sensitivity to seasonality and observed (i.e., ground truth) weather regime. S2S predictability from the atmosphere was higher during winter, from the ocean during summer, and from land during spring and summer. Ocean heat content was the best predictor for most seasons and weather regimes beyond week 2, highlighting the importance of sub-surface ocean conditions for S2S predictability. Soil temperature and water content were also important predictors. Climate patterns were associated with changes in the likelihood of occurrence for specific weather regimes, including the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation, Madden Julian Oscillation, North Pacific Gyre, and Indian Ocean dipole. This study quantifies predictability from some previously identified processes on the large-scale atmospheric circulation and gives insight into new sources for future study.</description>

      <title>Efficient Localized Adaptation of Neural Weather Forecasting: A Case Study in the MENA Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate weather and climate modeling is critical for both scientific advancement and safeguarding communities against environmental risks. Traditional approaches rely heavily on Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, which simulate energy and matter flow across Earth's systems. However, heavy computational requirements and low efficiency restrict the suitability of NWP, leading to a pressing need for enhanced modeling techniques. Neural network-based models have emerged as promising alternatives, leveraging data-driven approaches to forecast atmospheric variables. In this work, we focus on limited-area modeling and train our model specifically for localized region-level downstream tasks. As a case study, we consider the MENA region due to its unique climatic challenges, where accurate localized weather forecasting is crucial for managing water resources, agriculture and mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events. This targeted approach allows us to tailor the model's capabilities to the unique conditions of the region of interest. Our study aims to validate the effectiveness of integrating parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methodologies, specifically Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants, to enhance forecast accuracy, as well as training speed, computational resource utilization, and memory efficiency in weather and climate modeling for specific regions.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for predicting rate-induced tipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems exposed to changing forcing can exhibit catastrophic transitions between alternative and often markedly different states. The phenomenon of critical slowing down (CSD) can be used to anticipate such transitions if caused by a bifurcation and if the change in forcing is slow compared to the internal time scale of the system. However, in many real-world situations, these assumptions are not met and transitions can be triggered because the forcing exceeds a critical rate. For example, given the pace of anthropogenic climate change in comparison to the internal time scales of key Earth system components, such as the polar ice sheets or the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, such rate-induced tipping poses a severe risk. Moreover, depending on the realisation of random perturbations, some trajectories may transition across an unstable boundary, while others do not, even under the same forcing. CSD-based indicators generally cannot distinguish these cases of noise-induced tipping versus no tipping. This severely limits our ability to assess the risks of tipping, and to predict individual trajectories. To address this, we make a first attempt to develop a deep learning framework to predict transition probabilities of dynamical systems ahead of rate-induced transitions. Our method issues early warnings, as demonstrated on three prototypical systems for rate-induced tipping, subjected to time-varying equilibrium drift and noise perturbations. Exploiting explainable artificial intelligence methods, our framework captures the fingerprints necessary for early detection of rate-induced tipping, even in cases of long lead times. Our findings demonstrate the predictability of rate-induced and noise-induced tipping, advancing our ability to determine safe operating spaces for a broader class of dynamical systems than possible so far.</description>

      <title>Estimating atmospheric variables from Digital Typhoon Satellite Images via Conditional Denoising Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the application of diffusion models in the field of typhoons, predicting multiple ERA5 meteorological variables simultaneously from Digital Typhoon satellite images. The focus of this study is taken to be Taiwan, an area very vulnerable to typhoons. By comparing the performance of Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probability Model (CDDPM) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet), results suggest that the CDDPM performs best in generating accurate and realistic meteorological data. Specifically, CDDPM achieved a PSNR of 32.807, which is approximately 7.9% higher than CNN and 5.5% higher than SENet. Furthermore, CDDPM recorded an RMSE of 0.032, showing a 11.1% improvement over CNN and 8.6% improvement over SENet. A key application of this research can be for imputation purposes in missing meteorological datasets and generate additional high-quality meteorological data using satellite images. It is hoped that the results of this analysis will enable more robust and detailed forecasting, reducing the impact of severe weather events on vulnerable regions.

      <title>PuYun: Medium-Range Global Weather Forecasting Using Large Kernel Attention Convolutional Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate weather forecasting is essential for understanding and mitigating weather-related impacts. In this paper, we present PuYun, an autoregressive cascade model that leverages large kernel attention convolutional networks. The model's design inherently supports extended weather prediction horizons while broadening the effective receptive field. The integration of large kernel attention mechanisms within the convolutional layers enhances the model's capacity to capture fine-grained spatial details, thereby improving its predictive accuracy for meteorological phenomena.
  We introduce PuYun, comprising PuYun-Short for 0-5 day forecasts and PuYun-Medium for 5-10 day predictions. This approach enhances the accuracy of 10-day weather forecasting. Through evaluation, we demonstrate that PuYun-Short alone surpasses the performance of both GraphCast and FuXi-Short in generating accurate 10-day forecasts. Specifically, on the 10th day, PuYun-Short reduces the RMSE for Z500 to 720 $m^2/s^2$, compared to 732 $m^2/s^2$ for GraphCast and 740 $m^2/s^2$ for FuXi-Short. Additionally, the RMSE for T2M is reduced to 2.60 K, compared to 2.63 K for GraphCast and 2.65 K for FuXi-Short. Furthermore, when employing a cascaded approach by integrating PuYun-Short and PuYun-Medium, our method achieves superior results compared to the combined performance of FuXi-Short and FuXi-Medium. On the 10th day, the RMSE for Z500 is further reduced to 638 $m^2/s^2$, compared to 641 $m^2/s^2$ for FuXi. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our model ensemble in advancing medium-range weather prediction. Our training code and model will be open-sourced.</description>
