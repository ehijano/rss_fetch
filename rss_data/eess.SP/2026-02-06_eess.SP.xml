      <title>Phase-Only Positioning in Distributed MIMO Under Phase Impairments: AP Selection Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carrier phase positioning (CPP) can enable cm-level accuracy in next-generation wireless systems, while recent literature shows that accuracy remains high using phase-only measurements in distributed MIMO (D-MIMO). However, the impact of phase synchronization errors on such systems remains insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we first show that the proposed hyperbola intersection method achieves highly accurate positioning even in the presence of phase synchronization errors, when trained on appropriate data reflecting such impairments. We then introduce a deep learning (DL)-based D-MIMO antenna point (AP) selection framework that ensures high-precision localization under phase synchronization errors. Simulation results show that the proposed framework improves positioning accuracy compared to prior-art methods, while reducing inference complexity by approximately 19.7%.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Control for UAV-Assisted Mobile Target Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in mission-critical applications such as target tracking, where they must simultaneously sense dynamic environments, ensure reliable communication, and achieve precise control. A key challenge here is to jointly guarantee tracking accuracy, communication reliability, and control stability within a unified framework. To address this issue, we propose an integrated sensing, communication, and control (ISCC) framework for UAV-assisted target tracking, where the considered tracking system is modeled as a discrete-time linear control process, with the objective of driving the deviation between the UAV and target states toward zero. We formulate a stochastic model predictive control (MPC) optimization problem for joint control and beamforming design, which is highly non-convex and intractable in its original form. To overcome this difficulty, the target state is first estimated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Then, by deriving the closed-form optimal beamforming solution under a given control input, the original problem is equivalently reformulated into a tractable control-oriented form. Finally, we convexify the remaining non-convex constraints via a relaxation-based convex approximation, yielding a computationally tractable convex optimization problem that admits efficient global solution. Numerical results show that the proposed ISCC framework achieves tracking accuracy comparable to a non-causal benchmark while maintaining stable communication, and it significantly outperforms the conventional control and tracking method.</description>

      <title>A Migration-Assisted Deep Learning Scheme for Imaging Defects Inside Cylindrical Structures via GPR: A Case Study for Tree Trunks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has emerged as a prominent tool for imaging internal defects in cylindrical structures, such as columns, utility poles, and tree trunks. However, accurately reconstructing both the shape and permittivity of the defects inside cylindrical structures remains challenging due to complex wave scattering phenomena and the limited accuracy of the existing signal processing and deep learning techniques. To address these issues, this study proposes a migration-assisted deep learning scheme for reconstructing the shape and permittivity of defects within cylindrical structures. The proposed scheme involves three stages of GPR data processing. First, a dual-permittivity estimation network extracts the permittivity values of the defect and the cylindrical structure, the latter of which is estimated with the help of a novel structural similarity index measure-based autofocusing technique. Second, a modified Kirchhoff migration incorporating the extracted permittivity of the cylindrical structure maps the signals reflected from the defect to the imaging domain. Third, a shape reconstruction network processes the migrated image to recover the precise shape of the defect. The image of the interior defect is finally obtained by combining the reconstructed shape and extracted permittivity of the defect. The proposed scheme is validated using both synthetic and experimental data from a laboratory trunk model and real tree trunk samples. Comparative results show superior performance over existing deep learning methods, while generalization tests on live trees confirm its feasibility for in-field deployment. The underlying principle can further be applied to other circumferential GPR imaging scenarios.

      <title>Joint Optimization of Latency and Accuracy for Split Federated Learning in User-Centric Cell-Free MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a user-centric split federated learning (UCSFL) framework for user-centric cell-free multiple-input multiple-output (CF-MIMO) networks to support split federated learning (SFL). In the proposed UCSFL framework, users deploy split sub-models locally, while complete models are maintained and updated at access point (AP)-side distributed processing units (DPUs), followed by a two-level aggregation procedure across DPUs and the central processing unit (CPU). Under standard machine learning (ML) assumptions, we provide a theoretical convergence analysis for UCSFL, which reveals that the AP-cluster size is a key factor influencing model training accuracy. Motivated by this result, we introduce a new performance metric, termed the latency-to-accuracy ratio, defined as the ratio of a user's per-iteration training latency to the weighted size of its AP cluster. Based on this metric, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the maximum latency-to-accuracy ratio by jointly optimizing uplink power control, downlink beamforming, model splitting, and AP clustering. The resulting problem is decomposed into two sub-problems operating on different time scales, for which dedicated algorithms are developed to handle the short-term and long-term optimizations, respectively. Simulation results verify the convergence of the proposed algorithms and demonstrate that UCSFL effectively reduces the latency-to-accuracy ratio of the VGG16 model compared with baseline schemes. Moreover, the proposed framework adaptively adjusts splitting and clustering strategies in response to varying communication and computation resources. An MNIST-based handwritten digit classification example further shows that UCSFL significantly accelerates the convergence of the VGG16 model.</description>

      <title>Beamformed Fingerprint-Based Transformer Network for Trajectory Estimation and Path Determination in Outdoor mmWave MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio transmissions in millimeter wave (mmWave) bands have gained significant interest for applications demanding precise device localization and trajectory estimation. This paper explores novel neural network (NN) architectures suitable for trajectory estimation and path determination in a mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) outdoor system based on localization data from beamformed fingerprint (BFF). The NN architecture captures sequences of BFF signals from different users, and through the application of learning mechanisms, subsequently estimate their trajectories. In turn, this information is employed to find the shortest path to the target, thereby enabling more efficient navigation. Specifically, we propose a two-stage procedure for trajectory estimation and optimal path finding. In the first stage, a transformer network (TN) based on attention mechanisms is developed to predict trajectories of wireless devices using BFF sequences captured in a mmWave MIMO outdoor system. In the second stage, a novel algorithm based on Informed Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (iRRT*) is employed to determine the optimal path to target locations using trajectory estimates derived in the first stage. The effectiveness of the proposed schemes is validated through numerical experiments, using a comprehensive dataset of radio measurements, generated using ray tracing simulations to model outdoor propagation at 28 GHz. We show that our proposed TN-based trajectory estimator outperforms other methods from the recent literature and can successfully generalize to new trajectories outside the training set. Furthermore, our proposed iRRT* algorithm is able to consistently provide the shortest path to the target.</description>

      <title>Depth estimation of a monoharmonic source using a vertical linear array at fixed distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating the depth of a monoharmonic sound source at a fixed range using a vertical linear array (VLA) is challenging in the absence of seabed environmental parameters, and relevant research remains scarce. The orthogonality constrained modal search based depth estimation (OCMS-D) method is proposed in this paper, which enables the estimation of the depth of a monoharmonic source at a fixed range using a VLA under unknown seabed parameters. Using the sparsity of propagating normal modes and the orthogonality of mode depth functions, OCMS-D estimates the normal mode parameters under a fixed source-array distance at first. The estimated normal mode parameters are then used to estimate the source depth. To ensure the precision of the source depth estimation, the method utilizes information on both the amplitude distribution and the sign (positive/negative) patterns of the estimated mode depth functions at the inferred source depth. Numerical simulations evaluate the performance of OCMS-D under different conditions. The effectiveness of OCMS-D is also verified by the Yellow Sea experiment and the SWellEx-96 experiment. In the Yellow Sea experiment, the depth estimation absolute errors by OCMS-D with a 4-second time window are less than 2.4 m. And the depth estimation absolute errors in the SWellEx-96 experiment with a 10-second time window are less than 5.4 m for the shallow source and less than 10.8 m for the deep source.</description>

      <title>Physics-Aware Tensor Reconstruction for Radio Maps in Pixel-Based Fluid Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of pixel-based antennas and fluid antenna systems (FAS) is hindered by prohibitive channel state information (CSI) acquisition overhead. While radio maps enable proactive mode selection, reconstructing high-fidelity maps from sparse measurements is challenging. Existing physics-agnostic or data-driven methods often fail to recover fine-grained shadowing details under extreme sparsity. We propose a Physics-Regularized Low-Rank Tensor Completion (PR-LRTC) framework for radio map reconstruction. By modeling the signal field as a three-way tensor, we integrate environmental low-rankness with deterministic antenna physics. Specifically, we leverage Effective Aerial Degrees-of-Freedom (EADoF) theory to derive a differential gain topology map as a physical prior for regularization. The resulting optimization problem is solved via an efficient Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm. Simulations show that PR-LRTC achieves a 4 dB gain over baselines at a 10% sampling ratio. It effectively preserves sharp shadowing edges, providing a robust, physics-compliant solution for low-overhead beam management.</description>

      <title>Physics-Inspired Target Shape Detection and Reconstruction in mmWave Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of sensing and communication (ISAC) is an essential function of future wireless systems. Due to its large available bandwidth, millimeter-wave (mmWave) ISAC systems are able to achieve high sensing accuracy. In this paper, we consider the multiple base-station (BS) collaborative sensing problem in a multi-input multi-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) mmWave communication system. Our aim is to sense a remote target shape with the collected signals which consist of both the reflection and scattering signals. We first characterize the mmWave's scattering and reflection effects based on the Lambertian scattering model. Then we apply the periodogram technique to obtain rough scattering point detection, and further incorporate the subspace method to achieve more precise scattering and reflection point detection. Based on these, a reconstruction algorithm based on Hough Transform and principal component analysis (PCA) is designed for a single convex polygon target scenario. To improve the accuracy and completeness of the reconstruction results, we propose a method to further fuse the scattering and reflection points. Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Sound Field Estimation Using Optimal Transport Barycenters in the Presence of Phase Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a novel approach for estimating plane-wave coefficients in sound field reconstruction, specifically addressing challenges posed by error-in-variable phase perturbations. Such systematic errors typically arise from sensor mis-calibration, including uncertainties in sensor positions and response characteristics, leading to measurement-induced phase shifts in plane wave coefficients. Traditional methods often result in biased estimates or non-convex solutions. To overcome these issues, we propose an optimal transport (OT) framework. This framework operates on a set of lifted non-negative measures that correspond to observation-dependent shifted coefficients relative to the unperturbed ones. By applying OT, the supports of the measures are transported toward an optimal average in the phase space, effectively morphing them into an indistinguishable state. This optimal average, known as barycenter, is linked to the estimated plane-wave coefficients using the same lifting rule. The framework addresses the ill-posed nature of the problem, due to the large number of plane waves, by adding a constant to the ground cost, ensuring the sparsity of the transport matrix. Convex consistency of the solution is maintained. Simulation results confirm that our proposed method provides more accurate coefficient estimations compared to baseline approaches in scenarios with both additive noise and phase perturbations.</description>

      <title>Reciprocity Calibration of Dual-Antenna Repeaters via MMSE Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Bayesian reciprocity calibration method that consistently ensures uplink and downlink channel reciprocity in repeater-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The proposed algorithm is formulated under the minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion. Its Bayesian framework incorporates complete statistical knowledge of the signal model, noise, and prior distributions, enabling a coherent design that achieves both low computational complexity and high calibration accuracy. To further enhance phase alignment accuracy, which is critical for calibration tasks, we develop a von Mises denoiser that exploits the fact that the target parameters lie on the circle in the complex plane. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MMSE algorithm achieves substantially improved estimation accuracy compared with conventional deterministic non-linear least-squares (NLS) methods, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. Furthermore, the proposed method exhibits remarkably fast convergence, making it well suited for practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Discrete Aware Tensor Completion via Convexized $\ell_0$-Norm Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a novel algorithm, for the completion of partially observed low-rank tensors, where each entry of the tensor can be chosen from a discrete finite alphabet set, such as in common image processing problems, where the entries represent the RGB values. The proposed low-rank tensor completion (TC) method builds on the conventional nuclear norm (NN) minimization-based low-rank TC paradigm, through the addition of a discrete-aware regularizer, which enforces discreteness in the objective of the problem, by an $\ell_0$-norm regularizer that is approximated by a continuous and differentiable function normalized via fractional programming (FP) under a proximal gradient (PG) framework, in order to solve the proposed problem. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the new method both in terms of normalized mean square error (NMSE) and convergence, compared to the conventional state of-the-art (SotA) techniques, including NN minimization approaches, as well as a mixture of the latter with a matrix factorization approach.</description>

      <title>IDSOR: Intensity- and Distance-Aware Statistical Outlier Removal for Weather-Robust LiDAR Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LiDAR point clouds captured in rain or snow are often corrupted by weather-induced returns, which can degrade perception and safety-critical scene understanding. This paper proposes Intensity- and Distance-Aware Statistical Outlier Removal (IDSOR), a range-adaptive filtering method that jointly exploits intensity cues and neighborhood sparsity. By incorporating an empirical, range-dependent distribution of weather returns into the threshold design, IDSOR suppresses weather-induced points while preserving fine structural details without cumbersome manual parameter tuning. We also propose a variant that uses a previously proposed method to estimate the weather return distribution from data, and integrates it into IDSOR. Experiments on simulation-augmented level-crossing measurements and on the Winter Adverse Driving dataset (WADS) demonstrate that IDSOR achieves a favorable precision-recall trade-off, maintaining both precision and recall above 90% on WADS.</description>

      <title>Multi-Sensor Scheduling for Remote State Estimation over Wireless MIMO Fading Channels with Semantic Over-the-Air Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study multi-sensor scheduling for remote state estimation over wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels using a novel semantic over-the-air (SemOTA) aggregation approach. We first revisit Kalman filtering with conventional over-the-air (OTA) aggregation and highlight its transmit power limitations. To balance power efficiency and estimation performance, we formulate the scheduling task as a finite-horizon dynamic programming (DP) problem. By analyzing the structure of the optimal Q-function, we show that the resulting scheduling policy exhibits a semantic structure that adapts online to the estimation error covariance and channel variations. To obtain a practical solution, we derive a tractable upper bound on the Q-function via a positive semidefinite (PSD) cone decomposition, which enables an efficient approximate scheduling policy and a low-complexity remote estimation algorithm. Numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme outperforms existing methods in both estimation accuracy and power efficiency.</description>

      <title>GNSS SpAmming: a spoofing-based GNSS denial-of-service attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GNSSs are vulnerable to attacks of two kinds: jamming (i.e. denying access to the signal) and spoofing (i.e. impersonating a legitimate satellite). These attacks have been extensively studied, and we have a myriad of countermeasures to mitigate them. In this paper we expose a new type of attack: SpAmming, which combines both approaches to achieve the same effects in a more subtle way.
  Exploiting the CDMA multiplexing present in most GNSSs, and through a spoofing attack, this approach leads the receiver to lose access to the signal of a legitimate satellite, which would be equivalent to a denial of service; but in this case the existing countermeasures against jamming or spoofing would not allow safeguarding its effectiveness, as it is neither of them.
  An experimental proof-of-concept is presented in which its impact is evaluated as a function of the previous state of the receiver. Using an SDR-based system developed at the Space Security Centre, the attack is executed against a cold-started receiver, a warm-started receiver, and a receiver that has already acquired the PVT solution and is navigating. Different attack configurations are also tested, starting from a raw emission of the false signal, to surgical Doppler effect configuration, code offset, etc. Although it is shown to be particularly successful against cold-started receivers, the results show that it is also effective in other scenarios, especially if accompanied by other attacks. We will conclude the article by outlining possible countermeasures to detect and, eventually, counteract it; and possible avenues of research to better understand its impact, especially for authenticated services such as OSNMA, and to characterize it in order to improve the response to similar attacks.</description>

      <title>Low-complexity Design for Beam Coverage in Near-field and Far-field: A Fourier Transform Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study efficient beam coverage design for multi-antenna systems in both far-field and near-field cases. To reduce the computational complexity of existing sampling-based optimization methods, we propose a new low-complexity yet efficient beam coverage design. To this end, we first formulate a general beam coverage optimization problem to maximize the worst-case beamforming gain over a target region. For the far-field case, we show that the beam coverage design can be viewed as a spatial-frequency filtering problem, where angular coverage can be achieved by weight-shaping in the antenna domain via an inverse FT, yielding an infinite-length weighting sequence. Under the constraint of a finite number of antennas, a surrogate scheme is proposed by directly truncating this sequence, which inevitably introduces a roll-off effect at the angular boundaries, yielding degraded worst-case beamforming gain. To address this issue, we characterize the finite-antenna-induced roll-off effect, based on which a roll-off-aware design with a protective zoom is developed to ensure a flat beamforming-gain profile within the target angular region. Next, we extend the proposed method to the near-field case. Specifically, by applying a first-order Taylor approximation to the near-field channel steering vector (CSV), the two-dimensional (2D) beam coverage design (in both angle and inverse-range) can be transformed into a 2D inverse FT, leading to a low-complexity beamforming design. Furthermore, an inherent near-field range defocusing effect is observed, indicating that sufficiently wide angular coverage results in range-insensitive beam steering. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FT-based approach achieves a comparable worst-case beamforming performance with that of conventional sampling-based optimization methods while significantly reducing the computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Learning False Discovery Rate Control via Model-Based Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) in high-dimensional variable selection requires balancing rigorous error control with statistical power. Existing methods with provable guarantees are often overly conservative, creating a persistent gap between the realized false discovery proportion (FDP) and the target FDR level. We introduce a learning-augmented enhancement of the T-Rex Selector framework that narrows this gap. Our approach replaces the analytical FDP estimator with a neural network trained solely on diverse synthetic datasets, enabling a substantially tighter and more accurate approximation of the FDP. This refinement allows the procedure to operate much closer to the desired FDR level, thereby increasing discovery power while maintaining effective approximate control. Through extensive simulations and a challenging synthetic genome-wide association study (GWAS), we demonstrate that our method achieves superior detection of true variables compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Evaluating S-Band Interference: Impact of Satellite Systems on Terrestrial Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The co-existence of terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) is essential for achieving global coverage in sixth-generation cellular networks. Due to increasing spectrum demand, there is discussion in the world level to share some frequencies used in terrestrial Networks (TNs) with NTNs, resulting in co-channel interference and performance degradation. This paper analyzes the interference caused by satellite networks on TN in the S-band. We examined the transmission mechanisms of satellite signals and conducted simulations to evaluate interference intensity across varying slant ranges. Our findings indicate that the angle between the user equipment direction and the sub-satellite point direction from the beam center significantly impacts the interference level.</description>

      <title>Improved SINR Approximation for Downlink SDMA-based Networks with Outdated Channel State Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the performance of multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems under imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) remains a critical challenge in next-generation wireless networks. In this context, accurate statistical modeling of the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) is essential for enabling tractable performance analysis of multi-user systems. This paper presents an improved statistical approximation of the SINR for downlink (DL) MU-MIMO systems with imperfect CSIT. The proposed model retains the analytical simplicity of existing approaches (e.g., Gamma-based approximations) while overcoming their limitations, particularly the underestimation of SINR variance. We evaluate the proposed approximation in the context of Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA)-enabled MIMO DL systems with outdated CSIT. The results demonstrate excellent accuracy across a wide range of system configurations, including varying numbers of users, antennas, and degrees of CSIT staleness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plantar pressure measurement, or pedobarography, is an essential tool for analyzing human motion in healthy individuals and patients. Across the reviewed literature, sensor insoles are motivated as wearable, mobile solutions for assessing pressure distribution in applications including diabetic foot monitoring, rehabilitation guidance, assistive device control, and sports performance analysis. This review evaluates the current state of the art with particular attention to sensor technologies, sensor quantity and placement, participant cohorts, and reference standards. The focus lies on original works with innovative designs, preferably supported by ambulation experiments. The modalities covered include resistive, capacitive, inductive, piezoelectric, triboelectric, and optical sensing approaches. We identify a lack of proper sensor calibration, gait-based verification, and human study validation, and propose a gold standard based on testing machines and instrumented treadmills to ensure comparability across studies. The bidirectional interaction between insole insertion and foot-sole mechanics is examined, with tissue stiffness identified as a key source of uncertainty in sensor signals. Guidelines are provided for sensor dimensions and unobtrusive insole designs to foster natural gait. Finally, future directions include the development of multimodal sensors to compensate for the limitations of individual modalities and the emerging trend of multiaxial sensing for capturing shear components in pressure distributions.</description>

      <title>YOLO-based Bearing Fault Diagnosis With Continuous Wavelet Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03070v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter presents a locality-aware bearing fault diagnosis framework that operates on time-frequency representations and enables spatially interpretable decision-making. One-dimensional vibration signals are first mapped to two-dimensional time-frequency spectrograms using the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) with Morlet wavelets to enhance transient fault signatures. The diagnosis task is then formulated as object detection on the time-frequency plane, where YOLOv9, YOLOv10, and YOLOv11 are employed to localize fault-relevant regions and classify fault types simultaneously. Experiments on three public benchmarks, including Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Paderborn University (PU), and Intelligent Maintenance System (IMS), demonstrate strong cross-dataset generalization compared with a representative MCNN-LSTM baseline. In particular, YOLOv11 achieves mAP@0.5 of 99.0% (CWRU), 97.8% (PU), and 99.5% (IMS), while providing region-aware visualization of fault patterns in the time-frequency domain. These results suggest that detection-based inference on CWT spectrograms provides an effective and interpretable complementary approach to conventional global classification for rotating machinery condition monitoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that, in both theory and practice, the latent optimally partitioned (LOP)-$\ell_2/\ell_1$ penalty is effective for exploiting block-sparsity without knowledge of the concrete block structure. More precisely, we first present a novel theoretical result showing that the optimized block partition in the LOP-$\ell_2/\ell_1$ penalty satisfies a condition required for accurate recovery of block-sparse signals. Motivated by this result, we present a new application of the LOP-$\ell_2/\ell_1$ penalty to estimation of angular power spectrum, which is block-sparse with unknown block partition, in MIMO communication systems. Numerical simulations show that the proposed use of block-sparsity with the LOP-$\ell_2/\ell_1$ penalty significantly improves the estimation accuracy of the angular power spectrum.</description>

      <title>Compressed Multiband Sensing in FR3 Using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Joint detection and localization of users and scatterers in multipath-rich channels on multiple bands is critical for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 6G. Existing multiband sensing methods are limited by classical beamforming or computationally expensive approaches. This paper introduces alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-assisted compressed multiband sensing (CMS), hereafter referred to as ADMM-CMS, which is a novel framework for multiband sensing using uplink quadrature amplitude modulation-modulated pilot symbols. To solve the CMS problem, we develop an adaptive ADMM algorithm that adjusts to noise and ensures automatic stopping if converged. ADMM combines the decomposability of dual ascent with the robustness of augmented Lagrangian methods, making it suitable for large-scale structured optimization. Simulations show that ADMM-CMS achieves higher spatial resolution and improved denoising compared to Bartlett-type beamforming, yielding a 34 dB gain in per-antenna transmit power for achieving a 0.9 successful recovery probability (SRP). Moreover, compared to performing compressed sensing separately on the constituent 7 GHz and 10 GHz sub-bands, ADMM-CMS achieves reductions in delay root mean squared error of 34.46% and 40.76%, respectively, at -41 dBm per-antenna transmit power, while also yielding improved SRP. Our findings demonstrate ADMM-CMS as an efficient enabler of ISAC in frequency range 3 (FR3, 7-24 GHz) for 6G systems.</description>

      <title>Opportunistic Screening of Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome using Single-Lead AI-ECG Mobile System: A Real-World Study of over 3.5 million ECG Recordings in China</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome, a congenital cardiac conduction abnormality with low prevalence, carries a significant risk of sudden cardiac death. Early identification remains challenging due to screening costs and professional resource scarcity. This retrospective real-world study systematically evaluates an integrated Artificial Intelligence-enabled mobile screening system comprising portable single-lead devices, AI primary screening, and cardiologist review. Analyzing 3,566,626 ECG records from 87,836 individuals between 2019 and 2025, the AI model achieved an AUC of 0.6676 and a specificity of 95.92% in complex real-world signal environments. Despite predictive probability bias inherent in ultra-low prevalence contexts, the model demonstrated stable risk stratification, with high-confidence scores concentrated among true positive individuals. The risk of detecting WPW in AI-positive records was 86.2-fold higher than in AI-negative records. By implementing a human-AI collaborative workflow, the volume of ECGs requiring manual review was reduced by approximately 99.5% compared to universal screening. In an ideal collaborative scenario, an average of only 18 ECGs required review to confirm one WPW case, representing a more than 60-fold increase in screening efficiency. Compared to traditional 12-lead ECGs and electrophysiological studies, this system significantly reduced time and medical costs. Our findings suggest that a risk-stratification-based human-AI collaborative system provides a promising paradigm for the early public health detection of low-prevalence, high-risk arrhythmias.</description>

      <title>Division-based Receiver-agnostic RFF Identification in WiFi Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In physical-layer security schemes, radio frequency fingerprint (RFF) identification of WiFi devices is susceptible to receiver differences, which can significantly degrade classification performance when a model is trained on one receiver but tested on another. In this paper, we propose a division-based receiver-agnostic RFF extraction method for WiFi systems, which removes the receivers' effects by dividing different preambles in the frequency domain. The proposed method requires only a single receiver for training and does not rely on additional calibration or stacking processes. First, for flat fading channel scenarios, the legacy short training field (L-STF) and legacy long training field (L-LTF) of the unknown device are divided by those of the reference device in the frequency domain. The receiver-dependent effects can be eliminated with the requirement of only a single receiver for training, and the higher-dimensional RFF features can be extracted. Second, for frequency-selective fading channel scenarios, the high-throughput long training field (HT-LTF) is divided by the L-LTF in the frequency domain. Only a single receiver is required for training and the higher-dimensional RFF features that are both channel-invariant and receiver-agnostic are extracted. Finally, simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively mitigate the impacts of channel variations and receiver differences. The classification results show that, even when training on a single receiver and testing on a different one, the proposed method achieves classification accuracy improvements of 15.5% and 28.45% over the state-of-the-art approach in flat fading and frequency-selective fading channel scenarios, respectively.</description>

      <title>UniverSR: Unified and Versatile Audio Super-Resolution via Vocoder-Free Flow Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a vocoder-free framework for audio super-resolution that employs a flow matching generative model to capture the conditional distribution of complex-valued spectral coefficients. Unlike conventional two-stage diffusion-based approaches that predict a mel-spectrogram and then rely on a pre-trained neural vocoder to synthesize waveforms, our method directly reconstructs waveforms via the inverse Short-Time Fourier Transform (iSTFT), thereby eliminating the dependence on a separate vocoder. This design not only simplifies end-to-end optimization but also overcomes a critical bottleneck of two-stage pipelines, where the final audio quality is fundamentally constrained by vocoder performance. Experiments show that our model consistently produces high-fidelity 48 kHz audio across diverse upsampling factors, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both speech and general audio datasets.</description>

      <title>Approximating Analytically-Intractable Likelihood Densities with Deterministic Arithmetic for Optimal Particle Filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle filtering algorithms have enabled practical solutions to problems in autonomous robotics (self-driving cars, UAVs, warehouse robots), target tracking, and econometrics, with further applications in speech processing and medicine (patient monitoring). Yet, their inherent weakness at representing the likelihood of the observation (which often leads to particle degeneracy) remains unaddressed for real-time resource-constrained systems. Improvements such as the optimal proposal and auxiliary particle filter mitigate this issue under specific circumstances and with increased computational cost. This work presents a new particle filtering method and its implementation, which enables tunably-approximative representation of arbitrary likelihood densities as program transformations of parametric distributions.Our method leverages a recent computing platform thatcan perform deterministic computation on probability distributionrepresentations (UxHw) without relying on stochastic methods.For non-Gaussian non-linear systems and with an optimal-auxiliary particle filter, we benchmark the likelihood evaluation error and speed for a total of 294840 evaluation points. For such models, the results show that the UxHw method leads to as much as 37.7x speedup compared to the Monte Carlo alternative. For narrow uniform measurement uncertainty, the particle filter falsely assigns zero likelihood as much as 81.89% of the time whereas UxHw achieves 1.52% false-zero rate. The UxHw approach achieves filter RMSE improvement of as much as 18.9% (average 3.3%) over the Monte Carlo alternative.</description>

Given a nonnegative data matrix $X$, it aims at finding two lower dimensional matrices, $W$ and $H$, such that $X\approx WH$, where the factors $W$ and $H$ are constrained to be element-wise nonnegative. The factor $W$ serves as a basis for the columns of $X$. In order to obtain more interpretable and unique solutions, minimum-volume NMF (MinVol NMF) minimizes the volume of $W$. In this paper, we consider the dual approach, where the volume of $H$ is maximized instead; this is referred to as maximum-volume NMF (MaxVol NMF). MaxVol NMF is identifiable under the same conditions as MinVol NMF in the noiseless case, but it behaves rather differently in the presence of noise. In practice, MaxVol NMF is much more effective to extract a sparse decomposition and does not generate rank-deficient solutions. In fact, we prove that the solutions of MaxVol NMF with the largest volume correspond to clustering the columns of $X$ in disjoint clusters, while the solutions of MinVol NMF with smallest volume are rank deficient. We propose two algorithms to solve MaxVol NMF. We also present a normalized variant of MaxVol NMF that exhibits better performance than MinVol NMF and MaxVol NMF, and can be interpreted as a continuum between standard NMF and orthogonal NMF. We illustrate our results in the context of hyperspectral unmixing.</description>
