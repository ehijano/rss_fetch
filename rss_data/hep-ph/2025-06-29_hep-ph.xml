      <title>Ultralight Dilatonic Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dilaton, a pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) of broken scale invariance, is an appealing ultralight dark matter (DM) candidate. Its mass is protected by conformal invariance and it can be searched for in tabletop experiments. However, contrary to standard pNGBs of internal symmetries, the dilaton generically has a large non-derivative self-coupling, leading to radiative contributions to its mass of the order of its decay constant. Hence typical ultralight dilatons should also have sub-eV decay constants, which would incur significant deviations from standard DM behavior at structure formation times, in severe tension with observations. Therefore, a fine-tuning is required to generate a hierarchy between the mass and the decay constant. In this work, we consider whether supersymmetry (SUSY) can be used to protect this hierarchy from quantum corrections. To ensure an ultralight dilaton mass robust against realistic SUSY-breaking contributions, we must consider a novel dilaton stabilization mechanism. The observed DM abundance can be produced by the misalignment mechanism for dilaton masses ranging from $10^{-11}$ to $1$ eV. Unfortunately, irreducible SUSY-breaking corrections due to gravity restrict the couplings between the dilaton and the Standard Model to be extremely small, beyond the reach of any current or proposed experiments. Our work demonstrates that constructing a consistent model of ultralight dilaton DM is quite involved.</description>

      <title>Lessons from LHCb and Belle II measurements of $B\to J/\psi \pi$ and $B\to J/\psi K$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LHCb collaboration has recently measured the CP asymmetry in $B^+\to J/\psi\pi^+$ decay, while the Belle II collaboration has recently measured the CP asymmetries in $B^0\to J/\psi\pi^0$ decay. Within the Standard Model, and using flavor-$SU(3)$ relations including first-order breaking corrections, these measurements lead to new predictions with regard to CP violation in $B^+\to J/\psi K^+$ and $B_s\to J/\psi\overline{K}{}^0$ decays, the difference between $S_{\psi K_S}$ and $\sin2\beta$, and the rate and CP asymmetries in $B_s\to J/\psi\pi^0$ decay.</description>

      <title>A joint explanation for the soft lepton and monojet LHC excesses in the wino-bino model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new recasts of the CMS Run 2 soft-leptons + missing energy analysis and the ATLAS Run 2 multijet + missing energy analysis. These analyses are relevant for probing the parameter space of electroweak-charged particles with compressed spectra. We review these analyses and detail their implementation and validation in HackAnalysis (for CMS) and MadAnalysis 5 (ATLAS). We then use these new recasts to combine four LHC analyses to identify a region of parameter space of the "wino-bino" simplified model, which corresponds to a limit of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model in which higgsinos are decoupled, that is preferred over the Standard Model by excesses in the data. We find that the favoured region is compatible with the observed dark matter relic density, assuming freeze out within a standard cosmology, and we comment on the importance of this result and on how the simplified model should be mapped onto a complete supersymmetric model.</description>

      <title>Natural neutrino mass hierarchy in a theory of gauge flavour deconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how a natural neutrino mass hierarchy with large lepton mixing angles may be achieved in a theory of gauge flavour deconstruction. Hitherto it has been shown that neutrino anarchy may result from such theories, but here we show that this need not necessarily be the case. In particular we consider the minimal tri-hypercharge theory, and show that the decomposition of the family hypercharges into the corresponding $B-L$ gauge groups, together with the charged lepton mass hierarchy, implies the sequential dominance conditions for a neutrino mass hierarchy, where lepton mixing originates from both the neutrino and charged lepton sectors. We present novel and model-independent sequential dominance results applicable to this case, but also useful more generally. We also show how natural quark mass and mixing are included in such a framework.</description>

      <title>Matching HEFT and SMEFT in double and triple Higgs production from weak boson fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the matching between the two most popular effective field theories for beyond standard model Higgs physics, SMEFT and HEFT. To perform this matching we follow the approach of identifying the corresponding scattering amplitudes for physical processes in both theories, instead of the most usual approach of relating the corresponding effective Lagrangians or effective actions. In this work we focus on the physical processes of double and triple Higgs production from weak boson fusion, in particular, $WW \to HH$, $ZZ \to HH$, $WW \to HHH$ and $ZZ \to HHH$ and complement them with the elastic scattering $HH \to HH$. We present here the analytical solution to this matching in terms of relations among the coefficients in both theories and comment on the most relevant phenomenological implications of such relations for collider physics.</description>

      <title>Evidence for and implications of a dark photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed the first global QCD analysis of electron-nucleon deep-inelastic scattering and related high-energy data by including the contribution from a dark photon. Our results revealed a significant reduction in $\chi^2$ relative to the baseline result without new physics. From a hypothesis test, our best dark photon fit is preferred over the Standard Model by as much as $6.5\ \sigma$, providing the first hint for the existence of a dark photon, although indirectly. Additionally, we explored the implications of a dark photon in party-violating electron scattering, rare kaon decay, and the electroweak precision observables. The dark photon as a portal connecting to dark matter particles was also discussed.</description>

      <title>The nature of the $P_c$ states from compositeness criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a coupled-channel approach, we investigate the structures of four $P_c$ states through compositeness criteria. Towards a more precise description of the states, we have obtained refined fit results of the LHCb data on the $J/\psi p$ invariant mass distribution of the $\Lambda_b^0\to J/\psi p K^-$ decay. Allowing for the fact that each of the four $P_c$ states couples strongly to a nearby $S$-wave channel, three criteria on the compositeness/elementariness are adopted in this study: the pole-counting rule, the spectral density function, and the Gamow wave function. Compositeness information is extracted from the scattering amplitudes and the pole parameters (pole positions and residues), without any preconceived assumptions on the nature of the $P_c$ states. Consistently within the framework of all the three methods, it has been found that the $P_c(4312)\,1/2^-$ is mainly composed by $\bar{D}\Sigma_c$, $P_c(4380)\,3/2^-$ by $\bar{D}\Sigma_c^*$, while the $P_c(4440)\,1/2^-$ and $P_c(4457)\,3/2^-$ states are both turn out as composite states of $\bar{D}^*\Sigma_c$. The upper limits of the values of their elementariness are estimated to be rather small. This paper provides an additional confirmation of the molecular interpretation for the $P_c$ states in the literature.</description>

      <title>Polarization observables in semileptonic $V\to P$ decays of quarkonia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the weak semileptonic decays of the charmonium $J/\psi$ and bottomonium $\Upsilon(1S)$ into a pseudoscalar meson, namely, the $J/\psi\to D_{(s)}\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell$ and $\Upsilon(1S)\to B_{(c)}\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell$ decays. We focus on the polarization observables including the forward-backward asymmetry, final lepton polarization, and lepton-side convexity parameter. In order to define these quantities, we apply the helicity amplitude method and obtain a twofold angular decay distribution for a general $V\to P\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell$ case. The hadronic form factors are taken from our previous work, where they were calculated in the Covariant Confined Quark Model. We provide theoretical predictions for the polarization observables and compare them with the literature.</description>

      <title>Eigenstates in coupled-channel scattering amplitude and their effects on spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In general, discrete eigenstates such as resonances are represented by poles of the scattering amplitude, analytically continued to the complex energy plane. In multi-channel scattering, however, the Riemann surface becomes more complicated, leading to the emergence of various types of poles with distinct characteristics. In this study, we investigate the relationship between poles located on different Riemann sheets and analyze how they influence the observable spectra. In particular, we clarify the effect of the decay channel on the pole trajectory, where an $s$-wave bound state evolves into a resonance via a virtual state. It is shown that the quasibound state pole below the threshold does not continuously connected to the resonance pole above the threshold, and a kind of interchange of poles occurs. As a concrete example, we consider several models based on the chiral unitary approach that describe meson-baryon scattering amplitudes involving the $\Xi(1620)$ and $\Xi(1690)$ resonances. We examine their impact on the $\pi\Xi$ invariant mass distributions in the $\Xi_{c} \to \pi\pi\Xi$ decay, discussing how the pole structure manifests itself in experimental observables.</description>

      <title>Collins function for pion-in-jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions: a test of universality and factorization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an updated study of the Collins azimuthal asymmetries for pion-in-jet production in polarized $pp$ collisions. To this aim, we employ a recent extraction of the transversity and Collins fragmentation functions from semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and $e^+ e^-$ annihilation into hadron pairs processes, obtained within a simplified transverse momentum dependent (TMD) approach at leading order and adopting a collinear configuration for the initial state. Our theoretical estimates, when compared against 200 GeV and 510 GeV (preliminary) data from the STAR Collaboration, show a generally good agreement for the $p_{{\rm j}T}$ (the transverse momentum of the jet), $z$ and $j_T$ (the pion longitudinal momentum fraction and its transverse momentum with respect to the jet direction) distributions. This corroborates the hypothesis of the universality of the Collins function as well as of the TMD factorization for such processes and, once again, of a reduced impact of the proper TMD evolution on azimuthal asymmetries. We will also present predictions based on an extraction of the Collins and transversity distributions where information from data on single spin asymmetry for inclusive pion production in $p^\uparrow p$ collisions is included through a Bayesian reweighting procedure.</description>

      <title>Study of excited $D$ and $D_s$ mesons in a relativized quark model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use a modified relativistic quark model to study the properties of excited charmed and charmed strange mesons. We calculate the masses and wave functions of conventional charmed and charmed strange mesons incorporating both spin and $S$-$D$ mixing effects and fit parameters of the potential model with known experimental states using differential evolution technique. Using Leading Born-Oppenheimer expansion, we also compute the spectrum and wave functions of first gluonic excited state of charmed and charmed strange mesons. We examine the effects of gluonic excitation on the spectrum of resultant hybrid mesons. By using our calculated spectrum and wave functions, we determine the radiative transitions of the conventional and hybrid open charm mesons. We compare our calculations with experimental data and other works. We expect our results will be beneficial in the detection of the charmed and charmed strange conventional and hybrids mesons.</description>

      <title>Constraint on ultralight Nelson-Barr dark matter from time-dependent nuclear decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many experiments have notably reported anomalies in radioactive decay rates with periodic variations and challenged the traditional belief of time-independent decays. This periodicity could potentially be explained by the presence of a periodic dark matter (DM) candidate. In this work, we investigate the impact of time-dependent nuclear decay rates on the ultralight scalar DM in Nelson-Barr solution to the strong CP problem. The light scalar DM field in this framework induces periodic modulations of both CKM matrix elements and quark mass parameters. These modulations generate corresponding periodic perturbations in the neutron-proton mass difference and nuclear binding energies. Consequently, nuclear decay rates receive oscillating residuals. By analyzing the tritium decay rate, we derive new exclusion bounds on the Nelson-Barr DM parameters.</description>

      <title>Magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson effects in an interacting hadron gas in the presence of an external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The universality of electric charge as a quantum number allows thermoelectric properties to manifest across diverse systems, starting from a hot quantum chromodynamics matter in heavy-ion collisions at a high energy scale to semiconductors in condensed matter systems at a low energy scale. In this work, we explore the emergence of magneto-transport phenomena, specifically the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson effects, in a hot and dense hadronic medium produced in relativistic heavy-ion collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider energies. These phenomena arise due to the combined influence of temperature gradients and non-zero baryon chemical potential, particularly in the presence of an external magnetic field. Using the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation within the relaxation time approximation, we analyze the behavior of the hadronic medium considering different frameworks of hadron resonance gas models. The presence of external magnetic fields breaks the isotropy of the thermoelectric transport coefficient matrix, giving rise to new components of the Thomson coefficient, namely, magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients. For the first time, we estimate the magneto-Thomson and transverse Thomson coefficients, which originate from the temperature dependence of the magneto-Seebeck coefficient and Nernst coefficient, respectively, in hadron gas under the influence of a magnetic field. Our findings provide a novel perspective on the higher-order thermoelectric properties of the hot and dense hadronic medium in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, the off-shell electromagnetic pion form factors in the Bethe-Salpeter formalism are considered. The separable kernel of the first rank quark-antiquark interaction is used to solve the equation analytically.The semi-off-shell pion form factors \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \), which are related to each other by the Ward-Takahashi identity, are calculated. The obtained off-shell form factors as well as static properties of the pion are compared with the results of other authors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform an extensive analysis of the light CP-even Higgs boson pole mass in the MSSM and its dependencies on various parameters based on the 3-loop \texttt{Flexible-EFTHiggs} hybrid calculation which is implemented and publicly avaiable since recently in \texttt{FlexibleSUSY}. Our focus lies on the study of the robustness of the approach in scenarios of highly non-degenerate SUSY mass spectra. Also, we present an improved Higgs mass calculation in the NMSSM based on the same approach, which is published in the new version 2.9.0 of \texttt{FlexibleSUSY} as well. The calculation provides a treatment in the full-model parametrization, leading to an advantageous resummation of QCD-enhanced terms in the stop-mixing parameter and includes important 2-loop contributions as well as 3-loop QCD contributions in the MSSM limit. We assess the reliability of this new calculation by applying it to several distinct NMSSM scenarios. In this context, special attention is devoted to the estimation of NMSSM-specific theory uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions and gravitational waves in a non-abelian vector dark matter scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a scenario where the Standard Model is extended by a SU(2) gauge group in the dark sector. The three associated dark gauge bosons are stabilised via a custodial symmetry triggered by an addition dark SU(2) scalar doublet, thus making them viable dark-matter candidates. After considering the most recent constraints for this model, we analyse the phase transition dynamics and compute the power spectrum of resulting stochastic gravitational-wave background. Finally, we find regions of the parameter space yielding the observed dark-matter relic density while also leading to strong enough phase transition with an associated gravitational-wave signal reaching the sensitivity of future space-based gravitational-wave detector, such as LISA, DECIGO, BBO, TianQin or Taiji.</description>

      <title>Aligned Zee-Grimus-Neufeld model for $(g-2)_\mu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent result of the Fermilab Muon g-2 experiment is still in conflict with the SM prediction if dispersive methods are used as input for the hadronic vacuum polarization. We seek models where the same set of mediators around the weak scale or above contribute to neutrino masses and to the muon $g-2$ through a chiral enhanced contribution. As family lepton number violation is inherent to the former, non-negligible charged lepton flavor violation will be induced. We arrive at the following field content additional to the SM: one Higgs doublet, one singly charged scalar and one righthanded neutrino. Neutrino masses will be generated by a combination of mechanisms: tree-level seesaw, Zee mechanism and Grimus-Neufeld mechanism while lepton flavor violation will be minimized by considering Yukawa aligned Higgs doublets. The setting is flexible enough to account for $(g-2)_\mu$, the Cabibbo angle anomaly and the $W$ mass deviation while avoiding dangerous CLFV.</description>

      <title>Meson-baryon scattering lengths without annihilation diagrams to order $p^4$ in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the threshold $T$ matrices of the meson and baryon processes that have no annihilation diagrams: $\pi^{+}\Sigma^{+}$, $\pi^{+}\Xi^0$, $K^+p$, $K^+n$, and $\bar{K}^0\Xi^0$ to the fourth order in heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory. By performing least squares and Bayesian fits to the non-physical lattice QCD data, we determine the low-energy constants through both perturbative and non-perturbative iterative methods. By using these low-energy constants, we obtain the physical scattering lengths in these fits. The values of the scattering lengths tend to be convergent at the fourth order in the perturbative method. The scattering lengths for the five channels, obtained by taking the median values from four different fitting approaches, are $a_{\pi^+\Sigma^+}=-0.16\pm 0.07\,\text{fm}$, $a_{\pi^+\Xi^0}=-0.04\pm0.04\,\text{fm}$, $a_{K^+p}=-0.41\pm 0.11\,\text{fm}$, $a_{K^+n}=-0.19\pm 0.10\,\text{fm}$, and $a_{\bar{K}^0\Xi^0}=-0.30\pm 0.07\,\text{fm}$, where the uncertainties are conservatively estimated by taking the maximum deviation between the median and extreme values of the statistical errors.</description>

      <title>A Common Origin of Asymmetric Self-interacting Dark Matter and Dirac Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assuming dark matter to be asymmetric as well as self-interacting and neutrinos to be Dirac fermions, we propose a framework to address the observed baryon imbalance of the universe. We add three right-handed neutrinos $\nu_{R_i},\,{i=1,2,3}$, one singlet fermion $\chi$, a doublet fermion $\psi$, and heavy scalar doublets $\eta_i,\,{i=1,2}$ to the Standard Model. Both $\chi$ and $\psi$ are fermions with non-zero charge under an extended $U(1)_{B-L} \times U(1)_D$ symmetry. Additionally, a $\mathcal{Z}_2$ symmetry is imposed, where the singlets $\chi$, $\nu_R$, and $\eta$ are negative and the doublet $\psi$ is positive. Given the assumption that neutrinos are Dirac particles, $B-L$ turns into an exact symmetry of the universe. The CP-violating out-of-equilibrium decay of heavy scalar $\eta$ generates an equal and opposite $B-L$ asymmetry among the left-handed ($\nu_L$) and right-handed ($\nu_R$) neutrinos. The $\nu_L-\nu_R$ equilibration process does not take place until below the Electroweak phase transition scale because of tiny Yukawa couplings. During this time, Sphaleron processes, which are active at temperatures higher than 100 GeV, transform a portion of the $B-L$ asymmetry stored in left-handed neutrinos into baryon asymmetry. MeV scale gauge boson $Z'$ of $U(1)_D$ sector mediates both annihilation of symmetric dark matter component and self-interaction among dark matter particles. Moreover, $Z'$ mixes with the Standard Model Z-boson and provides a portal for dark matter direct detection.</description>

      <title>QCD sum rule analysis of $J^{PC}=1^{--}$ light hybrid mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a comprehensive next-to-leading order (NLO) QCD sum rule analysis of the light hybrid meson with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{--}$. Utilizing both Laplace sum rules (LSR) and Gaussian sum rules (GSR), we investigate the two-point correlation function of the light hybrid interpolating current, including condensates up to dimension-8. A conservative range $2-2.5\text{GeV}$ is obtained. Notably, the GSR yield mass predictions $2.27\text{GeV}$ for the $s\bar{s}g$ and $2.19\text{GeV}$ for $u\bar{u}g$. This result is notably lower than many previous sum rule estimates and significantly reduces the discrepancy with predictions from lattice QCD and flux-tube models. This result revitalizes the interpretation of the $\phi(2170)$ resonance as a possible candidate for the light vector hybrid meson.</description>

      <title>You never have enough J/$\psi$ events: the case for a J/$\psi$ factory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a talk at an IHEP-Beijing symposium celebrating the 50th anniversary of the discovery of the J/$\psi$, I reminisced about some of the interesting phenomena that were observed in J/$\psi$ decays in the BES, BESII, and BESIII detectors during the 35 year long BES experimental program. The three order of magnitude increase in the J/$\psi$ event samples and the improved detector capabilities that occurred during this time led to a persistent series of interesting discoveries and new insights. As more J/$\psi$ events were collected, the scientific interest in them increased and the breadth of physics topics that are addressed by them expanded. In addition, I speculated on what might happen if, in the next few decades, the magnitude of J/$\psi$ data samples and the detector capabilities continued to increase at similar paces. In particular, I emphasize the possibilities of searches for CP violation in strange hyperon decays and testing the CPT~theorem with strangeness-tagged neutral kaon decays.</description>

      <title>Infrared foundations for quantum geometry I: Catalogue of totally symmetric rank-three field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We systematically obtain all linear models which propagate a totally symmetric rank-three field without parity violation on a flat background. Each such model is defined exclusively by its gauge symmetry, a necessary property of effective field theories in the infrared limit. By comparison, models obtained by other means (tuning couplings or cherry-picking operators) may be unstable against radiative corrections. For each model, we compute the spectrum of massless and massive particles, and the no-ghost-no-tachyon constraints on the couplings. We conclude that foundational models exist which can propagate one massless particle of spin one or spin three in isolation, or both particles simultaneously, generalising the model of Campoleoni and Francia. Our algorithm for detecting symmetric models is grounded in particle physics methods, being based directly on the Wigner decomposition of the field. Compared to our recent analysis of the totally symmetric rank-three field (whose results we confirm and extend) our new algorithm does not require an ansatz for the symmetry transformation, and is not restricted to so-called 'free' symmetries.</description>

      <title>CaloHadronic: a diffusion model for the generation of hadronic showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulating showers of particles in highly-granular calorimeters is a key frontier in the application of machine learning to particle physics. Achieving high accuracy and speed with generative machine learning models can enable them to augment traditional simulations and alleviate a major computing constraint. Recent developments have shown how diffusion based generative shower simulation approaches that do not rely on a fixed structure, but instead generate geometry-independent point clouds, are very efficient. We present a transformer-based extension to previous architectures which were developed for simulating electromagnetic showers in the highly granular electromagnetic calorimeter of the International Large Detector, ILD. The attention mechanism now allows us to generate complex hadronic showers with more pronounced substructure across both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. This is the first time that machine learning methods are used to holistically generate showers across the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter in highly granular imaging calorimeter systems.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the minimum orbital period in the background of 5-dimensional charged black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the upper and lower bounds on the minimum orbital period of 5-dimensional charged black holes. Our results indicate that the upper bound of the minimum orbital period corresponds to non-charged black holes, while the lower bound is achieved in the case of maximally charged black holes. We further establish precise analytical expressions for the upper and lower bounds of the minimum orbital period. Our findings provide valuable insights into 5-dimensional charged black holes and help constrain theoretical gravity models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how to map kinetic theories for spinning particles in curved space to flat space through choice of inertial frame that eliminate forces acting on momentum and spin, thus putting the idea of mimicking off-equilibrium state by metric perturbation to equilibrium state on firm ground. The equivalence has been shown for hydrodynamic and elastic regimes. In the latter case, we predict spin polarization induced by time-variation of strain in elastic matter.</description>

      <title>Updated constraints on Regge-Teitelboim gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Regge-Teitelboim model, gravity is described by embedding the space-time manifold in a (usually flat) fixed higher-dimensional background, where the embedding coordinates, rather than the metric tensor, are the dynamical degrees of freedom. Stern \&amp; Xu extended the Regge-Teitelboim framework to encompass scenarios where the background embedding space is not flat, noting that when the background is a five-dimensional de Sitter space, the Robertson-Walker manifold undergoes a transition from a decelerating phase to an accelerating one. Previously, we constrained this model using only low-redshift observations. Here we further explore the observational constraints on this scenario, and report significantly more stringent constraints by including high-redshift data, specifically from the cosmic microwave background. Our results are consistent with $\Lambda$CDM, with the putative model-specific energy component responsible for the recent acceleration being constrained to $\Omega_{RT}&lt;0.006$ and the de Sitter curvature radius in units of the Hubble constant being constrained to $LH_0&gt;1.45$, both at the 95 percent confidence level.</description>

Abstract: The effective field theory (EFT) construction when the objects of interest are the In-In (or real time) correlators rather than the In-Out S-matrix elements is constructed. This is done using the formal equivalence between the In-In and In-Out correlation functions, and demanding that the EFT and the full theory provide the same answers for the In-In correlation functions. Matching coefficients for a simple example are provided including for operators with two or more space or time derivatives. It is also pointed out that the Schrodinger representation of QFT captures some of the desired features of these calculations in a natural way and may actually serve as a link between these calculations and the broader amplitude programme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note the nucleon-quark diquark-exchange interaction is derived using the Feynman-propagator for axial-vector diquark (D) exchange. The Feynman diquark propagator is derived and the result is a (-)-sign difference w.r.t. quark-antiquark exchange. This is due to the (-)-sign for a closed fermion loop, present in for example vector and axial-vector quark-antiquark exchange, but absent in the case of D-exchange. The calculations in these notes follow closely those for vacuum polarisation in the literature. Taking into account that the diquark D is a color $\left{\bar{3}_c\right\}$-state giving a factor +2. The result is an effective axial-vector diquark propagator. Application to $QN \rightarrow NQ$ gives a repulsive potential, which has been used in mixed nuclear-quark matter calculation.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the mixing between flavor-singlet light meson and charmonium operators in the S-wave channels, i.e. pseudo-scalar and vector channel, at two different pion masses. We measure statistically significant non-zero correlations between operators with different quark content corresponding to off-diagonal entries of a flavor-singlet mixing correlation matrix. By solving a GEVP we extract the low-lying energy spectrum and compare it with the one obtained by the different types of operators separately. We also calculate the overlaps between the states created by different operators and the energy eigenstates of the theory and find that all types of operators contribute to resolve the states of interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1906.02754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simplified Template Cross Sections (STXS) have been adopted by the LHC experiments as a common framework for Higgs measurements. Their purpose is to reduce the theoretical uncertainties that are directly folded into the measurements as much as possible, while at the same time allowing for the combination of the measurements between different decay channels as well as between experiments. We report the complete, revised definition of the STXS kinematic bins (stage 1.1 and stage 1.2), which have been used for the measurements by the ATLAS and CMS experiments using the full LHC Run 2 datasets. The main focus is on the four dominant Higgs production processes, namely gluon-fusion, vector-boson fusion, production in association with a vector boson and in association with a $t\bar t$ pair. We also comment briefly on the treatment of other production modes.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Algorithm for Model-Independent Searches for New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.02181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.02181v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel quantum technique to search for unmodeled anomalies in multidimensional binned collider data. We propose associating an Ising lattice spin site with each bin, with the Ising Hamiltonian suitably constructed from the observed data and a corresponding theoretical expectation. In order to capture spatially correlated anomalies in the data, we introduce spin-spin interactions between neighboring sites, as well as self-interactions. The ground state energy of the resulting Ising Hamiltonian can be used as a new test statistic, which can be computed either classically or via adiabatic quantum optimization. We demonstrate that our test statistic outperforms some of the most commonly used goodness-of-fit tests. The new approach greatly reduces the look-elsewhere effect by exploiting the typical differences between statistical noise and genuine new physics signals.</description>

      <title>Effect of interactions on the topological expression for the chiral separation effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.12261v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the absence of interactions the conductivity of chiral separation effect (CSE) in the system of massless fermions is given by topological expression. Interactions might change the pattern drastically. However, we prove that the CSE conductivity is still given by the topological invariant composed of the Green functions at zero temperature as long as the chiral symmetry is present, and if the renormalized axial current is considered. This allows to predict its appearance with the standard value of conductivity per Dirac fermion $\sigma_{CSE} = \frac{1}{2 \pi^2}$ in quark - gluon matter at $T = 0$ and sufficiently large baryon chemical potential, in the hypothetical phase with restored chiral symmetry and without color superconductivity. This phase may be realized inside the neutron stars. We also argue that the same topological expression for the CSE may be observed in Weyl semimetals, which realize the system of interacting relativistic fermions in solid state systems. In order to estimate the non - perturbative corrections to $\sigma_{CSE}$ within QCD at finite temperatures we apply method of field correlators developed by Yu.A.Simonov. As expected, above the deconfinement crossover the topological expression is approached within the quark - gluon plasma phase, when the quark chemical potential is sufficiently large. However, we observe that this occurs only when quark chemical potential is much larger than the thermal (Debye) mass. This range of parameters appears to be far out of the region accessible at the modern colliders.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the application of an analytical gluon distribution based on double-asymptotic scaling to the photoproduction of vector mesons in coherent $pp$, $pA$, and $AA$ collisions at LHC energies, using the color dipole formalism. Predictions for the rapidity distribution are presented for $\rho^0$, $J/ \psi$, $\psi (2S)$, and $\Upsilon (1S)$ mesons photoproduction. An analysis of the uncertainties associated with different implementations of the dipole--proton amplitude is performed. The vector meson photoproduction accompanied by electromagnetic dissociation is also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Leptogenesis assisted by scalar decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13468v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a pragmatic approach to lower down the mass scale of right-handed neutrinos in leptogenesis by introducing a scalar decaying to right-handed neutrinos. The key point of our proposal is that the out-of-equilibrium decays of the scalar provide an additional source for right-handed neutrinos and hence the lepton asymmetry. This mechanism works well at low temperatures when the washout of the generated lepton asymmetry is suppressed. Thus, the lepton asymmetry can be effectively produced despite the washout effect is strong or not. Through a comprehensive analysis, we demonstrate that such a scalar-assisted leptogenesis can typically decrease the viable right-handed neutrino mass scale by one to three orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Cold Quark Matter: Renormalization Group Improvement at next-to-next-to leading order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend previous next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) calculations of the QCD pressure at zero temperature and non-zero baryonic densities using the renormalization group optimized perturbation theory (RGOPT), which entails an all-order RG-invariant resummation. First, we consider the approximation of three massless quark flavors, and then adding the running strange quark mass dependence. The resulting pressure displays a sizeably reduced sensitivity to variations of the arbitrary renormalization scale as compared to the state-of-the-art NNLO results. This confirms previous NLO investigations that the RGOPT resummation scheme provides improved convergence properties and reduced renormalization scale uncertainties, thus being a promising prescription to improve perturbative QCD at high and mid range baryonic densities.</description>

      <title>Further study of the maximally symmetry breaking patterns in an ${\rm SU}(8)$ theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03172v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An ${\rm SU}(8)$ theory was previously found to be the minimal simple gauge group where all three-generational Standard Model (SM) fermions can be nontrivially embedded. It is maximally broken into a subgroup of ${\rm SU}(8)\to {\cal G}_{441}\equiv {\rm SU}(4)_s \otimes {\rm SU}(4)_W \otimes {\rm U}(1)_{X_0}$ at the grand unified theory scale by the ${\rm SU}(8)$ adjoint Higgs field of $\mathbf{63_H}$. Gauge symmetries in the strong and the weak sectors are extended by one and two ranks, respectively. The sequential strong-weak-weak (SWW) symmetry breaking stages were found to generate the observed hierarchical SM quark/lepton masses as well as the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa mixing pattern with the precise flavor identifications~[17, 20]. We further study the possible weak-strong-weak and weak-weak-strong symmetry breaking patterns, and compare with the results that we have obtained by following the SWW sequence. The two-loop renormalization group equations following both patterns are analyzed, where we cannot achieve the gauge coupling unification in the field theory framework. Through these analyses, we suggest the gauge coupling unification to be interpreted in the context of the affine Lie algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09113v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a class of leptogenesis scenarios in which the sector containing the lightest right-handed neutrino establishes kinetic equilibrium at a temperature $T_{N_1} &gt; T_\text{SM}$, where $T_\text{SM}$ is the temperature of the Standard Model sector. We study the reheating processes which realise this "hot leptogenesis" and the conditions under which kinetic and chemical equilibrium can be maintained. We derive and solve two sets of evolution equations, depending on the presence of chemical equilibrium within the hot sector, and numerically solve these for benchmark scenarios. We compare the viable parameter space of this model with standard leptogenesis scenarios with a thermal initial condition and find that hot leptogenesis resolves the neutrino and Higgs mass fine-tuning problems present in the standard scenario.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we study the collinear limit of the Energy-Energy Correlator (EEC) in single-inclusive jet production in proton-proton ($pp$) and proton-nucleus ($pA$) collisions. We introduce a non-perturbative model that allows us to describe the EEC in the entire angular region of the current experiments. Our results for $pp$ collisions show excellent agreement with CMS and ALICE data over a wide range of jet transverse momenta. For $pA$ collisions, we include modifications from the nuclear medium, and our predictions align well with the trends observed in recent ALICE measurements.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the chirally motivated $\pi\Sigma - \bar{K}N$ coupled channels model to the cubic finite volume and use it to calculate the stationary energy spectrum that appears in a nice agreement with the spectrum obtained in the lattice QCD simulations by the BaSc collaboration. Several other comparisons with the BaSc results are made, in particular relating their pole positions of the meson-baryon scattering matrix to the two-pole picture of $\Lambda(1405)$ generated by our chiral model in the infinite volume.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01080v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has long been argued that the action of the Schwinger mechanism in the gauge sector of Quantum Chromodynamics leads to the generation of a gluon mass scale. Within this scenario, the analytic structure of the fundamental vertices is modified by the creation of scalar colored excitations with vanishing mass. In the limit of zero momentum transfer, these terms act as massless poles, providing the required conditions for the infrared stabilization of the gluon propagator, and producing a characteristic displacement to the associated Ward identities. In this article we offer an extensive overview of the salient notions and techniques underlying this dynamical picture. We place particular emphasis on recent developments related to the exact renormalization of the mass, the nonlinear nature of the pole equation, and the key role played by the Fredholm alternative theorem.</description>

      <title>Improving the Direct Determination of $|V_{ts}|$ using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $s$-jet tagging approach to determine the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix component $|V_{ts}|$ directly in the dileptonic final state events of the top pair production in proton-proton collisions has been previously studied by measuring the branching fraction of the decay of one of the top quarks by $t \to sW$. The main challenge is improving the discrimination performance between strange jets from top decays and other jets. This study proposes novel jet discriminators, called DISAJA, using a Transformer-based deep learning method. The first model, DISAJA-H, utilizes multi-domain inputs (jets, leptons, and missing transverse momentum). An additional model, DISAJA-L, further improves the setup by using lower-level jet constituent information, rather than the high-level clustered information. DISAJA-L is a novel model that combines low-level jet constituent analysis with event classification using multi-domain inputs. The model performance is evaluated via a CMS-like LHC Run 2 fast simulation by comparing various statistical test results to those from a Transformer-based jet classifier which considers only the individual jets. This study shows that the DISAJA models have significant performance gains over the individual jet classifier, and we show the potential of the measurement during Run 3 of the LHC and the HL-LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At the LHC, two experiments - ATLAS and TOTEM - measure the total proton-proton cross section. Unfortunately, a significant discrepancy, persisting at different collision energies, is observed between the values reported by the two groups. This paper considers the hypothesis that this tension is predominantly driven by the assumption about the low-mass diffraction used in one of the measurement methods. It is shown that in such a case it is possible to extract the low-mass diffraction cross section from measurements of ATLAS and TOTEM. The results are compared with other data-driven estimates, showing better agreement than the original assumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to simulate neutrino scattering events as an alternative to the standard Monte Carlo generator approach. Generative adversarial neural network (GAN) models are developed to simulate charged current neutrino-carbon collisions in the few-GeV energy range. We consider a simplified framework to generate muon kinematic variables, specifically its energy and scattering angle. GAN models are trained on simulation data from \nuwro{} Monte Carlo event generator. Two GAN models have been obtained: one simulating quasielastic neutrino-nucleus scatterings and another simulating all interactions at given neutrino energy. The models work for neutrino energy ranging from 300 MeV to 10 GeV. The performance of both models has been assessed using two statistical metrics. It is shown that both GAN models successfully reproduce the distribution of muon kinematics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main goal of modern experiments in high-energy physics area is to find deviations from the Standard Model, the theoretical framework which describes data well but is expected to be extended to a more general theory. The anomalous coupling approach provides an opportunity to look for a wide range of new physics effects in different experimental signatures thanks to its model independence. In this work, the neutral triple gauge couplings are considered in $Z(\ell\ell)\gamma$ channel, and an effective field theory is used to parameterize these couplings in the Lagrangian. Neutral triple gauge couplings are triple interactions between $Z$ bosons and photons, and some of them violate $CP$ symmetry. This work presents a study of $CP$-sensitive variables in the aforementioned channel using special angular variables and matrix-element-based optimal observables. Based on these variables, expected limits on the coupling parameters are set for the conditions of Run II and Run III at LHC experiments, demonstrating the possibility of studying the $CP$-violation using a neutral triple gauge coupling approach and special $CP$-sensitive variables.</description>

Abstract: Nuclear matter with a strong magnetic field is prevalent inside neutron stars and heavy-ion collisions. In a sufficiently large magnetic field the ground state is either a chiral soliton lattice (CSL), an array of solitons of the neutral pion field, or a domain-wall Skyrmion phase in which Skyrmions emerge inside the chiral solitons. In the region of large chemical potential and a magnetic field lower than its critical value for CSL, a Skyrmion crystal is expected to take up the ground state based on the chiral perturbation theory at the next leading order. We determine the phase boundary between such a Skyrmion crystal and the QCD vacuum. There was a conjecture that a magnetic field deforms the Skyrmion into a pancake shape whose boundary is a superconducting ring of charged pions. In contrast, through the exact Skyrmion solution, we find that the pancake conjecture holds approximately in a strong magnetic field, but fails for a weak one. We also validate that a Skyrmion would shrink to null without the Skyrme term, although Derrick's scaling law is modified by a background magnetic field, and the stability at the leading order is not ruled out in theory.</description>

      <title>Hadron multiplicity fluctuations in perturbative QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00652v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine hadron multiplicity fluctuations in hard processes and confront analytic QCD predictions with the pattern of multiplicity fluctuations observed in $e^+e^-$ annihilation and high-$p_t$ jets produced in $pp$ collisions at the LHC. Special emphasis is placed on high-multiplicity fluctuations in jets. Selecting events with hadronic multiplicity exceeding the average value by a factor of 3 or more in various processes has been a source of conundrums for many years. We discuss two recent high-multiplicity puzzles and attempt to reveal their common origin.</description>

      <title>Thermal corrections to dark matter annihilation with real photon emission/absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dark matter relic density is being increasingly precisely measured. This relic density is theoretically determined by a Boltzmann equation which computes the dark matter distribution according to the (thermally averaged) cross section for annihilation/production of dark matter within a given model. We present here the complete higher order thermal corrections, calculated using real time thermal field theory, to the cross section for the annihilation of dark matter into Standard Model fermions via charged scalars: $\chi \chi \to f \overline{f}$ and $\chi \chi \to f \overline{f} (\gamma)$. The latter process includes real photon emission into, and absorption from, the heat bath at temperature $T$. We use the Grammer and Yennie technique to separate the soft infra-red divergences, which greatly simplifies the calculation. We show explicitly the cancellation of both soft and collinear divergences between real and virtual contributions at next-to-leading order (NLO) in the thermal field theory and remark on the non-trivial nature of the collinear divergences when the thermal contribution from fermions is considered. We present the leading thermal contributions to order ${\cal{O}}(\alpha T^2)$ for the case when the dark matter particle is a Majorana or Dirac type fermion. In the former case, both the leading order (LO) and NLO cross sections are helicity suppressed, while neither is suppressed in the Dirac case. It is interesting that the ratio of NLO to LO cross sections is the same for both Majorana and Dirac type dark matter.</description>

      <title>Decoupling Neutrino Magnetic Moment from Mass with $SU(2)_L$ Invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard Model extensions that yield observable neutrino magnetic moments typically also induce large neutrino masses, incompatible with experimental limits. This tension motivates the search for mechanisms that naturally decouple magnetic moments from mass generation without requiring fine-tuning. In this letter, we propose a novel mechanism for generating Dirac and Majorana neutrino magnetic moment, in which the associated mass contribution is forbidden by $SU(2)_L$ invariance. By carefully selecting the $SU(2)_L$ representations connecting the neutrino to the loop diagram, we ensure that only the effective dipole operator involving the non-Abelian part of the photon -- the neutral $SU(2)_L$ gauge boson -- is generated. Crucially, the corresponding mass diagram, obtained by removing the external gauge boson leg, vanishes. We provide explicit UV completions that implement this mechanism and yield neutrino magnetic moments within the sensitivity of current and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Field mixing in a thermal medium: A quantum master equation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08460v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We studied the nonequilibrium dynamics of the indirect mixing of two (pseudo-)scalar fields induced by their couplings to common decay channels in a medium. The effective non-Markovian quantum master equation (QME) for the two fields' reduced density matrix is derived to leading order in the couplings of the two fields with the medium, but to all orders of the couplings among degrees of freedom in the medium. The self-energy and noise-kernel in the QME satisfy a fluctuation-dissipation relation. The solutions show that an initial expectation value (condensate) of one field induces a condensate of the other field through the indirect mixing and that the populations and coherence of the two fields thermalize and approach to non-vanishing values asymptotically. The nearly-degenerate field masses and coupling strengths resonantly enhance the quantum beats and asymptotic coherence, and induce a prominent dynamics of the vacuum after the switch-on of the couplings. We argue that a time-dependent definitions of particles due to the changing vacuum must be introduced so as to obtain results consistent with the calculations of equilibrium states in the asymptotic limit. A coupling strength hierarchy breaks down the resonant enhancement in the nearly-degenerate case but leads to different power countings of the coupling strengths in the magnitudes of the observables and time-scales in the evolution, suggesting the possibility of detecting extremely long-lived particles using prepared short-lived particles within a practical experimental period.</description>

      <title>Is the formation of primordial black holes from single-field inflation compatible with standard cosmology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the generation of primordial black holes (PBHs) within the framework of single-field inflationary models and their compatibility with the cosmological history of the Universe. Our results suggest that, depending on the masses of the formed PBHs, single-field inflation models require more than fine-tuning a potential to induce ultra-slow roll; it necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the post-inflationary cosmological evolution. As an explicative example, we introduce a new model, based on a double inflection point and consistent with Cosmic Microwave Background observations, capable of generating sub-solar PBHs, whose merger could be potentially detectable by the LVK experiment.</description>

      <title>Three-Body Non-Locality in Particle Decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exploration of entanglement and Bell non-locality among multi-particle quantum systems offers a profound avenue for testing and understanding the limits of quantum mechanics and local real hidden variable theories. In this work, we examine non-local correlations among three massless spin-1/2 particles generated from the three-body decay of a massive particle, utilizing a framework based on general four-fermion interactions. By analyzing several inequalities, we address the detection of deviations from quantum mechanics as well as violations of two key hidden variable theories: fully local-real and bipartite local-real theories. Our approach encompasses the standard Mermin inequality and the tight $4 \times 4 \times 2$ inequality, providing a comprehensive framework for probing three-partite non-local correlations. Our findings provide deeper insights into the boundaries of classical and quantum theories in three-particle systems, advancing the understanding of non-locality in particle decays and its relevance to particle physics and quantum foundations.</description>

      <title>Worldvolume fermion as baryon with homogeneous instantons in holographic $\mathrm{QCD}_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24173v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (ArXiv version) We investigate holographically the effective theory of the worldvolume fermion on the flavor branes in the D3/D7 model with homogeneously smeared D(-1)-branes. As a top-down approach in gauge-gravity duality, the D(-1)-branes are instantons and violate the CP symmetry in the dual theory. In the confined geometry, we introduce a baryon vertex as a D5-brane wrapped on $S^{5}$, then identify the fermionic fluxes produced by the $N_{c}$ open strings on the D7-brane as a baryonic operator. Afterwards, we study the spectrum and the holographic correlation function of the baryonic fermion on the D7-branes. Remarkably, the fermionic spectrum is in agreement with the dispersion curves obtained from the confined correlation function, and the mass ratio of the lowest baryon and meson in our model is close to the associated experimental data. Moreover, the effective interaction terms of the holographic baryon and meson are derived and all the coupling constants take order of $N_{c}^{1/2}$ agreeing with the evaluation from the large $N_{c}$ field theory. In the deconfined geometry, the holographic correlation function is also evaluated numerically while the fermion on D7-brane is identified to plasmino instead of baryon. The dispersion curves from the deconfined correlation function basically covers the results from the hard thermal loop approximation and may imply the instanton-induced interaction with spin. Overall, this work constructs a holographic theory about baryonic fermion and mesonic boson with instantons or CP violation.</description>

      <title>Signatures of asymmetry: Gravitational wave memory and the parity violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Einstein's equivalence principle suggests a deep connection between matter and spacetime, prompting the question: if matter violates parity, must gravity? This letter explores the detection of parity violation in gravity using gravitational wave (GW) memory. Gravitational parity violation could be observable through GW amplitude birefringence and large-scale structure correlations. With improved sensitivity, next-generation GW detectors offer unprecedented opportunities to probe these effects. We propose that the integrated cosmological memory (ICM) of GWs, amplified over cosmological distances, can enhance faint parity-violating signatures. Specifically, if GWs from astrophysical events have differing polarization amplitudes, as in Chern-Simons gravity, ICM significantly amplifies this disparity. ICM uniquely and independently allows us to test fundamental symmetries, constrain gravity parameters, and gain insights into the interplay of particle physics, cosmology and gravity.</description>
