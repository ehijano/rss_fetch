      <title>Renewal equations for vector-borne diseases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During infectious disease outbreaks, estimates of time-varying pathogen transmissibility, such as the instantaneous reproduction number R(t) or epidemic growth rate r(t), are used to inform decision-making by public health authorities. For directly transmitted infectious diseases, the renewal equation framework is a widely used method for measuring time-varying transmissibility. The framework uses information on the typical time elapsing between an infection and the offspring infections (quantified by the generation time distribution), and R(t), to describe the rate at which currently infected individuals generate new infections. For diseases with transmission cycles involving hosts and vectors, however, renewal equation models have been far less used. This is likely due to difficulties in mechanistically defining generation times that can capture the complexity of multi-stage, human-vector relationships. Here, using dengue as an example, we provide general renewal equations that are derived from first principles using age-structured systems of coupled partial differential equations across human and vector sub-populations. Our framework tracks the multi-stage transmission cycle over calendar time and across stage-specific ages, resulting in governing renewal equations that quantify how the rate at which new infections are generated from existing infections depends on stage-specific processes. The framework provides a foundation on which to base inferential frameworks for estimating R(t) and r(t) for infectious diseases with multiple stages in the transmission cycle</description>

      <title>Inferring Drug-induced Plasticity via Drug Screen Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resistance to therapy remains a significant challenge in cancer treatment, often due to the presence of a stem-like cell population that drives tumor recurrence post-treatment. Moreover, many anticancer drugs inadvertently induce plasticity, reverting differentiated cancer cells to drug-resistant stem-like states. Addressing this phenomenon is crucial for advancing cancer therapeutics. In this study, we introduce a robust statistical framework based on multi-type branching processes that can dissect tumor dynamics and drug effects from high throughput drug screening data. Through comprehensive in silico experiments, we show the efficacy of our framework in estimating parameters governing population dynamics and drug responses in a heterogeneous tumor population where cell state transitions are influenced by the drug. Finally, using recent in vitro data involving AGS-SORE6+/- cells treated with ciclopirox olamine, we show how our framework can be used to confirm the presence of drug-induced cell plasticity.</description>

      <title>Split-or-decompose: Improved FPT branching algorithms for maximum agreement forests</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic trees are leaf-labelled trees used to model the evolution of species. In practice it is not uncommon to obtain two topologically distinct trees for the same set of species, and this motivates the use of distance measures to quantify dissimilarity. A well-known measure is the maximum agreement forest (MAF): a minimum-size partition of the leaf labels which splits both trees into the same set of disjoint, leaf-labelled subtrees (up to isomorphism after suppressing degree-2 vertices). Computing such a MAF is NP-hard and so considerable effort has been invested in finding FPT algorithms, parameterised by $k$, the number of components of a MAF. The state of the art has been unchanged since 2015, with running times of $O^*(3^k)$ for unrooted trees and $O^*(2.3431^k)$ for rooted trees. In this work we present improved algorithms for both the unrooted and rooted cases, with runtimes $O^*(2.846^k)$ and $O^*(2.3391^k)$ respectively. The key to our improvement is a novel branching strategy in which we show that any overlapping components obtained on the way to a MAF can be `split' by a branching rule with favourable branching factor, and then the problem can be decomposed into disjoint subproblems to be solved separately. We expect that this technique may be more widely applicable to other problems in algorithmic phylogenetics.</description>

      <title>Emergent time scales of epistasis in protein evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09436v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data-driven epistatic model of protein evolution, capable of generating evolutionary trajectories spanning very different time scales reaching from individual mutations to diverged homologs. Our in silico evolution encompasses random nucleotide mutations, insertions and deletions, and models selection using a fitness landscape, which is inferred via a generative probabilistic model for protein families. We show that the proposed framework accurately reproduces the sequence statistics of both short-time (experimental) and long-time (natural) protein evolution, suggesting applicability also to relatively data-poor intermediate evolutionary time scales, which are currently inaccessible to evolution experiments. Our model uncovers a highly collective nature of epistasis, gradually changing the fitness effect of mutations in a diverging sequence context, rather than acting via strong interactions between individual mutations. This collective nature triggers the emergence of a long evolutionary time scale, separating fast mutational processes inside a given sequence context, from the slow evolution of the context itself. The model quantitatively reproduces epistatic phenomena such as contingency and entrenchment, as well as the loss of predictability in protein evolution observed in deep mutational scanning experiments of distant homologs. It thereby deepens our understanding of the interplay between mutation and selection in shaping protein diversity and novel functions, allows one to statistically forecast evolution, and challenges the prevailing independent-site models of protein evolution, which are unable to capture the fundamental importance of epistasis.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary emergence of biological intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterising the intelligence of biological organisms is challenging. This work considers intelligent algorithms developed evolutionarily within neural systems. Mathematical analyses unveil a natural equivalence between canonical neural networks, variational Bayesian inference under a class of partially observable Markov decision processes, and differentiable Turing machines, by showing that they minimise the shared Helmholtz energy. Consequently, canonical neural networks can biologically plausibly equip Turing machines and conduct variational Bayesian inferences of external Turing machines in the environment. Applying Helmholtz energy minimisation at the species level facilitates deriving active Bayesian model selection inherent in natural selection, resulting in the emergence of adaptive algorithms. In particular, canonical neural networks with two mental actions can separately memorise transition mappings of multiple external Turing machines to form a universal machine. These propositions were corroborated by numerical simulations of algorithm implementation and neural network evolution. These notions offer a universal characterisation of biological intelligence emerging from evolution in terms of Bayesian model selection and belief updating.</description>
