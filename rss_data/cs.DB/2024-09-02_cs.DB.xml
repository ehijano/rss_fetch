      <title>Optimizing Traversal Queries of Sensor Data Using a Rule-Based Reachability Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link Traversal queries face challenges in completeness and long execution time due to the size of the web. Reachability criteria define completeness by restricting the links followed by engines. However, the number of links to dereference remains the bottleneck of the approach. Web environments often have structures exploitable by query engines to prune irrelevant sources. Current criteria rely on using information from the query definition and predefined predicate. However, it is difficult to use them to traverse environments where logical expressions indicate the location of resources. We propose to use a rule-based reachability criterion that captures logical statements expressed in hypermedia descriptions within linked data documents to prune irrelevant sources. In this poster paper, we show how the Comunica link traversal engine is modified to take hints from a hypermedia control vocabulary, to prune irrelevant sources. Our preliminary findings show that by using this strategy, the query engine can significantly reduce the number of HTTP requests and the query execution time without sacrificing the completeness of results. Our work shows that the investigation of hypermedia controls in link pruning of traversal queries is a worthy effort for optimizing web queries of unindexed decentralized databases.</description>

      <title>Updateable Data-Driven Cardinality Estimator with Bounded Q-error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern Cardinality Estimators struggle with data updates. This research tackles this challenge within single-table. We introduce ICE, an Index-based Cardinality Estimator, the first data-driven estimator that enables instant, tuple-leveled updates.
  ICE has learned two key lessons from the multidimensional index and applied them to solve cardinality estimation in dynamic scenarios: (1) Index possesses the capability for swift training and seamless updating amidst vast multidimensional data. (2) Index offers precise data distribution, staying synchronized with the latest database version. These insights endow the index with the ability to be a highly accurate, data-driven model that rapidly adapts to data updates and is resilient to out-of-distribution challenges during query testing. To make a solitary index support cardinality estimation, we have crafted sophisticated algorithms for training, updating, and estimating, analyzing unbiasedness and variance.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of ICE. ICE offers precise estimations and fast updates/construction across diverse workloads. Compared to state-of-the-art real-time query-driven models, ICE boasts superior accuracy (2-3 orders of magnitude more precise), faster updates (4.7-6.9 times faster), and significantly reduced training time (up to 1-3 orders of magnitude faster).</description>

      <title>BioBricks.ai: A Versioned Data Registry for Life Sciences Data Assets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers in biomedical research, public health, and the life sciences often spend weeks or months discovering, accessing, curating, and integrating data from disparate sources, significantly delaying the onset of actual analysis and innovation. Instead of countless developers creating redundant and inconsistent data pipelines, BioBricks.ai offers a centralized data repository and a suite of developer-friendly tools to simplify access to scientific data. Currently, BioBricks.ai delivers over ninety biological and chemical datasets. It provides a package manager-like system for installing and managing dependencies on data sources. Each 'brick' is a Data Version Control git repository that supports an updateable pipeline for extraction, transformation, and loading data into the BioBricks.ai backend at https://biobricks.ai. Use cases include accelerating data science workflows and facilitating the creation of novel data assets by integrating multiple datasets into unified, harmonized resources. In conclusion, BioBricks.ai offers an opportunity to accelerate access and use of public data through a single open platform.</description>

      <title>Empowering Open Data Sharing for Social Good: A Privacy-Aware Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Covid-19 pandemic has affected the world at multiple levels. Data sharing was pivotal for advancing research to understand the underlying causes and implement effective containment strategies. In response, many countries have promoted the availability of daily cases to support research initiatives, fostering collaboration between organisations and making such data available to the public through open data platforms. Despite the several advantages of data sharing, one of the major concerns before releasing health data is its impact on individuals' privacy. Such a sharing process should be based on state-of-the-art methods in Data Protection by Design and by Default. In this paper, we use a data set related to Covid-19 cases in the second largest hospital in Portugal to show how it is feasible to ensure data privacy while improving the quality and maintaining the utility of the data. Our goal is to demonstrate how knowledge exchange in multidisciplinary teams of healthcare practitioners, data privacy, and data science experts is crucial to co-developing strategies that ensure high utility of de-identified data.</description>

      <title>The FAIREr Guiding Principles: Organizing data and metadata into semantically meaningful types of FAIR Digital Objects to increase their cognitive interoperability and human explorability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04202v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring the FAIRness (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) of data and metadata is an important goal in research and industry. Knowledge graphs and ontologies have been central in achieving this goal, with interoperability receiving much attention. The European Open Science Cloud Interoperability Framework (EOSC IF) distinguishes four layers of interoperability: technical, semantic, organizational, and legal. This paper argues that the emphasis on machine-actionability has overshadowed the essential need for human-actionability of data and describes two cases within knowledge graphs in which human-actionability is challenged. In response, it propagates incorporating cognitive interoperability as fifth layer within the EOSC IF and discusses the relation between human explorability and cognitive interoperability, resulting in the suggestion to add the Principle of human Explorability, extending FAIR to the FAIREr Guiding Principles. The subsequent sections present the concept of semantic units, elucidating their importance in enhancing the human explorability and cognitive interoperability of knowledge graphs. Semantic units structure a knowledge graph into identifiable and semantically meaningful subgraphs, each represented with its own resource constituting a FAIR Digital Object (FDO) that instantiates a corresponding FDO class. Various categories of FDOs are distinguished. The content of a FDO can be displayed in a user interface either as a mind-map-like graph or as natural language text. Organizing knowledge graphs into FDOs based on semantic units supports the cognitive interoperability of data and metadata and facilitates their human explorability. The development of innovative user interfaces enabled by such FDOs empowers users to access, navigate, and explore information in knowledge graphs with enhanced efficiency.</description>

      <title>The Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC): Driving competition and collaboration in the graph data management space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph data management is instrumental for several use cases such as recommendation, root cause analysis, financial fraud detection, and enterprise knowledge representation. Efficiently supporting these use cases yields a number of unique requirements, including the need for a concise query language and graph-aware query optimization techniques. The goal of the Linked Data Benchmark Council (LDBC) is to design a set of standard benchmarks that capture representative categories of graph data management problems, making the performance of systems comparable and facilitating competition among vendors. LDBC also conducts research on graph schemas and graph query languages. This paper introduces the LDBC organization and its work over the last decade.</description>
