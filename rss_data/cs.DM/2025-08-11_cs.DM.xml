      <title>Sandwich Monotonicity and the Recognition of Weighted Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Edge-weighted graphs play an important role in the theory of Robinsonian matrices and similarity theory, particularly via the concept of level graphs, that is, graphs obtained from an edge-weighted graph by removing all sufficiently light edges. This suggest a natural way of associating to any class $\mathcal{G}$ of unweighted graphs a corresponding class of edge-weighted graphs, namely by requiring that all level graphs belong to $\mathcal{G}$. We show that weighted graphs for which all level graphs are split, threshold, or chain graphs can be recognized in linear time using special edge elimination orderings. We obtain these results by introducing the notion of degree sandwich monotone graph classes. A graph class $\mathcal{G}$ is sandwich monotone if every edge set which may be removed from a graph in $\mathcal{G}$ without leaving the class also contains a single edge that can be safely removed. Furthermore, if we require the safe edge to fulfill a certain degree property, then $\mathcal{G}$ is called degree sandwich monotone. We present necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a linear-time recognition algorithm for any weighted graph class whose corresponding unweighted class is degree sandwich monotone and contains all edgeless graphs.</description>

      <title>On Approximate MMS Allocations on Restricted Graph Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of fair division of a set of indivisible goods with connectivity constraints. Specifically, we assume that the goods are represented as vertices of a connected graph, and sets of goods allocated to the agents are connected subgraphs of this graph. We focus on the widely-studied maximin share criterion of fairness. It has been shown that an allocation satisfying this criterion may not exist even without connectivity constraints, i.e., if the graph of goods is complete. In view of this, it is natural to seek approximate allocations that guarantee each agent a connected bundle of goods with value at least a constant fraction of the maximin share value to the agent. It is known that for some classes of graphs, such as complete graphs, cycles, and $d$-claw-free graphs for any fixed $d$, such approximate allocations indeed exist. However, it is an open problem whether they exist for the class of all graphs.
  In this paper, we continue the systematic study of the existence of approximate allocations on restricted graph classes. In particular, we show that such allocations exist for several well-studied classes, including block graphs, cacti, complete multipartite graphs, and split graphs.</description>

      <title>Induced Minors, Asymptotic Dimension, and Baker's Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic dimension is a large-scale invariant of metric spaces that was introduced by Gromov (1993). We prove that every hereditary class of bounded-degree graphs that excludes some graph as a fat minor has asymptotic dimension at most $2$, which is optimal. This makes substantial progress on a question of Bonamy, Bousquet, Esperet, Groenland, Liu, Pirot, and Scott (J. Eur. Math. Soc. 2023).
  The key to our proof is a notion inspired by Baker's technique (J. ACM 1994). We say that a graph class $\mathcal{G}$ has bounded Baker-treewidth if there exists a function $f \colon \mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ such that, for every graph $G\in \mathcal{G}$, there is a layering of $G$ such that the subgraph induced by the union of any $\ell$ consecutive layers has treewidth at most $f(\ell)$. We show that every class of bounded-degree graphs that excludes some graph as an induced minor has bounded Baker-treewidth. We discuss further applications of this result to clustered colouring and the design of linear-time approximate schemes.</description>

      <title>A Structural Linear-Time Algorithm for Computing the Tutte Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The block-cut tree decomposes a connected graph along its cutvertices, displaying its 2-connected components. The Tutte-decomposition extends this idea to 2-separators in 2-connected graphs, yielding a canonical tree-decomposition that decomposes the graph into its triconnected components. In 1973, Hopcroft and Tarjan introduced a linear-time algorithm to compute the Tutte-decomposition. Cunningham and Edmonds later established a structural characterization of the Tutte-decomposition via totally-nested 2-separations. We present a conceptually simple algorithm based on this characterization, which computes the Tutte-decomposition in linear time. Our algorithm first computes all totally-nested 2-separations and then builds the Tutte-decomposition from them.
  Along the way, we derive new structural results on the structure of totally-nested 2-separations in 2-connected graphs using a novel notion of stability, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Voting-Based Semi-Parallel Proof-of-Work Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel Proof-of-Work (PoW) protocols are suggested to improve the safety guarantees, transaction throughput and confirmation latencies of Nakamoto consensus. In this work, we first consider the existing parallel PoW protocols and develop hard-coded incentive attack structures. Our theoretical results and simulations show that the existing parallel PoW protocols are more vulnerable to incentive attacks than the Nakamoto consensus, e.g., attacks have smaller profitability threshold and they result in higher relative rewards. Next, we introduce a voting-based semi-parallel PoW protocol that outperforms both Nakamoto consensus and the existing parallel PoW protocols from most practical perspectives such as communication overheads, throughput, transaction conflicts, incentive compatibility of the protocol as well as a fair distribution of transaction fees among the voters and the leaders. We use state-of-the-art analysis to evaluate the consistency of the protocol and consider Markov decision process (MDP) models to substantiate our claims about the resilience of our protocol against incentive attacks.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a class of graphs which we call average hereditary graphs. Many graphs that occur in the usual graph theory applications belong to this class of graphs. Many popular types of graphs fall under this class, such as regular graphs, trees and other popular classes of graphs. The paper aims to explore some interesting properties regarding colorings average hereditary graphs. We prove a new upper bound for the chromatic number of a graph in terms of its maximum average degree and show that this bound is an improvement on previous bounds. From this, we show a relationship between the average degree and the chromatic number of an average hereditary graph. We then show that even with new bound, the graph 3-coloring problem remains NP-hard when the input is restricted to average hereditary graphs. We provide an equivalent condition for a graph to be average hereditary, through which we show that we can decide if a given graph is average hereditary in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Random local access for sampling k-SAT solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03951v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a sublinear time algorithm that gives random local access to the uniform distribution over satisfying assignments to an arbitrary k-SAT formula $\Phi$, at exponential clause density. Our algorithm provides memory-less query access to variable assignments, such that the output variable assignments consistently emulate a single global satisfying assignment whose law is close to the uniform distribution over satisfying assignments to $\Phi$. Random local access and related models have been studied for a wide variety of natural Gibbs distributions and random graphical processes. Here, we establish feasibility of random local access models for one of the most canonical such sample spaces, the set of satisfying assignments to a k-SAT formula.
  Our algorithm proceeds by leveraging the local uniformity of the uniform distribution over satisfying assignments to $\Phi$. We randomly partition the variables into two subsets, so that each clause has sufficiently many variables from each set to preserve local uniformity. We then sample some variables by simulating a systematic scan Glauber dynamics backward in time, greedily constructing the necessary intermediate steps. We sample the other variables by first conducting a search for a polylogarithmic-sized local component, which we iteratively grow to identify a small subformula from which we can efficiently sample using the appropriate marginal distribution. This two-pronged approach enables us to sample individual variable assignments without constructing a full solution.</description>

      <title>Reducibility among NP-Hard graph problems and boundary classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many NP-hard graph problems become easy for some classes of graphs. For example, coloring is easy for bipartite graphs, but NP-hard in general. So we can ask question like when does a hard problem become easy? What is the minimum substructure for which the problem remains hard? We use the notion of boundary classes to study such questions. In this paper, we introduce a method for transforming the boundary class of one NP-hard graph problem into a boundary class for another problem. If {\Pi} and {\Gamma} are two NP-hard graph problems where {\Pi} is reducible to {\Gamma}, we transform a boundary class of {\Pi} into a boundary class of {\Gamma}. More formally if {\Pi} is reducible to {\Gamma}, where the reduction satisfies certain conditions, then X is a boundary class of {\Pi} if and only if the image of X under the reduction is a boundary class of {\Gamma}. This gives us a relationship between boundary classes and reducibility among several NP-hard problems. To show the strength of our main result, we apply our theorem to obtain some previously unknown boundary classes for a few graph problems namely; vertex-cover, clique, traveling-salesperson, bounded-degree-spanning-tree, subgraph-isomorphism and clique-cover.</description>
