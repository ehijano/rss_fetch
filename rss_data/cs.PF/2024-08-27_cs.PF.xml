      <title>Exploring GPU-to-GPU Communication: Insights into Supercomputer Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-GPU nodes are increasingly common in the rapidly evolving landscape of exascale supercomputers. On these systems, GPUs on the same node are connected through dedicated networks, with bandwidths up to a few terabits per second. However, gauging performance expectations and maximizing system efficiency is challenging due to different technologies, design options, and software layers. This paper comprehensively characterizes three supercomputers - Alps, Leonardo, and LUMI - each with a unique architecture and design. We focus on performance evaluation of intra-node and inter-node interconnects on up to 4096 GPUs, using a mix of intra-node and inter-node benchmarks. By analyzing its limitations and opportunities, we aim to offer practical guidance to researchers, system architects, and software developers dealing with multi-GPU supercomputing. Our results show that there is untapped bandwidth, and there are still many opportunities for optimization, ranging from network to software optimization.</description>

      <title>FSDEM: Feature Selection Dynamic Evaluation Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Expressive evaluation metrics are indispensable for informative experiments in all areas, and while several metrics are established in some areas, in others, such as feature selection, only indirect or otherwise limited evaluation metrics are found. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation metric to address several problems of its predecessors and allow for flexible and reliable evaluation of feature selection algorithms. The proposed metric is a dynamic metric with two properties that can be used to evaluate both the performance and the stability of a feature selection algorithm. We conduct several empirical experiments to illustrate the use of the proposed metric in the successful evaluation of feature selection algorithms. We also provide a comparison and analysis to show the different aspects involved in the evaluation of the feature selection algorithms. The results indicate that the proposed metric is successful in carrying out the evaluation task for feature selection algorithms.

      <title>A Power-Consumption Analysis for Different IPoWDM Network Architectures with ZR/ZR+ and Long-Haul Muxponders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We quantify and compare the power consumption of four IPoWDM transport network architectures employing ZR/ZR+ modules, considering different grooming, regeneration, and optical bypass capabilities. Results show that optical bypass is still the most power-efficient solution, reducing consumption by up to 30%.</description>
