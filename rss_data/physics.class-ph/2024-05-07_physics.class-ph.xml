      <title>Fully Reversing the Shoebox Image Source Method: From Impulse Responses to Room Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm that fully reverses the shoebox image source method (ISM), a popular and widely used room impulse response (RIR) simulator for cuboid rooms introduced by Allen and Berkley in 1979. More precisely, given a discrete multichannel RIR generated by the shoebox ISM for a microphone array of known geometry, the algorithm reliably recovers the 18 input parameters. These are the 3D source position, the 3 dimensions of the room, the 6-degrees-of-freedom room translation and orientation, and an absorption coefficient for each of the 6 room boundaries. The approach builds on a recently proposed gridless image source localization technique combined with new procedures for room axes recovery and first-order-reflection identification. Extensive simulated experiments reveal that near-exact recovery of all parameters is achieved for a 32-element, 8.4-cm-wide spherical microphone array and a sampling rate of 16~kHz using fully randomized input parameters within rooms of size 2X2X2 to 10X10X5 meters. Estimation errors decay towards zero when increasing the array size and sampling rate. The method is also shown to strongly outperform a known baseline, and its ability to extrapolate RIRs at new positions is demonstrated. Crucially, the approach is strictly limited to low-passed discrete RIRs simulated using the vanilla shoebox ISM. Nonetheless, it represents to our knowledge the first algorithmic demonstration that this difficult inverse problem is in-principle fully solvable over a wide range of configurations.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations and phase-space structures in KCN molecular system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the evolution of the phase-space structures of KCN molecular system as a function of the vibrational energy using Lagrangian descriptors. For low energies, the motion is mostly regular around the absolute minimum of the potential energy surface. As the energy increases, the phase space combines regions with regular and chaotic motion, a difference that is well captured by the Lagrangian descriptors. We show that the dynamics is mostly governed by the invariant manifolds of the stretch periodic orbits located at the top of one of the energetic barriers of the system. Furthermore, we show a perfect agreement between the bifurcation theory and the differences observed in the phase-space structures as the vibrational energy is modified. The accuracy of our calculations is also assessed by explicit comparison with the invariant manifolds computed using linear dynamics.</description>
