      <title>Symbolic Control for Autonomous Docking of Marine Surface Vessels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Docking marine surface vessels remains a largely manual task due to its safety-critical nature. In this paper, we develop a hierarchical symbolic control architecture for autonomous docking maneuvers of a dynamic positioning vessel, to provide formal safety guarantees. At the upper-level, we treat the vessel's desired surge, sway, and yaw velocities as control inputs and synthesize a symbolic controller in real-time. The desired velocities are then transmitted to and executed by the vessel's low-level velocity feedback control loop. Given a synthesized symbolic controller, we investigate methods to optimize the performance of the proposed control scheme for the docking task. The efficacy of this methodology is evaluated on a low-fidelity simulation model of a marine surface vessel in the presence of static and dynamic obstacles and, for the first time, through physical experiments on a scaled model vessel.</description>

      <title>Time-Constrained Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Satellite Rendezvous, Proximity Operations, and Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a time-constrained model predictive control strategy for the six degree-of-freedom autonomous rendezvous, proximity, operations and docking problem between a controllable "deputy" satellite and an uncontrolled "chief" satellite. The objective is to achieve a docking configuration defined by both the translational and attitudinal states of the deputy relative to the chief, whose dynamics are respectively governed by both the Clohessy-Wiltshire equations and Euler's second law of motion. The proposed control strategy explicitly addresses computational time constraints that are common to state-of-the-art space vehicles. Thus, a time-constrained model predictive control strategy is implemented on a space-grade processor. Although suboptimal with regards to energy consumption when compared to conventional optimal RPO trajectories, it is empirically demonstrated via numerical simulations that the deputy spacecraft still achieves a successful docking configuration while subject to computational time constraints.</description>

      <title>Comparative Withholding Behavior Analysis of Historical Energy Storage Bids in California</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of battery energy storage in wholesale electricity markets calls for a deeper understanding of storage operators' bidding strategies and their market impacts. This study examines energy storage bidding data from the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) between July 1, 2023, and October 1, 2024, with a primary focus on economic withholding strategies. Our analysis reveals that storage bids are closely aligned with day-ahead and real-time market clearing prices, with notable bid inflation during price spikes. Statistical tests demonstrate a strong correlation between price spikes and capacity withholding, indicating that operators can anticipate price surges and use market volatility to increase profitability. Comparisons with optimal hindsight bids further reveal a clear daily periodic bidding pattern, highlighting extensive economic withholding. These results underscore potential market inefficiencies and highlight the need for refined regulatory measures to address economic withholding as storage capacity in the market continues to grow.</description>

      <title>Risk and Vulnerability Assessment of Energy-Transportation Infrastructure Systems to Extreme Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between extreme weather events and interdependent critical infrastructure systems involves complex spatiotemporal dynamics. Multi-type emergency decisions within energy-transportation infrastructures significantly influence system performance throughout the extreme weather process. A comprehensive assessment of these factors faces challenges in model complexity and heterogeneity between energy and transportation systems. This paper proposes an assessment framework that accommodates multiple types of emergency decisions. It integrates the heterogeneous energy and transportation infrastructures in the form of a network flow model to simulate and quantify the impact of extreme weather events on the energy-transportation infrastructure system. Based on this framework, a targeted method for identifying system vulnerabilities is further introduced, utilizing a neural network surrogate that achieves privacy protection and evaluation acceleration while maintaining consideration of system interdependencies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework and method can reveal the risk levels faced by urban infrastructure systems, identify weak points that should be prioritized for reinforcement, and strike a balance between accuracy and evaluation speed.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Digital Twin and Machine Learning Techniques for Anomaly Detection in Power Electronics Dominated Grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern power grids are transitioning towards power electronics-dominated grids (PEDG) due to the increasing integration of renewable energy sources and energy storage systems. This shift introduces complexities in grid operation and increases vulnerability to cyberattacks. This research explores the application of digital twin (DT) technology and machine learning (ML) techniques for anomaly detection in PEDGs. A DT can accurately track and simulate the behavior of the physical grid in real-time, providing a platform for monitoring and analyzing grid operations, with extended amount of data about dynamic power flow along the whole power system. By integrating ML algorithms, the DT can learn normal grid behavior and effectively identify anomalies that deviate from established patterns, enabling early detection of potential cyberattacks or system faults. This approach offers a comprehensive and proactive strategy for enhancing cybersecurity and ensuring the stability and reliability of PEDGs.</description>

      <title>Benchmark Study of Transient Stability during Power-Hardware-in-the-Loop and Fault-Ride-Through capabilities of PV inverters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of PV inverters is rapidly expanding across Europe, where these devices must increasingly comply with stringent grid requirements.This study presents a benchmark analysis of four PV inverter manufacturers, focusing on their Fault Ride Through capabilities under varying grid strengths, voltage dips, and fault durations, parameters critical for grid operators during fault conditions.The findings highlight the influence of different inverter controls on key metrics such as total harmonic distortion of current and voltage signals, as well as system stability following grid faults.Additionally, the study evaluates transient stability using two distinct testing approaches.The first approach employs the current standard method, which is testing with an ideal voltage source. The second utilizes a Power Hardware in the Loop methodology with a benchmark CIGRE grid model.The results reveal that while testing with an ideal voltage source is cost-effective and convenient in the short term, it lacks the ability to capture the dynamic interactions and feedback loops of physical grid components.This limitation can obscure critical real world factors, potentially leading to unexpected inverter behavior and operational challenges in grids with high PV penetration.This study underscores the importance of re-evaluating conventional testing methods and incorporating Power Hardware in the Loop structures to achieve test results that more closely align with real-world conditions.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Core Loss -- Cycle-by-cycle Modeling of Power Magnetics in PWM DC-AC Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays, PWM excitation is one of the most common waveforms seen by magnetic components in power electronic converters. Core loss modeling approaches such as the improved Generalized Steinmetz Equation (iGSE) or the loss map based on the composite waveform hypothesis (CWH) generally process the PWM excitation piecewise, which has been proven effective for DC-DC converters. However, an additional challenge arises in DC-AC converters, i.e. the fundamental-frequency sinewave component induces the major loop loss on top of the piecewise high-frequency segments. This major loop loss cannot be modeled on a switching cycle basis by any existing methods. To address this gap, this paper proposes a novel fundamental concept, instantaneous core loss, which is observed empirically for the first time. Enabled by the reactive voltage cancellation method, the instantaneous core loss, which only contains the real power loss, can be measured as a function of time. Building on this concept, a modeling method is proposed to break down the major loop core loss, typically represented as an average value in the literature, into the time domain, enabling cycle-by-cycle modeling as a practical workflow for predicting core losses in PWM converters. Through experiments, the existence of the major loop loss is verified, and generic instantaneous core loss models are extracted for several magnetic components. An example workflow is proposed to extract the cycle-by-cycle core loss at the design stage of a PWM DC-AC converter. This work enhances the fundamental understanding of the core loss process in real time, contributing to the advancement of scientific knowledge.</description>

      <title>Safety in safe Bayesian optimization and its ramifications for control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recurring and important task in control engineering is parameter tuning under constraints, which conceptually amounts to optimization of a blackbox function accessible only through noisy evaluations. For example, in control practice parameters of a pre-designed controller are often tuned online in feedback with a plant, and only safe parameter values should be tried, avoiding for example instability. Recently, machine learning methods have been deployed for this important problem, in particular, Bayesian optimization (BO). To handle safety constraints, algorithms from safe BO have been utilized, especially SafeOpt-type algorithms, which enjoy considerable popularity in learning-based control, robotics, and adjacent fields. However, we identify two significant obstacles to practical safety. First, SafeOpt-type algorithms rely on quantitative uncertainty bounds, and most implementations replace these by theoretically unsupported heuristics. Second, the theoretically valid uncertainty bounds crucially depend on a quantity - the reproducing kernel Hilbert space norm of the target function - that at present is impossible to reliably bound using established prior engineering knowledge. By careful numerical experiments we show that these issues can indeed cause safety violations. To overcome these problems, we propose Lipschitz-only Safe Bayesian Optimization (LoSBO), a safe BO algorithm that relies only on a known Lipschitz bound for its safety. Furthermore, we propose a variant (LoS-GP-UCB) that avoids gridding of the search space and is therefore applicable even for moderately high-dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>GenTL: A General Transfer Learning Model for Building Thermal Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer Learning (TL) is an emerging field in modeling building thermal dynamics. This method reduces the data required for a data-driven model of a target building by leveraging knowledge from a source building. Consequently, it enables the creation of data-efficient models that can be used for advanced control and fault detection &amp; diagnosis. A major limitation of the TL approach is its inconsistent performance across different sources. Although accurate source-building selection for a target is crucial, it remains a persistent challenge.
  We present GenTL, a general transfer learning model for single-family houses in Central Europe. GenTL can be efficiently fine-tuned to a large variety of target buildings. It is pretrained on a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network with data from 450 different buildings. The general transfer learning model eliminates the need for source-building selection by serving as a universal source for fine-tuning. Comparative analysis with conventional single-source to single-target TL demonstrates the efficacy and reliability of the general pretraining approach. Testing GenTL on 144 target buildings for fine-tuning reveals an average prediction error (RMSE) reduction of 42.1 % compared to fine-tuning single-source models.</description>

      <title>Towards Real-World Validation of a Physics-Based Ship Motion Prediction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The maritime industry aims towards a sustainable future, which requires significant improvements in operational efficiency. Current approaches focus on minimising fuel consumption and emissions through greater autonomy. Efficient and safe autonomous navigation requires high-fidelity ship motion models applicable to real-world conditions. Although physics-based ship motion models can predict ships' motion with sub-second resolution, their validation in real-world conditions is rarely found in the literature. This study presents a physics-based 3D dynamics motion model that is tailored to a container-ship, and compares its predictions against real-world voyages. The model integrates vessel motion over time and accounts for its hydrodynamic behavior under different environmental conditions. The model's predictions are evaluated against real vessel data both visually and using multiple distance measures. Both methodologies demonstrate that the model's predictions align closely with the real-world trajectories of the container-ship.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning Framework for Multi-UAV Combat Using Leader-Follower Strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-UAV air combat is a complex task involving multiple autonomous UAVs, an evolving field in both aerospace and artificial intelligence. This paper aims to enhance adversarial performance through collaborative strategies. Previous approaches predominantly discretize the action space into predefined actions, limiting UAV maneuverability and complex strategy implementation. Others simplify the problem to 1v1 combat, neglecting the cooperative dynamics among multiple UAVs. To address the high-dimensional challenges inherent in six-degree-of-freedom space and improve cooperation, we propose a hierarchical framework utilizing the Leader-Follower Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (LFMAPPO) strategy. Specifically, the framework is structured into three levels. The top level conducts a macro-level assessment of the environment and guides execution policy. The middle level determines the angle of the desired action. The bottom level generates precise action commands for the high-dimensional action space. Moreover, we optimize the state-value functions by assigning distinct roles with the leader-follower strategy to train the top-level policy, followers estimate the leader's utility, promoting effective cooperation among agents. Additionally, the incorporation of a target selector, aligned with the UAVs' posture, assesses the threat level of targets. Finally, simulation experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>On the reproducibility of discrete-event simulation studies in health research: an empirical study using open models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reproducibility of computational research is critical for ensuring transparency, reliability and reusability. Challenges with computational reproducibility have been documented in several fields, but healthcare discrete-event simulation (DES) models have not been thoroughly examined in this context. This study assessed the computational reproducibility of eight published healthcare DES models (Python or R), selected to represent diverse contexts, complexities, and years of publication. Repositories and articles were also assessed against guidelines and reporting standards, offering insights into their relationship with reproducibility success. Reproducing results required up to 28 hours of troubleshooting per model, with 50% fully reproduced and 50% partially reproduced (12.5% to 94.1% of reported outcomes). Key barriers included the absence of open licences, discrepancies between reported and coded parameters, and missing code to produce model outputs, run scenarios, and generate tables and figures. Addressing these issues would often require relatively little effort from authors: adding an open licence and sharing all materials used to produce the article. Actionable recommendations are proposed to enhance reproducibility practices for simulation modellers and reviewers.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Trajectory Planning for Signal Temporal Logic Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a powerful specification language for describing complex temporal behaviors of continuous signals, making it well-suited for high-level robotic task descriptions. However, generating executable plans for STL tasks is challenging, as it requires consideration of the coupling between the task specification and the system dynamics. Existing approaches either follow a model-based setting that explicitly requires knowledge of the system dynamics or adopt a task-oriented data-driven approach to learn plans for specific tasks. In this work, we investigate the problem of generating executable STL plans for systems whose dynamics are unknown a priori. We propose a new planning framework that uses only task-agnostic data during the offline training stage, enabling zero-shot generalization to new STL tasks. Our framework is hierarchical, involving: (i) decomposing the STL task into a set of progress and time constraints, (ii) searching for time-aware waypoints guided by task-agnostic data, and (iii) generating trajectories using a pre-trained safe diffusion model. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method indeed in achieving zero-shot generalization to various STL tasks.</description>

Abstract: We address distributed learning problems, both nonconvex and convex, over undirected networks. In particular, we design a novel algorithm based on the distributed Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to address the challenges of high communication costs, and large datasets. Our design tackles these challenges i) by enabling the agents to perform multiple local training steps between each round of communications; and ii) by allowing the agents to employ stochastic gradients while carrying out local computations. We show that the proposed algorithm converges to a neighborhood of a stationary point, for nonconvex problems, and of an optimal point, for convex problems. We also propose a variant of the algorithm to incorporate variance reduction thus achieving exact convergence. We show that the resulting algorithm indeed converges to a stationary (or optimal) point, and moreover that local training accelerates convergence. We thoroughly compare the proposed algorithms with the state of the art, both theoretically and through numerical results.</description>

      <title>WFCRL: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Benchmark for Wind Farm Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The wind farm control problem is challenging, since conventional model-based control strategies require tractable models of complex aerodynamical interactions between the turbines and suffer from the curse of dimension when the number of turbines increases. Recently, model-free and multi-agent reinforcement learning approaches have been used to address this challenge. In this article, we introduce WFCRL (Wind Farm Control with Reinforcement Learning), the first open suite of multi-agent reinforcement learning environments for the wind farm control problem. WFCRL frames a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem: each turbine is an agent and can learn to adjust its yaw, pitch or torque to maximize the common objective (e.g. the total power production of the farm). WFCRL also offers turbine load observations that will allow to optimize the farm performance while limiting turbine structural damages. Interfaces with two state-of-the-art farm simulators are implemented in WFCRL: a static simulator (FLORIS) and a dynamic simulator (FAST.Farm). For each simulator, $10$ wind layouts are provided, including $5$ real wind farms. Two state-of-the-art online MARL algorithms are implemented to illustrate the scaling challenges. As learning online on FAST.Farm is highly time-consuming, WFCRL offers the possibility of designing transfer learning strategies from FLORIS to FAST.Farm.</description>

      <title>Centralized Versus Distributed Routing for Large-Scale Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An important choice in the design of satellite networks is whether the routing decisions are made in a distributed manner onboard the satellite, or centrally on a ground-based controller. We study the tradeoff between centralized and distributed routing in large-scale satellite networks. In particular, we consider a centralized routing scheme that has access to global but delayed network state information and a distributed routing scheme that has access to local but real-time network state information. For both routing schemes, we analyze the throughput and delay performance of shortest-path algorithms in networks with and without buffers onboard the satellites. We show that distributed routing outperforms centralized routing when the rate of changes in the network link state is comparable to the inherent propagation and transmission delays. In particular, we show that in highly dynamic networks without buffers, the distributed scheme achieves higher throughput than a centralized scheme. In networks with buffers, the distributed scheme achieves lower delays with the same throughput.</description>

      <title>Temporal Logic Guided Safe Navigation for Autonomous Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety verification for autonomous vehicles (AVs) and ground robots is crucial for ensuring reliable operation given their uncertain environments. Formal language tools provide a robust and sound method to verify safety rules for such complex cyber-physical systems. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of formal verification languages like Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to generate safe trajectories and optimal control inputs for autonomous vehicle navigation. We implement a symbolic path planning approach using LTL to generate a formally safe reference trajectory. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) solver is then used on this reference trajectory to solve for the control inputs while satisfying the state, control and safety constraints described by STL. We test our proposed solution on two environments and compare the results with popular path planning algorithms. In contrast to conventional path planning algorithms, our formally safe solution excels in handling complex specification scenarios while ensuring both safety and comparable computation times.</description>

      <title>Sample-Based Piecewise Linear Power Flow Approximations Using Second-Order Sensitivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inherent nonlinearity of the power flow equations poses significant challenges in accurately modeling power systems, particularly when employing linearized approximations. Although power flow linearizations provide computational efficiency, they can fail to fully capture nonlinear behavior across diverse operating conditions. To improve approximation accuracy, we propose conservative piecewise linear approximations (CPLA) of the power flow equations, which are designed to consistently over- or under-estimate the quantity of interest, ensuring conservative behavior in optimization. The flexibility provided by piecewise linear functions can yield improved accuracy relative to standard linear approximations. However, applying CPLA across all dimensions of the power flow equations could introduce significant computational complexity, especially for large-scale optimization problems. In this paper, we propose a strategy that selectively targets dimensions exhibiting significant nonlinearities. Using a second-order sensitivity analysis, we identify the directions where the power flow equations exhibit the most significant curvature and tailor the CPLAs to improve accuracy in these specific directions. This approach reduces the computational burden while maintaining high accuracy, making it particularly well-suited for mixed-integer programming problems involving the power flow equations.</description>

      <title>Quantum model reduction for continuous-time quantum filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of quantum stochastic models is widespread in dynamical reduction, simulation of open systems, feedback control and adaptive estimation. In many applications only part of the information contained in the filter's state is actually needed to reconstruct the target observable quantities; thus, filters of smaller dimensions could be in principle implemented to perform the same task.In this work, we propose a systematic method to find, when possible, reduced-order quantum filters that are capable of exactly reproducing the evolution of expectation values of interest. In contrast with existing reduction techniques, the reduced model we obtain is exact and in the form of a Belavkin filtering equation, ensuring physical interpretability.This is attained by leveraging tools from the theory of both minimal realization and non-commutative conditional expectations. The proposed procedure is tested on prototypical examples, laying the groundwork for applications in quantum trajectory simulation and quantum feedback control.</description>

      <title>Internal Model Control design for systems learned by Control Affine Neural Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of Control Affine Neural Nonlinear AutoRegressive eXogenous (CA-NNARX) models for nonlinear system identification and model-based control design. The idea behind this architecture is to match the known control-affine structure of the system to achieve improved performance. Coherently with recent literature of neural networks for data-driven control, we first analyze the stability properties of CA-NNARX models, devising sufficient conditions for their incremental Input-to-State Stability ($\delta$ISS) that can be enforced at the model training stage. The model's stability property is then leveraged to design a stable Internal Model Control (IMC) architecture. The proposed control scheme is tested on a real Quadruple Tank benchmark system to address the output reference tracking problem. The results achieved show that (i) the modeling accuracy of CA-NNARX is superior to the one of a standard NNARX model for given weight size and training epochs, (ii) the proposed IMC law provides performance comparable to the ones of a standard Model Predictive Controller (MPC) at a significantly lower computational burden, and (iii) the $\delta$ISS of the model is beneficial to the closed-loop performance.</description>

      <title>Early Detection and Classification of Hidden Contingencies in Modern Power Systems: A Learning-based Stochastic Hybrid System Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21219v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel learning-based Stochastic Hybrid System (LSHS) approach for detecting and classifying various contingencies in modern power systems. Specifically, the proposed method is capable of identifying hidden contingencies that cannot be captured by existing sensing and monitoring systems, such as failures in protection systems or line outages in distribution networks. The LSHS approach detects contingencies by analyzing system outputs and behaviors. It then categorizes them based on their impact on the SHS model into physical, control network, and measurement contingencies. The stochastic hybrid system (SHS) model is further extended into an advanced closed-loop framework incorporating both system dynamics and observer-based state estimation error dynamics. Machine learning methods within the LSHS framework are employed for contingency classification and rapid detection. The practicality and effectiveness of the proposed methodology are validated through simulations on an enhanced IEEE-33 bus system. The results demonstrate that the LSHS framework significantly improves the accuracy and speed of contingency detection compared to state-of-the-art methods, offering a promising solution for enhancing power system contingency detection.</description>

      <title>Regret Analysis: a control perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Online learning and model reference adaptive control have many interesting intersections. One area where they differ however is in how the algorithms are analyzed and what objective or metric is used to discriminate "good" algorithms from "bad" algorithms. In adaptive control there are usually two objectives: 1) prove that all time varying parameters/states of the system are bounded, and 2) that the instantaneous error between the adaptively controlled system and a reference system converges to zero over time (or at least a compact set). For online learning the performance of algorithms is often characterized by the regret the algorithm incurs. Regret is defined as the cumulative loss (cost) over time from the online algorithm minus the cumulative loss (cost) of the single optimal fixed parameter choice in hindsight. Another significant difference between the two areas of research is with regard to the assumptions made in order to obtain said results. Adaptive control makes assumptions about the input-output properties of the control problem and derives solutions for a fixed error model or optimization task. In the online learning literature results are derived for classes of loss functions (i.e. convex) while a priori assuming certain signals are bounded. In this work we discuss these differences in detail through the regret based analysis of gradient descent for convex functions and the control based analysis of a streaming regression problem. We close with a discussion about the newly defined paradigm of online adaptive control.</description>

      <title>BOOST: Microgrid Sizing using Ordinal Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition to sustainable energy systems has highlighted the critical need for efficient sizing of renewable energy resources in microgrids. In particular, designing photovoltaic (PV) and battery systems to meet residential loads is challenging due to trade-offs between cost, reliability, and environmental impact. While previous studies have employed dynamic programming and heuristic techniques for microgrid sizing, these approaches often fail to balance computational efficiency and accuracy. In this work, we propose BOOST, or Battery-solar Ordinal Optimization Sizing Technique, a novel framework for optimizing the sizing of PV and battery components in microgrids. Ordinal optimization enables computationally efficient evaluations of potential designs while preserving accuracy through robust ranking of solutions. To determine the optimal operation of the system at any given time, we introduce a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach, which achieves lower costs than the commonly used dynamic programming methods. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework identifies optimal designs that achieve a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) as low as 8.84 cents/kWh, underscoring its potential for cost-effective microgrid design. The implications of our work are significant: BOOST provides a scalable and accurate methodology for integrating renewable energy into residential microgrids, addressing economic and environmental goals simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Numerically Robust Fixed-Point Smoothing Without State Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Practical implementations of Gaussian smoothing algorithms have received a great deal of attention in the last 60 years. However, almost all work focuses on estimating complete time series (''fixed-interval smoothing'', $\mathcal{O}(K)$ memory) through variations of the Rauch--Tung--Striebel smoother, rarely on estimating the initial states (''fixed-point smoothing'', $\mathcal{O}(1)$ memory). Since fixed-point smoothing is a crucial component of algorithms for dynamical systems with unknown initial conditions, we close this gap by introducing a new formulation of a Gaussian fixed-point smoother. In contrast to prior approaches, our perspective admits a numerically robust Cholesky-based form (without downdates) and avoids state augmentation, which would needlessly inflate the state-space model and reduce the numerical practicality of any fixed-point smoother code. The experiments demonstrate how a JAX implementation of our algorithm matches the runtime of the fastest methods and the robustness of the most robust techniques while existing implementations must always sacrifice one for the other.</description>

      <title>OCMDP: Observation-Constrained Markov Decision Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07087v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many practical applications, decision-making processes must balance the costs of acquiring information with the benefits it provides. Traditional control systems often assume full observability, an unrealistic assumption when observations are expensive. We tackle the challenge of simultaneously learning observation and control strategies in such cost-sensitive environments by introducing the Observation-Constrained Markov Decision Process (OCMDP), where the policy influences the observability of the true state. To manage the complexity arising from the combined observation and control actions, we develop an iterative, model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithm that separates the sensing and control components of the policy. This decomposition enables efficient learning in the expanded action space by focusing on when and what to observe, as well as determining optimal control actions, without requiring knowledge of the environment's dynamics. We validate our approach on a simulated diagnostic task and a realistic healthcare environment using HeartPole. Given both scenarios, the experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a substantial reduction in observation costs on average, significantly outperforming baseline methods by a notable margin in efficiency.</description>
