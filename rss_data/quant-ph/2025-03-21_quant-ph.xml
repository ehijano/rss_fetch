      <title>Current and quantum transport factor of fermionic system in fermionic bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the dynamics of current and the quantum transport factor in a fermionic system with a central oscillator interacting with two fermionic reservoirs at different temperatures. We derive the master equation for the system density matrix, accounting for energy exchange between the system and the reservoirs. The current is analyzed in relation to system parameters and reservoir temperatures, revealing that the quantum transport factor differs from classical systems, approaching Carnot efficiency at high temperatures but being different at low temperatures. We also examine the power spectrum of the current, providing insights into current fluctuations and their temperature dependence. Furthermore, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation and the Glauber-Sudarshan P-representation, where the steady-state probability distribution takes a Gaussian form, confirming the system behaves like a harmonic oscillator. This work advances the understanding of quantum transport in fermionic systems and provides a foundation for future research in quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Eigenvalues and Braak's Conjecture in the Quantum Rabi Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum of the quantum Rabi model can be separated as regular eigenvalues that need to be computed numerically and exceptional eigenvalues, that match the energies of a shifted quantum harmonic oscillator. Exceptional values can be separated further as Juddean, if they occur under certain algebraic conditions, and non-Juddean, if they obey more elusive transcendental conditions. Here, we show that simple assumptions on these conditions imply and extend Braak's conjecture on the distribution of the quantum Rabi spectrum.</description>

      <title>Unification of observational entropy with maximum entropy principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a definition of coarse-grained entropy that unifies measurement-based (observational entropy) and max-entropy-based (Jaynes) approaches to coarse-graining, by identifying physical constraints with information theoretic priors. The definition is shown to include as special cases most other entropies of interest in physics. We then consider second laws, showing that the definition admits new entropy increase theorems and connections to thermodynamics. We survey mathematical properties of the definition, and show it resolves some pathologies of the traditional observational entropy in infinite dimensions. Finally, we study the dynamics of this entropy in a quantum random matrix model and a classical hard sphere gas. Together the results suggest that this generalized observational entropy can form the basis of a highly general approach to statistical mechanics.</description>

      <title>The classical limit of quantum mechanics through coarse-grained measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the classical limit of quantum mechanics, focusing on its emergence through coarse-grained measurements when multiple outcomes are conflated into slots. We rigorously derive effective classical kinematics under such measurements, demonstrating that when the volume of the coarse-grained slot in phase space significantly exceeds Planck's constant, quantum states can be effectively described by classical probability distributions. Furthermore, we show that the dynamics, derived under coarse-grained observations and the linear approximation of the quantum Hamiltonian around its classical values within the slots, is effectively described by a classical Hamiltonian following Liouville dynamics. The classical Hamiltonian obtained through this process is equivalent to the one from which the underlying quantum Hamiltonian is derived via the (Dirac) quantization procedure, completing the quantization-classical limit loop. The Ehrenfest time, marking the duration within which classical behavior remains valid, is analyzed for various physical systems. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of both macroscopic and microscopic systems, revealing the mechanisms behind their observed classicality. This work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the quantum-to-classical transition and addresses foundational questions about the consistency of the quantization-classical limit cycle.</description>

      <title>Regulation of a continuously monitored quantum harmonic oscillator with inefficient detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the control problem of regulating the purity of a quantum harmonic oscillator in a Gaussian state via weak measurements. Specifically, we assume time-invariant Hamiltonian dynamics and that control is exerted via the back-action induced from monitoring the oscillator's position and momentum observables; the manipulation of the detector measurement strengths regulates the purity of the target Gaussian quantum state. After briefly drawing connections between Gaussian quantum dynamics and stochastic control, we focus on the effect of inefficient detectors and derive closed-form expressions for the transient and steady-state dynamics of the state covariance. We highlight the degradation of attainable purity that is due to inefficient detectors, as compared to that dictated by the Robertson-Schr\"odinger uncertainty relation. Our results suggest that quantum correlations can enhance the purity at steady-state. The quantum harmonic oscillator represents a basic system where analytic formulae may provide insights into the role of inefficient measurements in quantum control; the gained insights are pertinent to measurement-based quantum engines and cooling experiments.</description>

      <title>Most continuous-variable cluster states are too entangled to be useless</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define absolutely maximal entanglement (AME) in continuous-variable (CV) systems and show that, in stark contrast to qudit systems, this entanglement is generic among infinitely squeezed Gaussian states. In particular, we show that CV cluster states are generically AME and provide explicit constructions using Cauchy, Vandermonde, totally positive, and real-block-code generator matrices. Finitely squeezed versions of CV AME states give rise to open-destination multi-party CV teleportation, CV quantum secret sharing, CV majority-agreed key distribution, Gaussian perfect-tensor networks on arbitrary geometries, and Gaussian multi-unitary circuits.</description>

      <title>Extending the HNLS Condition to Robust Quantum Metrology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing holds great promise for high-precision magnetic field measurements. However, its performance is significantly limited by noise. In this work, we develop a quantum sensing protocol to estimate a parameter $\theta$, associated with a magnetic field, under full-rank Markovian noise. Our approach uses a probe state constructed from a CSS code that evolves under the parameter's Hamiltonian for a short time, but without any active error correction. Then we measure the code's $\hat{X}$ stabilizers to infer $\theta$. Given $N$ copies of the probe state, we derive the probability that all stabilizer measurements return $+1$, which depends on $\theta$. The uncertainty in $\theta$ (estimated from these measurements) is bounded by a new quantity, the Robustness Bound, which characterizes how the structure of the quantum code affects the Quantum Fisher Information of the measurement. Using this bound, we establish a strong no-go result: a nontrivial CSS code can achieve Heisenberg scaling if and only if the Hamiltonian is orthogonal to the span of the noise channel's Lindblad operators. This result extends the well-known HNLS condition under infinite rounds of error correction to the robust quantum sensing setting that does not use active error correction. Our finding suggests fundamental limitations in the use of linear quantum codes for dephased magnetic field sensing applications both in the near-term robust sensing regime and in the long-term fault tolerant era.</description>

      <title>Universal fault tolerant quantum computation in 2D without getting tied in knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how to perform scalable fault-tolerant non-Clifford gates in two dimensions by introducing domain walls between the surface code and a non-Abelian topological code whose codespace is stabilized by Clifford operators. We formulate a path integral framework which provides both a macroscopic picture for different logical gates as well as a way to derive the associated microscopic circuits. We also show an equivalence between our approach and prior proposals where a 2D array of qubits reproduces the action of a transversal gate in a 3D stabilizer code over time, thus, establishing a new connection between 3D codes and 2D non-Abelian topological phases. We prove a threshold theorem for our protocols under local stochastic circuit noise using a just-in-time decoder to correct the non-Abelian code.</description>

      <title>Rapid quantum ground state preparation via dissipative dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by natural cooling processes, dissipation has become a promising approach for preparing low-energy states of quantum systems. However, the potential of dissipative protocols remains unclear beyond certain commuting Hamiltonians. This work provides significant analytical and numerical insights into the power of dissipation for preparing the ground state of non-commuting Hamiltonians. For quasi-free dissipative dynamics, including certain 1D spin systems with boundary dissipation, our results reveal a new connection between the mixing time in trace distance and the spectral properties of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, leading to an explicit and sharp bound on the mixing time that scales polynomially with system size. For more general spin systems, we develop a tensor network-based algorithm for constructing the Lindblad jump operator and for simulating the dynamics. Using this algorithm, we demonstrate numerically that dissipative ground state preparation protocols can achieve rapid mixing for certain 1D local Hamiltonians under bulk dissipation, with a mixing time that scales logarithmically with the system size. We then prove the rapid mixing result for certain weakly interacting spin and fermionic systems in arbitrary dimensions, extending recent results for high-temperature quantum Gibbs samplers to the zero-temperature regime. Our theoretical approaches are applicable to systems with singular stationary states, and are thus expected to have applications beyond the specific systems considered in this study.</description>

      <title>Reducing T Gates with Unitary Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is essential for achieving practical quantum computing but has a significant computational overhead. Among fault-tolerant (FT) gate operations, non-Clifford gates, such as $T$, are particularly expensive due to their reliance on magic state distillation. These costly $T$ gates appear frequently in FT circuits as many quantum algorithms require arbitrary single-qubit rotations, such as $R_x$ and $R_z$ gates, which must be decomposed into a sequence of $T$ and Clifford gates. In many quantum circuits, $R_x$ and $R_z$ gates can be fused to form a single $U3$ unitary. However, existing synthesis methods, such as gridsynth, rely on indirect decompositions, requiring separate $R_z$ decompositions that result in a threefold increase in $T$ count.
  This work presents a novel FT synthesis algorithm that directly synthesizes arbitrary single-qubit unitaries, avoiding the overhead of separate $R_z$ decompositions. By leveraging tensor network-based search, our approach enables native $U3$ synthesis, reducing the $T$ count, Clifford gate count, and approximation error. Compared to gridsynth-based circuit synthesis, for 187 representative benchmarks, our design reduces the $T$ count by up to $3.5\times$, and Clifford gates by $7\times$, resulting in up to $4\times$ improvement in overall circuit infidelity.</description>

      <title>Optimizing realistic continuous-variable quantum teleportation with non-Gaussian resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the performance of non-Gaussian entangled resources in continuous-variable quantum teleportation within a realistic setting. We describe the characteristic functions of three distinct entangled resources, a two-mode squeezed vacuum state, a two-mode photon-subtracted squeezed state, and a two-mode photon-added squeezed state. We extend the theoretical analysis by Yang et al. to include the realistic experimental conditions such as photon losses, imperfect measurements which typically affect continuous-variable quantum teleportation. Our results demonstrate that even in non-ideal situations, the photon-subtracted squeezed state outperforms the other two resources in the low squeezing regime, keeping fidelity above the classical threshold that suggests the robustness of photon-subtracted squeezed state in practical teleportation applications. We further analyze the EPR correlations of these entangled resources, revealing that the photon-subtracted squeezed state exhibits stronger EPR correlations than the original two-mode squeezed vacuum state and the two-mode photon-added squeezed state. This study merges theoretical models with realistic imperfections and utilizes non-Gaussian entanglement into high-fidelity quantum teleportation.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Enhancement of Squeezed Light in Quantum-Optical High-Harmonic Generation From a Mott Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong-field induced generation of nonclassical states of light is not only a subject of fundamental research but also has potential usage in quantum information science and technology. The emerging field of strong-field quantum optics has developed ways of generating nonclassical states of light from the process of high-harmonic generation (HHG) at much wider frequency ranges and intensities than is typical for quantum optics. So far, however, no clear nonclassical signal at a distinct and unambiguous frequency has been predicted. Here, we study the response from an exciton in a Mott-insulating system, using the extended Hubbard model. We find that the exciton plays a key role in the nonclassical response and generates squeezing at the exciton energy. We relate this nonclassical response to the nonvanishing time correlations of the current operator in the system. Our work defines a direction for experimental work to search for squeezed light from HHG in a spectrally confined region defined by the exciton energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general framework for generating single- and multimode qubit-conditional operations by extending cross-resonant driving to a generalized multimode scheme. This includes single-mode conditional displacements and squeezing induced by one- and two-photon cross-resonant drives in the presence of one- and two-photon qubit-oscillator interactions, respectively. In the multimode setting, we derive multimode qubit-conditional beamsplitter and two-mode squeezing operations. We highlight their significance for bosonic quantum computing and quantum simulations. We also discuss possible implementations with superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Federated Quantum-Train Long Short-Term Memory for Gravitational Wave Signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Federated QT-LSTM, a novel framework that combines the Quantum-Train (QT) methodology with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks in a federated learning setup. By leveraging quantum neural networks (QNNs) to generate classical LSTM model parameters during training, the framework effectively addresses challenges in model compression, scalability, and computational efficiency. Importantly, Federated QT-LSTM eliminates the reliance on quantum devices during inference, making it practical for real-world applications. Experiments on simulated gravitational wave (GW) signal datasets demonstrate the framework's superior performance compared to baseline models, including LSTM and QLSTM, achieving lower training and testing losses while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. The results also reveal that deeper QT layers enhance model expressiveness for complex tasks, highlighting the adaptability of the framework. Federated QT-LSTM provides a scalable and efficient solution for privacy-preserving distributed learning, showcasing the potential of quantum-inspired techniques in advancing time-series prediction and signal reconstruction tasks.</description>

      <title>Constraint Phase Space Formulations for Finite-State Quantum Systems: The Relation between Commutator Variables and Complex Stiefel Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have recently developed the \textit{constraint} coordinate-momentum \textit{phase space} (CPS) formulation for finite-state quantum systems. It has been implemented for the electronic subsystem in nonadiabatic transition dynamics to develop practical trajectory-based approaches. In the generalized CPS formulation for the mapping Hamiltonian of the classical mapping model with commutator variables (CMMcv) method [\textit{J. Phys. Chem. A} \textbf{2021}, 125, 6845-6863], each {connected} component of the generalized CPS is the \textit{complex Stiefel manifold} labeled by the eigenvalue set of the mapping kernel. Such a phase space structure allows for exact trajectory-based dynamics for pure discrete (electronic) degrees of freedom (DOFs), where the equations of motion of each trajectory are isomorphic to the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation. We employ covariant kernels {within the generalized CPS framework} to develop two approaches that naturally yield exact evaluation of time correlation functions (TCFs) for pure discrete (electronic) DOFs. In addition, we briefly discuss the phase space mapping formalisms where the contribution of each trajectory to the integral expression of the {TCF} of population dynamics is strictly positive semi-definite. The generalized CPS formulation also indicates that the equations of motion in phase space mapping model I of our previous work [\textit{J. Chem. Phys.} \textbf{2016}, 145, 204105; \textbf{2017}, 146, 024110; \textbf{2019}, 151, 024105] lead to a complex Stiefel manifold $\mathrm{U}(F)/\mathrm{U}(F-2)$. It is expected that the generalized CPS formulation has implications for simulations of both nonadiabatic transition dynamics and many-body quantum dynamics for spins/bosons/fermions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chebyshev Probabilistic Models for Fragmentation Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum protocol for efficiently learning and sampling multivariate probability distributions that commonly appear in high-energy physics. Our approach introduces a bivariate probabilistic model based on generalized Chebyshev polynomials, which is (pre-)trained as an explicit circuit-based model for two correlated variables, and sampled efficiently with the use of quantum Chebyshev transforms. As a key application, we study the fragmentation functions~(FFs) of charged pions and kaons from single-inclusive hadron production in electron-positron annihilation. We learn the joint distribution for the momentum fraction $z$ and energy scale $Q$ in several fragmentation processes. Using the trained model, we infer the correlations between $z$ and $Q$ from the entanglement of the probabilistic model, noting that the developed energy-momentum correlations improve model performance. Furthermore, utilizing the generalization capabilities of the quantum Chebyshev model and extended register architecture, we perform a fine-grid multivariate sampling relevant for FF dataset augmentation. Our results highlight the growing potential of quantum generative modeling for addressing problems in scientific discovery and advancing data analysis in high-energy physics.</description>

      <title>A Non-Hermitian State-to-State Analysis of Transport in Aggregates with Multiple Endpoints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiency of quantum transport through aggregates with multiple end-points or traps proves to be an emergent and a highly non-equilibrium phenomenon. We present a numerically exact approach for computing the emergent time scale and amount of extraction specific to particular traps leveraging a non-Hermitian generalization of the recently introduced state-to-state transport analysis [Bose and Walters, J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2023, 19, 15, 4828-4836]. This method is able to simultaneously account for the coupling between various sites, the many-body effects brought in by the vibrations and environment held at a non-zero temperature, and the local extraction processes described by non-Hermitian terms in the Hamiltonian. In fact, our non-Hermitian state-to-state analysis goes beyond merely providing an emergent loss time-scale. It can parse the entire dynamics into the constituent internal transport pathways and loss to environment. We demonstrate this method using examples of an exciton transport in a lossy polaritonic cavity. The loss at the cavity and the extraction of the exciton from a terminal molecule provide competing mechanisms that our method helps to unravel, revealing extremely interesting non-intuitive physics. This non-Hermitian state-to-state analysis technique contributes an important link in understanding and elucidating the routes of transport in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Dense Coding Enhanced With Non-classical Routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a distributed quantum dense coding protocol that uses a control system to superpose two dense coding processes, allowing us to simultaneously and coherently encode and non-classically route the sender's single-qubit system to two receiver labs. We find that dense coding with coherently controlled encoding and routing performs better than the standard dense coding protocol in both global and one-way local decoding strategies employed by receiver labs in weak entanglement regimes and with noisy mixed states. We extend our protocol to an arbitrary number of receivers and analyse its performance under a global decoding strategy.</description>

      <title>Effects of driven atomic ensemble on the output spectrum and entanglement of optomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers an indirect driving model of a cavity QED system in which the left cavity wall consists of a large ensemble of two-level atoms driven by a classical laser field at a specific resonant frequency, inducing an effective drive for the optomechanical system. We investigate the effects of the atomic ensemble on the output intensity squeezing spectrum and the entanglement between the optical and mechanical modes. Our results show that both the coupling between the atomic ensemble and the cavity mode and the excitation level of the atomic ensemble significantly influences the output spectrum and the entanglement. The theoretical model presented in this paper provides deeper insight into the mechanisms governing correlations and squeezing spectra in conventional optomechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Dissipative Continuous Time Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous time crystals, i.e., nonequilibrium phases with a spontaneously broken continuous time-translational symmetry, have been studied and recently observed in the long-time dynamics of open quantum systems. Here, we investigate a lattice of interacting three-level systems and find two distinct time-crystal phases that cannot be described within mean-field theory. Remarkably, one of them emerges only in the presence of quantum fluctuations. Our findings extend explorations of continuous time-translational symmetry breaking in dissipative systems beyond the classical phenomenology of periodic orbits in a low-dimensional nonlinear system. The proposed model applies directly to the laser-driven dynamics of interacting Rydberg states in neutral atom arrays and suggests that the predicted time-crystal phases are observable in such experiments.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically Induced Transparency Effect Improves Quantum Battery Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum battery (QB) is an application of quantum thermodynamics which uses quantum effects to store and transfer energy, overcoming the limitations of classical batteries and potentially improving performance. However, due to the interaction with the external environment, it will lead to decoherence and thus reduce the lifetime of QBs. Here, we propose suppressing the environmental dissipation in the energy-storage process of the QB by exploiting the electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) and bound states. By constructing a hybrid system composed of a four-level atom and a coupled-cavity array, two bound states are formed in the system when the energy of the QB is in the energy band of the cavity array. Due to the bound states and the EIT effect, the ambient dissipation is significantly suppressed, which improves the lifetime of the QB. In addition, we show that when the energy of the QB is in resonance with the cavity, the ergotropy of the QB reaches the maximum. Furthermore, there exists an optimal coupling strength between two neighbouring cavities which helps improve the performance of the QB. These discoveries may shed the light on the design of high-efficiency QBs.</description>

      <title>Complete $k$-partite entanglement measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $k$-partite entanglement, which focus on at most how many particles in the global system are entangled but separable from other particles, is complementary to the $k$-entanglement that reflects how many splitted subsystems are entangled under partitions of the systems in characterizing multipartite entanglement. Very recently, the theory of the complete $k$-entanglement measure has been established in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 012405 (2024)]. Here we investigate whether we can define the complete measure of the $k$-partite entanglement. Consequently, with the same spirit as that of the complete $k$-entanglement measure, we present the axiomatic conditions that a complete $k$-partite entanglement measure should require. Furthermore, we present two classes of $k$-partite entanglement and discuss the completeness of them as illustrations.</description>

      <title>Probing classical and quantum violations of the equivalence of active and passive gravitational mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equivalence of active and passive (EAP) gravitational mass is one of the most fundamental principles of gravity. But in contrast to the usual equivalence of inertial and (passive) gravitational mass, the EAP has not received much attention. Here we revisit this principle and show how it can be used to probe quantum gravity in laboratory-based experiments. We first examine how the dynamics under EAP violations affects classical systems and show that new laboratory tests can be performed, to improve over the current experimental bounds and to test new manifestations of EAP violations. We then extend the analysis to the quantum domain, where quantized energy contributes to mass and the EAP principle can thus shed light on how quantum source masses would gravitate. We show that experiments with cold polar molecules, and future experiments with nuclear atomic clocks, can test the quantum EAP in a regime where quantum gravity phenomenology could become relevant. Our results open new opportunities for fundamental tests of gravity in high-precision laboratory experiments that can shed light on foundational principles of gravity and its interface with quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Constant-Depth Quantum Circuits for Arbitrary Quantum State Preparation via Measurement and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization of quantum circuit depth is crucial for practical quantum computing, as limited coherence times and error-prone operations constrain executable algorithms. Measurement and feedback operations are fundamental in quantum computing (e.g., quantum error correction); we develop a framework using them to achieve constant-depth implementations of essential quantum tasks. This includes preparing arbitrary quantum states with constant-depth circuits through measurement and feedback, breaking the linear-depth lower bound that is required without these operations. Our result paves the way for general quantum circuit compression using measurement and feedback.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Newton's constant is the least well-measured among the fundamental constants of Nature, and, indeed, its accurate measurement has long served an experimental challenge. Levitated mechanical systems are attracting growing attention for their promising applications in sensing and as an experimental platform for exploring the intersection between quantum physics and gravitation. Here we propose a mechanical interferometric scheme of interacting levitated oscillators for the accurate estimation of Newton's constant. Our scheme promises to beat the current standard by several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Enhanced quantum sensing in time-modulated non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing the sensitivity of quantum sensing near an exceptional point represents a significant phenomenon in non-Hermitian (NH) systems. However, the application of this property in time-modulated NH systems remains largely unexplored. In this work, we propose two theoretical schemes to achieve enhanced quantum sensing in time-modulated NH systems by leveraging the coalescence of eigenvalues and eigenstates. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the full energy spectrum, including both real and imaginary components, the population distribution of eigenstates, and various characteristics associated with optimal conditions for sensitivity enhancement. Numerical simulations confirm that eigenvalue-based quantum sensors exhibit a 9.21-fold improvement compared to conventional Hermitian sensors, aligning with the performance of existing time-independent NH sensors. Conversely, for eigenstate-based quantum sensors, the enhancement reaches up to 50 times that of conventional Hermitian sensors, surpassing the results of existing time-independent NH sensors. Moreover, the eigenstate-based sensor exhibits divergent susceptibility even when not close to an exceptional point. Our findings pave the way for advanced sensing in time-sensitive contexts, thereby complementing existing efforts aimed at harnessing the unique properties of open systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum metrology of a structured reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately characterizing the properties of structured reservoirs is a key challenge in quantum systems and is of great importance for advances in quantum metrology and sensing. In this work, we employ a two-level system (qubit) as a probe, which is coupled to a structured reservoir consisting of an ancilla qubit and a Markovian environment modeled as a thermal bath. By exploiting non-Markovian dynamics, we systematically investigate the effectiveness of different interaction types between the probe and ancilla for estimating critical parameters, including temperature, ancilla frequency, and system-bath coupling strength. We quantify the precision of parameter estimation using quantum Fisher information (QFI) and analyze the system dynamics in both transient and steady-state regimes. Our findings demonstrate that non-Markovianity substantially enhances parameter estimation in the transient regime, with specific interactions facilitating sustained information backflow and yielding higher QFI values. However, the performance of these interactions is contingent on the parameter under estimation and the operational regime. For instance, certain interactions become prominent in the transient regime but exhibit diminished utility in the steady state, whereas others maintain their effectiveness even at equilibrium. These results stress the importance of judiciously selecting interactions adapted to specific estimation objectives and operational regimes.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the impact of disturbances in quantum channels is of paramount importance for the implementation of many quantum technologies, as noise can be detrimental to quantum correlations. Among the various types of disturbances, we explore the effects of white and colored noise and experimentally test the resilience of a quantum ghost spectrometer against these two types of noise, showing that it is always robust against white noise, whereas colored noise introduces a huge impact on the process.</description>

      <title>Many exact area-law scar eigenstates in the nonintegrable PXP and related models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present new, highly non-trivial area-law exact zero-energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional (1D) PXP and related models. We formulate sufficient conditions for a matrix product state to represent an exact zero-energy eigenstate of a given 1D kinetically constrained model and use them to prove our new states. We also demonstrate that all previously known exact eigenstates of PXP-type models satisfy these conditions, and, in fact, can be directly deduced from them. We discuss and demonstrate a remarkably effective general numerical technique for discovering finite-bond-dimension eigenstates residing in degenerate subspaces of a broad class of Hamiltonians. Our results highlight a previously unrecognized structure characteristic of the exponentially large nullspaces in kinetically constrained models, suggesting the possibly of extensively many increasingly complex area-law zero-energy eigenstates in the thermodynamic limit. The important implications of these emergent exact eigenstates for the general thermalization phenomenology are exemplified by one of the states introduced in this work, which we propose is a member of the primary $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum many-body scar tower responsible for long-lived revivals in the Rydberg atom chain experiment.</description>

      <title>Enhancing variational quantum algorithms by balancing training on classical and quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computers offer a promising route to tackling problems that are classically intractable such as in prime-factorization, solving large-scale linear algebra and simulating complex quantum systems, but require fault-tolerant quantum hardware. On the other hand, variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have the potential to provide a near-term route to quantum utility or advantage, and is usually constructed by using parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) in combination with a classical optimizer for training. Although VQAs have been proposed for a multitude of tasks such as ground-state estimation, combinatorial optimization and unitary compilation, there remain major challenges in its trainability and resource costs on quantum hardware. Here we address these challenges by adopting Hardware Efficient and dynamical LIe algebra Supported Ansatz (HELIA), and propose two training schemes that combine an existing g-sim method (that uses the underlying group structure of the operators) and the Parameter-Shift Rule (PSR). Our improvement comes from distributing the resources required for gradient estimation and training to both classical and quantum hardware. We numerically test our proposal for ground-state estimation using Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and classification of quantum phases using quantum neural networks. Our methods show better accuracy and success of trials, and also need fewer calls to the quantum hardware on an average than using only PSR (upto 60% reduction), that runs exclusively on quantum hardware. We also numerically demonstrate the capability of HELIA in mitigating barren plateaus, paving the way for training large-scale quantum models.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum information cannot be broadcast -- an intrinsic limitation imposed by quantum mechanics. However, recent advances in virtual operations have brought new insights into the no-broadcasting theorem. Here, we focus on the practical utility and introduce sample efficiency as a fundamental constraint, requiring any practical broadcasting protocol perform no worse than the naive approach of direct preparation and distribution. We prove that no linear process -- whether quantum or beyond -- can simultaneously uphold sample efficiency, unitary covariance, permutation invariance, and classical consistency. This leads to a no-practical-broadcasting theorem, which places strict limits on the practical distribution of quantum information. To achieve this, we use Schur-Weyl duality to provide a significantly simplified derivation of the uniqueness of the canonical virtual broadcasting map, which satisfies the latter three conditions, and determine its sample complexity via semidefinite programming. Our approach naturally extends the uniqueness of virtual broadcasting to the 1-to-N case and provides its construction. Moreover, we demonstrate that the connection between virtual broadcasting and pseudo-density operators is limited to the 1-to-2 case and generally does not hold, further underscoring the fundamental asymmetry between spatial and temporal statistics in the quantum world.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Relaxation Spectroscopy of Fluxonium Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that parasitic two-level systems (TLS) in superconducting qubits, which are a leading source of decoherence, can have relaxation times longer than the qubits themselves. However, the standard techniques used to characterize qubit relaxation is only valid for measuring $T_1$ under Markovian assumptions and could mask such non-Markovian behavior of the environment in practice. Here, we introduce two-timescale relaxometry, a technique to probe the qubit and environment relaxation simultaneously and efficiently. We apply it to high-coherence fluxonium qubits over a frequency range of 0.1-0.4 GHz, which reveals a discrete spectrum of TLS with millisecond lifetimes. Our analysis of the spectrum is consistent with a random distribution of TLS in the aluminum oxide tunnel barrier of the Josephson junction chain of the fluxonium with an average density and electric dipole similar to previous TLS studies at much higher frequencies. Our study suggests that investigating and mitigating TLS in the junction chain is crucial to the development of various types of noise-protected qubits in circuit QED.</description>

      <title>Quantum Characterization, Verification, and Validation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum characterization, verification, and validation (QCVV) is a set of techniques to probe, describe, and assess the behavior of quantum bits (qubits), quantum information-processing registers, and quantum computers. QCVV protocols probe and describe the effects of unwanted decoherence so that it can be eliminated or mitigated. They can be usefully divided into characterization techniques that estimate predictive models for a device's behavior from data, and benchmarking techniques that assess overall performance of a device. In this introductory article, we briefly summarize the history of QCVV, introduce the mathematical models and metrics upon which it relies, and then summarize the foundational fields of tomography, randomized benchmarking, and holistic benchmarks. We conclude with brief descriptions of (and references to) advanced topics including gate set tomography, phase estimation, Pauli noise learning, characterization of mid-circuit measurements and non-Markovianity, classical shadows, verification and certification, and logical qubit assessment.</description>

      <title>A foundational derivation of quantum weak values and time-dependent density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The equations of time-dependent density functional theory are derived, via the expression for the quantum weak value, from ring polymer quantum theory using a symmetry between time and imaginary time. The imaginary time path integral formalism of Feynman, in which inverse temperature is seen to be a Wick rotation of time, allows one to write the equilibrium partition function of a quantum system in a form isomorphic with the path integral expression for the dynamics. Therefore the self-consistent field theory equations which are solutions to the equilibrium partition function are Wick rotated back into a set of dynamic equations, which are shown to give the formula for the quantum weak value. As a special case, this in turn reduces to the equations of time-dependent density functional theory. This first-principles derivation does not use the theorems of density functional theory, which are instead applied to guarantee equivalence with standard quantum mechanics. An expression for finite-temperature dynamics is also derived using the limits of the equilibrium equations and the ground state dynamics. This finite temperature expression shows that a ring polymer model for quantum particles holds for time-dependent systems as well as static situations. Issues arising in time-dependent density functional theory, such as causality, initial state dependence, and $v$-representability, are discussed in the context of the ring polymer derivation. Connections with a variety of quantum phenomena is reviewed, and a possible link with de Broglie-Bohm theory is mentioned.</description>

      <title>Coherence of a hole spin flopping-mode qubit in a circuit quantum electrodynamics environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement of microwave photons and spin qubits in silicon represents a pivotal step forward for quantum information processing utilizing semiconductor quantum dots. Such hybrid spin circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) has been achieved by granting a substantial electric dipole moment to a spin by de-localizing it in a double quantum dot under spin-orbit interaction, thereby forming a flopping-mode (FM) spin qubit. Despite its promise, the coherence properties demonstrated to date remain insufficient to envision FM spin qubits as practical single qubits. Here, we present a FM hole spin qubit in a silicon nanowire coupled to a high-impedance niobium nitride microwave resonator for readout. We report Rabi frequencies exceeding 100 MHz and coherence times in the microsecond range, resulting in a high single gate quality factor of 380. This establishes FM spin qubits as fast and reliable qubits. Moreover, using the large frequency tunability of the FM qubit, we reveal for the first time that photonic effects predominantly limit coherence, with radiative decay being the main relaxation channel and photon shot-noise inducing dephasing. These results highlight that optimized microwave engineering can unlock the potential of FM spin qubits in hybrid cQED architectures, offering a scalable and robust platform for fast and coherent spin qubits with strong coupling to microwave photons.</description>

      <title>A quantum monomer-dimer model on Penrose tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a quantum monomer-dimer model in the space of maximal dimer coverings of quasicrystalline Penrose tilings. Since Penrose tilings do not admit perfect dimer coverings, as shown by F. Flicker et al., PRX 10, 011005 (2020), monomers are necessarily present in our model. The model features a frustration-free Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) point where the ground state is a uniform superposition of all the exponentially many maximal dimer coverings, despite the presence of a finite density of monomers. We map our model to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory with matter and calculate various correlators to characterize the phase of the system at the RK point using classical Monte Carlo calculations. Specifically, we compute the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators, as well as open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops corresponding to the monomers and the visons. We find that both the dimer-dimer and vison-vison correlators decay exponentially with distance. The open Wilson lines and closed Wilson loops decay exponentially with the same correlation length, indicating that the gauge theory is in the confined phase, which implies that the system is likely in an ordered phase.</description>

      <title>The category of anyon sectors for non-abelian quantum double models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Kitaev's quantum double model for arbitrary finite gauge group in infinite volume, using an operator-algebraic approach. The quantum double model hosts anyonic excitations which can be identified with equivalence classes of `localized and transportable endomorphisms', which produce anyonic excitations from the ground state. Following the Doplicher--Haag--Roberts (DHR) sector theory from AQFT, we organize these endomorphisms into a braided monoidal category capturing the fusion and braiding properties of the anyons. We show that this category is equivalent to $\mathrm{Rep}_f \mathcal{D}(G)$, the representation category of the quantum double of $G$. This establishes for the first time the full DHR structure for a class of 2d quantum lattice models with non-abelian anyons.</description>

      <title>Crosscap states with tunable entanglement as exact eigenstates of local spin chain Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been observed recently that various spin chain Hamiltonians admit special zero energy "crosscap" eigenstates. These states are made up of maximally entangled Bell pairs prepared on antipodal sites of a periodic chain. We generalize the states by allowing the antipodal pairs to have non-maximal, tunable entanglement. We give sufficient conditions for such states to be exact zero energy eigenstates of a local Hamiltonian. The conditions are naturally satisfied in many models which have a global U(1) symmetry. These models include well known integrable models such as the XX model, the Bariev model, the folded XXZ model, and also a variety of non-integrable models. Using the zero-energy crosscap states we also derive a family of exact zero modes with sub-volume law entanglement.</description>

      <title>Deep quantum Monte Carlo approach for polaritonic chemistry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge of experimental and theoretical interest in controlling the properties of matter, such as its chemical reactivity, by confining it in optical cavities, where the enhancement of the light-matter coupling strength leads to the creation of hybrid light-matter states known as polaritons. However, ab initio calculations that account for the quantum nature of both the electromagnetic field and matter are challenging and have only started to be developed in recent years. We introduce a deep learning variational quantum Monte Carlo method to solve the electronic and photonic Schr\"odinger equation of molecules trapped in optical cavities. We extend typical electronic neural network wavefunction ansatzes to describe joint fermionic and bosonic systems, i.e. electron-photon systems, in a quantum Monte Carlo framework. We apply our method to hydrogen molecules in a cavity, computing both ground and excited states. We assess their energy, dipole moment, charge density shift due to the cavity, the state of the photonic field, and the entanglement developed between the electrons and photons. When possible, we compare our results with more conventional quantum chemistry methods proposed in the literature, finding good qualitative agreement, thus extending the range of scientific problems that can be tackled using machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>Using machine learning to map simulated noisy and laser-limited multidimensional spectra to molecular electronic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) has enabled significant discoveries in both biological and synthetic energy-transducing systems. Although deriving chemical information from 2DES is a complex task, machine learning (ML) offers exciting opportunities to translate complicated spectroscopic data into physical insight. Recent studies have found that neural networks (NNs) can map simulated multidimensional spectra to molecular-scale properties with high accuracy. However, simulations often do not capture experimental factors that influence real spectra, including noise and suboptimal pulse resonance conditions, bringing into question the experimental utility of NNs trained on simulated data. Here, we show how factors associated with experimental 2D spectral data influence the ability of NNs to map simulated 2DES spectra onto underlying intermolecular electronic couplings. By systematically introducing multisourced noise into a library of 356000 simulated 2D spectra, we show that noise does not hamper NN performance for spectra exceeding threshold signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) (&gt; 6.6 if background noise dominates vs. &gt; 2.5 for intensity-dependent noise). In stark contrast to human-based analyses of 2DES data, we find that the NN accuracy improves significantly (ca. 84% $\rightarrow$ 96%) when the data are constrained by the bandwidth and center frequency of the pump pulses. This result is consistent with the NN learning the optical trends described by Kasha's theory of molecular excitons. Our findings convey positive prospects for adapting simulation-trained NNs to extract molecular properties from inherently imperfect experimental 2DES data. More broadly, we propose that machine-learned perspectives of nonlinear spectroscopic data may produce unique and, perhaps, counterintuitive guidelines for experimental design.</description>

      <title>A theory of quasiballistic spin transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent work [Mierzejewski et al., Phys. Rev. B 107, 045134 (2023)] observed "quasiballistic spin transport" - long-lived and transiently ballistic modes of the magnetization density - in numerical simulations of infinite-temperature XXZ chains with power-law exchange interactions. We develop an analytical theory of such quasiballistic spin transport. Previous work found that this effect was maximized along a specific locus in the space of model parameters, which interpolated smoothly between the integrable Haldane-Shastry and XX models and whose shape was estimated from numerics. We obtain an analytical estimate for the lifetime of the spin current and show that it has a unique maximum along a different locus, which interpolates more gradually between the two integrable points. We further rule out the existence of a conserved two-body operator that protects ballistic spin transport away from these integrable points by proving that a corresponding functional equation has no solutions. We discuss connections between our approach and an integrability-transport conjecture for spin.</description>

Abstract: The variational determination of the two-boson reduced density matrix is described for a one-dimensional system of $N$ (where $N$ ranges from $2$ to $10^4$) harmonically trapped bosons interacting via contact interaction. The ground-state energies are calculated, and compared to existing methods in the field, including the analytic case (for $N=2)$ and mean-field approaches such as the one-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation and its variations. Structural properties including the density and correlation functions are also derived, including the behaviour of the correlation function when boson coordinates coincide, collectively demonstrating the capacity of the reduced density matrix method to accurately calculate ground-state properties of bosonic systems comprising few to many bosons, including the cross-over region between these extremes, across a large range of interaction strengths.</description>

      <title>From Paramagnet to Dipolar Topological Order via Duality and Dipolar SPT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A scheme for the adaptive preparation of a topological state with dipole symmetry, dubbed the dipolar topological state (dTS), which serves as an example of translation symmetry-enriched topological phase, is proposed. The midcircuit state emerging during the preparation process is identified as a two-dimensional symmetry-protected topological (SPT) state protected by dipole bundle symmetry alongside charge and 1-form symmetries. The non-trivial boundary modes of the dipolar SPT state exhibiting the spontaneous breaking of charge and dipole bundle symmetries are analyzed. The duality map between the paramagnetic state and the dipolar topological state is established in the framework of the {\it simultaneous gauging} of two charge symmetries and one dipole symmetry that cannot be reduced as sequential gauging of the individual symmetry. Leveraging this duality, we work out the phase diagram of the dipolar topological state under perturbations by various transverse fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a field theory formulation for the interaction of an ensemble of two-level tunneling systems (TLS) with the electronic states of a superconductor. Predictions for the impact of two-level tunneling systems on superconductivity are presented, including $T_c$ and spectrum of quasiparticle states for conventional BCS superconductors. We show that non-magnetic TLS impurities in conventional s-wave superconductors can act as pair-breaking or pair-enhancing defects depending on the level population of the distribution of TLS impurities. We present calculations of the enhancement of superconductivity, both $T_c$ and the order parameter, for TLS defects in thermal equilibrium with the electrons and lattice. The scattering of quasiparticles by TLS impurities leads to sub-gap states below the bulk excitation gap, $\Delta$, as well as resonances in the continuum above $\Delta$. The energies and spectral weights of these states depend on the distribution of tunnel splittings, while the spectral weights are particularly sensitive to the level occupation of the TLS impurities. Under microwave excitation, or decoupling from the thermal bath, a nonequilibrium level population of the TLS distribution generates subgap quasiparticle states near the Fermi level which contribute to dissipation and thus degrade the performance of superconducting devices at low temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent investigation into the phenomena of refraction and reflection at temporal boundaries, conducted through the lens of spacetime duality, has attracted considerable scholarly interest. This duality unveils insights into the propagation behaviors of beams at the temporal boundaries of perturbed systems. We have delineated a temporal boundary effect amenable to external control through a specifically tailored driving force, augmented by a time-varying constituent within the driving signal. We then unveil the phenomenon of beam splitting-both in time refraction and reflection induced by perturbing the lattice's hopping parameter over time. By introducing varying intensities of aperiodic disorder to the coupling coefficients, we have exercised authority over the reflection angles. Our results lay the groundwork for delving into the temporal evolution of crystalline attributes via temporal boundary effects, while also enabling deliberate manipulation of spatial distribution frequency patterns by regulating the form and magnitude of noise.

      <title>Quantum Hamiltonian Descent for Non-smooth Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-smooth optimization models play a fundamental role in various disciplines, including engineering, science, management, and finance. However, classical algorithms for solving such models often struggle with convergence speed, scalability, and parameter tuning, particularly in high-dimensional and non-convex settings. In this paper, we explore how quantum mechanics can be leveraged to overcome these limitations. Specifically, we investigate the theoretical properties of the Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD) algorithm for non-smooth optimization in both continuous and discrete time. First, we propose continuous-time variants of the general QHD algorithm and establish their global convergence and convergence rate for non-smooth convex and strongly convex problems through a novel Lyapunov function design. Furthermore, we prove the finite-time global convergence of continuous-time QHD for non-smooth non-convex problems under mild conditions (i.e., locally Lipschitz). In addition, we propose discrete-time QHD, a fully digitized implementation of QHD via operator splitting (i.e., product formula). We find that discrete-time QHD exhibits similar convergence properties even with large time steps. Finally, numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the computational advantages of QHD over classical non-smooth non-convex optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Event Soliton Formation in Mixed Energy-Momentum Gaps of Nonlinear Spacetime Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the formation of a novel soliton, termed event soliton, in nonlinear photonic spacetime crystals (STCs). In these media, simultaneous spatiotemporal periodic modulation of the dielectric constant generates mixed frequency (${\omega}$) and wavevector (k) gaps. Under Kerr nonlinearity, the event solitons emerge as fully localized entities in both spacetime and energy-momentum domains, providing a tangible demonstration of the concept of event in relativity. The ${\omega}$k-gap mixture arises from the coexistence and competition between time reflected and Bragg reflected waves due to the spatiotemporal modulation. We propose a new partial differential equation to capture various spatiotemporal patterns and present numerical simulations to validate our theoretical predictions, reflecting a three-way balance among k-gap opening, ${\omega}$-gap opening, and nonlinearity. Our work opens avenues for fundamental studies and fosters experimental prospects for implementing spacetime crystals in both time-varying photonics and periodically driven condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>HiQ-Lip: The First Quantum-Classical Hierarchical Method for Global Lipschitz Constant Estimation of ReLU Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the global Lipschitz constant of neural networks is crucial for understanding and improving their robustness and generalization capabilities. However, precise calculations are NP-hard, and current semidefinite programming (SDP) methods face challenges such as high memory usage and slow processing speeds. In this paper, we propose \textbf{HiQ-Lip}, a hybrid quantum-classical hierarchical method that leverages Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs) to estimate the global Lipschitz constant. We tackle the estimation by converting it into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and implement a multilevel graph coarsening and refinement strategy to adapt to the constraints of contemporary quantum hardware. Our experimental evaluations on fully connected neural networks demonstrate that HiQ-Lip not only provides estimates comparable to state-of-the-art methods but also significantly accelerates the computation process. In specific tests involving two-layer neural networks with 256 hidden neurons, HiQ-Lip doubles the solving speed and offers more accurate upper bounds than the existing best method, LiPopt. These findings highlight the promising utility of small-scale quantum devices in advancing the estimation of neural network robustness.</description>

      <title>A Scalable and Robust Compilation Framework for Emitter-Photonic Graph State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum graph states are critical resources for various quantum algorithms, and also determine essential interconnections in distributed quantum computing. There are two schemes for generating graph states probabilistic scheme and deterministic scheme. While the all-photonic probabilistic scheme has garnered significant attention, the emitter-photonic deterministic scheme has been proved to be more scalable and feasible across several hardware platforms.
  This paper studies the GraphState-to-Circuit compilation problem in the context of the deterministic scheme. Previous research has primarily focused on optimizing individual circuit parameters, often neglecting the characteristics of quantum hardware, which results in impractical implementations. Additionally, existing algorithms lack scalability for larger graph sizes. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel compilation framework that partitions the target graph state into subgraphs, compiles them individually, and subsequently combines and schedules the circuits to maximize emitter resource utilization. Furthermore, we incorporate local complementation to transform graph states and minimize entanglement overhead. Evaluation of our framework on various graph types demonstrates significant reductions in CNOT gates and circuit duration, up to 52% and 56%. Moreover, it enhances the suppression of photon loss, achieving improvements of up to x1.9.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Quantum SVM Training on Ising Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds significant potential to accelerate machine learning algorithms, especially in solving optimization problems like those encountered in Support Vector Machine (SVM) training. However, current QUBO-based Quantum SVM (QSVM) methods rely solely on binary optimal solutions, limiting their ability to identify fuzzy boundaries in data. Additionally, the limited qubit count in contemporary quantum devices constrains training on larger datasets. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic quantum SVM training framework suitable for Coherent Ising Machines (CIMs). By formulating the SVM training problem as a QUBO model, we leverage CIMs' energy minimization capabilities and introduce a Boltzmann distribution-based probabilistic approach to better approximate optimal SVM solutions, enhancing robustness. To address qubit limitations, we employ batch processing and multi-batch ensemble strategies, enabling small-scale quantum devices to train SVMs on larger datasets and support multi-class classification tasks via a one-vs-one approach. Our method is validated through simulations and real-machine experiments on binary and multi-class datasets. On the banknote binary classification dataset, our CIM-based QSVM, utilizing an energy-based probabilistic approach, achieved up to 20% higher accuracy compared to the original QSVM, while training up to $10^4$ times faster than simulated annealing methods. Compared with classical SVM, our approach either matched or reduced training time. On the IRIS three-class dataset, our improved QSVM outperformed existing QSVM models in all key metrics. As quantum technology advances, increased qubit counts are expected to further enhance QSVM performance relative to classical SVM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quantum transport generated by the bipartite entanglement in two-dimensional conformal field theory at finite density with the $U(1) \times U(1)$ symmetry associated to the conservation of the electric charge and of the helicity. The bipartition given by an interval is considered, either on the line or on the circle. The continuity equations and the corresponding conserved quantities for the modular flows of the currents and of the energy-momentum tensor are derived. We investigate the mean values of the associated currents and their quantum fluctuations in the finite density representation, which describe the properties of the modular quantum transport. The modular analogues of the Johnson-Nyquist law and of the fluctuation-dissipation relation are found, which encode the thermal nature of the modular evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.08939v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Gottesman's (1998) semantics for Clifford circuits based on the Heisenberg representation gives rise to a lightweight Hoare-like logic for efficiently characterizing a common subset of quantum programs. Our applications include (i) certifying whether auxiliary qubits can be safely disposed of, (ii) determining if a system is separable across a given bipartition, (iii) checking the transversality of a gate with respect to a given stabilizer code, and (iv) computing post-measurement states for computational basis measurements. Further, this logic is extended to accommodate universal quantum computing by deriving Hoare triples for the $T$-gate, multiply-controlled unitaries such as the Toffoli gate, and some gate injection circuits that use associated magic states. A number of interesting results emerge from this logic, including a lower bound on the number of $T$ gates necessary to perform a multiply-controlled $Z$ gate.</description>

      <title>Robust quantum metrology with random Majorana constellations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.01612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Even the most classical states are still governed by quantum theory. A number of physical systems can be described by their Majorana constellations of points on the surface of a sphere, where concentrated constellations and highly symmetric distributions correspond to the least and most quantum states, respectively. If these points are chosen randomly, how quantum will the resultant state be, on average? We explore this simple conceptual question in detail, investigating the quantum properties of the resulting random states. We find these states to be far from the norm, even in the large-number-of-particles limit, where classical intuition often replaces quantum properties, making random Majorana constellations peculiar and intriguing. Moreover, we study their usefulness in the context of rotation sensing and find numerical evidence of their robustness against dephasing and particle loss. We realize these states experimentally using light's orbital angular momentum degree of freedom and implement arbitrary unitaries with a multiplane light conversion setup to demonstrate the rotation sensing. Our findings open up new possibilities for quantum-enhanced metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.12497v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in systems with symmetry is a cornerstone phenomenon accompanying second-order phase transitions. Here, we predict the opposite phenomenon, namely, spontaneous symmetry emergence in a system that lacks symmetry. In the example of two coupled oscillators interacting non-symmetrically with a set of oscillators whose frequencies uniformly fill a finite frequency range, we demonstrate that the system state can acquire symmetry that is not inherent in the system Hamiltonian. The emergence of symmetry is manifested as a change in the system dynamics, which can be interpreted as a phase transition in a Hermitian system that lacks symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17220v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that energy dissipation in slowly-driven, Markovian quantum systems at low temperature is linked to the geometry of the driving protocol through the quantum (or Fubini-Study) metric. Utilizing these findings, we establish lower bounds on dissipation rates in two-tone protocols, such as those employed for topological frequency conversion. Notably, in appropriate limits these bounds are only determined by the topology of the protocol and an effective quality factor of the system-bath coupling. Our results bridge topological and geometric phenomena with energy dissipation in open quantum systems, and further provide design principles for optimal driving protocols.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Clustering is one of the most important tools for analysis of large datasets, and perhaps the most popular clustering algorithm is Lloyd's iteration for $k$-means. This iteration takes $n$ vectors $V=[v_1,\dots,v_n]\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$ and outputs $k$ centroids $c_1,\dots,c_k\in\mathbb{R}^d$; these partition the vectors into clusters based on which centroid is closest to a particular vector. We present an overall improved version of the "$q$-means" algorithm, the quantum algorithm originally proposed by Kerenidis, Landman, Luongo, and Prakash (NeurIPS'19) which performs $\varepsilon$-$k$-means, an approximate version of $k$-means clustering. Our algorithm does not rely on quantum linear algebra primitives of prior work, but instead only uses QRAM to prepare simple states based on the current iteration's clusters and multivariate quantum amplitude estimation. The time complexity is $\widetilde{O}\big(\frac{\|V\|_F}{\sqrt{n}}\frac{k^{5/2}d}{\varepsilon}(\sqrt{k} + \log{n})\big)$ and maintains the logarithmic dependence on $n$ while improving the dependence on most of the other parameters. We also present a "dequantized" algorithm for $\varepsilon$-$k$-means which runs in $O\big(\frac{\|V\|_F^2}{n}\frac{k^{2}}{\varepsilon^2}(kd + \log{n})\big)$ time. Notably, this classical algorithm matches the logarithmic dependence on $n$ attained by the quantum algorithm.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithms for the Pathwise Lasso</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum high-dimensional linear regression algorithm with an $\ell_1$-penalty based on the classical LARS (Least Angle Regression) pathwise algorithm. Similarly to available classical algorithms for Lasso, our quantum algorithm provides the full regularisation path as the penalty term varies, but quadratically faster per iteration under specific conditions. A quadratic speedup on the number of features $d$ is possible by using the simple quantum minimum-finding subroutine from D\"urr and Hoyer (arXiv'96) in order to obtain the joining time at each iteration. We then improve upon this simple quantum algorithm and obtain a quadratic speedup both in the number of features $d$ and the number of observations $n$ by using the approximate quantum minimum-finding subroutine from Chen and de Wolf (ICALP'23). In order to do so, we approximately compute the joining times to be searched over by the approximate quantum minimum-finding subroutine. As another main contribution, we prove, via an approximate version of the KKT conditions and a duality gap, that the LARS algorithm (and therefore our quantum algorithm) is robust to errors. This means that it still outputs a path that minimises the Lasso cost function up to a small error if the joining times are only approximately computed. Furthermore, we show that, when the observations are sampled from a Gaussian distribution, our quantum algorithm's complexity only depends polylogarithmically on $n$, exponentially better than the classical LARS algorithm, while keeping the quadratic improvement on $d$. Moreover, we propose a dequantised version of our quantum algorithm that also retains the polylogarithmic dependence on $n$, albeit presenting the linear scaling on $d$ from the standard LARS algorithm. Finally, we prove query lower bounds for classical and quantum Lasso algorithms.</description>

      <title>Line Search Strategy for Navigating through Barren Plateaus in Quantum Circuit Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms are viewed as promising candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage on near-term devices. These approaches typically involve the training of parameterized quantum circuits through a classical optimization loop. However, they often encounter challenges attributed to the exponentially diminishing gradient components, known as the barren plateau (BP) problem. This work introduces a novel optimization approach designed to alleviate the adverse effects of BPs during circuit training. In contrast to conventional gradient descent methods with a small learning parameter, our approach relies on making a finite hops along the search direction determined on a randomly chosen subsets of the free parameters. The optimization search direction, together with the range of the search, is determined by the distant features of the cost-function landscape. This enables the optimization path to navigate around barren plateaus without the need for external control mechanisms. We have successfully applied our optimization strategy to quantum circuits comprising 16 qubits and 15000 entangling gates, demonstrating robust resistance against BPs. Additionally, we have extended our optimization strategy by incorporating an evolutionary selection framework, enhancing its ability to avoid local minima in the landscape. The modified algorithm has been successfully utilized in quantum gate synthesis applications, showcasing a significantly improved efficiency in generating highly compressed quantum circuits compared to traditional gradient-based optimization approaches.</description>

      <title>Realization of versatile and effective quantum metrology using a single bosonic mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14967v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum metrology offers the potential to surpass its classical counterpart, pushing the boundaries of measurement precision toward the ultimate Heisenberg limit. This enhanced precision is normally attained by utilizing large squeezed states or multi-particle entangled quantum states, both of which are often challenging to implement and prone to decoherence in real quantum devices. In this work, we present a versatile and on-demand protocol for deterministic parameter estimation that leverages two efficient state-transfer operations on a single bosonic mode. Specifically, we demonstrate this protocol in the context of phase estimation using the superposition of coherent states in the bosonic circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platform. With low average photon numbers of only up to 1.76, we achieve quantum-enhanced precision approaching the Heisenberg scaling, reaching a metrological gain of 7.5(6) dB. Importantly, we show that the gain or sensitivity range can be further enhanced on the fly by tailoring the input states, with different superposition weights, based on specific system constraints. The realization of this versatile and efficient scheme affords a promising path towards practical quantum-enhanced sensing, not only for bosonic cQED hardware but also readily extensible to other continuous-variable platforms.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of solid-state spin qubits: a computational perspective</title>

Abstract: The usefulness of solid-state spins in quantum technologies depends on how long they can remain in a coherent superposition of quantum states. This Colloquium discusses how first-principles simulations can predict spin dynamics for different types of solid-state electron spins, helping design novel and improved platforms for quantum computing, networking, and sensing.
  We begin by outlining the necessary concepts of the noise affecting generic quantum systems. We then focus on recent advances in predicting spin-phonon relaxation of the spin-defect qubits. Next, we discuss cluster methods as a means of simulating quantum decoherence induced by spin-spin interactions, emphasizing the critical role of validation in ensuring the accuracy of these simulations. We highlight how validated cluster methods can be instrumental in interpreting recent experimental results and, more importantly, predicting the coherence properties of novel spin-based quantum platforms, guiding the development of next-generation quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional entanglement witnessed by correlations in arbitrary bases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04395v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certifying entanglement is an important step in the development of many quantum technologies, especially for higher-dimensional systems, where entanglement promises increased capabilities for quantum communication and computation. A key feature distinguishing entanglement from classical correlations is the occurrence of correlations for complementary measurement bases. In particular, mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) are a paradigmatic example that is well-understood and routinely employed for entanglement certification. However, implementing unbiased measurements exactly is challenging and not generically possible for all physical platforms. Here, we extend the entanglement-certification toolbox from correlations in MUBs to arbitrary bases. This practically significant simplification paves the way for efficient characterizations of high-dimensional entanglement in a wide range of physical systems. Furthermore, we introduce a simple three-MUBs construction for all dimensions without using the Wootters-Fields construction, potentially simplifying experimental requirements when measurements in more than two MUBs are needed, especially in high-dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Qutrit and Qubit Circuits for Three-Flavor Collective Neutrino Oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13914v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the utility of qutrits and qubits for simulating the flavor dynamics of dense neutrino systems. The evolution of such systems impacts some important astrophysical processes, such as core-collapse supernovae and the nucleosynthesis of heavy nuclei. Many-body simulations require classical resources beyond current computing capabilities for physically relevant system sizes. Quantum computers are therefore a promising candidate to efficiently simulate the many-body dynamics of collective neutrino oscillations. Previous quantum simulation efforts have primarily focused on properties of the two-flavor approximation due to their direct mapping to qubits. Here, we present new quantum circuits for simulating three-flavor neutrino systems on qutrit- and qubit-based platforms, and demonstrate their feasibility by simulating systems of two, four and eight neutrinos on IBM and Quantinuum quantum computers.</description>

      <title>A Sufficient Criterion for Divisibility of Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17103v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple, dimension-independent criterion which guarantees that some quantum channel $\Phi$ is divisible, i.e. that there exists a non-trivial factorization $\Phi=\Phi_1\Phi_2$. The idea is to first define an "elementary" channel $\Phi_2$ and then to analyze when $\Phi\Phi_2^{-1}$ is completely positive. The sufficient criterion obtained this way -- which even yields an explicit factorization of $\Phi$ -- is that one has to find orthogonal unit vectors $x,x^\perp$ such that $\langle x^\perp|\mathcal K_\Phi\mathcal K_\Phi^\perp|x\rangle=\langle x|\mathcal K_\Phi\mathcal K_\Phi^\perp|x\rangle=\{0\}$ where $\mathcal K_\Phi$ is the Kraus subspace of $\Phi$ and $\mathcal K_\Phi^\perp$ is its orthogonal complement. Of course, using linearity this criterion can be reduced to finitely many equalities. Generically, this division even lowers the Kraus rank which is why repeated application -- if possible -- results in a factorization of $\Phi$ into in some sense "simple" channels. Finally, be aware that our techniques are not limited to the particular elementary channel we chose.</description>

      <title>Measurement Induced Magic Resources</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01980v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic states and magic gates are crucial for achieving universal computation, but some important questions about how magic resources should be implemented to attain quantum advantage have remained unexplored, for instance, in the context of Measurement-based Quantum Computation (MQC) with only single-qubit measurements. This work bridges the gap between MQC and the resource theory of magic by introducing the concept of ``invested'' and ``potential" magic resources. The former quantifies the magic cost associated with the MQC framework, serving both as a witness of magic resources and an upper bound for the realization of a desired unitary transformation. Potential magic resources represent the maximum achievable magic resource in a given graph structure defining the MQC. We utilize these concepts to analyze the magic resource requirements of the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and provide a fresh perspective on the universality of MQC of different resource states, highlighting the crucial role of non-Pauli measurements for injecting magic. We demonstrate experimentally our theoretical predictions in a high-fidelity four-photon setup and demonstrate the efficiency of MQC in generating magic states, surpassing the limitations of conventional magic state injection methods. Our findings pave the way for future research exploring magic resource optimization and novel distillation schemes within the MQC framework, contributing to the advancement of fault-tolerant universal quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulations with compressed circuits and fewer measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (AVQDS) method performs real-time evolution of quantum states using automatically generated parameterized quantum circuits that often contain substantially fewer gates than Trotter circuits. Here we report an improved version of the method, which we call AVQDS(T), by porting the Tiling Efficient Trial Circuits with Rotations Implemented Simultaneously (TETRIS) technique. The algorithm adaptively adds layers of disjoint unitary gates to the ansatz circuit so as to keep the McLachlan distance, a measure of the accuracy of the variational dynamics, below a fixed threshold. We perform benchmark noiseless AVQDS(T) simulations of quench dynamics in local spin models demonstrating that the TETRIS technique significantly reduces the circuit depth and two-qubit gate count. We also show a method based on eigenvalue truncation to solve the linear equations of motion for the variational parameters with enhanced noise resilience. Finally, we propose a way to substantially alleviate the measurement overhead of AVQDS(T) while maintaining high accuracy by synergistically integrating quantum circuit calculations on quantum processing units with classical calculations using, e.g., tensor networks to evaluate the quantum geometric tensor. We showcase that this approach enables AVQDS(T) to deliver more accurate results than simulations using a fixed ansatz of comparable final depth for a significant time duration with fewer quantum resources.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo Tree Search approach to QAOA: finding a needle in the haystack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for quantum algorithms to tackle classical combinatorial optimization problems has long been one of the most attractive yet challenging research topics in quantum computing. In this context, variational quantum algorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods tailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware. However, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical parameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima or in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of efficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully leveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach QAOA parameter optimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an adaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence technique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show that leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree structure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy suitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the interplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a valuable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>In-situ tunable interaction with an invertible sign between a fluxonium and a post cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07612v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computation with bosonic modes presents a powerful paradigm for harnessing the principles of quantum mechanics to perform complex information processing tasks. In constructing a bosonic qubit with superconducting circuits, nonlinearity is typically introduced to a cavity mode through an ancillary two-level qubit. However, the ancilla's spurious heating has impeded progress towards fully fault-tolerant bosonic qubits. The ability to in situ decouple the ancilla when not in use would be beneficial but has so far only been realized with tunable couplers or additional parametric drives. This work presents a novel architecture for quantum information processing, comprising a 3D post cavity coupled to a fluxonium ancilla via a readout resonator. This system's intricate energy level structure results in a complex landscape of interactions whose sign can be tuned in situ by the magnetic field threading the fluxonium loop without the need of additional elements. Our results could significantly advance the lifetime and controllability of bosonic qubits.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid quantum-classical approach to prime factorization. The proposed algorithm is based on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), which employs a classical optimizer to find the ground state of a given Hamiltonian. A numerical study is presented, evaluating the performance of the proposed method across various instances on both IBM's real quantum computer and its classical simulator. The results demonstrate that the method is capable of successfully factorizing numbers up to 253 on a real quantum computer and up to 1048561 on a classical simulator. These findings show the potential of the approach for practical applications on near-term quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, rotation sensors utilizing the nuclear spins of nitrogen-vacancy color centers in diamond have been demonstrated. However, these devices are power-intensive and challenging to integrate into small chip-based radiofrequency antennas and circuits necessary for controlling nuclear spins or producing relatively high magnetic fields. To address this issue, the coherent manipulation of nuclear spins via coherent population trapping at moderate magnetic fields using microwave fields has been successfully demonstrated in isotopically pure diamond. In this work, we demonstrate that a similar technique can be applied to a diamond plate with a natural abundance of carbon-13, which holds significant potential for practical sensing applications. Although the forbidden resonances required for coherent control were only partially observed, coherent population trapping was successfully demonstrated at both visible and invisible transitions, with an apparent contrast of up to 98+-11% and a true contrast of approximately 35+-7%. This finding confirms the feasibility of coherent nuclear spin control even in diamond plates with naturally occurring carbon-13</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08040v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a quantum perturbative approach to evaluating the phase shift of an atom interferometer in a weakly anharmonic trap. This provides a simple way to evaluate quantum corrections to the standard semi-classical approximation. The calculation benefits from the use of generalized coherent states for a basis. We find that the form of the semi-classical approximation remains valid to first order in the anharmonic perturbation, but that phase differences arise because the trajectory of a quantum wave packet will generally deviate from that of a classical particle. The quantum correction to the phase is a factor $\ell^2/A^2$ smaller than the semi-classical perturbation itself, where $\ell$ is the quantum harmonic oscillator length scale and $A$ is the classical amplitude of the motion. We provide analytical results for one-dimensional perturbations of power three through six in the position coordinate.</description>

Abstract: In this paper certain classes of infinite sums involving special functions are evaluated analytically by application of basic quantum mechanical principles to simple models of half harmonic oscillator and a particle trapped inside an infinite potential well. The infinite sums $\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\frac{2^{2n}}{(2n+1)!}\Gamma^{2}\left(n+\frac{3}{2}\right)\left[\hspace{0.2mm}_2\hspace{-0.03cm}F_1\left(-n,\frac{\nu+2}{2};\frac{3}{2};\frac{1}{2}\right)\right]^{2}$, $\sum^{\infty}_{n=0}\frac{\left[L_{\nu}^{2n+1-\nu}\left(\frac{b^{2}}{2}\right)\right]^{2}b^{4n}}{2^{2n}(2n+1)!}$ and $\sum^{\infty}_{n=1}\frac{\big[J_{\nu+1}(n\pi)\big]^{2}}{n^{2\nu}}$, where $_2\hspace{-0.03cm}F_1\left(-n,\frac{\nu+2}{2};\frac{3}{2};\frac{1}{2}\right)$ is generalized hypergeometric function, $L_{\nu}^{2n+1-\nu}\left(\frac{b^{2}}{2}\right)$ associated Laguerre polynomial and $J_{\nu+1}(n\pi)$ Bessel function of the first kind, are calculated for integer $\nu$. It is also demonstrated that the same procedure can be generalized by application to some classes of functions which are not regular wave functions leading to additional infinite sums, as a consequence of which the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\left[\mathsf{H}_{\nu}(n\pi)\right]^{2}}{n^{2\nu}}$ containing Struve functions of the first kind $\mathsf{H}_{\nu}(n\pi)$ are evaluated. Convergence of the evaluated series, additionally verified by the application of different convergence tests, is secured by the properties of the corresponding Hilbert space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a composite atom-cavity system interacting with a ring resonator. In such a structure, time crystal regime can be observed. We show that a quadratic observation time dependence of the system's sensitivity to perturbations takes place in the time crystal regime and also in the transition area to the normal state. This dependence is due to ability of the system to retain the memory of the atom's initial state. Outside these areas, the system is not able to retain the memory of the atom's initial state and the sensitivity scales linearly on the observation time. Our results open up a new way for implementation of discrete time crystals in sensing and metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17064v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting and characterizing decoherence-inducing noise sources is critical for developing scalable quantum technologies and deploying quantum sensors that operate at molecular scales. Yet, existing methods for such noise spectroscopy face fundamental difficulties, including their reliance on severe approximations and the need for extensively averaged measurements. Here, we propose an alternative approach that processes the commonly performed dynamical decoupling-based coherence measurements using a novel self-consistent optimization framework to extract the noise power spectrum that characterizes the interaction between a qubit or quantum sensor and its environment. Our approach adopts minimal assumptions and is robust to the presence of measurement errors. We introduce a protocol to quantify confidence intervals and a physically motivated heuristic to determine which new dynamical decoupling measurement can improve spectral reconstruction. We employ our method to reconstruct the noise spectrum of a nitrogen-vacancy sensor in diamond, resolving previously undetected nuclear species at the diamond surface and revealing that the previous measurements of low-frequency noise had overestimated its strength by an order of magnitude. Our method's noise spectrum reconstructions uncover previously unsuspected structure and offer unprecedented accuracy, setting the stage for precision noise spectroscopy-based quantum metrology.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a promising technology for secure communication. Nevertheless, QKD is still treated with caution in certain contexts due to potential gaps between theoretical models and actual QKD implementations. A common assumption in security proofs is that the detection probability at the receiver, for a given input state, is independent of the measurement basis, which might not always be verified and could lead to security loopholes. This paper presents a security proof for QKD protocols that does not rely on the above assumption and is thus applicable in scenarios with detection probability mismatches, even when induced by the adversary. We demonstrate, through simulations, that our proof can extract positive key rates for setups vulnerable to large detection probability mismatches. This is achieved by monitoring whether an adversary is actively exploiting such vulnerabilities, instead of considering the worst-case scenario as in previous proofs. Our work highlights the importance of accounting for basis-dependent detection probabilities and provides a concrete solution for improving the security of practical QKD systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient estimation of error bounds for quantum multiparametric imaging with constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08199v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced super-resolution imaging techniques require specific approaches for accurate and consistent estimation of the achievable spatial resolution. Fisher information supplied to Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) has proved to be a powerful and efficient tool for resolution analysis and optical setups optimization. However, the standard CRB is not applicable to constrained problems violating the unbiasedness condition, while such models are frequently encountered in quantum imaging of complex objects. Complimentary to the existing approaches based on modifying CRB, we propose a practical algorithm for approximate construction of a modified Fisher information matrix, which takes the constraints into account and can be supplied to the standard CRB. We demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed technique by applying it to 1-, 2-, and multi-parameter model problems in quantum imaging. The approach provides quantitative explanation of previous results with successful experimental reconstruction of objects with the spatial scale smaller than the theoretical limit predicted by the standard CRB.</description>

      <title>Exceptional stationary state in a dephasing many-body open quantum system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a dephasing many-body open quantum system that hosts, together with the infinite-temperature state, another additional stationary state. The latter is exceptional in many respects, as it is pure and retains memory of the initial condition, whereas any orthogonal state evolves towards the infinite-temperature state erasing any information on the initial state. We discuss the approach to stationarity of the model focusing in particular on the fate of interfaces between the two states; a simple classical model based on a membrane picture helps developing an effective hydrodynamic theory even if the dynamics does not feature any conserved quantity. The fact that the model reaches stationary properties on timescales that depend on the system size while the asymptotic decay rate is finite is duly highlighted. We point out the reasons for considering these exceptional stationary states as quantum many-body scars in the open system framework.</description>

Abstract: The simulation of the dynamics of a system coupled to a low-temperature environment is a promising application of quantum computers to determine ground-state properties of physical systems. However, this approach requires not only the $\textit{existence}$ of an environment that allows the system to dissipate energy and evolve to its ground state, but also the $\textit{detailed knowledge}$ of the properties of the bath. In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for ground state preparation which only relies on the $\textit{existence}$ of a physical bath which achieves the same task, while a detailed description of the environment may remain $\textit{unknown}$. In particular, we show that this ``super-bath quantum eigensolver algorithm'' prepares the ground state of the system by combining a Gaussian stabilization dephasing procedure with the simulation of the interaction between the system and a super-bath which only requires minimal knowledge of the physical environment. Supported by experimental lifetime data of nuclear metastable states, we suggest that our algorithm is applicable to determine nuclear ground states in polynomial time. These results highlight the potential advantage of quantum computing in addressing ground state problems in real-world physical systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum random walks have been shown to be powerful quantum algorithms for certain tasks on graphs like database searching, quantum simulations etc. In this work we focus on its applications for the graph isomorphism problem. In particular we look at how we can compare multi-particle quantum walks and well known classical WL tests and how quantum walks can be used to distinguish hard graphs like CFI graphs which k-WL tests cannot distinguish. We provide theoretical proofs and empirical results to show that a k-QW with input superposition states distinguishes k-CFI graphs. In addition we also prove that a k-1 QW with localized input states distinguishes k-CFI graphs. We also prove some additional results about strongly regular graphs (SRGs).</description>

      <title>A trilinear quantum dot architecture for semiconductor spin qubits</title>

Abstract: Semiconductor quantum dot spin qubits hold significant potential for scaling to millions of qubits for practical quantum computing applications, as their structure highly resembles the structure of conventional transistors. Since classical semiconductor manufacturing technology has reached an unprecedented level of maturity, reliably mass-producing CMOS chips with hundreds of billions of components, conventional wisdom dictates that leveraging CMOS technologies for quantum dot qubits can result in upscaled quantum processors with thousands or even millions of interconnected qubits. However, the interconnect requirements for quantum circuits are very different from those for classical circuits, where for each qubit individual control and readout wiring could be needed. Although significant developments have been demonstrated on small scale systems, qubit numbers remain limited, to a large extent due to the lack of scalable qubit interconnect schemes. Here, we present a trilinear quantum dot array that is simple in physical layout while allowing individual wiring to each quantum dot. By means of electron shuttling, the trilinear architecture provides qubit connectivity that is equivalent to or even surpasses that of 2D square lattice. Assuming the current qubit fidelities of small-scale devices can be extrapolated to large-scale arrays, medium-length shuttling arrays on the order of tens of microns would allow million-scale qubit systems, while maintaining manageable overheads. We also present a scalable control scheme, where the qubit chip is 3D-integrated with a low-power switch-based cryoCMOS circuit for parallel qubit operation with limited control inputs. As our trilinear quantum dot array is fully compatible with existing semiconductor technologies, this qubit architecture represents one possible framework for future research and development of large-scale spin qubit systems.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Algorithm for Assessing Node Importance in the st-Connectivity Attack</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Problems in distributed security often naturally map to graphs. The centrality of nodes assesses the importance of nodes in a graph. It is used in various applications. Cooperative game theory has been used to create nuanced and flexible notions of node centrality. However, the approach is often computationally complex to implement classically. This work describes a quantum approach to approximating the importance of nodes that maintain a target connection. In addition, we detail a method for quickly identifying high-importance nodes. The approximation method relies on quantum subroutines for st-connectivity and approximating Shapley values. The search for important nodes relies on a quantum algorithm to find the maximum. We consider st-connectivity attack scenarios in which a malicious actor disrupts a subset of nodes to perturb the system functionality. Our methods identify the nodes that are most important in minimizing the impact of the attack. The node centrality metric identifies where more redundancy is required and can be used to enhance network resiliency. Finally, we explore the potential complexity benefits of our quantum approach in contrast to classical random sampling.</description>

      <title>Qualitative differences in the robust controllability of model two-qubit systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The precise implementation and manipulation of quantum gates is key to extracting advantages from future quantum technologies. Achieving this requires very accurate control over the quantum system. If one has complete knowledge about a Hamiltonian, accurate manipulation of the system is possible. However, in real scenarios, there will often be some uncertainty in the parameters of the Hamiltonian, which makes full control of the system either difficult or impossible. In this paper we consider two model Hamiltonians with a continuous parameter that is partly unknown. We assess robust controllability against this parameter uncertainty using existing theoretical frameworks and take a numerical route by discretizing the unknown parameter in the cases where we cannot predict controllability. Furthermore, we introduce a penalty term into the fidelity function to optimize control pulses, enhancing robustness against the influence of parameter fluctuations. Within our framework, we analyze the qualitative differences in the robust controllability of the two systems.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL) has emerged as a promising research field, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to enhance the performance of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. However, despite its growing interest, QRL still faces significant challenges. It is still uncertain if QRL can show any advantage over classical RL beyond artificial problem formulations. Additionally, it is not yet clear which streams of QRL research show the greatest potential. The lack of a unified benchmark and the need to evaluate the reliance on quantum principles of QRL approaches are pressing questions. This work aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive comparison of three major QRL classes: Parameterized Quantum Circuit based QRL (PQC-QRL) (with one policy gradient (QPG) and one Q-Learning (QDQN) algorithm), Free Energy based QRL (FE-QRL), and Amplitude Amplification based QRL (AA-QRL). We introduce a set of metrics to evaluate the QRL algorithms on the widely applicable benchmark of gridworld games. Our results provide a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the QRL classes, shedding light on the role of quantum principles in QRL and paving the way for future research in this field.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising domain to leverage the computational capabilities of quantum systems to solve complex classification tasks. In this work, we present the first comprehensive QML study by benchmarking the MedMNIST-a diverse collection of medical imaging datasets on a 127-qubit real IBM quantum hardware, to evaluate the feasibility and performance of quantum models (without any classical neural networks) in practical applications. This study explores recent advancements in quantum computing such as device-aware quantum circuits, error suppression, and mitigation for medical image classification. Our methodology is comprised of three stages: preprocessing, generation of noise-resilient and hardware-efficient quantum circuits, optimizing/training of quantum circuits on classical hardware, and inference on real IBM quantum hardware. Firstly, we process all input images in the preprocessing stage to reduce the spatial dimension due to quantum hardware limitations. We generate hardware-efficient quantum circuits using backend properties expressible to learn complex patterns for medical image classification. After classical optimization of QML models, we perform inference on real quantum hardware. We also incorporate advanced error suppression and mitigation techniques in our QML workflow, including dynamical decoupling (DD), gate twirling, and matrix-free measurement mitigation (M3) to mitigate the effects of noise and improve classification performance. The experimental results showcase the potential of quantum computing for medical imaging and establish a benchmark for future advancements in QML applied to healthcare.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a numerical framework based on tree tensor operators that enables large-scale simulation of out-of-equilibrium open quantum many-body systems. By design, it protects density operator positivity and provides direct access to entanglement monotones, such as entanglement of formation and logarithmic negativity. To demonstrate the framework's ability to probe entanglement in open quantum many-body systems and distinguish it from other correlations, we study a paradigmatic open system problem: the boundary-driven XXZ spin-chain. We uncover entanglement transitions driven by both the coupling to the environment and the anisotropy parameter. These transitions reveal an immediate connection between entanglement and spin-current, and link the known transport regimes of the model to distinct entanglement regimes, i.e., separable, area-law, and volume-law. Our work enables the analysis of entanglement in open quantum many-body systems out of equilibrium, a necessary step for developing scalable quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Direct Analysis of Zero-Noise Extrapolation: Polynomial Methods, Error Bounds, and Simultaneous Physical-Algorithmic Error Mitigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE) is a widely used quantum error mitigation technique that artificially amplifies circuit noise and then extrapolates the results to the noise-free circuit. A common ZNE approach is Richardson extrapolation, which relies on polynomial interpolation. Despite its simplicity, efficient implementations of Richardson extrapolation face several challenges, including approximation errors from the non-polynomial behavior of noise channels, overfitting due to polynomial interpolation, and exponentially amplified measurement noise. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of these challenges, presenting bias and variance bounds that quantify approximation errors. Additionally, for any precision $\varepsilon$, our results offer an estimate of the necessary sample complexity. We further extend the analysis to polynomial least squares-based extrapolation, which mitigates measurement noise and avoids overfitting. Finally, we propose a strategy for simultaneously mitigating circuit and algorithmic errors in the Trotter-Suzuki algorithm by jointly scaling the time step size and the noise level. This strategy provides a practical tool to enhance the reliability of near-term quantum computations. We support our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A discrete Fourier transform based quantum circuit for modular multiplication in Shor's algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Shor's algorithm for the prime factorization of numbers provides an exponential speedup over the best known classical algorithms. However, nontrivial practical applications have remained out of reach due to experimental limitations. The bottleneck of the experimental realization of the algorithm is the modular exponentiation operation. In this paper, based on a relation between the modular multiplication operator and generalizations of discrete Fourier transforms, we propose a quantum circuit for modular exponentiation. A distinctive feature of our proposal is that our circuit can be entirely implemented in terms of the standard quantum circuit for the discrete Fourier transform and its variants. The gate-complexity of our proposal is $O(L^3)$ where L is the number of bits required to store the number being factorized. It is possible that such a proposal may provide easier avenues for near-term generic implementations of Shor's algorithm, in contrast to existing realizations which have often explicitly adapted the circuit to the number being factorized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ZZ crosstalk and decoherence hinder superconducting quantum computing. To enhance parallelism in mitigating ZZ crosstalk, we formulate the problem by integrating quantum cycles and two forms of qubit interference. We then propose CYCO, a CYcle-aware ZZ Crosstalk Optimization algorithm, which uses a timing-based greedy strategy to schedule gates through cycles within quantum circuits. A novel data structure called Time and Distance Dependency Graph is designed to model gate data dependencies and physical distances from quantum topologies for precise scheduling. Additionally, dynamically punching barriers reduces idle time in quantum circuits, further enhancing parallelism. Simulations show a reduction of up to 37.44% in quantum program cycle (14.19% on average) on various NISQ devices with 53 to 127 qubits. Real-device experiments on IBMQ-Brisbane demonstrate significant acceleration in quantum computing while maintaining fidelity.</description>

Abstract: Discrete-Time Crystals (DTC) are a non-equilibrium phase of matter characterized by the breaking of time-translation symmetry in periodically driven quantum systems. In this work, we present a detailed thermodynamic analysis of a DTC in a one-dimensional spin-1/2 chain coupled to a thermal bath. We derive a master equation from the microscopic model, and we explore key thermodynamic quantities, such as work, heat, and entropy production. Our results reveal that the DTC signature inevitably decays in the presence of environmental noise, but we show that a periodic measurement scheme can mitigate the effects of decoherence, stabilizing the subharmonic oscillations of the DTC for extended periods. These findings provide insights into the robustness of time-crystalline phases and potential strategies for protecting them in experimental settings.</description>

Abstract: Many-body entanglement unveils additional aspects of quantum matter and offers insights into strongly correlated physics. While ground-state entanglement has received much attention in the past decade, the study of mixed-state quantum entanglement using negativity in interacting fermionic systems remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate that the partially transposed density matrix of interacting fermions, similar to their reduced density matrix, can be expressed as a weighted sum of Gaussian states describing free fermions, enabling the calculation of rank-$n$ R\'{e}nyi negativity within the determinant quantum Monte Carlo framework. We calculate the rank-two R\'{e}nyi negativity for the half-filled Hubbard model and the spinless $t$-$V$ model. Our calculation reveals that the area law coefficient of the R\'{e}nyi negativity for the spinless $t$-$V$ model has a logarithmic finite-size scaling at the finite-temperature transition point. Our work contributes to the calculation of entanglement and sets the stage for future studies on quantum entanglement in various fermionic many-body mixed states.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics as the effective field theory of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the hunt for new phases of matter in quantum mixed states, it has recently been proposed that the equivalence of microcanonical and canonical ensembles in statistical mechanics is a manifestation of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) in an underlying many-body quantum description. Here, we build an effective field theory for SWSSB of a global U(1) symmetry; the answer exactly reproduces the Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theory of diffusion for the conserved charge. We conclude that hydrodynamics can be understood as a theory of "superfluidity" for the broken strong symmetry: a non-vanishing susceptibility is a measurable order parameter for SWSSB, the diffusion mode is the Goldstone boson of the spontaneously broken continuous symmetry, and a generalization of Goldstone's Theorem implies that the diffusion mode is always long-lived. This perspective provides a transparent physical explanation for the unusual "reparameterization" symmetries which are a necessary ingredient of Schwinger-Keldysh effective field theories for "normal fluids".</description>

      <title>The M\"obius Game: A Quantum-Inspired Test of General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a tight inequality to test the dynamical nature of spacetime. A general-relativistic violation of that inequality certifies change of curvature, in the same sense as a quantum-mechanical violation of a Bell inequality certifies a source of entanglement. The inequality arises from a minimal generalization of the Bell setup. It represents a limit on the winning chance of a collaborative multi-agent game played on the M\"obius graph. A long version of this Letter including other games and how these games certify the dynamical character of the celebrated quantum switch is accessible as arXiv:2309.15752 [gr-qc].</description>

      <title>Synthetic half-integer magnetic monopole and single-vortex dynamics in spherical Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles are crucial in explaining the quantization of electric charges and quantum Hall effects, while artificially creating a minimal magnetic monopole in experiments remains a challenge. Here, we come up with a flexible way to simulate a half-integer-type monopole in Bose gases and investigate the induced vortex dynamics on a sphere. We list the possible experiment parameter settings for different isotopes and discuss their experimental feasibility. With the assumption of a rigid monopole-vortex structure, we analytically predict the vortex trajectory in an external magnetic field. We then confirm the result by numerically solving the Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which employs two gauges simultaneously (the Wu-Yang approach) to prevent singularity in the one-gauge method when a monopole is present. The study offers significant insight into the characteristics of monopoles and vortices, facilitating avenues for experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Large positive magnetoconductance in carbon nanoscrolls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03518v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate that carbon nanoscrolls -- spirally wrapped graphene layers with open endpoints -- can be characterized by a large positive magnetoconductance. We show that when a carbon nanoscroll is subject to an axial magnetic field of several Tesla, the ballistic conductance at low carrier densities of the nanoscroll has an increase of about 200%. Importantly, we find that this positive magnetoconductance is not only preserved in an imperfect nanoscroll (with disorder or mild inter-turn misalignment) but can even be enhanced in the presence of on-site disorder. We prove that the positive magnetoconductance comes about the emergence of magnetic field-induced zero energy modes, specific of rolled-up geometries. Our results establish curved graphene systems as a new material platform displaying sizable magnetoresistive phenomena.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of Disjoint Intervals in Dual-Unitary Circuits: Exact Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16750v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growth of the entanglement between two disjoint intervals and its complement after a quantum quench is regarded as a dynamical chaos indicator. Namely, it is expected to show qualitatively different behaviours depending on whether the underlying microscopic dynamics is chaotic or integrable. So far, however, this could only be verified in the context of conformal field theories. Here we present an exact confirmation of this expectation in a class of interacting microscopic Floquet systems on the lattice, i.e., dual-unitary circuits. These systems can either have zero or a super extensive number of conserved charges: the latter case is achieved via fine-tuning. We show that, for almost all dual unitary circuits on qubits and for a large family of dual-unitary circuits on qudits the asymptotic entanglement dynamics agrees with what is expected for chaotic systems. On the other hand, if we require the systems to have conserved charges, we find that the entanglement displays the qualitatively different behaviour expected for integrable systems. Interestingly, despite having many conserved charges, charge-conserving dual-unitary circuits are in general not Yang-Baxter integrable.</description>

      <title>Generalized Clausius inequalities and entanglement production in holographic two-dimensional CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Utilizing quantum information theory, it has been shown that irreversible entropy production is bounded from both below and above in physical processes. Both these bounds are positive and generalize the Clausius inequality. Such bounds are, however, obtained from distance measures in the space of states, which are hard to define and compute in quantum field theories. We show that the quantum null energy condition (QNEC) can be utilized to obtain both lower and upper bounds on irreversible entropy production for quenches leading to transitions between thermal states carrying uniform momentum density in two dimensional holographic conformal field theories. We achieve this by refining earlier methods and developing an algebraic procedure for determining HRT surfaces in arbitrary Ba\~nados-Vaidya geometries which are dual to quenches involving transitions between general quantum equilibrium states (e.g. thermal states) where the QNEC is saturated. We also discuss results for the growth and thermalization of entanglement entropy for arbitrary initial and final temperatures and momentum densities. The rate of quadratic growth of entanglement just after the quench depends only on the change in the energy density and is independent of the entangling length. For sufficiently large entangling lengths, the entanglement tsunami phenomenon can be established. Finally, we study recovery of the initial state from the evolving entanglement entropy and argue that the Renyi entropies should give us a refined understanding of scrambling of quantum information.</description>

      <title>From Stars to Molecules: AI Guided Device-Agnostic Super-Resolution Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Super-resolution imaging has revolutionized the study of systems ranging from molecular structures to distant galaxies. However, existing super-resolution methods require extensive calibration and retraining for each imaging setup, limiting their practical deployment. We introduce a device-agnostic deep-learning framework for super-resolution imaging of point-like emitters that eliminates the need for calibration data or explicit knowledge of optical system parameters. Our model is trained on a diverse, numerically simulated dataset encompassing a broad range of imaging conditions, enabling generalization across different optical setups. Once trained, it reconstructs super-resolved images directly from a single resolution-limited camera frame with superior accuracy and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. We experimentally validate our approach using a custom microscopy setup with ground-truth emitter positions. We also demonstrate its versatility on astronomical and single-molecule localization microscopy datasets, achieving unprecedented resolution without prior information. Our findings establish a pathway toward universal, calibration-free super-resolution imaging, expanding its applicability across scientific disciplines.</description>

      <title>Anti Kibble-Zurek behavior in the quantum XY spin-1/2 chain driven by correlated noisy magnetic field and anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the non-adiabatic dynamics across a quantum phase transition, the Kibble-Zurek paradigm describes that the average number of topological defects is suppressed as a universal power law with the quench time scale. A conflicting observation, which termed anti-Kibble-Zurek dynamics has been reported in several studies, specifically in the driven systems with an uncorrelated stochastic (white) noise. Here, we study the defect generation in the driven transverse field/anisotropy quantum $XY$ model in the presence of a correlated (colored) Gaussian noise. We propose a generic conjecture that properly capture the noise-induced excitation features, which shows good agreement with the numerical simulations. We show that, the dynamical features of defect density are modified by varying the noise correlation time. Our numerical simulations confirm that, for fast noises, the dynamics of the defect density is the same as that of the uncorrelated (white) noise, as is expected. However, the larger ratio of noise correlation time to the annealing time results in larger defects density formation and reforms the universal dynamical features. Our finding reveals that, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the annealing time for fast noises, while in the presence of the slow noises, the noise-induced defects scale linearly with the square of the annealing time. The numerical simulations confirm that, the optimal annealing time, at which the defects density is minimum, scales linearly in logarithmic scale with the total noise power having different exponents for the fast and slow noises.</description>

      <title>Quantum Strong-to-Weak Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Decohered Critical Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking has been a central theme in classifying quantum phases and phase transitions. Recently, this concept has been extended to the mixed states of open systems, attracting considerable attention due to the emergence of novel physics beyond closed systems. In this Letter, we reveal a new type of phase transition in mixed states, termed \emph{quantum} strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB). Using a combination of field theory calculations and large-scale matrix product state simulations, we map out the global phase diagram of the XXZ critical spin chain under two-site XX decoherence, which features an SWSSB phase and a trivial Luttinger liquid phase, separated by a straight critical line that belongs to the boundary Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless universality class with a varying effective central charge. Remarkably, the SWSSB transition in our case is \emph{purely quantum} in the sense that it can only be driven by tuning the Hamiltonian parameter even under arbitrarily small decoherence strength, fundamentally distinguishing it from the decoherence-driven SWSSB transitions extensively discussed in previous literature. Conversely, no such phase transition occurs under ZZ decoherence. Finally, we also discuss the experimental relevance of our theory on quantum simulator platforms.</description>
