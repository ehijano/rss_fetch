      <title>Reducing the Environmental Impact of Midblock Crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accommodating pedestrians crossing midblock has been shown to have harmful environmental consequences because of increased fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. Somewhat surprisingly, no studies were devoted to mitigating the environmental impact of midblock crossing. Our main contribution is to propose schemes that mitigate the increased fuel consumption and CO2 emissions due to pedestrian midblock crossing by leveraging information about the location and expected duration of the crossing. This information is shared in a timely manner with approaching cars. We evaluated the impact of car decisions on fuel consumption and emissions by exploring potential trajectories that cars may take as a result of messages received. Our extensive simulations showed that timely dissemination of pedestrian crossing information to approaching vehicles can reduce fuel consumption and emissions by up to 16.7%.</description>

Abstract: From the implementation of the Grafcet programming language we obtain in this document the different ways of applying this method, the advantages it obtains with respect to efficiency, cost, quality and operational and time optimization. The behavior of a pump alternation process is analyzed using GRAFCET, which is easier to design, verify and implement sequential control systems.

      <title>Optimizing Bio-energy Supply Chain to Achieve Alternative Energy Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In response to global warming and the dwindling reservoirs of fossil fuels, Thailand has increasingly embraced alternative energy sources. Central to its energy development strategy is the Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP), which aims to reduce energy intensity, capitalize on residual resources, and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. While significant strides have been made in meeting various consumption targets set forth by the AEDP, notable challenges persist, particularly in the realms of bio-mass-derived electricity generation, bio-gas utilization, and bio-ethanol production from bio-mass. Therefore, this study delves into the factors contributing to the shortfall in achieving AEDP targets and proposes strategies to enhance the efficiency of the bioenergy supply chain. Leveraging mathematical and linear programming techniques, our research optimizes the supply chain dynamics, accounting for monthly supplier profiles spanning 77 provinces, 17 distinct biomasses, and 427 bioenergy plants equipped with diverse energy conversion technologies. Our findings indicate that Thailand currently boasts adequate bio-mass resources to fulfill the electricity and bio-ethanol targets outlined in the AEDP provided enhancements are made to supply chain efficiency. To fully realize the objectives of the AEDP, we recommend augmenting bio-mass cultivation efforts and implementing new power plant installations. Additionally, we advocate for the consideration of high-methane content fuels, such as solid waste, as a means to alleviate bio-mass demand. This study underscores the paramount importance of strategic planning and optimization in propelling Thailand towards its alternative energy ambitions while surmounting supply chain impediments.</description>

      <title>Estimates on the domain of validity for Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction is a dimensionality reduction technique in nonlinear systems analysis that is commonly utilised in the study of bifurcation problems in high-dimensional systems. The method is a systematic procedure for reducing the dimensionality of systems of algebraic equations that have singular points, preserving essential features of their solution sets. In this article, we establish estimates for the region of validity of the reduction by applying bounds on the implicit function theorem derived in [https://doi.org/10.1007/s00498-023-00370-5]. We then apply these bounds to an illustrative example of a two-dimensional system with a pitchfork bifurcation.</description>

      <title>Verification of Neural Network Control Systems in Continuous Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network controllers are currently being proposed for use in many safety-critical tasks. Most analysis methods for neural network control systems assume a fixed control period. In control theory, higher frequency usually improves performance. However, for current analysis methods, increasing the frequency complicates verification. In the limit, when actuation is performed continuously, no existing neural network control systems verification methods are able to analyze the system. In this work, we develop the first verification method for continuously-actuated neural network control systems. We accomplish this by adding a level of abstraction to model the neural network controller. The abstraction is a piecewise linear model with added noise to account for local linearization error. The soundness of the abstraction can be checked using open-loop neural network verification tools, although we demonstrate bottlenecks in existing tools when handling the required specifications. We demonstrate the approach's efficacy by applying it to a vision-based autonomous airplane taxiing system and compare with a fixed frequency analysis baseline.</description>

      <title>Quasi-periodic Disturbance Observer for Wideband Harmonic Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic disturbances composed of harmonics usually appear during periodic operation, impairing performance in mechanical and electrical systems. To improve the performance, control for periodic-disturbance suppression has been studied, such as repetitive control and periodic-disturbance observer. For robustness against perturbations in each cycle, slight changes over cycles, slight variations in the period, and/or aperiodic disturbances, although wideband harmonic suppression is expected, the conventional methods have trade-offs among the wideband harmonic suppression, non-amplification of aperiodic disturbances, and deviation of harmonic suppression frequencies. This article proposes a quasi-periodic disturbance observer to estimate and compensate for a quasi-periodic disturbance. The quasi-periodic disturbance is defined to consist of harmonics and surrounding signals, based on which the quasi-periodic disturbance observer is designed using a periodic-pass filter of a first-order periodic/aperiodic separation filter, time delay integrated with a zero-phase low-pass filter, and an inverse plant model with a first-order low-pass filter. For the implementation of the proposed observer, its Q-filter is discretized by the exact mapping of the s-plane to the z-plane, and the inverse plant model is discretized by the backward Euler method. The experiments validated the frequency response and position-control precision of the quasi-periodic disturbance observer in comparison with conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Performance Evaluation of Damping Systems in Civil Engineering Structures Via Minimal Sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To control structural responses under various actions, the growing use of supplementary damping systems in modern civil engineering structures necessitates inspecting and evaluating their operational performance postinstallation. However, due to the dispersed placement and complex nonlinearities of these devices, difficulties arise in determining minimal sensor configuration. This is inherently connected to a pivotal challenge: establishing a reliable input-output mapping, which comprises both the mathematical model and sensor arrangements. Prior work indicates this can be achieved through theoretical observability analysis or Lie symmetries analysis, both of which provide different perspectives on the existence of a way to access the solutions of a system identification problem uniquely (at least locally). The present study introduces a unified framework, enhanced by algorithm realization as an application guide, for analyzing the observability and Lie symmetries of a given input-output mapping. We demonstrate its implementation via examples of a building structure with various damping systems under different conditions such as seismic loads, wind loads, and operational vibrations. Finally, we present a case study for an isolation building with an inerter damper and minimal sensor arrangement under seismic action. The results demonstrate that the unscented Kalman filter, a system identification method, can precisely estimate structural responses and assess damping device performance once a reliable input-output mapping is established.</description>

      <title>Modal Analysis of Power System with High CIG Penetration Based on Impedance Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the modal analysis of power systems with high Converter-Interfaced Generation (CIG) penetration utilizing an impedance-based modeling approach. Traditional modal analysis based on the state-space model (MASS) requires comprehensive control structures and parameters of each system element, a challenging prerequisite as converters increasingly integrate into power systems and their internal specifics remain largely inaccessible. Conversely, the proposed modal analysis based on the impedance model (MAI) leverages only the impedance port characteristics to pinpoint system elements significantly influencing unstable modes. This study is the first to confirm the theoretical equivalency between MASS and MAI in terms of transfer functions, eigenvalues, and sensitivities, thus bridging the gap between detailed theoretical modeling and practical, accessible analyses. We further provide enhancements to the MAI method, including a revised element participation index, a transformer ratio-based admittance sensitivity adjustment, and an impedance splitting-based sensitivity analysis considering parameter variations. Validation through numerical simulations on a modified IEEE 14-bus system underscores the efficacy of our approach. By examining the interplay between different elements and system modes in high CIG environments, this study offers insights and a foundational framework for delineating the oscillatory modes' participation and stability characteristics of power systems with substantial CIG integration.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning based Performance Testing for Analog Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a deep learning based performance testing framework to minimize the number of required test modules while guaranteeing the accuracy requirement, where a test module corresponds to a combination of one circuit and one stimulus. First, we apply a deep neural network (DNN) to establish the mapping from the response of the circuit under test (CUT) in each module to all specifications to be tested. Then, the required test modules are selected by solving a 0-1 integer programming problem. Finally, the predictions from the selected test modules are combined by a DNN to form the specification estimations. The simulation results validate the proposed approach in terms of testing accuracy and cost.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transmission Power Scheduling for Networked Control System under DoS Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing networked control systems that are reliable and resilient against adversarial threats, is essential for ensuring the security of cyber-physical systems. This paper addresses the communication-control co-design problem for networked control systems under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. In the wireless channel, a transmission power scheduler periodically determines the power level for sensory data transmission. Yet DoS attacks render data packets unavailable by disrupting the communication channel. This paper co-designs the control and power scheduling laws in the presence of DoS attacks and aims to minimize the sum of regulation control performance and transmission power consumption. Both finite- and infinite-horizon discounted cost criteria are addressed, respectively. By delving into the information structure between the controller and the power scheduler under attack, the original co-design problem is divided into two subproblems that can be solved individually without compromising optimality. The optimal control is shown to be certainty equivalent, and the optimal transmission power scheduling is solved using a dynamic programming approach. Moreover, in the infinite-horizon scenario, we analyze the performance of the designed scheduling policy and develop an upper bound of the total costs. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning: A Unified Framework Based on Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe a new conceptual framework that connects approximate Dynamic Programming (DP), Model Predictive Control (MPC), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). This framework centers around two algorithms, which are designed largely independently of each other and operate in synergy through the powerful mechanism of Newton's method. We call them the off-line training and the on-line play algorithms. The names are borrowed from some of the major successes of RL involving games; primary examples are the recent (2017) AlphaZero program (which plays chess, [SHS17], [SSS17]), and the similarly structured and earlier (1990s) TD-Gammon program (which plays backgammon, [Tes94], [Tes95], [TeG96]). In these game contexts, the off-line training algorithm is the method used to teach the program how to evaluate positions and to generate good moves at any given position, while the on-line play algorithm is the method used to play in real time against human or computer opponents.
  Significantly, the synergy between off-line training and on-line play also underlies MPC (as well as other major classes of sequential decision problems), and indeed the MPC design architecture is very similar to the one of AlphaZero and TD-Gammon. This conceptual insight provides a vehicle for bridging the cultural gap between RL and MPC, and sheds new light on some fundamental issues in MPC. These include the enhancement of stability properties through rollout, the treatment of uncertainty through the use of certainty equivalence, the resilience of MPC in adaptive control settings that involve changing system parameters, and the insights provided by the superlinear performance bounds implied by Newton's method.</description>

      <title>Hydrogen and Battery Based Energy Storage System (ESS) for Future DC Microgrids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a hydrogen-based energy storage system (ESS) is proposed for DC microgrids, which can potentially be integrated with battery ESS to meet the needs of future grids with high renewable penetration. Hydrogen-based ESS can provide a stable energy supply for a long time but has a slower response than battery ESSs. However, a combination of battery and hydrogen storage provides stable energy for an extended period of time and can easily handle the sudden demands and surpluses of the microgrid. One of the main challenges in this system is the integration of power electronics with fuel cell technology to convert renewable energy into electricity seamlessly. This paper proposes a system that uses an isolated DC-DC converter to activate clean hydrogen production using an electrolyzer and then pressurize the hydrogen to store in a tank. The pressured hydrogen becomes an essential input to the fuel cell, which regulates and transforms it into electricity. The electricity produced is then transferred to the grid using a DC-DC boost converter. A Simulink model of the hybrid system with a 1 kV DC bus voltage is used to demonstrate the hydrogen production and fuel cell behavior based on the demand and surplus power of the loads. The proposed system simulates aspects of the power conversion, electrolyzer, storage tank, and fuel cell needed for the proposed hybrid ESS. Due to its economic feasibility, the polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) is the primary technology considered for the electrolyzer and fuel cell.</description>

      <title>Log-Scale Quantization in Distributed First-Order Methods: Gradient-based Learning from Distributed Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized strategies are of interest for learning from large-scale data over networks. This paper studies learning over a network of geographically distributed nodes/agents subject to quantization. Each node possesses a private local cost function, collectively contributing to a global cost function, which the proposed methodology aims to minimize. In contrast to many existing literature, the information exchange among nodes is quantized. We adopt a first-order computationally-efficient distributed optimization algorithm (with no extra inner consensus loop) that leverages node-level gradient correction based on local data and network-level gradient aggregation only over nearby nodes. This method only requires balanced networks with no need for stochastic weight design. It can handle log-scale quantized data exchange over possibly time-varying and switching network setups. We analyze convergence over both structured networks (for example, training over data-centers) and ad-hoc multi-agent networks (for example, training over dynamic robotic networks). Through analysis and experimental validation, we show that (i) structured networks generally result in a smaller optimality gap, and (ii) logarithmic quantization leads to smaller optimality gap compared to uniform quantization.</description>

      <title>Multi-technology co-optimization approach for sustainable hydrogen and electricity supply chains considering variability and demand scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the pursuit of a carbon-neutral future, hydrogen emerges as a pivotal element, serving as a carbon-free energy carrier and feedstock. As efforts to decarbonize sectors such as heating and transportation intensify, understanding and navigating through the dynamics of hydrogen demand expansion becomes critical. Transitioning to hydrogen economy is complicated by varying regional scales and types of hydrogen demand, with forecasts indicating a rise in variable demand that calls for diverse production technologies. Currently, steam methane reforming is prevalent, but its significant carbon emissions make a shift to cleaner alternatives like blue and green hydrogen imperative. Each production method possesses distinct characteristics, necessitating a thorough exploration and co-optimization with electricity supply chains as well as carbon capture, utilization, and storage systems. Our study fills existing research gaps by introducing a superstructure optimization framework that accommodates various demand scenarios and technologies. Through case studies in California, we underscore the critical role of demand profiles in shaping the optimal configurations and economics of supply chains and emphasize the need for diversified portfolios and co-optimization to facilitate sustainable energy transitions.</description>

      <title>A Digital Twin Framework for Reinforcement Learning with Real-Time Self-Improvement via Human Assistive Teleoperation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a powerful approach to solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) when the model of the environment is not known a priori. However, RL models are still faced with challenges such as handling covariate shifts and ensuring the quality of human demonstration. To address these challenges and further advance DRL models, our work develops a human-in-the-loop DRL framework via digital twin that leverages human intelligence after deployment to retrain the DRL model in real time. First, we develop a pre-trained model fully based on learning through trial and error in the simulated environment allowing scalability and automation while eliminating variability and biases that can come from subjective human guidance. Second, instead of deploying the trained model directly on the UGV, we create a digital twin which controls the physical UGV from the virtual environment. Third, to allow continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting, we introduce the ability of the model to self-improve with the help of small human guidance at the start of the retraining. We test the performance of our proposed model in both simulation and real-world environments with both static and dynamic obstacles. The results indicate that our proposed approach not only outperforms the baseline models in terms of reward accumulation but also demonstrates superior training efficiency.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring sufficiently accurate models is crucial in target tracking systems. If the assumed models deviate too much from the truth, the tracking performance might be severely degraded. While the models are in general defined using multivariate conditions, the measures used to validate them are most often scalar-valued. In this paper, we propose matrix-valued measures for both offline and online assessment of target tracking systems. Recent results from Wishart statistics, and approximations thereof, are adapted and it is shown how these can be incorporated to infer statistical properties for the eigenvalues of the proposed measures. In addition, we relate these results to the statistics of the baseline measures. Finally, the applicability of the proposed measures are demonstrated using two important problems in target tracking: (i) distributed track fusion design; and (ii) filter model mismatch detection.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Assisted Optimal Bidding of BESS in FCAS Market: An AI-agent based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To incentivize flexible resources such as Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) to offer Frequency Control Ancillary Services (FCAS), Australia's National Electricity Market (NEM) has implemented changes in recent years towards shorter-term bidding rules and faster service requirements. However, firstly, existing bidding optimization methods often overlook or oversimplify the key aspects of FCAS market procedures, resulting in an inaccurate depiction of the market bidding process. Thus, the BESS bidding problem is modeled based on the actual bidding records and the latest market specifications and then formulated as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) problem. Secondly, the erratic decisions of the DRL agent caused by imperfectly predicted market information increases the risk of profit loss. Hence, a Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)-based DRL algorithm is developed to enhance the risk resilience of bidding strategies. Thirdly, well-trained DRL models still face performance decline in uncommon scenarios during online operations. Therefore, a Large Language Models (LLMs)-assisted artificial intelligence (AI)-agent interactive decision-making framework is proposed to improve the strategy timeliness, reliability and interpretability in uncertain new scenarios, where conditional hybrid decision and self-reflection mechanisms are designed to address LLMs' hallucination challenge. The experiment results demonstrate that our proposed framework has higher bidding profitability compared to the baseline methods by effectively mitigating the profit loss caused by various uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Constructing Dynamic Feedback Linearizable Discretizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic feedback linearization-based methods allow us to design control algorithms for a fairly large class of nonlinear systems in continuous time. However, this feature does not extend to their sampled counterparts, i.e., for a given dynamically feedback linearizable continuous time system, its numerical discretization may fail to be so. In this article, we present a way to construct discretization schemes (accurate up to first order) that result in schemes that are feedback linearizable. This result is an extension of our previous work, where we had considered only static feedback linearizable systems. The result presented here applies to a fairly general class of nonlinear systems, in particular, our analysis applies to both endogenous and exogenous types of feedback. While the results in this article are presented on a control affine form of nonlinear systems, they can be readily modified to general nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Sensing, Communication, and Control Co-design for Energy Efficient Satellite-UAV Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional terrestrial communication infrastructures often fail to collect the timely information from Internet of Thing (IoT) devices in remote areas. To address this challenge, we investigate a Satellite-unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) integrated Non-terrestrial network (NTN), where the UAV is controlled by remote control center via UAV-to-Satellite connections. To maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the UAV, we optimize the UAV trajectory, power allocation, and state sensing strategies, while guaranteing the control stability and communication reliability. This challenging problem is addressed using an efficient algorithm, incorporating a Deep Q-Network (DQN)-based trajectory determination, a closed form of power allocation, and one-dimensional searching for sensing. Numerical simulations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of our approach. The results showcase the data size of collection has a greater impact than transmission power, and reveal the relationship among sensing interval, communication maximum power and control performance. This study provides promising solutions and valuable insights for efficient data collection in remote IoT.</description>

      <title>Constructive Safety Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a constructive approach to safety control of nonlinear cascade systems subject to multiple state constraints. New design ingredients include a unified characterization of safety and stability for systematic designs of safety controllers, and a novel technique of reshaping the feasible sets of quadratically constrained quadratic programming induced from safety control. The proposed method guarantees Lipschitz continuity of virtual control laws, enabling a stepwise constructive design. A refined nonlinear small-gain synthesis is employed to address the nonlinear uncertain interconnections between the resulting subsystems corresponding to different virtual control laws, and to guarantee the achievement of the safety control objective. When the safety constraints are removed, the proposed approach coincides with the standard constructive nonlinear control. The proposed safety-control algorithm is experimentally validated in a testbed involving a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) vehicle taking off in narrow spaces.</description>

      <title>Safety-Critical Control of Euler-Lagrange Systems Subject to Multiple Obstacles and Velocity Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the safety-critical control problem for Euler-Lagrange (EL) systems subject to multiple ball obstacles and velocity constraints in accordance with affordable velocity ranges. A key strategy is to exploit the underlying inner-outer-loop structure for the design of a new cascade controller for the class of EL systems. In particular, the outer-loop controller is developed based on quadratic programming (QP) to avoid ball obstacles and generate velocity reference signals fulfilling the velocity limitation. Taking full advantage of the conservation-of-energy property, a nonlinear velocity-tracking controller is designed to form the inner loop. One major difficulty is caused by the possible non-Lipschitz continuity of the standard QP algorithm when there are multiple constraints. To solve this problem, we propose a refined QP algorithm with the feasible set reshaped by an appropriately chosen positive basis such that the feasibility is retained while the resulting outer-loop controller is locally Lipschitz. It is proved that the constraint-satisfaction problem is solvable as long as the ball obstacles satisfy a mild distance condition. The proposed design is validated by numerical simulation and an experiment based on a $2$-link planar manipulator.</description>

      <title>Cascade Network Stability of Synchronized Traffic Load Balancing with Heterogeneous Energy Efficiency Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cascade stability of load balancing is critical for ensuring high efficiency service delivery and preventing undesirable handovers. In energy efficient networks that employ diverse sleep mode operations, handing over traffic to neighbouring cells' expanded coverage must be done with minimal side effects. Current research is largely concerned with designing distributed and centralized efficient load balancing policies that are locally stable. There is a major research gap in identifying large-scale cascade stability for networks with heterogeneous load balancing policies arising from diverse plug-and-play sleep mode policies in ORAN, which will cause heterogeneity in the network stability behaviour.
  Here, we investigate whether cells arbitrarily connected for load balancing and having an arbitrary number undergoing sleep mode can: (i) synchronize to a desirable load-balancing state, and (ii) maintain stability. For the first time, we establish the criterion for stability and prove its validity for any general load dynamics and random network topology. Whilst its general form allows all load balancing and sleep mode dynamics to be incorporated, we propose an ORAN architecture where the network service management and orchestration (SMO) must monitor new load balancing policies to ensure overall network cascade stability.</description>

      <title>Programmable Multi-input Buck-Boost Converter for Photovoltaics Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a programmable multi-input buck-boost structure method, which can enhance the operation tolerance for the PV array under extremely harsh climatic conditions. The proposed structure based on a traditional two switches buck-boost converter can connect PV panels in parallel and cascade flexibly, and also enable the individual operation of each PV panel. The active switches can be programmed to change the connection structures as well as achieve the maximum power point track of PV panels simultaneously. The paper presents the programming method for an exemplified scalable structure converter for two PV panels. The simulation has been established in MATLAB/Simulink to validate the performance of the proposed converter in terms of multiplexing function, wide operating range of PV panels, and low switching stress.</description>

      <title>On the Stability of Networked Nonlinear Imaginary Systems with Applications to Electrical Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the transition to achieving net zero emissions, it has been suggested that a substantial expansion of electric power grids will be necessary to support emerging renewable energy zones. In this paper, we propose employing battery-based feedback control and nonlinear negative imaginary (NI) systems theory to reduce the need for such expansion. By formulating a novel Lur\'e-Postnikov-like Lyapunov function, stability results are presented for the feedback interconnection of two single nonlinear NI systems, while output feedback consensus results are established for the feedback interconnection of two networked nonlinear NI systems based on a network topology. This theoretical framework underpins our design of battery-based control in power transmission systems. We demonstrate that the power grid can be gradually transitioned into the proposed NI systems, one transmission line at a time.</description>

      <title>Loss of Control Prevention of an Agile Aircraft: Dynamic Command Saturation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The prevention of the loss of control in agile aircraft during the extreme maneuvers is of concern due to the nonlinear aerodynamics and flight dynamics nature of the aircraft in this study. Within this context, the primary objective is to present an architectural framework and elucidate the methodology for its determination. This architecture enables agile maneuvering aircraft to execute more extreme maneuvers while avoiding departure from stable flight, surpassing maneuverability capabilities of conventional state limiters. Hence, the notion of an incremental attainable moment set is introduced for an instantaneous controllability investigation using demanded control moment coefficients derived in the high-level controller, which is the incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion. In the event of detecting a violation of controllability boundaries, Lyapunov-based dynamic command saturation is employed to limit pilot commands, preventing the aircraft from initiating departure from stable flight. As a result, abrupt and excessive pilot inputs are dynamically softened in-flight, and presumable departure tendencies are mitigated. Consequently, the superiority of the proposed method over conventional state limiters is proven through the flight simulations of agile and abrupt maneuvers, as well as Monte Carlo simulations that demonstrate the expansion of stable maneuverable volumes up to 55%.</description>

      <title>Innovative Gain Reconfiguration for Active Fault-Tolerant Flight Control: Balance of Stability and Agility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a distinct reconfigurable fault-tolerant flight control strategy is addressed for mitigating one of the persistent safety-critical issue, i.e. loss of control triggered by actuator faults. The attainable acceleration set notion is taken a step further towards incremental attainable acceleration set through a slight modification that enables instantaneous controllability checks. The inner-loop gains are updated in case of a fault using incremental attainable acceleration set and a tuning function, which is in charge as a compensator of agility and robustness. Additionally, the outer-loop gains are also such reconfigured that holding the bandwidth ratio of the successive loops at a prudent level to ensure the closed-loop stability; for this reason, an analytical outer-loop gain update law is derived based on the inner-loop gains and bandwidth, actuator and command filter time constants. Subsequently, the proposed architecture is assessed under a severe fault scenario with a demanding maneuver mission. Noticeably, the proposed method fulfills the expectations of stability and agility sufficiently, and surpasses the fixed-gain approach.</description>

      <title>An Origami-Inspired Endoscopic Capsule with Tactile Perception for Early Tissue Anomaly Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video Capsule Endoscopy (VCE) is currently one of the most effective methods for detecting intestinal diseases. However, it is challenging to detect early-stage small nodules with this method because they lack obvious color or shape features. In this letter, we present a new origami capsule endoscope to detect early small intestinal nodules using tactile sensing. Four soft tactile sensors made out of piezoresistive material feed four channels of phase-shifted data that are processed using a particle filter. The particle filter uses an importance assignment template designed using experimental data from five known sizes of modules. Moreover, the proposed capsule can use shape changes to passively move forward or backward under peristalsis, enabling it to reach any position in the intestine for detection. Experimental results show that the proposed capsule can detect nodules of more than 3mm diameter with 100% accuracy.</description>

      <title>High-performance magnetostatic wave resonators through deep anisotropic etching of GGG substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscale resonators are fundamental and necessary building blocks for modern radio communication filters for mobile devices. The resonator's Q factor ($Q$) determines the insertion loss while coupling ($K_t^2$) governs the fractional bandwidth. The product $k_t^2 \times Q$ is widely recognized as the definitive figure of merit for microresonators. Magnetostatic wave resonators based on Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) are a promising technology platform for future communication filters. They have shown considerably better performance in terms of $Q$ when compared to the commercially successful acoustic resonators in the $&gt;$7 GHz range. However, the coupling coefficients of these resonators have been limited to $&lt;$3 %, primarily due to the restricted design space imposed by microfabrication challenges related to the patterning of gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG), the substrate material used for growing single crystal YIG. This paper reports novel resonator designs enabled by breakthrough bulk micromachining technology for anisotropic etching of GGG, leading to coupling &gt;8 % in the 6-20 GHz frequency range. We use the same technology platform to show resonant enhancement of effective coupling, reaching up to 23 \% at 10.5 GHz. The frequency of resonant coupling can be tuned by design during the fabrication process. The resonant coupling results in an unprecedented $k_t^2 \times Q$ figure of merit of 191 at 10.5 GHz and 222 at 14.7 GHz. The technology platform presented in this paper supports both tunable filter architecture and switched filter banks that are currently being used in consumer mobile devices.</description>

      <title>How to discretize continuous state-action spaces in Q-learning: A symbolic control approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Q-learning is widely recognized as an effective approach for synthesizing controllers to achieve specific goals. However, handling challenges posed by continuous state-action spaces remains an ongoing research focus. This paper presents a systematic analysis that highlights a major drawback in space discretization methods. To address this challenge, the paper proposes a symbolic model that represents behavioral relations, such as alternating simulation from abstraction to the controlled system. This relation allows for seamless application of the synthesized controller based on abstraction to the original system. Introducing a novel Q-learning technique for symbolic models, the algorithm yields two Q-tables encoding optimal policies. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that these Q-tables serve as both upper and lower bounds on the Q-values of the original system with continuous spaces. Additionally, the paper explores the correlation between the parameters of the space abstraction and the loss in Q-values. The resulting algorithm facilitates achieving optimality within an arbitrary accuracy, providing control over the trade-off between accuracy and computational complexity. The obtained results provide valuable insights for selecting appropriate learning parameters and refining the controller. The engineering relevance of the proposed Q-learning based symbolic model is illustrated through two case studies.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Incentive-based Demand Response Program for Virtual Power Plant with Solar, Battery, Electric Vehicles, and Controllable Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into the power grid necessitates an effective coordination strategy to maximize their benefits. Acting as an aggregator of DERs, a virtual power plant (VPP) facilitates this coordination, thereby amplifying their impact on the transmission level of the power grid. Further, a demand response program enhances the scheduling approach by managing the energy demands in parallel with the uncertain energy outputs of the DERs. This work presents a stochastic incentive-based demand response model for the scheduling operation of VPP comprising solar-powered generating stations, battery swapping stations, electric vehicle charging stations, and consumers with controllable loads. The work also proposes a priority mechanism to consider the individual preferences of electric vehicle users and consumers with controllable loads. The scheduling approach for the VPP is framed as a multi-objective optimization problem, normalized using the utopia-tracking method. Subsequently, the normalized optimization problem is transformed into a stochastic formulation to address uncertainties in energy demand from charging stations and controllable loads. The proposed VPP scheduling approach is addressed on a 33-node distribution system simulated using MATLAB software, which is further validated using a real-time digital simulator.</description>

      <title>Navigating Autonomous Vehicle on Unmarked Roads with Diffusion-Based Motion Prediction and Active Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to improving autonomous vehicle control in environments lacking clear road markings by integrating a diffusion-based motion predictor within an Active Inference Framework (AIF). Using a simulated parking lot environment as a parallel to unmarked roads, we develop and test our model to predict and guide vehicle movements effectively. The diffusion-based motion predictor forecasts vehicle actions by leveraging probabilistic dynamics, while AIF aids in decision-making under uncertainty. Unlike traditional methods such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL), our approach reduces computational demands and requires less extensive training, enhancing navigation safety and efficiency. Our results demonstrate the model's capability to navigate complex scenarios, marking significant progress in autonomous driving technology.</description>

      <title>Learning to Stabilize Unknown LTI Systems on a Single Trajectory under Stochastic Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of learning to stabilize unknown noisy Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems on a single trajectory. It is well known in the literature that the learn-to-stabilize problem suffers from exponential blow-up in which the state norm blows up in the order of $\Theta(2^n)$ where $n$ is the state space dimension. This blow-up is due to the open-loop instability when exploring the $n$-dimensional state space. To address this issue, we develop a novel algorithm that decouples the unstable subspace of the LTI system from the stable subspace, based on which the algorithm only explores and stabilizes the unstable subspace, the dimension of which can be much smaller than $n$. With a new singular-value-decomposition(SVD)-based analytical framework, we prove that the system is stabilized before the state norm reaches $2^{O(k \log n)}$, where $k$ is the dimension of the unstable subspace. Critically, this bound avoids exponential blow-up in state dimension in the order of $\Theta(2^n)$ as in the previous works, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to avoid exponential blow-up in dimension for stabilizing LTI systems with noise.</description>

      <title>State Compensation Linearization and Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linearization method builds a bridge from mature methods for linear systems to nonlinear systems and has been widely used in various areas. There are currently two main linearization methods: Jacobian linearization and feedback linearization. However, the Jacobian linearization method has approximate and local properties, and the feedback linearization method has a singularity problem and loses the physical meaning of the obtained states. Thus, as a kind of complementation, a new linearization method named state compensation linearization is proposed in the paper. Their differences, advantages, and disadvantages are discussed in detail. Based on the state compensation linearization, a state-compensation-linearization-based control framework is proposed for a class of nonlinear systems. Under the new framework, the original problem can be simplified. The framework also allows different control methods, especially those only applicable to linear systems, to be incorporated. Three illustrative examples are also given to show the process and effectiveness of the proposed linearization method and control framework.</description>

      <title>Computation of Maximal Admissible Robust Positive Invariant Sets for Linear Systems with Parametric and Additive Uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of computing the maximal admissible robust positive invariant (MARPI) set for discrete-time linear time-varying systems with parametric uncertainties and additive disturbances. The system state and input are subjected to hard constraints, and the system parameters and the exogenous disturbance are assumed to belong to known convex polytopes. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of the non-empty MARPI set, and explore relevant features of the set that lead to an efficient finite-time converging algorithm with a suitable stopping criterion. The analysis hinges on backward reachable sets defined using recursively computed halfspaces and the minimal RPI set. A numerical example is used to validate the theoretical development.</description>

      <title>Schr\"{o}dinger Bridge with Quadratic State Cost is Exactly Solvable</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schr\"odinger bridge is a diffusion process that steers a given distribution to another in a prescribed time while minimizing the effort to do so. It can be seen as the stochastic dynamical version of the optimal mass transport, and has growing applications in generative diffusion models and stochastic optimal control. In this work, we propose a regularized variant of the Schr\"odinger bridge with a quadratic state cost-to-go that incentivizes the optimal sample paths to stay close to a nominal level. Unlike the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge, the regularization induces a state-dependent rate of killing and creation of probability mass, and its solution requires determining the Markov kernel of a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation. We derive this Markov kernel in closed form. Our solution recovers the heat kernel in the vanishing regularization (i.e., diffusion without reaction) limit, thereby recovering the solution of the conventional Schr\"odinger bridge. Our results enable the use of dynamic Sinkhorn recursion for computing the Schr\"odinger bridge with a quadratic state cost-to-go, which would otherwise be challenging to use in this setting. We deduce properties of the new kernel and explain its connections with certain exactly solvable models in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Integrating solid direct air capture systems with green hydrogen production: Economic synergy of sector coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the global pursuit of sustainable energy solutions, mitigating carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions stands as a pivotal challenge. With escalating atmospheric CO2 levels, the imperative of direct air capture (DAC) systems becomes evident. Simultaneously, green hydrogen (GH) emerges as a pivotal medium for renewable energy. Nevertheless, the substantial expenses associated with these technologies impede widespread adoption, primarily due to significant installation costs and underutilized operational advantages when deployed independently. Integration through sector coupling enhances system efficiency and sustainability, while shared power sources and energy storage devices offer additional economic benefits. In this study, we assess the economic viability of polymer electrolyte membrane electrolyzers versus alkaline electrolyzers within the context of sector coupling. Our findings indicate that combining GH production with solid DAC systems yields significant economic advantages, with approximately a 10% improvement for PEM electrolyzers and a 20% enhancement for alkaline electrolyzers. These results highlight a substantial opportunity to improve the efficiency and economic viability of renewable energy and green hydrogen initiatives, thereby facilitating the broader adoption of cleaner technologies.</description>

      <title>Throughput and Link Utilization Improvement in Satellite Networks: A Learning-Enabled Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Satellite networks provide communication services to global users with an uneven geographical distribution. In densely populated regions, Inter-satellite links (ISLs) often experience congestion, blocking traffic from other links and leading to low link utilization and throughput. In such cases, delay-tolerant traffic can be withheld by moving satellites and carried to navigate congested areas, thereby mitigating link congestion in densely populated regions. Through rational store-and-forward decision-making, link utilization and throughput can be improved. Building on this foundation, this letter centers its focus on learning-based decision-making for satellite traffic. First, a link load prediction method based on topology isomorphism is proposed. Then, a Markov decision process (MDP) is formulated to model store-and-forward decision-making. To generate store-and-forward policies, we propose reinforcement learning algorithms based on value iteration and Q-Learning. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method improves throughput and link utilization while consuming less than 20$\%$ of the time required by constraint-based routing.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a new systematic framework for nonlinear singularly perturbed systems in which state-dependent perturbation functions are used instead of constant perturbation coefficients. Under this framework, general results are obtained for the global robust stability and input-to-state stability of nonlinear singularly perturbed systems. Interestingly, the proposed methodology provides innovative solutions beyond traditional singular perturbation theory for emerging control problems arising from nonlinear integral control, feedback optimization, and formation-based source seeking.</description>

      <title>Accelerate Hybrid Model Predictive Control using Generalized Benders Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hybrid model predictive control with both continuous and discrete variables is widely applicable to robotics tasks. Due to the combinatorial complexity, the solving speed of hybrid MPC can be insufficient for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose to accelerate hybrid MPC using Generalized Benders Decomposition (GBD). GBD enumerates cuts online and stores inside a finite buffer to provide warm-starts for the new problem instances. Leveraging on the sparsity of feasibility cuts, a fast algorithm is designed for Benders master problems. We also propose to construct initial optimality cuts from heuristic solutions allowing GBD to plan for longer time horizons. The proposed algorithm successfully controls a cart-pole system with randomly moving soft-contact walls reaching speeds 2-3 times faster than Gurobi, oftentimes exceeding 1000Hz. It also guides a free-flying robot through a maze with a time horizon of 50 re-planning at 20Hz. The code is available at https://github.com/XuanLin/Benders-MPC.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Verification of Stochastic Dynamical Systems with Neural Network Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00826v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the verification of neural network policies for reach-avoid control tasks in stochastic dynamical systems. We use a verification procedure that trains another neural network, which acts as a certificate proving that the policy satisfies the task. For reach-avoid tasks, it suffices to show that this certificate network is a reach-avoid supermartingale (RASM). As our main contribution, we significantly accelerate algorithmic approaches for verifying that a neural network is indeed a RASM. The main bottleneck of these approaches is the discretization of the state space of the dynamical system. The following two key contributions allow us to use a coarser discretization than existing approaches. First, we present a novel and fast method to compute tight upper bounds on Lipschitz constants of neural networks based on weighted norms. We further improve these bounds on Lipschitz constants based on the characteristics of the certificate network. Second, we integrate an efficient local refinement scheme that dynamically refines the state space discretization where necessary. Our empirical evaluation shows the effectiveness of our approach for verifying neural network policies in several benchmarks and trained with different reinforcement learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>VERTECS: A COTS-based payload interface board to enable next generation astronomical imaging payloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to advances in observation and imaging technologies, modern astronomical satellites generate large volumes of data. This necessitates efficient onboard data processing and high-speed data downlink. Reflecting this trend is the VERTECS 6U Astronomical Nanosatellite. Designed for the observation of Extragalactic Background Light (EBL), this mission is expected to generate a substantial amount of image data, particularly within the confines of CubeSat capabilities. This paper introduces the VERTECS Camera Control Board (CCB), an open-source payload interface board leveraging Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components, with a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 at its core. The VERTECS CCB hardware and software have been designed from the ground up to serve as the sole interface between the VERTECS bus system and astronomical imaging payload, while providing compute capability not usually seen in nanosatellites of this class. Responsible for mission data processing, it will facilitate high-speed data transfer from the imaging payload via gigabit Ethernet, while also providing a high-bitrate serial connection to the payload X-band transmitter for mission data downlink. Additional interfaces for secondary payloads are provided via USB-C and standard 15-pin camera connectors. The Raspberry Pi embedded within the VERTECS CCB operates on a standard Linux distribution, streamlining the software development process. Beyond addressing the current mission's payload control and data handling requirements, the CCB sets the stage for future missions with heightened data demands. Furthermore, it supports the adoption of machine learning and other compute-intensive applications in orbit. This paper delves into the development of the VERTECS CCB, offering insights into the design and validation of this next-generation payload interface, to ensure that it can survive the rigors of space flight.</description>

      <title>Joint Learning of Linear Dynamical Systems under Smoothness Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of joint learning of multiple linear dynamical systems. This has received significant attention recently under different types of assumptions on the model parameters. The setting we consider involves a collection of $m$ linear systems each of which resides on a node of a given undirected graph $G = ([m], \mathcal{E})$. We assume that the system matrices are marginally stable, and satisfy a smoothness constraint w.r.t $G$ -- akin to the quadratic variation of a signal on a graph. Given access to the states of the nodes over $T$ time points, we then propose two estimators for joint estimation of the system matrices, along with non-asymptotic error bounds on the mean-squared error (MSE). In particular, we show conditions under which the MSE converges to zero as $m$ increases, typically polynomially fast w.r.t $m$. The results hold under mild (i.e., $T \sim \log m$), or sometimes, even no assumption on $T$ (i.e. $T \geq 2$).</description>

      <title>Achieving Tractable Minimax Optimal Regret in Average Reward MDPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, significant attention has been directed towards learning average-reward Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). However, existing algorithms either suffer from sub-optimal regret guarantees or computational inefficiencies. In this paper, we present the first tractable algorithm with minimax optimal regret of $\widetilde{\mathrm{O}}(\sqrt{\mathrm{sp}(h^*) S A T})$, where $\mathrm{sp}(h^*)$ is the span of the optimal bias function $h^*$, $S \times A$ is the size of the state-action space and $T$ the number of learning steps. Remarkably, our algorithm does not require prior information on $\mathrm{sp}(h^*)$. Our algorithm relies on a novel subroutine, Projected Mitigated Extended Value Iteration (PMEVI), to compute bias-constrained optimal policies efficiently. This subroutine can be applied to various previous algorithms to improve regret bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a methodology that aims to model and to provide predictive capabilities for the lifetime of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cell (PEMFC). The approach integrates parametric identification, dynamic modeling, and Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF). The foundation is laid with the creation of a representative aging database, emphasizing specific operating conditions. Electrochemical behavior is characterized through the identification of critical parameters. The methodology extends to capture the temporal evolution of the identified parameters. We also address challenges posed by the limiting current density through a differential analysis-based modeling technique and the detection of breakpoints. This approach, involving Monte Carlo simulations, is coupled with an EKF for predicting voltage degradation. The Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is also estimated. The results show that our approach accurately predicts future voltage and RUL with very low relative errors.</description>

      <title>RL in Latent MDPs is Tractable: Online Guarantees via Off-Policy Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many real-world decision problems there is partially observed, hidden or latent information that remains fixed throughout an interaction. Such decision problems can be modeled as Latent Markov Decision Processes (LMDPs), where a latent variable is selected at the beginning of an interaction and is not disclosed to the agent. In the last decade, there has been significant progress in solving LMDPs under different structural assumptions. However, for general LMDPs, there is no known learning algorithm that provably matches the existing lower bound~\cite{kwon2021rl}. We introduce the first sample-efficient algorithm for LMDPs without any additional structural assumptions. Our result builds off a new perspective on the role of off-policy evaluation guarantees and coverage coefficients in LMDPs, a perspective, that has been overlooked in the context of exploration in partially observed environments. Specifically, we establish a novel off-policy evaluation lemma and introduce a new coverage coefficient for LMDPs. Then, we show how these can be used to derive near-optimal guarantees of an optimistic exploration algorithm. These results, we believe, can be valuable for a wide range of interactive learning problems beyond LMDPs, and especially, for partially observed environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the finite-time analysis of finding ($\delta,\epsilon$)-stationary points for nonsmooth nonconvex objectives in decentralized stochastic optimization. A set of agents aim at minimizing a global function using only their local information by interacting over a network. We present a novel algorithm, called Multi Epoch Decentralized Online Learning (ME-DOL), for which we establish the sample complexity in various settings. First, using a recently proposed online-to-nonconvex technique, we show that our algorithm recovers the optimal convergence rate of smooth nonconvex objectives. We then extend our analysis to the nonsmooth setting, building on properties of randomized smoothing and Goldstein-subdifferential sets. We establish the sample complexity of $O(\delta^{-1}\epsilon^{-3})$, which to the best of our knowledge is the first finite-time guarantee for decentralized nonsmooth nonconvex stochastic optimization in the first-order setting (without weak-convexity), matching its optimal centralized counterpart. We further prove the same rate for the zero-order oracle setting without using variance reduction.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with the gradient extremum seeking control for static scalar maps with actuators governed by distributed diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs). To achieve the real-time optimization objective, we design a compensation controller for the distributed diffusion PDE via backstepping transformation in infinite dimensions. A further contribution of this paper is the appropriate motion planning design of the so-called probing (or perturbation) signal, which is more involved than in the non-distributed counterpart. Hence, with these two design ingredients, we provide an averaging-based methodology that can be implemented using the gradient and Hessian estimates. Local exponential stability for the closed-loop equilibrium of the average error dynamics is guaranteed through a Lyapunov-based analysis. By employing the averaging theory for infinite-dimensional systems, we prove that the trajectory converges to a small neighborhood surrounding the optimal point. The effectiveness of the proposed extremum seeking controller for distributed diffusion PDEs in cascade of nonlinear maps to be optimized is illustrated by means of numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the performance of risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS), an empirical risk minimization-based formulation of conformal prediction, with a single trajectory of temporally correlated data from an unknown stochastic dynamical system. First, we use the blocking technique to show that RCPS attains performance guarantees similar to those enjoyed in the iid setting whenever data is generated by asymptotically stationary and contractive dynamics. Next, we use the decoupling technique to characterize the graceful degradation in RCPS guarantees when the data generating process deviates from stationarity and contractivity. We conclude by discussing how these tools could be used toward a unified analysis of online and offline conformal prediction algorithms, which are currently treated with very different tools.</description>

      <title>Age-of-information minimization via opportunistic sampling by an energy harvesting source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Herein, minimization of time-averaged age-of-information (AoI) in an energy harvesting (EH) source setting is considered. The EH source opportunistically samples one or multiple processes over discrete time instants and sends the status updates to a sink node over a wireless fading channel. Each time, the EH node decides whether to probe the link quality and then decides whether to sample a process and communicate based on the channel probe outcome. The trade-off is between the freshness of information available at the sink node and the available energy at the source node. We use infinite horizon Markov decision process (MDP) to formulate the AoI minimization problem for two scenarios where energy arrival and channel fading processes are: (i) independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), (ii) Markovian. In i.i.d. setting, after channel probing, the optimal source sampling policy is shown to be a threshold policy. Also, for unknown channel state and EH characteristics, a variant of the Q-learning algorithm is proposed for the two-stage action model, that seeks to learn the optimal policy. For Markovian system, the problem is again formulated as an MDP, and a learning algorithm is provided for unknown dynamics. Finally, numerical results demonstrate the policy structures and performance trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Learning with Delayed Payoffs in Population Games using Kullback-Leibler Divergence Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a multi-agent decision problem in large population games. Agents from multiple populations select strategies for repeated interactions with one another. At each stage of these interactions, agents use their decision-making model to revise their strategy selections based on payoffs determined by an underlying game. Their goal is to learn the strategies that correspond to the Nash equilibrium of the game. However, when games are subject to time delays, conventional decision-making models from the population game literature may result in oscillations in the strategy revision process or convergence to an equilibrium other than the Nash. To address this problem, we propose the Kullback-Leibler Divergence Regularized Learning (KLD-RL) model, along with an algorithm that iteratively updates the model's regularization parameter across a network of communicating agents. Using passivity-based convergence analysis techniques, we show that the KLD-RL model achieves convergence to the Nash equilibrium without oscillations, even for a class of population games that are subject to time delays. We demonstrate our main results numerically on a two-population congestion game and a two-population zero-sum game.</description>

      <title>6G Wireless Communications in 7-24 GHz Band: Opportunities, Techniques, and Challenges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) wireless communication nowadays is seeking a new spectrum to inherit the pros and discard the cons of sub-6 GHz, millimeter-wave (mmWave), and sub-terahertz (THz) bands. To this end, an upper mid-band with a Frequency Range (FR) spanning from 7 GHz to 24 GHz, also known as FR3, has emerged as a focal point in 6G communications. Thus, as an inevitable prerequisite, a comprehensive investigation encompassing spectrum utilization and channel characteristics is the first step to exploiting potential applications and prospects of using FR3 in the 6G ecosystem. In this article, we provide FR3 synergies with emerging technologies including non-terrestrial network (NTN), massive multi-input multi-output (mMIMO), reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), and integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). Furthermore, leveraging ray-tracing simulations, our investigation unveils the similarity of channel characteristics in FR3 with other FRs. The analysis of RIS-aided communication shows the insight of higher spectral efficiency achieved in FR3 compared to other FRs when using the same RIS size. Finally, challenges and promising directions are discussed for wireless systems in FR3.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented Estimation of Multiple Markov Sources in Resource-constrained Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates goal-oriented communication for remote estimation of multiple Markov sources in resource-constrained networks. An agent decides the updating times of the sources and transmits the packet to a remote destination over an unreliable channel with delay. The destination is tasked with source reconstruction for actuation. We utilize the metric \textit{cost of actuation error} (CAE) to capture the state-dependent actuation costs. We aim for a sampling policy that minimizes the long-term average CAE subject to an average resource constraint. We formulate this problem as an average-cost constrained Markov Decision Process (CMDP) and relax it into an unconstrained problem by utilizing \textit{Lyapunov drift} techniques. Then, we propose a low-complexity \textit{drift-plus-penalty} (DPP) policy for systems with known source/channel statistics and a Lyapunov optimization-based deep reinforcement learning (LO-DRL) policy for unknown environments. Our policies significantly reduce the number of uninformative transmissions by exploiting the timing of the important information.</description>

      <title>VREM-FL: Mobility-Aware Computation-Scheduling Co-Design for Vehicular Federated Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Assisted and autonomous driving are rapidly gaining momentum and will soon become a reality. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are regarded as key enablers thanks to the massive amount of data that smart vehicles will collect from onboard sensors. Federated learning is one of the most promising techniques for training global machine learning models while preserving data privacy of vehicles and optimizing communications resource usage. In this article, we propose vehicular radio environment map federated learning (VREM-FL), a computation-scheduling co-design for vehicular federated learning that combines mobility of vehicles with 5G radio environment maps. VREM-FL jointly optimizes learning performance of the global model and wisely allocates communication and computation resources. This is achieved by orchestrating local computations at the vehicles in conjunction with transmission of their local models in an adaptive and predictive fashion, by exploiting radio channel maps. The proposed algorithm can be tuned to trade training time for radio resource usage. Experimental results demonstrate that VREM-FL outperforms literature benchmarks for both a linear regression model (learning time reduced by 28%) and a deep neural network for semantic image segmentation (doubling the number of model updates within the same time window).</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces a simulation preorder among lifted systems, a generalization of finite-dimensional Koopman approximations (also known as approximate immersions) to systems with inputs. It is proved that this simulation relation implies the containment of both the open- and closed-loop behaviors. Optimization-based sufficient conditions are derived to verify the simulation relation in two special cases: i) a nonlinear (unlifted) system and an affine lifted system and, ii) two affine lifted systems. Numerical examples demonstrate the approach.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Offloading Cellular Communications with Cooperating UAVs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective solutions for intelligent data collection in terrestrial cellular networks are crucial, especially in the context of Internet of Things applications. The limited spectrum and coverage area of terrestrial base stations pose challenges in meeting the escalating data rate demands of network users. Unmanned aerial vehicles, known for their high agility, mobility, and flexibility, present an alternative means to offload data traffic from terrestrial BSs, serving as additional access points. This paper introduces a novel approach to efficiently maximize the utilization of multiple UAVs for data traffic offloading from terrestrial BSs. Specifically, the focus is on maximizing user association with UAVs by jointly optimizing UAV trajectories and users association indicators under quality of service constraints. Since, the formulated UAVs control problem is nonconvex and combinatorial, this study leverages the multi agent reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, each UAV acts as an independent agent, aiming to maintain inter UAV cooperative behavior. The proposed approach utilizes the finite state Markov decision process to account for UAVs velocity constraints and the relationship between their trajectories and state space. A low complexity distributed state action reward state action algorithm is presented to determine UAVs optimal sequential decision making policies over training episodes. The extensive simulation results validate the proposed analysis and offer valuable insights into the optimal UAV trajectories. The derived trajectories demonstrate superior average UAV association performance compared to benchmark techniques such as Q learning and particle swarm optimization.</description>

Abstract: The increasing reliance on numerical methods for controlling dynamical systems and training machine learning models underscores the need to devise algorithms that dependably and efficiently navigate complex optimization landscapes. Classical gradient descent methods offer strong theoretical guarantees for convex problems; however, they demand meticulous hyperparameter tuning for non-convex ones. The emerging paradigm of learning to optimize (L2O) automates the discovery of algorithms with optimized performance leveraging learning models and data - yet, it lacks a theoretical framework to analyze convergence of the learned algorithms. In this paper, we fill this gap by harnessing nonlinear system theory. Specifically, we propose an unconstrained parametrization of all convergent algorithms for smooth non-convex objective functions. Notably, our framework is directly compatible with automatic differentiation tools, ensuring convergence by design while learning to optimize.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven framework to learn a finite-dimensional approximation of a Koopman operator for approximating the state evolution of a dynamical system under noisy observations. To this end, our proposed solution has two main advantages. First, the proposed method only requires the measurement noise to be bounded. Second, the proposed method modifies the existing deep Koopman operator formulations by characterizing the effect of the measurement noise on the Koopman operator learning and then mitigating it by updating the tunable parameter of the observable functions of the Koopman operator, making it easy to implement. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on several standard benchmarks. We further compare the presented method with similar methods proposed in the latest literature on Koopman learning.</description>

      <title>Privacy and Security Trade-off in Interconnected Systems with Known or Unknown Privacy Noise Covariance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16905v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the security problem for interconnected systems, where each subsystem is required to detect local attacks using locally available information and the information received from its neighboring subsystems. Moreover, we consider that there exists an additional eavesdropper being able to infer the private information by eavesdropping transmitted data between subsystems. Then, a privacy-preserving method is employed by adding privacy noise to transmitted data, and the privacy level is measured by mutual information. Nevertheless, adding privacy noise to transmitted data may affect the detection performance metrics such as detection probability and false alarm probability. Thus, we theoretically analyze the trade-off between the privacy and the detection performance. An optimization problem with maximizing both the degree of privacy preservation and the detection probability is established to obtain the covariance of the privacy noise. In addition, the attack detector of each subsystem may not obtain all information about the privacy noise. We further theoretically analyze the trade-off between the privacy and the false alarm probability when the attack detector has no knowledge of the privacy noise covariance. An optimization problem with maximizing the degree of privacy preservation with guaranteeing a bound of false alarm distortion level is established to obtain {\color{black}{the covariance of the privacy noise}}. Moreover, to analyze the effect of the privacy noise on the detection probability, we consider that each subsystem can estimate the unknown privacy noise covariance by the secondary data. Based on the estimated covariance, we construct another attack detector and analyze how the privacy noise affects its detection performance. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A case study comparing both stochastic and worst-case robust control co-design under different control structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As uncertainty considerations become increasingly important aspects of concurrent plant and control optimization, it is imperative to identify and compare the impact of uncertain control co-design (UCCD) formulations on their associated solutions. While previous work developed the theory for various UCCD formulations, their implementation, along with an in-depth discussion of the structure of UCCD problems, implicit assumptions, method-dependent considerations, and practical insights, is currently missing from the literature. Therefore, in this study, we address some of these limitations by focusing on UCCD formulations, with an emphasis on optimal control structures, and uncertainty propagation techniques. Specifically, we propose three optimal control structures for UCCD problems: (i) open-loop multiple-control (OLMC), (ii) multi-stage control (MSC), and (iii) open-loop single-control (OLSC). Stochastic in expectation UCCD (SE-UCCD) and worst-case robust UCCD (WCR-UCCD) formulations, which are motivated by probabilistic and crisp representations of uncertainties, respectively, are implemented for a simplified strain-actuated solar array case study. Solutions to the OLMC SE-UCCD problem are obtained using two uncertainty propagation techniques: generalized Polynomial Chaos expansion (gPC) and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). The OLMC and MSC WCR-UCCD problems are solved by leveraging the structure of the linear program, leading to polytopic uncertainties. To highlight the importance of uncertainty in early-stage design, the closed-loop reference-tracking response of the systems is also investigated. Insights from such studies underscore the role of the control structure in managing the trade-offs between risk and performance, as well as meeting problem requirements. The results also emphasize the benefits of efficient uncertainty propagation techniques for dynamic optimization problems.</description>

Abstract: This study introduces a method for simulating quantum systems using electrical networks. Our approach leverages a generalized similarity transformation, which connects different Hamiltonians, enabling well-defined paths for quantum system simulation using classical circuits. By synthesizing interaction networks, we accurately simulate quantum systems of varying complexity, from $2-$state to $n-$state systems. Unlike quantum computers, classical approaches do not require stringent conditions, making them more accessible for practical implementation. Our reinterpretation of Born's rule in the context of electrical circuit simulations offers a perspective on quantum phenomena.</description>

Abstract: We propose a hierarchical architecture designed for scalable real-time Model Predictive Control (MPC) in complex, multi-modal traffic scenarios. This architecture comprises two key components: 1) RAID-Net, a novel attention-based Recurrent Neural Network that predicts relevant interactions along the MPC prediction horizon between the autonomous vehicle and the surrounding vehicles using Lagrangian duality, and 2) a reduced Stochastic MPC problem that eliminates irrelevant collision avoidance constraints, enhancing computational efficiency. Our approach is demonstrated in a simulated traffic intersection with interactive surrounding vehicles, showcasing a 12x speed-up in solving the motion planning problem. A video demonstrating the proposed architecture in multiple complex traffic scenarios can be found here: https://youtu.be/-pRiOnPb9_c.

      <description>arXiv:2402.02827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Power grids are critical infrastructures of paramount importance to modern society and, therefore, engineered to operate under diverse conditions and failures. The ongoing energy transition poses new challenges for the decision-makers and system operators. Therefore, we must develop grid analysis algorithms to ensure reliable operations. These key tools include power flow analysis and system security analysis, both needed for effective operational and strategic planning. The literature review shows a growing trend of machine learning (ML) models that perform these analyses effectively. In particular, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) stand out in such applications because of the graph-based structure of power grids. However, there is a lack of publicly available graph datasets for training and benchmarking ML models in electrical power grid applications. First, we present PowerGraph, which comprises GNN-tailored datasets for i) power flows, ii) optimal power flows, and iii) cascading failure analyses of power grids. Second, we provide ground-truth explanations for the cascading failure analysis. Finally, we perform a complete benchmarking of GNN methods for node-level and graph-level tasks and explainability. Overall, PowerGraph is a multifaceted GNN dataset for diverse tasks that includes power flow and fault scenarios with real-world explanations, providing a valuable resource for developing improved GNN models for node-level, graph-level tasks and explainability methods in power system modeling. The dataset is available at https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/PowerGraph/22820534 and the code at https://github.com/PowerGraph-Datasets.</description>

Abstract: In modern machine learning, models can often fit training data in numerous ways, some of which perform well on unseen (test) data, while others do not. Remarkably, in such cases gradient descent frequently exhibits an implicit bias that leads to excellent performance on unseen data. This implicit bias was extensively studied in supervised learning, but is far less understood in optimal control (reinforcement learning). There, learning a controller applied to a system via gradient descent is known as policy gradient, and a question of prime importance is the extent to which a learned controller extrapolates to unseen initial states. This paper theoretically studies the implicit bias of policy gradient in terms of extrapolation to unseen initial states. Focusing on the fundamental Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem, we establish that the extent of extrapolation depends on the degree of exploration induced by the system when commencing from initial states included in training. Experiments corroborate our theory, and demonstrate its conclusions on problems beyond LQR, where systems are non-linear and controllers are neural networks. We hypothesize that real-world optimal control may be greatly improved by developing methods for informed selection of initial states to train on.</description>

      <title>On the Existence of Static Equilibria of a Cable-Suspended Load with Non-stopping Flying Carriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19315v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work answers positively the question whether non-stop flights are possible for maintaining constant the pose of cable-suspended objects. Such a counterintuitive answer paves the way for a paradigm shift where energetically efficient fixed-wing flying carriers can replace the inefficient multirotor carriers that have been used so far in precise cooperative cable-suspended aerial manipulation.
  First, we show that one or two flying carriers alone cannot perform non-stop flights while maintaining a constant pose of the suspended object. Instead, we prove that three flying carriers can achieve this task provided that the orientation of the load at the equilibrium is such that the components of the cable forces that balance the external force (typically gravity) do not belong to the plane of the cable anchoring points on the load. Numerical tests are presented in support of the analytical results.</description>

      <title>Impact of Traffic-Following on Order of Autonomous Airspace Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamic emergence of traffic order in a distributed multi-agent system, aiming to minimize inefficiencies that stem from unnecessary structural impositions. We introduce a methodology for developing a dynamically-updating traffic pattern map of the airspace by leveraging information about the consistency and frequency of flow directions used by current as well as preceding traffic. Informed by this map, an agent can discern the degree to which it is advantageous to follow traffic by trading off utilities such as time and order. We show that for the traffic levels studied, for low degrees of traffic-following behavior, there is minimal penalty in terms of aircraft travel times while improving the overall orderliness of the airspace. On the other hand, heightened traffic-following behavior may result in increased aircraft travel times, while marginally reducing the overall entropy of the airspace. Ultimately, the methods and metrics presented in this paper can be used to optimally and dynamically adjust an agent's traffic-following behavior based on these trade-offs.</description>

      <title>State-Free Inference of State-Space Models: The Transfer Function Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We approach designing a state-space model for deep learning applications through its dual representation, the transfer function, and uncover a highly efficient sequence parallel inference algorithm that is state-free: unlike other proposed algorithms, state-free inference does not incur any significant memory or computational cost with an increase in state size. We achieve this using properties of the proposed frequency domain transfer function parametrization, which enables direct computation of its corresponding convolutional kernel's spectrum via a single Fast Fourier Transform. Our experimental results across multiple sequence lengths and state sizes illustrates, on average, a 35% training speed improvement over S4 layers -- parametrized in time-domain -- on the Long Range Arena benchmark, while delivering state-of-the-art downstream performances over other attention-free approaches. Moreover, we report improved perplexity in language modeling over a long convolutional Hyena baseline, by simply introducing our transfer function parametrization.
