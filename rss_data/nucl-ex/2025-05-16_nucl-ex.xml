      <title>Cross-section of the ${^{\rm nat}\rm{Ni}}(\gamma,{\rm p} x\rm n)^{58}\rm{Co}$ reaction at the bremsstrahlung end-point energy of 35-94 MeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The photoproduction of the $^{58}\rm{Co}$ nuclei on ${^{\rm nat}\rm{Ni}}$ was studied using the induced $\gamma$-activity method and off-line $\gamma$-ray spectrometric technique. The experiment was performed at the electron linear accelerator LUE-40 NSC KIPT, Ukraine. The total flux-averaged cross-section $\langle{\sigma(E_{\rm{\gamma max}})}\rangle$ for the ${^{\rm nat}\rm{Ni}}(\gamma,{\rm p} x\rm n)^{58}\rm{Co}$ reaction has been measured in the range of bremsstrahlung end-point energies $E_{\rm{\gamma max}}$ = 35-94 MeV. The obtained $\langle{\sigma(E_{\rm{\gamma max}})}\rangle$ were compared with theoretical estimates. The theoretical values of $\langle{\sigma(E_{\rm{\gamma max}})}\rangle_{\rm th}$ were calculated using the partial cross-sections $\sigma(E)$ from the TALYS1.96 code for different level density models and gamma strength functions.</description>

      <title>Competition between the neutron-proton pair break-ups delineating the level structure of 202Po</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-spin spectroscopic study of $^{202}$Po ($Z$ = 84, $N$ = 118) has been carried out using the $^{195}$Pt($^{12}$C, 5n)$^{202}$Po fusion-evaporation reaction. An extended level scheme has been proposed up to an excitation energy of $E_x\approx$ 8 MeV and angular momentum of 27$\hbar$, with the addition of 57 newly observed $\gamma$-ray transitions, along with the revisions in the placement of 8 already known transitions and the multipolarities of 4 of these transitions. The energy of the unobserved 8$^+ \rightarrow 6^+$ transition has been proposed to be 9.0(5) keV, which resolves the uncertainty in the excitation energy of the levels above the 6$^{+}$ state. Three new sequences of $M1$ transitions have also been identified in the high excitation energy regime and included in the proposed level scheme. The large-scale shell model calculations for $Z&gt;82$ and $N&lt;126$ valence space have been carried out using PBPOP interaction which explained the overall level scheme for both the positive and negative parity states. The calculations successfully reproduced the purity of the proton $\pi h_{9/2}$ dominated $8^+$ isomeric state, and also explained the missing $E2$ decay of the ${12}^+$ isomeric state in terms of changing nucleonic configurations.</description>

      <title>First-ever detection of microseismic activity with a tonne-scale cryogenic experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vibrations from experimental setups and the environment are a persistent source of noise for low-temperature calorimeters searching for rare events, including neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay or dark matter interactions. Such noise can significantly limit experimental sensitivity to the physics case under investigation. Here we report the first detection of marine microseismic vibrations using mK-scale calorimeters. This study employs a multi-device analysis correlating data from CUORE, the leading experiment in the search for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay with mK-scale calorimeters and the Copernicus Earth Observation program, revealing the seasonal impact of Mediterranean Sea activity on CUORE's energy thresholds, resolution, and sensitivity over four years. The detection of marine microseisms underscores the need to address faint environmental noise in ultra-sensitive experiments. Understanding how such noise couples to the detector and developing mitigation strategies is essential for next-generation experiments. We demonstrate one such strategy: a noise decorrelation algorithm implemented in CUORE using auxiliary sensors, which reduces vibrational noise and improves detector performance. Enhancing sensitivity to $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and to rare events with low-energy signatures requires identifying unresolved noise sources, advancing noise reduction methods, and improving vibration suppression systems, all of which inform the design of next-generation rare event experiments.</description>

      <title>Neutrino-less double beta decay in the $\nu$ Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive study of the $3+3$ Type-I seesaw model for a broad range of right-handed mass scales (from keV to 10 TeV). We take into account and, in some cases, update the constraints from a large number of high- and low-energy experiments and study the implications on neutrino-less double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay experiments. We illustrate our findings through profile likelihood plots for the half-life $T_{1/2}^{0\nu}$ and two-dimensional plots correlating $T_{1/2}^{0\nu}$ to neutrino masses. We find that in this simple class of models for Majorana neutrino masses, current and next-generation $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay experiments have a broad discovery potential in both the normal and inverted orderings of the spectrum of light active neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Correlations of $Q_{\beta}$-values with symmetry energy and effective mass studied within Skyrme energy--density functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\beta$-decay half-lives of nuclei are sensitive to the values of $Q_{\beta}$. For accurate theoretical predictions, it is essential to develop an effective interaction or an energy density functional (EDF) that can systematically reproduce experimental $Q_{\beta}$ values. The challenge lies in identifying an appropriate EDF for an accurate $Q_{\beta}$ prediction. To address this, we focus on the bulk properties of nuclei that have correlations with $Q_{\beta}$. The primary objective of this study is to determine which nuclear bulk properties are sensitive to $Q_{\beta}$, providing information on the key nuclear characteristics that influence $\beta$-decay calculations. We employ the Skyrme energy-density functionals to find correlations between $Q_{\beta}$ and the nuclear bulk properties, assuming spherical symmetry. Using $42$ different Skyrme EDFs, we analyze these correlations by evaluating Pearson linear coefficients, focusing particularly on the relationship between $Q_{\beta}$ and various nuclear properties. We found that the symmetry energy at low densities shows a correlation with the $Q_{\beta}$ value. In particular, this correlation becomes stronger for functionals with an effective mass close to $1$. However, as the nuclear density increases, the correlation weakens. From our analysis, we found that a symmetry energy of $32.8\pm0.7$~MeV and effective mass of $m^{*}/m\ge0.75$ at the saturation density is the most likely to systematically reproduce the experimental data of $Q_{\beta}$ systematically.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Richardson-Lucy Deconvolution and Data Unfolding with Mean Integrated Square Error Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two maximum likelihood-based algorithms for unfolding or deconvolution are considered: the Richardson-Lucy method and the Data Unfolding method with Mean Integrated Square Error (MISE) optimization [10]. Unfolding is viewed as a procedure for estimating an unknown probability density function. Both external and internal quality assessment methods can be applied for this purpose. In some cases, external criteria exist to evaluate deconvolution quality. A typical example is the deconvolution of a blurred image, where the sharpness of the restored image serves as an indicator of quality. However, defining such external criteria can be challenging, particularly when a measurement has not been performed previously. In such instances, internal criteria are necessary to assess the quality of the result independently of external information. The article discusses two internal criteria: MISE for the unfolded distribution and the condition number of the correlation matrix of the unfolded distribution. These internal quality criteria are applied to a comparative analysis of the two methods using identical numerical data. The results of the analysis demonstrate the superiority of the Data Unfolding method with MISE optimization over the Richardson-Lucy method.</description>
