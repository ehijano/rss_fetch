      <title>Freely controllable single-optical-frequency comb for highly sensitive cavity ring-down spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct comb spectroscopy is a useful tool for obtaining highly accurate spectroscopic information. However, as the number of comb modes is very large and the optical energy is dispersed over them, the optical energy per each comb mode is ultrasmall, limiting the sensitivity of highly sensitive spectroscopy. If we can concentrate the optical energy into the comb modes that only overlap with the absorption spectra, we can demonstrate drastic improvements in its measurement sensitivity. In this study, we developed a freely controllable optical frequency comb source based on the spectral peak phenomenon. The comb modes overlapping the CH4 absorption spectra were transformed into background-suppressed spectral peaks at the nonlinear loop mirror using a CH4 gas cell. Coherence-preserving power scaling of the generated comb was demonstrated using a fiber Raman amplifier. Subsequently, only the single-comb mode was filtered using a newly developed spectral filter with an ultrahigh resolution. The maximum optical power of a single comb was estimated to be more than 10 mW. The ring-down decay signal from the high-finesse optical cavity was measured using a single selected mode of the generated controllable comb. As a demonstration, the 2v_3 bands of the CH4 absorption spectra were accurately measured by comb-mode-resolved, cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) with high sensitivity up to 4.2 x 10^(-11) cm^(-1). This sensitivity is two orders of magnitude higher than that of previously reported comb-based CRDS. The residual was only 0.29 %, indicating the high accuracy of the proposed spectrometer for molecular spectral analysis. This approach can be extended to other wavelength ranges and is useful for highly sensitive, high-resolution, comb-resolved spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Ionic Disorder-Mediated Exfoliation and Optical Birefringence in a Non-van der Waals Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The landscape of two-dimensional photonics has been dominated by van der Waals (vdW) materials. Expanding this library to include non-vdW layered systems promises enhanced environmental robustness and access to novel functionalities, such as strong ionic conductivity, yet their exfoliation remains challenging. Here, we establish Na2Zn2TeO6 (NZTO), a P2-type superionic conductor, as an exfoliable non-vdW optical material. We demonstrate that the highly disordered, mobile Na+ interlayer inherently facilitates mechanical cleavage down to few-nanometer thicknesses (about 4 nm). Optical interrogation via spectroscopic ellipsometry reveals NZTO as a wide-bandgap dielectric with pronounced optical birefringence (Delta_n about 0.25) across the visible and near-infrared spectrum. The lattice dynamics, probed by temperature-resolved Raman spectroscopy, underscore the rigidity of the [Zn2TeO6]2- framework, which remains largely decoupled from the high ionic mobility. These results identify NZTO as a compelling platform for robust, anisotropic dielectric photonics, simultaneously opening a pathway toward the convergence of ionic transport and optical control - an emerging paradigm we term iono-photonics.</description>

      <title>Scalable van der Waals Photonics: High-Refractive-Index Gallium Sulfide Films with Single-Crystal Optical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of high-refractive-index dielectrics into scalable photonic architectures is foundational to advancing integrated circuits and augmented reality (AR) displays. Van der Waals (vdW) materials offer exceptional optical properties, including high refractive indices and giant anisotropy, but their implementation is constrained by the small area and uncontrolled thickness of mechanically exfoliated flakes. Here, we demonstrate that atomic layer deposition (ALD) grown gallium sulfide (GaS) overcomes the trade-off between high optical performance and manufacturability, emerging as a large-scale vdW dielectric platform. Through rigorous optical and structural benchmarking against pristine single crystals, we establish that the optical constants (n, k) of ALD-GaS are virtually indistinguishable from single-crystal counterparts. By leveraging the retained out-of-plane anisotropy, we demonstrate that ALD-GaS enables superior suppression of crosstalk in densely integrated waveguides compared to conventional scalable high-index platforms. Our findings establish ALD-GaS as a technologically viable pathway for implementing anisotropic vdW materials in visible-spectrum photonics.</description>

      <title>Twisted light from topological chiral exceptional points in a nanolaser array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate an orbital angular momentum (OAM) nanolaser array arranged in a ring geometry on an InP-based photonic crystal membrane. The device realizes a non-Hermitian extension of the Rice-Mele model, featuring alternating coupling strengths and imaginary on-site detunings. This configuration supports a symmetry-protected zero mode stabilized by non-Hermitian particle-hole symmetry, which enforces a uniform $\pi/2$ phase shift between adjacent nanolasers, establishing a coherent phase winding around the array. By adjusting the gain/loss contrast in a parity-time (PT)-like pumping scheme, the system can be tuned to a chiral exceptional point, where energy flows unidirectionally between nanocavities despite their reciprocal coupling. This symmetry-enforced, directional tunneling leads to far-field emission carrying non-zero OAM, providing a direct signature of the phase-structured lasing mode. Our results demonstrate a robust and scalable strategy for engineering compact, phase-locked laser arrays with controllable angular momentum output, and open new avenues for structured light generation in integrated photonic platforms.</description>

      <title>Photophoretic Trapping: Fundamentals, Advances and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photophoretic forces, several orders of magnitude stronger than radiation pressure, enable particle trapping at remarkably low optical intensities and have opened pathways to applications in aerosol science, free-space 3D volumetric displays, and even deployment of lightweight payloads in space. In this review, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the underlying physics of photophoretic forces and how they facilitate stable three-dimensional manipulation of absorbing particles. We examine the experimental configurations that enable robust trapping, and we detail the physical parameters that govern the magnitude and behavior of photophoretic forces in these geometries. The rich dynamical phenomena exhibited by photophoretically trapped particles are discussed alongside current and emerging applications and possible future research directions. This review thus attempts to systematically unify the theoretical, experimental, and application-oriented aspects of photophoretic trapping, with the aim of advancing and strengthening research in this rapidly developing field.</description>

      <title>A power-in-bucket model enabled designs of nanostructure-enhanced waveguides for highly efficient wide-angle light couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Well-designed nanostructures on fiber facets can boost wide-angle light coupling and thus gain considerable attention because of the potential for intensive applications. However, previous theories commonly concentrate on the configurations of the bare waveguide, lacking full consideration of structure-assisted couplings. Here, a power-in-bucket (PIB) model is introduced to explore the coupling behavior of structure-modified waveguides. The analytical model investigates two representative coupling scenarios,including Gaussian beam and plane wave excitation. The PIB-computed coefficient {\eta} enhancements agree well with the experimental values, especially for the multiple-mode fibers under large-angle illuminations. Using PIB to optimize the beam-fiber parameters, we show that at the incidence angle of 37 degree, {\eta} could increase from 0.3320 to 0.5102 by the identical ring gratings. Overall, the proposed model provides a useful account of the mechanism of grating-aided light couplings. These findings would be of great help in designing structure-enhanced probes for wide-angle broadband light collection applications.</description>

      <title>Coherent Tunneling by Adiabatic Passage in Silicon Nitride based Integrated Waveguide Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nowadays silicon nitride photonic integrated circuits serve as a mature platform for numerous applications. Planar waveguides and directional couplers made by CMOS-compatible technology are its basic elements. Here we demonstrate the possibilities of efficient light routing and transfer provided by the integrated planar Si3N4 waveguides structure based on the coherent tunneling by adiabatic passage (CTAP) at the 1.55um telecom band. We addressed both high- and low-confinement silicon nitride CTAP structures and proved high efficiency of light routing in them. The mechanisms that limit the light control efficiency have been revealed. The accessible parameters of such structures have been determined. Besides that, there was proposed the original hybrid Si3N4 Si - Si3N4 waveguides structure providing the enhanced efficiency and flexibility of the CTAP in comparison with the single-material Si3N4 waveguide structures.</description>

      <title>Casimir radiation with Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When Casimir friction torque acts upon a rotated nanoparticle (NP), mechanical energy can be transformed into thermal energy, known as Casimir radiation, which significantly affects the thermal performance of nanoelectromechanical systems. In this work, we investigate Casimir radiation with nonreciprocal Weyl semimetals (WSM) NP levitated on a plate. WSM NP with inherent nonreciprocity has a radiative heat flux 27 times higher than NP with degenerate modes. The underlying physics is elucidated by the coupling and decoupling of the electromagnetic local density of states between nonreciprocal WSN NP and the plate in the near-field. The three-fold localized plasmon modes of WSM NP split into localized circular modes with strong gyrotropic response, which opens up new channels for Casimir radiation. This work provides a new method for nanoscale energy conversion in NP systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate knowledge of the uneven free spectral range of an optical microresonator, which provides direct insight into group velocity dispersion, is essential for understanding and controlling Kerr frequency comb dynamics. In this work, we present a simple and highly precise method formeasuring the free spectral range over a 5 THz bandwidth in silicon nitride microresonators, leveraging a wavemeter with 0.4 MHz resolution. Our fully fibered plug-and-play experimental setup enables the accurate extraction of resonance frequencies. By carefully analyzing the spectral position of each resonance, we measure both second- and third-order free spectral range expansion coefficients. This approach offers a robust and accessible tool for dispersion characterization in integrated photonic circuits, paving the way for next-generation of Kerr comb sources and quantum photonic technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Letter is devoted to new frequencies generation and its role in the synchronization of two spatially separated polariton condensates affected by the coherent pump with the frequency detuned from the frequencies of the condensates. We focus on the case where the distance between the condensates is so long that their interaction through the evanescent tails is negligible. By numerical simulation we show that the four-wave mixing of the polaritons with the coherent drive produces the free propagating polaritons that can mediate the inter-condensate interaction resulting in the phase-locking of the condensates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cathodoluminescence in a scanning electron microscope was applied to a semiconductor quantum dot in a nanowire able to emit single photons. We show that cathodoluminescence can be used not only for imaging and spectroscopy, but also to measure the correlation function and characterize the purity of the single-photon emitter. The electron beam can be manipulated to minimize the collection of parasitic luminescence. At cryogenic temperatures, we observed that the thermal budget, as measured via the phonon sidebands, is close to that of non-resonant micro-photoluminescence. This makes cathodoluminescence an efficient tool in the quest of novel single-photon sources.</description>

      <title>Conservation of transverse orbital angular momentum for spatiotemporal optical vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse orbital angular momentum (OAM) of spatiotemporal optical vortices (STOVs) has been a topic of active debate in recent years. Previous studies, relying on narrowband and paraxial approximations, resulted in unprecedented conclusions. Some researchers have proposed that electromagnetic waves require a modified definition of OAM to ensure conservation. In this work, we demonstrate that the transverse OAM of STOVs is highly sensitive to these commonly adopted approximations. Using the standard definition of OAM for electromagnetic waves, we demonstrate that the total transverse OAM is conserved during propagation once the narrowband and paraxial assumptions are removed.</description>

      <title>Self-Hybridized Exciton-Polariton Photodetectors From Layered Metal-Organic Chalcogenolates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-polaritons (EPs) arising from strong light-matter coupling offer new pathways for controlling optoelectronic properties. While typically requiring closed optical cavities for strong coupling, we demonstrate that 2D metal-organic chalcogenolates (MOCs), mithrene (AgSePh), with a high refractive index (~2.5) and strong excitons enable self-hybridized polaritons photodetectors (PDs) without top mirrors, simplifying device architecture. Through thickness-tuned multimode polariton engineering, we achieve photodetection of sub-bandgap photons via lower polariton states, validated through reflectance, photoluminescence (PL), and photocurrent spectroscopy with quantitative theoretical agreement. Trap-assisted two-photon absorption enables sustained strong coupling even under sub-bandgap excitation. The polariton dispersion yields ultrafast group velocities (~65 {\mu}m/ps), extending exciton diffusion lengths from hundreds of nanometers to several micrometers. Strong-coupling devices demonstrate a 2.38-fold enhancement in photo-to-dark current ratio compared to weak-coupling counterparts, establishing a practical route to polariton-enhanced photodetection and light harvesting.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Free Coherent Diffraction Imaging via Physics-Guided Neural Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CDI is a lensless imaging technique that enables atomic-resolution imaging of non-crystalline specimens and their dynamics. However, its broader implementation has been hindered by the instability and ill-posedness of its reconstruction process, known as phase retrieval, which relies heavily on handcrafted, object-specific constraints. To overcome the key limitations, we propose CDIP, a robust phase-retrieval framework that eliminates the need for such constraints by combining untrained coordinate-based neural fields for static and dynamic reconstructions and a physics-consistent forward model. We evaluate CDIP on simulated and experimental datasets that involve both static samples and dynamic processes, demonstrating that it substantially outperforms classical iterative algorithms and deep-learning baselines in terms of fidelity and stability. These results highlight a paradigm shift in both static and time-resolved CDI reconstruction, providing a broadly applicable framework for coherent imaging modalities such as ptychography and holography, across X-ray, electron, and optical probes.</description>

      <title>Structures resistant to Manipulation by all Wavefronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using light to manipulate small particles is a tool with many practical applications throughout biophysics and nanotechnology. These tools have seen a significant increase in performance by utilizing shaped wavefronts, most commonly created with spatial light modulators. Wavefront shaping has also enabled the manipulation of seemingly arbitrary objects, which was impossible with conventional beams. In contrast, we show here the existence of a wide variety of objects that cannot be manipulated as desired, even with the optimal wavefront shaping protocol. The counterintuitive shapes of these objects are found using inverse design. Specifically, we show that the maximal pulling force is reduced by up to three orders of magnitude, and the maximal trapping stiffness is reduced by up to nearly two orders of magnitude. Our findings could prove useful in the development of micromachines that require a predictable mechanical reaction to an arbitrary wave.</description>

      <title>Mode Control and Dynamic Population Gratings in Quantum-Dot Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-mode operation is essential for integrated semiconductor lasers, yet most solutions rely on regrowth, etched gratings, or other complex fabrication steps that limit scalability. We show that quantum-dot (QD) lasers can achieve stable single-mode lasing through a simple cavity design using dynamic population gratings (DPGs). Owing to the low lateral carrier diffusion of QDs, a strong standing-wave-induced carrier grating forms in a reverse-biased saturable absorber and provides self-aligned, mode-selective feedback not attainable in quantum-well devices. A single-ring laser achieves 46 dB side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR), while a dual-ring Vernier laser delivers ($&gt;$ 46 nm) tuning range and up to 52.6 dB SMSR, with continuous-wave operation up to $80\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$. The laser remains single-mode under $-10.6$ dB external optical feedback and supports isolator-free data transmission at 32 Gbps. These results establish DPG-enabled QD lasers as a simple and scalable route to tunable, feedback-resilient on-chip light sources for communication, sensing, and reconfigurable photonic systems.</description>

      <title>Noise dynamics in large mode volume Brillouin lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated Brillouin lasers have emerged as an important tool to realize a wide range of precision applications, including atomic time-keeping, low-noise microwave signal generation, fiber and quantum sensing, and ultra-high capacity coherent communications. While Brillouin lasers routinely achieve sub-Hz instantaneous linewidths, many of these applications also require exceptional frequency stability and high-power single-mode emission. A recent demonstration showed that extending the resonator length increases the laser power while also improving the frequency stability through suppression of thermorefractive noise. However, as the resonator scales to larger lengths, multiple optical resonances can be found within the Brillouin gain bandwidth, greatly complicating the laser dynamics compared to existing coupled-mode Brillouin laser models. Given the potential to scale lasers of this type to watt-level output powers at sub-mHz linewidths, a theoretical model describing this physics is needed to provide key insights into their performance. Here, we develop a coupled-mode theory of integrated large mode volume Brillouin lasers, accounting for multiple cavity modes with potential to lase within the gain bandwidth. We obtain expressions for the steady-state dynamics, spontaneous spectrum, relative intensity noise, and frequency noise. Our analysis reveals that the broad gain bandwidth results in atypical Brillouin dynamics, giving rise to distinct features in the noise spectra, and consequently modifications of the standard, single-mode fundamental linewidth of Brillouin lasers. Additionally, these features may be used for a variety of tangential applications, such as phonon spectroscopy or quality factor enhancement. Furthermore, we find that the linewidth can be significantly impacted by transferred RIN from the external pump in Brillouin lasers that lack ideal phase matching.</description>

      <title>Solvent-Directed Femtosecond Laser Ablation: Tuning Phase and Defect Engineering in Hybrid CdPS3/CdS Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The limited visible-light absorption of wide-bandgap van der Waals crystals fundamentally restricts their utility in solar energy conversion. Here, we report a surfactant-free, solvent-directed laser synthesis strategy to engineer the phase and optoelectronic properties of Cadmium Phosphorus Trisulfide (CdPS3). By exploiting the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of femtosecond pulsed laser ablation in liquid (fs-PLAL), we demonstrate a tunable transition from the stoichiometric ternary phase to a highly active binary-rich heterostructure. While ablation in water preserves the monoclinic CdPS3 lattice, the reducing environment of isopropanol triggers the formation of CdS quantum dots and metallic cadmium defect sites. This solvent-induced phase engineering transforms the ultraviolet-active host into a robust visible-light photocatalyst. The resulting hybrid CdPS3/CdS nanocolloids exhibit superior charge separation efficiency, driven by Schottky-like metal-semiconductor junctions, achieving ~ 90% degradation of Methylene Blue under 532 nm irradiation within 30 minutes. This work establishes fs-PLAL as a scalable defect-engineering tool for complex ternary layered materials, offering a new design of high-performance metal-thiophosphate-based photocatalysts.</description>

      <title>Two-Photon Bandwidth of Hyper-Entangled Photons in Complex Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When light propagates through complex media, its output spatial distribution is highly sensitive to its wavelength. This fundamentally limits the bandwidth of applications ranging from imaging to communication. Here, we demonstrate analytically and numerically that the spatial correlations of hyper-entangled photon pairs, simultaneously entangled spatially and spectrally, remain stable across a broad bandwidth: The chromatic modal dispersion experienced by one photon is canceled to first order by its spectrally anti-correlated twin, defining a "two-photon bandwidth" that can far exceed its classical counterpart. We illustrate this modal dispersion cancellation in multimode fibers, thin diffusers and blazed gratings, and demonstrate its utility for broadband wavefront shaping of quantum states. These findings advance our fundamental understanding of quantum light in complex media with applications in quantum imaging, communication, and sensing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uncertainty relations are fundamental to quantum mechanics, encoding limits on the simultaneous measurement of conjugate observables. Violations of joint uncertainty bounds can certify entanglement -- a resource critical for quantum information protocols and increasingly relevant in strong-field physics. Here, we investigate the pairwise time-delay and frequency-bandwidth uncertainties for arbitrary multimode quantum states of light, deriving a general lower bound for their joint product. We find that the nonclassical correction scales inversely with the average photon number, a behavior rooted in the so-called ``monogamy of entanglement''. These results clarify the intensity scaling of quantum advantages in nonclassical light states and highlight the interplay between entanglement and photon statistics.</description>

      <title>Exceptional points of arbitrary high orders induced by non-Markovian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exceptional points are singularities in the spectrum of non-Hermitian systems in which several eigenvectors are linearly dependent and their eigenvalues are equal to each other. Usually it is assumed that the order of the exceptional point is limited by the number of degrees of freedom of a non-Hermitian system. In this letter, we refute this common opinion and show that non-Markovian effects can lead to dynamics characteristic of systems with exceptional points of higher orders than the number of degrees of freedom in the system. This takes place when the energy returns from reservoir to the system such that the dynamics of the system are divided into intervals in which it describes by the product of the exponential and a polynomial function of ever-increasing order. We demonstrate that by choosing the observation time, it is possible to observe exceptional points of arbitrary high orders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) has emerged as a powerful technique within the field of attosecond science, combining extremely high temporal and excellent spectral resolution. So far, ATAS has been implemented in pump-probe experiments where an attosecond extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) pump or probe pulse was combined with a near-infrared (NIR) pulse in the femtosecond range, with the attosecond time resolution deriving from sub-cycle NIR-driven dynamics. Investigations of ultrafast electron dynamics in atoms, molecules and solids, with potential impact across physics, chemistry, and biology, would benefit significantly from the ability to perform all-attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (AATAS). Here we demonstrate time-resolved AATAS using a table-top high-harmonic generation (HHG) source. The method is applied to investigate previously unresolved electronic coherences in Xe, revealing oscillatory valence hole motion with a 3-femtosecond period. In addition, systematic investigations of electron dynamics in Kr, Ar, and Ne are presented. Our work shows that, thanks to its broad bandwidth, high stability and easy accessibility, HHG is an ideal source for AATAS, offering the potential for replication in numerous laboratories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a practical and efficient framework for verifying entangled states when only a tomographically incomplete measurement setting is available-specifically, when access to observables is severely limited. We show how the experimental estimation of a small number of observables can be directly exploited to construct a large family of entanglement witnesses, enabling the efficient identification of entangled states. Moreover, we introduce an optimization approach, formulated as a semidefinite program, that systematically searches for those witnesses best suited to reveal entanglement under the given measurement constraints. We demonstrate the practicality of the approach in a proof-of-principle experiment with photon-polarization qubits, where entanglement is certified using only a fraction of the full measurement data. These results reveal the maximal usefulness of incomplete measurement settings for entanglement verification in realistic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Nitrogen-Vacancy Emission from Nanodiamond: Size, Depth, and Surroundings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a leading solid-state quantum emitter, offering spin-photon interfaces over a wide temperature range with applications from electromagnetic sensing to bioimaging. While NV centers in bulk diamond are well understood, embedding them in nanodiamond (ND) introduces complexities from size, NV location, and NV polarizations. NVs in ND show altered fluorescence properties including longer lifetimes, lower quantum efficiency, and higher sensitivity to dielectric surroundings, which arise from radiative suppression, surface-induced non-radiative decay, and escape inefficiency at the diamond-background interface. Prior models typically addressed isolated aspects, such as dielectric contrast or surface quenching, without integrating full quantum-optical NV behavior with classical electrodynamics. We present a hybrid framework coupling rigorous electromagnetic simulations with a quantum-optical NV model including phonon sideband dynamics. NV emission is found to depend strongly on ND size, NV position, and surrounding refractive index. Our results explain observations such as shallow NVs in water-coated ND appearing brighter than deeper ones in air. This integrated model provides a unified framework for realistic NV in ND emission scenarios and informs the design of efficient NV-based sensors and quantum devices, advancing understanding of quantum emitter photophysics in nanoscale crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compared the performance of two post-compression techniques, a gas-filled hollow-core fiber (HCF) and a multi-pass cell (MPC), using a high-power ytterbium-doped fiber laser. The HCF produced 27 fs pulses from 230 fs inputs at &gt;50% efficiency, whereas the MPC achieved 34 fs pulses with significantly higher efficiency (&gt;88%). Both results aligned well with numerical simulations. Crucially, spatial wavefront analysis revealed that the HCF acts as a modal filter, improving beam quality, whereas the MPC introduces aberrations through cumulative mirror errors. Furthermore, we characterize the photon flux of high harmonic generation driven by the post-compressed pulses from the HCF and MPC. These finding highlights that post-compression technique based on self-phase modulation is efficient for the intensity boosting of femtosecond laser system, providing opportunities for generating high quality extreme ultraviolet (XUV) sources. In addition, further improvement of spatial wavefront quality is suggested using the HCF as a single compressor or output component of the cascade compressor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Breaking optical reciprocity enables new regimes of light--matter interaction with broad implications for fundamental physics and emerging quantum technologies. Although various approaches have been explored to achieve optical nonreciprocity, realizing it at the single-photon level has remained a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate nonmagnetic optical nonreciprocity -- including both isolation and circulation -- in the quantum regime, enabled by efficient and noiseless all-optical frequency conversion on an integrated III-V photonic chip. Our device preserves the quantum coherence and entanglement of the input photons while delivering exceptional performance parameters, including a high extinction ratio of 34 dB, low insertion loss of 0.8 dB, broad bandwidth of 44 GHz, high operational fidelity of 97%, and widely tunable operation wavelength. This realization of quantum optical nonreciprocity in a scalable photonic platform opens a pathway toward directional quantum communication and noise-resilient quantum networks.</description>

  direction-dependent Stokes parameters for the scattered field. Both symmetric and asymmetric Poincar\'e spinors are formulated to characterize the polarization states of incident plane wave and the far-zone scattering amplitude, and two different geometric phases are defined therefrom. Density plots of both geometric phases were calculated for six different homogeneous isotropic spheres with different linear constitutive properties and boundary conditions: dielectric-magnetic spheres (non-dissipative and dissipative), impedance spheres, perfect electrically conducting spheres, charged dielectric-magnetic spheres, dielectric-magnetic spheres with topologically insulating surface states, and isotropic chiral spheres. The incident plane waves were taken to be linearly and circularly polarized, for the sake of illustration. Numerical results revealed that geometric-phase density plots possess significantly richer features than their counterparts for the differential scattering efficiency. The geometric-phase portrayals exhibit enhanced sensitivity to changes in the size and composition of the scatterer, the boundary conditions, and the incident polarization state, suggesting promise for inverse-scattering problems.</description>

Abstract: Light scattering by spherical-shaped particles of sizes comparable to the wavelength is foundational in many areas of science, from chemistry to atmospheric science, photonics and nanotechnology. With the new capabilities offered by machine learning, there is a great interest in end-to-end differentiable frameworks for scattering calculations. Here we introduce PyMieDiff, a fully differentiable, GPU-compatible implementation of Mie scattering for core-shell particles in PyTorch. The library provides native, autograd-compatible spherical Bessel and Hankel functions, vectorized evaluation of Mie coefficients, and APIs for computing efficiencies, angular scattering, and near-fields. All inputs - geometry, material dispersion, wavelengths, and observation angles and positions - are represented as tensors, enabling seamless integration with gradient-based optimisation or physics-informed neural networks. The toolkit can also be combined with "TorchGDM" for end-to-end differentiable multi-particle scattering simulations. PyMieDiff is available under an open source licence at https://github.com/UoS-Integrated-Nanophotonics-group/MieDiff.</description>

      <title>Gradient-based optimization of scatterer arrangements based on the T-Matrix method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The demand for inverse design is increasing as the ability to fabricate sub-10 nm features expands the design space by orders of magnitude. Efficient inverse design benefits from differentiable models of light-structure interaction. While traditional full-wave solvers based on finite differences, finite elements, or Fourier modal methods have already been presented for that purpose, a dedicated tool adapted for performing multiple scattering simulations is still lacking. To overcome this limitation, we provide a multiple-scattering framework compatible to automatic differentiation, suitable for treating periodic and non-periodic arrangements of scatterers. It yields exact gradients regarding geometric and positional parameters in finite clusters and infinite metasurfaces. In this work, we use spheres as the elementary building blocks to demonstrate the framework's capabilities as a standalone tool. However, the framework is adaptable to arbitrarily shaped scatterers, provided the individual T-matrices are calculated using differentiable full-wave Maxwell solvers. Since the gradients are obtained simultaneously in a single backward pass, the framework is well-suited for moderately dimensional problems. It is also possible to combine multiple performance goals into a single objective function. The versatility of our method is illustrated in proof-of-concept examples that focus on various aspects of Kerker-type physics. In the first example, a finite cluster of scatterers is optimized in order to reach a high forward-to-backward scattering ratio, and we show experimental feasibility of the designs. In the second example, a metasurface made from multiple scatterers in each unit cell is designed to maximize the reflectance contrast between orthogonal linear polarizations of the incident light. We make the framework publicly available at https://github.com/tfp-photonics/dreams.</description>

      <title>A simple fourth order propagator based on the Magnus expansion in the Liouville space: Application to a $\Lambda$-system and assessment of the rotating wave approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple 4th order propagator [Ture and Jang, {\it J. Phys. Chem. A.} {\bf 128}, 2871 (2024)] based on the Magnus expansion (ME) is extended to the Liouville space for both closed-system and Lindbladian open-system quantum dynamics. For both dynamics, commutator free versions of 4th order propagators are provided as well. These propagators are then applied to the dynamics of a driven $\Lambda$-system, where Lindblad terms represent the effect of a photonic bath. For both dynamics, the accuracy of the rotating wave approximation (RWA) for the matter-radiation interaction is assessed. We confirmed reasonable performance of RWA for weak and resonant fields. However, small errors appear for moderate fields and substantial errors can be found for strong fields where coherent population trapping can still be expected. We also found that the presence of bath for open system quantum dynamics consistently reduces the errors of the RWA. These results provide a quantitative information on how the RWA breaks down beyond weak field or for non-resonant cases. Major results are benchmarked against results of our 6th order ME-based propagator. We also provide numerical comparison of our algorithms with other 4th order algorithms for the $\Lambda$-system. These confirm reasonable performance of out simple propagators and the improvement gained through commutator-free expressions.</description>

      <title>Initial acquisition requirements for optical cavities in the space gravitational wave antennae DECIGO and B-DECIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DECIGO (DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory) is a space-based gravitational wave antenna concept targeting the 0.1-10 Hz band. It consists of three spacecraft arranged in an equilateral triangle with 1,000 km sides, forming Fabry-P\'erot cavities between them. A precursor mission, B-DECIGO, is also planned, featuring a smaller 100 km triangle. Operating these cavities requires ultra-precise formation flying, where inter-mirror distance and alignment must be precisely controlled. Achieving this necessitates a sequential improvement in precision using various sensors and actuators, from the deployment of the spacecraft to laser link acquisition and ultimately to the control of the Fabry-P\'erot cavities to maintain resonance. In this paper, we derive the precision requirements at each stage and discuss the feasibility of achieving them. We show that the relative speed between cavity mirrors must be controlled at the sub-micrometer-per-second level and that relative alignment must be maintained at the sub-microradian level to obtain control signals from the Fabry-P\'erot cavities of DECIGO and B-DECIGO.</description>

      <title>Accurate Prediction of Tensorial Spectra Using Equivariant Graph Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04862v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical spectroscopies provide a powerful tool for harnessing light-matter interactions for unraveling complex electronic features such as the flat bands and nontrivial topologies of materials. These insights are crucial for the development and optimization of optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors, where device performance is closely connected with the nature of the underlying electronic spectrum. Realistic modeling of tensor optical responses in materials, which are computationally quite demanding, however, remains challenging. Here we introduce the Tensorial Spectra Equivariant Neural Network (TSENN), which is a equivariant graph neural network architecture that maps crystal structures directly to their full photon-frequency-dependent optical tensors. By encoding the isotropic sequential scalar components along with the anisotropic sequential tensor components into l = 0 and l = 2 spherical tensor components, TSENN ensures symmetry-aware predictions that are consistent with the constraints of crystalline symmetries of materials. Trained on a dataset of frequency-dependent permittivity tensors of 1,432 bulk semiconductors computed using first-principles methods, our model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 21.181 millifarads per meter (mF/m), demonstrating its potential for efficient modeling of other related properties such as the optical conductivities. Our framework opens new avenues for rational data-driven design of anisotropic optical responses for accelerating materials discovery for advancing optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum coherence and negative quasi probabilities in a contextual three-path interferometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Basic quantum effects are often illustrated using single particle interferences in two-path interferometers. A wider range of non-classical phenomena can be illustrated using three-path interferometers, but the increased complexity of quantum statistics in a three-dimensional Hilbert space makes it difficult to identify a representative set of observable properties that could be used to characterize specific phenomena. Here, I propose a characterization of pure states based on a five-stage interferometer recently introduced to demonstrate the relation between different measurement contexts (Optica Quantum 1, 63 (2023)). It is shown that the orthogonality relations between the states representing the different measurement contexts can be used to classify pure states within the three-dimensional Hilbert space according to the non-classical correlations between different contexts expressed by negative Kirkwood-Dirac distributions.</description>

      <title>Optimized Single-Core PCF-Based SPR Biosensor for High-Performance Early-Stage Multi-Cancer Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a highly sensitive Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR)-based biosensor integrated with a circular-lattice Photonic Crystal Fiber (PCF) for early-stage cancer detection. The proposed sensor leverages the synergy between SPR and PCF technologies to overcome the bulkiness and limited sensitivity of traditional SPR systems. A thin gold (Au) layer, responsible for plasmon excitation, is deposited on the fiber structure, while a nanolayer of vanadium pentoxide (V2O5) is introduced to enhance adhesion between the gold and the silica background, improving structural stability and field confinement. The sensor is designed to detect refractive index (RI) variations in biological analytes, specifically targeting cancerous cells from skin, blood, and adrenal gland tissues. The optical characteristics and performance of the sensor were thoroughly analyzed using the Finite Element Method (FEM) in COMSOL Multiphysics 6.1, allowing for precise simulation and optimization. The sensor demonstrates high sensitivity within the RI range of 1.360-1.395, corresponding to the RI values of the target cancer cells. Remarkable wavelength sensitivities of 21,250 nm/RIU, 53,571 nm/RIU, and 103,571 nm/RIU were achieved for skin, blood, and adrenal gland cancers, respectively. In addition, a maximum figure of merit (FOM) of 306.424 RIU^-1 and a spectral resolution (SR) of 9.57x10^-7 RIU further affirm the sensor's exceptional detection capabilities. These findings indicate the proposed SPR-PCF sensor's strong potential for real-time, label-free biosensing applications, particularly in precise and early cancer diagnostics.</description>

      <title>High-OAM Deep Ultraviolet Twisted Light Generation for RF-Photoinjector Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the generation and characterization of ultraviolet (wavelength 266 nm) twisted light with high orbital angular momentum (OAM) using three types of fabricated diffractive optical elements (DOEs): a reflective fork grating, a high-charge spiral phase plate (SPP), and binary axicons. All elements were integrated into a drive-laser beamline of an electron RF-photoinjector, enabling direct evaluation under accelerator-relevant conditions. The SPP produced a high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian mode with OAM l = 64 and a measured conversion efficiency of approximately 80%. Binary axicons generated quasi-Bessel twisted light with topological charges up to m = 10, exhibiting low divergence and stable multi-lobe ring structures. The fork grating reliably produced lower-order modes, l = 2-8, with good agreement between simulations and cylindrical-lens diagnostics. These results constitute, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive experimental demonstration of deep-UV high-OAM beams generated with fabricated DOEs and validated through mode-conversion measurements. The demonstrated techniques are compatible with high-power UV laser systems used in RF-photoinjectors and offer a practical route toward structured photocathode illumination and the generation of relativistic vortex electrons at a particle accelerator facility.</description>
