      <title>Fingerprints of supersymmetric spin and charge dynamics observed by inelastic neutron scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersymmetry is an algebraic property of a class of quantum Hamiltonians, a guiding principle used in the development of nuclear theory and a concept that may underpin physics beyond the Standard Model. In condensed matter, any symmetry between bosonic and fermionic entities is usually strongly broken, as for the spin and charge sectors of the $t$-$J$ model describing the dynamics of fractionalized electrons in one-dimensional materials. While the triplet excitations of a quantum spin ladder in an applied magnetic field provide a close analogue of the $t$-$J$ chain, the supersymmetric nature of this system has not been explored. Here we perform neutron spectroscopy on the spin-ladder compounds (C$_5$D$_{12}$N)$_2$CuBr$_4$ and (C$_5$D$_{12}$N)$_2$CuCl$_4$ over a range of applied fields and temperatures, and apply matrix-product-state (MPS) methods to the ladder and equivalent chain models, to analyse the full, momentum-resolved dynamics of a single charge excitation in a bath of fractionalized spins. We find a dramatic difference in the effects of thermal fluctuations, where strong and coherent shifts of spectral weight at the zone edge contrast with a strict pole at the zone centre, whose persistence at all temperatures constitutes an observable consequence of supersymmetry in a quantum spin ladder.</description>

      <title>The Kondo impurity in the large spin limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kondo problem, which describes the interaction of a spin $s$ magnetic impurity with a free Fermi gas, is a classic example of strongly coupled physics. Historically, the problem has been solved by Wilson's numerical renormalization group and later by Bethe ansatz. In this paper, we present an alternate analytic solution of the Kondo problem that combines an expansion in $1/s$ with the renormalization group. We study both the case of an impurity interacting with a single channel $K=1$ of fermions in the $s \rightarrow \infty$ limit and the case with $K$ channels in the double-scaling limit $K \rightarrow \infty$, $s \to \infty$, $K/s$ fixed. Our approach allows us to describe analytically intermediate scales of the Kondo problem at large $s$ and compute thermodynamic observables such as the impurity entropy and susceptibility. We find these observables to agree with the Bethe ansatz results. We also compute the impurity spectral function, finite temperature resistivity and the Kondo screening cloud profile, properties that are not easily accessible from Bethe ansatz. Notably, in the regime $K &gt; 2s$ we access the "non-Fermi-liquid" overscreened fixed point of the multichannel Kondo problem.</description>

      <title>Bond disorder in extended Heisenberg-Kitaev models: Spin textures and in-gap states in the high-field regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effect of bond disorder in extended Heisenberg-Kitaev models on the honeycomb lattice, relevant for materials such as $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, in the semiclassical limit using a combination of T-matrix and real-space spin-wave approaches. Focusing on the regime of large applied magnetic field, we discuss two distinct but related disorder-induced phenomena, namely spin textures in the vicinity of isolated impurities and magnetic excitations below the bulk gap. A finite impurity concentration smears the field-tuned phase transition and turns the isolated in-gap states into impurity bands. As a result, there is a large field regime above the bulk transition into the high-field phase where impurity-induced states fill the bulk spin gap. We illustrate the field dependence of these in-gap states for parameters relevant for $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and we connect our results to heat-transport and NMR data which indicated their presence.</description>

      <title>Magnetism of the Bilayer Wigner Crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiple-spin exchange frequencies of the bilayer Wigner crystal are determined by the semiclassical method, which is asymptotically exact in the limit of dilute electron densities. The evolution of the exchange frequencies with interlayer distance -- as the crystal undergoes a sequence of structural transitions -- leads to both ferromagnetic and multi-sublattice antiferromagnetic phases. Extrapolation of the results to higher density suggests a rich magnetic phase diagram of the bilayer Wigner crystal, including the possibility of spin-nematic and valence-bond solid phases. The bilayer crystal is stable to higher electron densities than the monolayer, leading to enhanced magnetic energy scales. Our estimates of the exchange energies suggest some of the magnetic phases may be accessible in recently discovered bilayer Wigner crystals in a transition-metal dichalcogenide system.</description>

      <title>Waterfalls: umbilical cords at the birth of Hubbard bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Waterfalls are anomalies in the angle-resolved photoemission spectrum where the energy-momentum dispersion is almost vertical, and the spectrum strongly smeared out. These anomalies are observed at relatively high energies, among others, in superconducting cuprates and nickelates. The prevalent understanding is that they originate from the coupling to some boson, with spin fluctuations and phonons being the usual suspects. Here, we show that waterfalls occur naturally in the process where a Hubbard band develops and splits off from the quasiparticle band. Our results for the Hubbard model with $\textit{ab initio}$ determined parameters well agree with waterfalls in cuprates and nickelates.</description>

      <title>Ground state of the S = 1/2 Heisenberg spin chain with random ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Heisenberg $S=1/2$ chain with random ferro- and antiferromagnetic couplings, using quantum Monte Carlo simulations at ultra-low temperatures, converging to the ground state. Finite-size scaling of correlation functions and excitation gaps demonstrate an exotic critical state in qualitative agreement with previous strong-disorder renormalization group calculations, but with scaling exponents depending on the coupling distribution. We find dual scaling regimes of the transverse correlations versus the distance, with an $L$ independent form $C(r)=r^{-\mu}$ for $r \ll L$ and $C(r,L)=L^{-\eta}f(r/L)$ for $r/L &gt; 0$, where $\mu &gt; \eta$ and the scaling function is delivered by our analysis. These results are at variance with previous spin-wave and density-matrix renormalization group calculations, thus highlighting the power of unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations.</description>

      <title>Real-time control of non-Abelian anyons in Kitaev spin liquid under energy dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids realized in the Kitaev model offer a platform for fractionalization of spin into two quasiparticles: itinerant Majoranas and localized visons. Introducing a uniform weak magnetic field associates a Majorana zero mode with each vison excitation. The vison accompanied by a Majorana zero mode is known to behave as a non-Abelian anyon, which has garnered significant attention for its potential applications in topological quantum computing. Although spatial and temporal control of these anyons is essential for exploring their applicability in quantum computing, numerical simulations of creating, moving, and annihilating anyons by an external field remain challenging as this field violates the exact solvability of the Kitaev model. Moreover, such a field to control anyons may disturb the quantum state due to the energy injection it causes. In this study, by introducing energy dissipation phenomenologically in real-time simulations, we demonstrate that the generation, movement, and annihilation of vison excitations can be achieved while maintaining their localization. We find that a vison can be moved in a desired direction by using time-dependent local magnetic fields or gradient fields, and it remains accompanied by a Majorana zero mode even after its movement. We also reveal that a larger spatial extent of the Majorana zero modes bound to a vison facilitates the movement of the vison with smaller field gradients. Furthermore, our numerical simulations demonstrate pair creation and annihilation of visons, triggered by time-dependent magnetic fields. The results obtained in this study highlight the significance of energy dissipation in controlling non-Abelian anyons, which will stimulate further investigations into the nonequilibrium dynamics of fractional quasiparticles in strongly correlated electron systems, as well as studies for applications in quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformer Neural Quantum States for Impurity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer neural networks, known for their ability to recognize complex patterns in high-dimensional data, offer a promising framework for capturing many-body correlations in quantum systems. We employ an adapted Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture to model quantum impurity models, optimizing it with a subspace expansion scheme that surpasses conventional variational Monte Carlo in both accuracy and efficiency. Benchmarks against matrix product states in single- and three-orbital Anderson impurity models show that these ViT-based neural quantum states achieve comparable or superior accuracy with significantly fewer variational parameters. We further extend our approach to compute dynamical quantities by constructing a restricted excitation space that effectively captures relevant physical processes, yielding accurate core-level X-ray absorption spectra. These findings highlight the potential of ViT-based neural quantum states for accurate and efficient modeling of quantum impurity models.</description>

      <title>Magnetic correlations and Griffith-like phase in Co$_2$TiSi$_{0.5}$Al$_{0.5}$ Heusler alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study aimed at elucidating the complex magnetic correlations in Co$_2$TiSi$_{0.5}$Al$_{0.5}$ Heusler alloy having the partial B2-type structure amid L2$_1$ cubic main phase. The thermo-magnetization measurements at 100 Oe reveal the presence of two magnetic transitions at T$\rm_{C1}=278~K$ and T$\rm_{C2}=270~K$, respectively, with saturation magnetization of around 1.2 $\mu \rm_ B$/f.u. at 5~K. Our magnetic field dependent studies reveal the dominance of T$\rm_{C1}$ transition at lower fields ($\mu_0\rm H \leqslant 0.03~Tesla$); however, at higher fields the T$\rm_{C2}$ transition becomes more pronounced. The observation of remnant magnetization above Curie temperature suggests the development of Griffiths-like phase, which is extensively analyzed through {\it ac} and {\it dc}- magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$) data. The evaluation of magnetocaloric potential indicates second order phase transition with notable $\Delta S_{\rm M}=$ 2.22 Jkg$^{-1}$K$^{-1}$ at 7 Tesla. The low-field ($\mu_0\rm H \leqslant 0.1~Tesla$) magnetic entropy ($\Delta S_{\rm M}$) curves exhibit two non-identical positive peaks. The nature and range of spin interactions near T$\rm_C$ were scrutinized through rigorous critical phenomenon analysis, and the values of exponents $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ and $\delta$ to be $0.063, 0.361, 1.108$ and $3.943$, respectively, which are found to be slightly deviating from mean-field theory towards 3D Heisenberg model. Additionally, the exchange magnetic interactions are found to decay as $J(r) \sim r^{-4.6}$. Furthermore, the density functional theory results reveal the half-metallic nature exhibiting 100\% spin polarization (SP). However, the electronic and magnetic properties are greatly affected by the incorporation of structural disorder, which results in drastic reduction of SP to mere 8.3\%.</description>

      <title>Quantum-critical and dynamical properties of the XXZ bilayer with long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the XXZ square lattice bilayer model with antiferromagnetic non-frustrating long-range interactions that decay as a power law with the distance. Employing large-scale high-order series expansions with classical Monte Carlo integration (pCUT+MC) about the limit of isolated Heisenberg dimers in the rung-singlet phase, we investigate the one-triplon dispersion and the corresponding spectral weight along the parameter axes of the long-range decay exponent and the XXZ anisotropy. By tuning the latter, we observe two extended regions of 3d XY and Ising universality as well as 3d Heisenberg critical exponents at the isotropic point. Along the decay exponent axis, we demonstrate mean-field behavior for strong long-range couplings, the aforementioned three universality classes for sufficiently weak interactions, and continuously varying critical exponents in-between. Using extrapolations we are able to determine the one-triplon dispersion in a quantitative fashion up to the quantum-critical breakdown of the rung-singlet phase. This allows to extract the dynamical critical exponent $z$ as a function of the decay exponent, displaying a universal behavior. The detected $z&lt;1$ for small decay exponents is in agreement with the expected properties of the anomalous Goldstone modes in the ordered phases with broken continuous symmetry.</description>

      <title>The Fock-space landscape of many-body localisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article reviews recent progress in understanding the physics of many-body localisation (MBL) in disordered and interacting quantum many-body systems, from the perspective of ergodicity breaking on the associated Fock space. This approach to MBL is underpinned by mapping the dynamics of the many-body system onto that of a fictitious single particle on the high-dimensional, correlated and disordered Fock-space graph; yet, as we elaborate, the problem is fundamentally different from that of conventional Anderson localisation on high-dimensional or hierarchical graphs. We discuss in detail the nature of eigenstate correlations on the Fock space, both static and dynamic, and in the ergodic and many-body localised phases as well as in the vicinity of the MBL transition. The latter in turn sheds light on the nature of the transition, and motivates a scaling theory for it in terms of Fock-space based quantities. We also illustrate how these quantities can be concretely connected to real-space observables. An overview is given of several analytical and numerical techniques which have proven important in developing a comprehensive picture. Finally, we comment on some open questions in the field of MBL where the Fock-space approach is likely to prove insightful.</description>

      <title>Effective field theories of dissipative fluids with one-form symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A system with a one-form global symmetry at finite temperature can be viewed as a dissipative fluid of string-like objects. In this work, we classify and construct the most general effective field theories for hydrodynamics of such string fluids, in a probe limit where the one-form charge density is decoupled from the energy-momentum tensor. We show that at leading order in the derivative expansion, there are two distinct types of diffusive transport in a string fluid depending on the discrete spacetime symmetries present in it. One particular application of interest is magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), where the effective field theories describe the diffusion of magnetic field lines. Due to the distinction between the effective field theories for different discrete symmetries, we show that the MHD of a fluid with charge conjugation symmetry is qualitatively different from that of a neutron star, which we previously discussed in arXiv:2207.01636. The explicit effective actions that we write down can be used to obtain the dispersion relations $\omega(k)$ up to cubic order in momenta for each of the different discrete symmetry choices. As another application of this formalism, we show that when the one-form symmetry is spontaneously broken, the effective action reduces to the Maxwell theory. This confirms the interpretation of the photon as a Goldstone boson arising from the spontaneous breaking of a one-form symmetry.</description>

      <title>Closing in on possible scenarios for infinite-layer nickelates: comparison of dynamical mean-field theory with angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conflicting theoretical scenarios for infinite-layer nickelate superconductors have been hotly debated, particularly regarding whether {only} a single Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ band is relevant at low energies besides electron pockets or whether multi-orbital physics including Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ is instead essential. The first scenario has emerged from density-functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations. Comparing the previous DFT+DMFT spectra to recent angular-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, we find excellent agreement for both the Fermi surface and the strongly renormalized quasi-particle bands, supporting the first scenario. Our key findings further suggest that the "waterfalls" observed in ARPES might emerge from the quasi-particle--to--Hubbard-band crossover, and that additional spectral weight close to the $A$-pocket likely originates from the Ni-3$d_{xy}$ orbital.</description>

      <title>Emergence of global receptive fields capturing multipartite quantum correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In quantum physics, even simple data with a well-defined structure at the wave function level can be characterized by extremely complex correlations between its constituent elements. The inherent non-locality of the quantum correlations generally prevents one from providing their simple and transparent interpretation, which also remains a challenging problem for advanced classical techniques that approximate quantum states with neural networks. Here we show that monitoring the neural network weight space while learning quantum statistics from measurements allows to develop physical intuition about complex multipartite patterns and thus helps to construct more effective classical representations of the wave functions. Particularly, we observe the formation of distinct global convolutional structures, receptive fields in the hidden layer of the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) within the neural quantum tomography of the highly-entangled Dicke states. On this basis we propose an exact two-parameter classical representation not only for a specific quantum wave function, but for the whole family of the N-qubit Dicke states of different entanglement. Our findings suggest a fresh look at constructing convolutional neural networks for processing data with non-local patterns and pave the way for developing exact learning-based representations of entangled quantum states.</description>

      <title>S-Matrix Bootstrap and Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate the S-matrix bootstrap analysis of theories with non-invertible symmetries in (1+1) dimensions. Our previous work showed that crossing symmetry of S-matrices in such theories is modified, with modification characterized by the fusion category data. By imposing unitarity, symmetry and the modified crossing, we constrain the space of consistent S-matrices, identifying integrable theories with non-invertible symmetries at the cusps of allowed regions. We also extend the modified crossing rules to cases where vacua transform in non-regular representations of fusion category, utilizing a connection to a dual category $\mathscr C^{*}_{\mathscr{M}}$ and Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT). This highlights the utility of SymTFT in the analysis of scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Rules governing Jahn-Teller order in Prussian blue analogues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jahn-Teller distortions of transition-metal coordination environments link orbital occupancies to structure. In the solid state, such distortions can be strongly correlated through the propagation of strain and/or through orbital interactions. Cooperative Jahn-Teller (CJT) order of this kind affects the electronic, magnetic, and structural properties of the materials in which it occurs. Conventionally studied in dense ceramics, CJT order also occurs in hybrid materials, albeit the underlying phenomenology is not well established. Here we use synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction measurements to determine links between composition and Jahn-Teller effects in a series of Prussian blue analogue (PBA) families. We develop a simple model based on the dual considerations of strain and crystal-field stabilisation that can account for the stability, extent of CJT order, and crystallite strain measured experimentally. This model shows how PBA compositions might be tuned to control the emergence and nature of CJT effects. A key implication of the model is that PBAs harbour their own complex interplay between compositional, structural, orbital, and magnetic degrees of freedom related to that of strongly-correlated functional materials such as the manganite perovskites.</description>

      <title>Hole doping and electronic correlations in Cr-substituted BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09014v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity (SC) is absent in Cr-substituted BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ (CrBFA), a well-established but poorly understood topic. Additionally, the suppression of the spin density wave transition temperature ($T_{\text{SDW}}$) in CrBFA and Mn-substituted BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$ (MnBFA) coincides as a function of Cr/Mn content, despite the distinct electronic effects of these substitutions. In this work, we employ angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and combined density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory calculations (DFT+DMFT) to address the evolution of the Fermi surface (FS) and electronic correlations in CrBFA. Our findings reveal that incorporating Cr leads to an effective hole doping of the states near the FS, which is well described within the virtual crystal approximation (VCA). We analyzed the electronic band spectra with main $d_{yz}$-orbital character and found a fractional scaling of the imaginary part of self-energy as a function of the binding energy, a signature property of Hund's correlations. We conclude that CrBFA is a correlated electron system and the changes in the FS as a function of Cr are unrelated to the suppression of $T_{\text{SDW}}$. We suggest that the absence of SC is primarily due to the competition between Cr local moments and the Fe-derived itinerant spin fluctuations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the 1D quantum Heisenberg chain with randomly ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic couplings (a model previously studied by approximate strong-disorder RG). We find that, at least for sufficiently large spin $S$, the ground state has ``spin glass'' order. The spin waves on top of this state have the dynamical exponent ${z=3/2}$, intermediate between the values $z=1$ of the antiferromagnet and ${z=2}$ of the ferromagnet. DMRG simulations are in good agreement with the analytical results for spins ${S=1}$ and ${S=3/2}$. The case ${S=1/2}$ shows large finite size effects: we suggest that this case is also ordered, but with a small ordered moment.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the problem of adsorption of a single He-4 layer on graphene, focusing on the commensurate C1/3 crystalline phase, specifically on whether it may possess a nonzero superfluid response, and on the existence of superfluid phases, either (metastable) liquid or vacancy-doped crystalline. We make use of canonical Quantum Monte Carlo simulations at zero and finite temperature, based on a realistic microscopic model of the system. Our results confirm the absence of any superfluid response in the commensurate crystal, and that no thermodynamically stable uniform phase exists at lower coverage. No evidence of a possibly long-lived, metastable superfluid phase at C1/3 coverage is found. Altogether, the results of ground-state projection methods and finite-temperature simulations are entirely consistent.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The S = 1/2 triangular lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF) is a paradigmatic example of frustrated quantum magnetism. An ongoing challenge involves understanding the influence of exchange anisotropy on the collective behavior within such systems. Using inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and advanced calculation techniques, we have studied the low and high-temperature spin dynamics of Ba2La2CoTe2O12 (BLCTO): a Co2+-based Jeff = 1/2 TLAF that exhibits 120{\deg} order below TN = 3.26 K. We determined the spin Hamiltonian by fitting the energy-resolved paramagnetic excitations measured at T &gt; TN, revealing exceptionally strong easy-plane XXZ anisotropy. Below TN, the excitation spectrum exhibits a high energy continuum having a larger spectral weight than the single-magnon modes, suggesting a scenario characterized by a spinon confinement length that markedly exceeds the lattice spacing. We conjecture that this phenomenon arises from the proximity to a quantum melting point, even under strong easy-plane XXZ anisotropy. Finally, we highlight characteristic flat features in the excitation spectrum, which are connected to higher-order van Hove singularities in the magnon dispersion directly induced by easy-plane XXZ anisotropy. Our results provide a rare experimental insight into the nature of highly anisotropic S = 1/2 TLAFs between the Heisenberg and XY limits.</description>

      <title>A Generalised Haldane Map from the Matrix Product State Path Integral to the Critical Theory of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the $J_1$-$J_2$ spin-$1/2$ chain using a path integral constructed over matrix product states (MPS). By virtue of its non-trivial entanglement structure, the MPS ansatz captures the key phases of the model even at a semi-classical, saddle-point level, and, as a variational state, is in good agreement with the field theory obtained by abelian bosonisation. Going beyond the semi-classical level, we show that the MPS ansatz facilitates a physically-motivated derivation of the field theory of the critical phase: by carefully taking the continuum limit -- a generalisation of the Haldane map -- we recover from the MPS path integral a field theory with the correct topological term and emergent $SO(4)$ symmetry, constructively linking the microscopic states and topological field-theoretic structures. Moreover, the dimerisation transition is particularly clear in the MPS formulation -- an explicit dimerisation potential becomes relevant, gapping out the magnetic fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Modelling of Magnetism in Strongly Correlated Materials: Evaluating Constrained DFT and the Hubbard Model for Y114</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transition-metal compounds represent a fascinating playground for exploring the intricate relationship between structural distortions, electronic properties, and magnetic behaviour, holding significant promise for technological advancements. Among these compounds, YBaCo$_4$O$_{7}$ (Y114) is attractive due to its manifestation of a ferrimagnetic component at low temperature intertwined with distortion effect due to the charge disproportionation on Co ions, exerting profound impact on its magnetic properties. In this perspective paper, we study the structural and magnetic intricacies of the Y114 crystal using a novel first-principles methodology. Traditionally, the investigation of such materials has relied heavily on computational modelling using density-functional theory (DFT) with the on-site Coulomb interaction correction $U$ (DFT+$U$) based on the Hubbard model (sometimes including Hund's exchange coupling parameter $J$, DFT+$U$+$J$) to unravel their complexities. Herein, we analysed the spurious effects of magnetic-moment delocalisation and spillover to non-magnetic ions in the lattice on electronic structure and magnetic properties of Y114. To overcome this problem we have applied constrained DFT (cDFT) based on the potential self-consistency approach, and comprehensively explore the Y114 crystal's characteristics in its ferrimagnetic order. We find that cDFT yields magnetic moments of Co ions much closer to the experimental values than Hubbard model with the parameters $U$ and $J$ fitted to reproduce experimental lattice constants. cDFT allows for an accurate prediction of magnetic properties using oxidation states of magnetic ions as well-defined parameters. Through this perspective, we not only enhance our understanding of the magnetic interactions in Y114 crystal, but also pave the way for future investigations into magnetic materials.</description>

      <title>Lattice Models for Phases and Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05964v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-invertible categorical symmetries have emerged as a powerful tool to uncover new beyond-Landau phases of matter, both gapped and gapless, along with second order phase transitions between them. The general theory of such phases in (1+1)d has been studied using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), also known as topological holography. This has unearthed the infrared (IR) structure of these phases and transitions. In this paper, we describe how the SymTFT information can be converted into an ultraviolet (UV) anyonic chain lattice model realizing, in the IR limit, these phases and transitions. In many cases, the Hilbert space of the anyonic chain is tensor product decomposable and the model can be realized as a quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian. We also describe operators acting on the lattice models that are charged under non-invertible symmetries and act as order parameters for the phases and transitions. In order to fully describe the action of non-invertible symmetries, it is crucial to understand the symmetry twisted sectors of the lattice models, which we describe in detail. Throughout the paper, we illustrate the general concepts using the symmetry category $\mathsf{Rep}(S_3)$ formed by representations of the permutation group $S_3$, but our procedure can be applied to any fusion category symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We propose a symmetry-based approach to constructing lattice models for chiral topological phases, focusing on non-Abelian anyons. Using a 2+1D version of anyon chains and modular tensor categories(MTCs), we ensure exact MTC symmetry at the microscopic level. Numerical simulations using tensor networks demonstrate chiral edge modes for topological phases with Ising and Fibonacci anyons. Our method contrasts with conventional solvability approaches, providing a new theoretical avenue to explore strongly coupled 2+1D systems, revealing chiral edge states in non-Abelian anyonic systems.</description>

Abstract: In this lecture note, we give a basic introduction to the rapidly developing concepts of generalized symmetries, from the perspectives of both high energy physics and condensed matter physics. In particular, we emphasize on the (invertible) higher-form and higher-group symmetries. For the physical applications, we discuss the geometric engineering of QFTs in string theory and the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in condensed matter physics.
  The lecture note is based on a short course on generalized symmetries, jointly given by Yi-Nan Wang and Qing-Rui Wang in Feb. 2023, which took place at School of Physics, Peking University (https://indico.ihep.ac.cn/event/18796/).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a study of electrical and thermal transport in Weyl semimetal WTe$_2$ down to 0.3 K. The Wiedemann-Franz law holds below 2 K and a downward deviation starts above. The deviation is more pronounced in cleaner samples, as expected in the hydrodynamic picture of electronic transport, where a fraction of electron-electron collisions conserve momentum. Phonons are the dominant heat carriers and their mean-free-path do not display a Knudsen minimum. This is presumably a consequence of weak anharmonicity, as indicated by the temperature dependence of the specific heat. Frequent momentum exchange between phonons and electrons leads to quantum oscillations of the phononic thermal conductivity. Bloch-Gr\"uneisen picture of electron-phonon scattering breaks down at low temperature when Umklapp ph-ph collisions cease to be a sink for electronic flow of momentum. Comparison with semi-metallic Sb shows that normal ph-ph collisions are amplified by anharmonicity. In both semimetals, at cryogenic temperature, e-ph collisions degrade the phononic flow of energy but not the electronic flow of momentum.</description>

Abstract: interacting and disordered topological phases of coupled Kitaev wires, which may support further realistic applications of Majorana fermions. We develop a variety of analytical, mathematical and numerical methods for one and two-coupled wires, associated with a topological marker accessible from real-space correlation functions on the wire(s). We verify the stability of the topological superconducting phase and quantify disorder effects close to the quantum phase transitions, e.g. through two-point correlation functions or using a renormalization group (RG) analysis of disorder. We show for the first time that the double critical Ising (DCI) phase -- a fractional Majorana liquid characterized by a pair of half central charges and topological numbers -- is stabilized by strong interactions against disorder which respects the inversion symmetry between the wires (ie. parity conservation on each wire). In the presence of an inter-wire hopping term, the DCI phase turns into a protected topological phase with a bulk gap. We study the localization physics developing along the critical line for weaker interactions.</description>
