      <title>Mechanism Design for Facility Location using Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mechanisms for the facility location problem augmented with predictions of the optimal facility location. We demonstrate that an egalitarian viewpoint which considers both the maximum distance of any agent from the facility and the minimum utility of any agent provides important new insights compared to a viewpoint that just considers the maximum distance. As in previous studies, we consider performance in terms of consistency (worst case when predictions are accurate) and robustness (worst case irrespective of the accuracy of predictions). By considering how mechanisms with predictions can perform poorly, we design new mechanisms that are more robust. Indeed, by adjusting parameters, we demonstrate how to trade robustness for consistency. We go beyond the single facility problem by designing novel strategy proof mechanisms for locating two facilities with bounded consistency and robustness that use two predictions for where to locate the two facilities.</description>

      <title>What Do Agents Think Others Would Do? Level-2 Inverse Games for Inferring Agents' Estimates of Others' Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effectively interpreting strategic interactions among multiple agents requires us to infer each agent's objective from limited information. Existing inverse game-theoretic approaches frame this challenge in terms of a "level-1" inference problem, in which we take the perspective of a third-party observer and assume that individual agents share complete knowledge of one another's objectives. However, this assumption breaks down in decentralized, real-world decision scenarios like urban driving and bargaining, in which agents may act based on conflicting views of one another's objectives. We demonstrate the necessity of inferring agents' heterogeneous estimates of each other's objectives through empirical examples, and by theoretically characterizing the prediction error of level-1 inference on fictitious gameplay data from linear-quadratic games. To address this fundamental issue, we propose a framework for level-2 inference to address the question: "What does each agent believe about all agents' objectives?" We prove that the level-2 inference problem is non-convex even in benign settings like linear-quadratic games, and we develop an efficient gradient-based approach for identifying local solutions. Experiments on a synthetic urban driving example show that our approach uncovers nuanced misalignments that level-1 methods miss.</description>

      <title>Inequality in the Age of Pseudonymity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inequality measures such as the Gini coefficient are used to inform and motivate policymaking, and are increasingly applied to digital platforms. We analyze how measures fare in pseudonymous settings, as common to internet-based or blockchain-based platforms. One key challenge that arises is the ability of actors to create multiple fake identities under fictitious false names, also known as ``Sybils.'' While some actors may do so to preserve their privacy, we show that this can inadvertently distort inequality metrics. As we show, when using inequality measures that satisfy literature's canonical set of desired properties, the presence of Sybils in an economy implies that it is impossible to properly measure the economy's inequality. Then, we present several classes of Sybil-proof measures that satisfy relaxed versions of the aforementioned desired properties, and, by fully characterizing them, we prove that the structure imposed restricts their ability to assess inequality at a fine-grained level. In addition, we prove that popular inequality metrics, including the famous Gini coefficient, are vulnerable to Sybil manipulations, and examine the dynamics that result in the creation of Sybils, whether in pseudonymous settings or traditional ones.</description>

      <title>A Game-Theoretic Framework for Network Formation in Large Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a model of network formation in large populations. Each agent can choose the strength of interaction (i.e. connection) with other agents to find a Nash equilibrium. Different from the recently-developed theory of graphon games, here each agent's control depends not only on her own index but also on the index of other agents. After defining the general model of the game, we focus on a special case with piecewise constant graphs and we provide optimality conditions through a system of forward-backward stochastic differential equations. Furthermore, we show the uniqueness and existence results. Finally, we provide numerical experiments to discuss the effects of different model settings.</description>

      <title>Agentic-AI based Mathematical Framework for Commercialization of Energy Resilience in Electrical Distribution System Planning and Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing vulnerability of electrical distribution systems to extreme weather events and cyber threats necessitates the development of economically viable frameworks for resilience enhancement. While existing approaches focus primarily on technical resilience metrics and enhancement strategies, there remains a significant gap in establishing market-driven mechanisms that can effectively commercialize resilience features while optimizing their deployment through intelligent decision-making. Moreover, traditional optimization approaches for distribution network reconfiguration often fail to dynamically adapt to both normal and emergency conditions. This paper introduces a novel framework integrating dual-agent Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) with market-based mechanisms, achieving an average resilience score of 0.85 0.08 over 10 test episodes. The proposed architecture leverages a dual-agent PPO scheme, where a strategic agent selects optimal DER-driven switching configurations, while a tactical agent fine-tunes individual switch states and grid preferences under budget and weather constraints. These agents interact within a custom-built dynamic simulation environment that models stochastic calamity events, budget limits, and resilience-cost trade-offs. A comprehensive reward function is designed that balances resilience enhancement objectives with market profitability (with up to 200x reward incentives, resulting in 85% of actions during calamity steps selecting configurations with 4 DERs), incorporating factors such as load recovery speed, system robustness, and customer satisfaction. Over 10 test episodes, the framework achieved a benefit-cost ratio of 0.12 0.01, demonstrating sustainable market incentives for resilience investment. This framework creates sustainable market incentives</description>

      <title>Diverse Committees with Incomplete or Inaccurate Approval Ballots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study diversity in approval-based committee elections with incomplete or inaccurate information. We define diversity according to the Maximum Coverage problem, which is known to be \textsc{np}-complete, with a best attainable polynomial time approximation ratio of $1-1/\e$. In the incomplete information setting, voters vote only on a small portion of the candidates, and we prove that getting arbitrarily close to the optimal approximation ratio w.h.p. requires $\Omega(m^2)$ non-adaptive queries, where $m$ is the number of candidates. This motivates studying adaptive querying algorithms, that can adapt their querying strategy to information obtained from previous query outcomes. In that setting, we lower this bound to only $\Omega(m)$ queries. We propose a greedy algorithm to match this lower bound up to log-factors. We prove the same $\tilde\Theta(m)$ bound for the generalized problem of Max Cover over a matroid constraint, using a local search algorithm. Specifying a matroid of valid committees lets us implement extra structural requirements on the committee, like quota. In the inaccurate information setting, voters' responses are corrupted with a small probability. We prove $\tilde\Theta(nm)$ queries are required to attain a $(1-1/\e)$-approximation with high probability, where $n$ is the number of voters. While the proven bounds show that all our algorithms are viable asymptotically, they also show that some of them would still require large numbers of queries in instances of practical relevance. Using real data from Polis as well as synthetic data, we observe that our algorithms perform well also on smaller instances, both with incomplete and inaccurate information.</description>

      <title>A Value Based Parallel Update MCTS Method for Multi-Agent Cooperative Decision Making of Connected and Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To solve the problem of lateral and logitudinal joint decision-making of multi-vehicle cooperative driving for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs), this paper proposes a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) method with parallel update for multi-agent Markov game with limited horizon and time discounted setting. By analyzing the parallel actions in the multi-vehicle joint action space in the partial-steady-state traffic flow, the parallel update method can quickly exclude potential dangerous actions, thereby increasing the search depth without sacrificing the search breadth. The proposed method is tested in a large number of randomly generated traffic flow. The experiment results show that the algorithm has good robustness and better performance than the SOTA reinforcement learning algorithms and heuristic methods. The vehicle driving strategy using the proposed algorithm shows rationality beyond human drivers, and has advantages in traffic efficiency and safety in the coordinating zone.</description>

      <title>On the Fundamental Impossibility of Hallucination Control in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06382v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes a fundamental impossibility theorem: no LLM capable performing non-trivial knowledge aggregation can simultaneously achieve truthful (internally consistent) knowledge representation, semantic information conservation, complete revelation of relevant knowledge, and knowledge-constrained optimality. This impossibility is not an engineering limitation but arises from the mathematical structure of information aggregation itself. We establish this result by describing the inference process as an auction of ideas, where distributed components compete exploiting their partial knowledge to shape responses. The proof spans three independent mathematical domains: mechanism design theory (Green-Laffont), the theory of proper scoring rules (Savage), and direct architectural analysis of transformers (Log-Sum-Exp convexity). In particular, we show how in the strictly concave settings the score of an aggregate of diverse beliefs strictly exceeds the sum of individual scores. That gap may quantify the creation of unattributable certainty or overconfidence -- the mathematical origin of both hallucination and creativity, or imagination.
  To support this analysis, we introduce the complementary concepts of the semantic information measure and the emergence operator to model bounded reasoning in a general setting. We prove that while bounded reasoning generates accessible information, providing valuable insights and inspirations, idealized reasoning strictly preserves semantic content. By demonstrating that hallucination and imagination are mathematically identical phenomena-grounded in the necessary violation of information conservation-this paper offers a principled foundation for managing these behaviors in advanced AI systems. Finally, we present some speculative ideas to inspire evaluation and refinements of the proposed theory.</description>
