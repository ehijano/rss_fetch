      <title>Local rigidity of covering constructions and Weil--Petersson subvarieties of the moduli space of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that totally geodesic subvarieties of the moduli space $\mathcal M_{g,n}$ of genus $g$ curves with $n$ marked points, endowed with the Weil--Petersson metric, are locally rigid. This implies that covering constructions -- examples of totally geodesic subvarieties of $\mathcal M_{g,n}$ endowed with the Teichm\"uller metric -- are locally rigid. We deduce the local rigidity statement from a more general rigidity result for a class of orbifold maps to $\mathcal M_{g,n}$.</description>

      <title>Partially hyperbolic flows on flat vector bundles with an application to complete affine manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a manifold of dimension $m$ with a flat vector bundle given by a representation $\rho:\pi_1(N) \rightarrow \mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbf{R})$ where $\pi_1(N)$ is finitely generated. The holonomy group $\rho$ is a $k$-partially hyperbolic holonomy representation if the flat bundle pulled back over the unit tangent bundle of a sufficiently large compact submanifold of $N$ splits into expanding, neutral, and contracting subbundles along the geodesic flow, where the expanding and contracting subbundles are $k$-dimensional with $k &lt; n/2$. Suppose that each element of $\rho(\pi_1(N))$ has an eigenvalue of norm $1$, or, alternatively, each element of it has a singular value that is uniformly bounded above and below. We show that $\rho$ is a $P$-Anosov representation for a parabolic subgroup $P$ of $\mathrm{GL}(n, \mathbf{R})$ if and only if $\rho$ is a partially hyperbolic representation. We are going to primarily employ representation theory techniques. As an application, we will show this holds when $N$ is a complete affine $n$-manifold and $\rho$ is a linear part of the holonomy representation. This had never been done over the full general linear group.</description>

      <title>Non-fibered strongly quasipositive links and tightness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that for fibered links in $\mathbb{S}^3$ being strongly quasipositive and supporting a tight contact structure are equivalent notions (arXiv:math/0509499). In this note we analyze the relation between these two properties for non fibered links. A non fibered link (together with an incompressible Seifert surface) induces a natural partial open book (arXiv:2509.09615). We prove that strongly quasipositive links induce tight contact structures. We also show that, in contrast to the fibered case, the converse is not true, giving examples of links that are not strongly quasipositive but support tight contact structures.</description>

      <title>Fundamental groups of strata of abelian differentials of low codimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for a stratum of projectivized abelian differentials with sufficiently many simple zeroes, the inclusion into the appropriate moduli space of pointed curves induces an injection at the level of orbifold fundamental group, thereby confirming part of a 1997 conjecture of Kontsevich-Zorich. Combined with previous work of the author with Calderon, this describes the orbifold fundamental groups of these strata as framed mapping class groups. Our approach is algebro-geometric in nature, and is based on Shimada's techniques for computing fundamental groups via morphisms of varieties that behave like fiber bundles away from loci of high codimension.</description>

      <title>Hochschild (co)homology for odd Khovanov arc algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Hochschild homology and cohomology to quasi-associative algebras, which were defined initially by Albuquerque and Majid and generalized by Naisse and Putyra via grading categories. As an application, we use our construction to give an alternative proof of up-to-sign functoriality for odd Khovanov homology, which was recently proven by Migdail and Wehrli. Our proof generalizes an argument of Khovanov: in doing so, we also give the first proof that the tangle theory of Naisse and Putyra is functorial with respect to tangle cobordisms, up to unit.</description>

      <title>Sierpinski carpet hyperbolic components of disjoint type are bounded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish certain uniform a priori bounds for hyperbolic components of disjoint type. As an application, we will prove that Sierpinski carpet hyperbolic components of disjoint type are bounded. Furthermore, we show that for each map $f$ on the closure of such a hyperbolic component, there exists a quadratic-like restriction around every non-repelling periodic point. Extensions of these results to non-Sierpinski configurations are underway. As a prototype example, we describe the post-critical set of any map on the boundary of the hyperbolic component of $z^2$.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous braids are visually prime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that closures of homogeneous braids are visually prime, addressing a question of Cromwell. The key technical tool for the proof is the following criterion concerning primeness of open books, which we consider to be of independent interest. For open books of 3-manifolds the property of having no fixed essential arcs is preserved under essential Murasugi sums with a strictly right-veering open book, if the plumbing region of the original open book veers to the left. We also provide examples of open books in S^3 demonstrating that primeness is not necessarily preserved under essential Murasugi sum, in fact not even under stabilizations a.k.a. Hopf plumbings. Furthermore, we find that trefoil plumbings need not preserve primeness. In contrast, we establish that figure-eight knot plumbings do preserve primeness.</description>

      <title>Rep-Tiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $n$-dimensional rep-tile is a compact, connected submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with non-empty interior which can be decomposed into pairwise isometric rescaled copies of itself whose interiors are disjoint. We show that every smooth compact $n$-dimensional submanifold of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with connected boundary is topologically isotopic to a polycube that tiles the $n$-cube, and hence is topologically isotopic to a rep-tile. It follows that there is a rep-tile in the homotopy type of any finite CW complex. In addition to classifying rep-tiles in all dimensions up to isotopy, we also give new explicit constructions of rep-tiles, namely examples in the homotopy type of any finite bouquet of spheres.</description>

      <title>A Fast, Strong, Topologically Meaningful and Fun Knot Invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18456v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss a pair of polynomial knot invariants $\Theta=(\Delta,\theta)$ which is:
  * Theoretically and practically fast: $\Theta$ can be computed in polynomial time. We can compute it in full on random knots with over 300 crossings, and its evaluation at simple rational numbers on random knots with over 600 crossings.
  * Strong: Its separation power is much greater than the hyperbolic volume, the HOMFLY-PT polynomial and Khovanov homology (taken together) on knots with up to 15 crossings (while being computable on much larger knots).
  * Topologically meaningful: It likely gives a genus bound, and there are reasons to hope that it would do more.
  * Fun: Scroll to Figures 1.1-1.4, 3.1, and 6.2.
  $\Delta$ is merely the Alexander polynomial. $\theta$ is almost certainly equal to an invariant that was studied extensively by Ohtsuki, continuing Rozansky, Kricker, and Garoufalidis. Yet our formulas, proofs, and programs are much simpler and enable its computation even on very large knots.</description>
