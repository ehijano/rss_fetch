      <title>Quiet Please: Detrending Radial Velocity Variations from Stellar Activity with a Physically Motivated Spot Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For solar-type stars, spots and their associated magnetic regions induce radial velocity perturbations through the Doppler rotation signal and the suppression of convective blueshift -- collectively known as rotation-modulation. We developed the Rotation-Convection (RC) model: a method of detrending and characterizing rotation-modulation, using only cross-correlation functions or 1-dimensional spectra, without the need for continuous high cadence measurements. The RC method uses a simple model for the anomalous radial velocity induced by an active region and has two inputs: stellar flux (or a flux proxy) and the relative radial velocity between strongly and weakly absorbed wavelengths (analogous to the bisector-inverse slope). On NEID solar data (three month baseline), the RC model lowers the amplitude of rotationally-modulated stellar activity to below the meter-per-second level. For the standard star HD 26965, the RC model detrends the activity signal to the meter-per-second level for HARPS, EXPRES, and NEID observations, even though the temporal density and timespan of the observations differs by an order of magnitude between the three datasets. In addition to detrending, the RC model also characterizes the rotation-modulation signal. From comparison with the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we confirmed that the model accurately recovers and separates the rotation and convection radial velocity components. We also mapped the amplitude of the rotation and convection perturbations as a function of height within the stellar atmosphere. Probing stellar atmospheres with our revised spot model will fuel future innovations in stellar activity mitigation, enabling robust exoplanet detection.</description>

      <title>Universal non-thermal power-law distribution functions from the self-consistent evolution of collisionless electrostatic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distribution functions of collisionless systems are known to show non-thermal power law tails. Interestingly, collisionless plasmas in various physical scenarios, (e.g., the ion population of the solar wind) feature a $v^{-5}$ tail in the velocity ($v$) distribution, whose origin has been a long-standing mystery. We show this power law tail to be a natural outcome of the self-consistent collisionless relaxation of driven electrostatic plasmas. We perform a quasilinear analysis of the perturbed Vlasov-Poisson equations to show that the coarse-grained mean distribution function (DF), $f_0$, follows a quasilinear diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient $D(v)$ that depends on $v$ through the plasma dielectric constant. If the plasma is isotropically forced on scales much larger than the Debye length with a white noise-like electric field, then $D(v)\sim v^4$ for $\sigma&lt;v&lt;\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$, with $\sigma$ the thermal velocity, $\omega_{\mathrm{P}}$ the plasma frequency and $k$ the maximum wavenumber of the perturbation; the corresponding $f_0$, in the quasi-steady state, develops a $v^{-\left(d+2\right)}$ tail in $d$ dimensions ($v^{-5}$ tail in 3D), while the energy ($E$) distribution develops an $E^{-2}$ tail irrespective of the dimensionality of space. Any redness of the noise only alters the scaling in the high $v$ end. Non-resonant particles moving slower than the phase-velocity of the plasma waves ($\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$) experience a Debye-screened electric field, and significantly less (power law suppressed) acceleration than the near-resonant particles. Thus, a Maxwellian DF develops a power law tail. The Maxwellian core ($v&lt;\sigma$) eventually also heats up, but over a much longer timescale than that over which the tail forms. We definitively show that self-consistency (ignored in test-particle treatments) is crucial for the development of the universal $v^{-5}$ tail.</description>

      <title>Toward a Comprehensive Grid of Cepheid Models with MESA I. Uncertainties of the Evolutionary Tracks of Intermediate-Mass Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Helium-burning stars, in particular Cepheids, are especially difficult to model, as the choice of free parameters can greatly impact the shape of the blue loops - the part of the evolutionary track at which instability strip is crossed. Contemporary one-dimensional stellar evolution codes, like MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics), come with a large number of free parameters that allow to model the physical processes in stellar interiors under many assumptions. The uncertainties that arise from this freedom are rarely discussed in the literature despite their impact on the evolution of the model. We calculate a grid of evolutionary models with MESA, varying several controls, like solar mixture of heavy elements, mixing length theory prescription, nuclear reaction rates, scheme to determine convective boundaries, atmosphere model, temporal and spatial resolution, and quantify their impact on age and location of the evolutionary track on the HR diagram from the main sequence till the end of core-helium burning. Our investigation was conducted for a full range of masses and metallicities expected for classical Cepheids. The uncertainties are significant, especially during core-helium burning, reaching or exceeding the observational uncertainties of log Teff and log L for detached eclipsing binary systems. For models below 9 solar masses, thin convective shells develop and evolve erratically, not allowing the models to converge. A careful inspection of Kippenhahn diagrams and convergence study is advised for a given mass and metallicity, to assess how severe this problem is and to what extent it may affect the evolution.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Solar Spicules and their Role in Solar Wind Production using Machine Learning and the Hough Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar winds originate from the Sun and can be classified as fast or slow. Fast solar winds come from coronal holes at the solar poles, while slow solar winds may originate from the equatorial region or streamers. Spicules are jet-like structures observed in the Sun's chromosphere and transition region. Some spicules exhibit rotating motion, potentially indicating vorticity and Alfven waves. Machine learning and the Hough algorithm were used to analyze over 3000 frames of the Sun, identifying spicules and their characteristics. The study found that rotating spicules, accounting for 21 percent at the poles and 4 percent at the equator, play a role in energy transfer to the upper solar atmosphere. The observations suggest connections between spicules, mini-loops, magnetic reconnection, and the acceleration of fast solar winds. Understanding these small-scale structures is crucial for comprehending the origin and heating of the fast solar wind.</description>

      <title>Jets from the Upper Scorpious Variable Young Star System 2MASS J16075796-2040087 Via KECK/HIRES Spectro-astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 2MASS J16075796-2040087 is a ~ 5 Myr young star in Upper Sco with evidence for accretion bursts on a timescale of about 15 days and, uncommonly for its age, outflows traced by multi-component forbidden emission lines (FELs). The accretion bursts may be triggered by a companion at ~ 4.6 au. We analyze HIRES spectra optimised for spectro-astrometry to better understand the origin of the several FEL velocity components and determine whether a MHD disk wind is present. The FEL high velocity component (HVC) traces an asymmetric, bipolar jet ~ 700 au long. The jet's position angle (PA) ~ 277 degrees is not perpendicular to the disk. The lower-velocity emission, classified previously as a disk wind low-velocity component (LVC), is found to have more in common with the HVC and overall it is not possible to identify a MHD disk wind component. The spectro-astrometric signal of the low velocity emission resembles those of jets and its density and ionisation fraction fall into the range of HVCs. We suggest a scenario where the accretion bursts due to the close companion power the jets past the age where such activity ends around most stars. The low-velocity emission here could come from a slow jet launched near the close companion and this emission would be blended with emission from the MHD wind.</description>

      <title>Rotational velocities of Blue Straggler Stars in the Globular Cluster M55</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using high-resolution spectra acquired with FLAMES-GIRAFFE at the ESO/VLT, we measured radial and rotational velocities of 115 stars in the Galactic globular cluster M55. After field decontamination based on the radial velocity values, the final sample of member stars is composed of 32 blue straggler stars (BSSs) and 76 reference stars populating the red giant and horizontal branches of the cluster. In agreement with previous findings, the totality of red giant branch stars has negligible rotation ($&lt;$ 10 km s$^{-1}$), and horizontal branch stars have rotational velocities of 40 km s$^{-1}$ at most. In contrast, the BSS rotational velocity distribution shows a long tail extending up to $\sim$ 200 km s$^{-1}$, with 15 BSSs (out of 32) spinning faster than 40 km s$^{-1}$. By defining the threshold for fast rotating BSSs at 40 km s$^{-1}$, this sets the percentage of these stars at 47 $\pm$ 14 %. Such a large value has never been found before in any globular clusters. It is roughly comparable to that measured in other loose systems ($\omega$ Centauri, M4, and NGC 3201) and significantly larger than that observed in high-density clusters (as 47 Tucanae, NGC 6397, NGC 6752, and M30). This evidence supports a scenario where recent BSS formation is occurring in low-density environments. We also find that the BSS rotational velocity tends to decrease for decreasing luminosity, as found for another loose cluster of the sample (namely, NGC 3201).</description>

      <title>Insight into the occurrence of particle acceleration through the investigation of Wolf-Rayet stars using uGMRT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars produce strong stellar winds that consist of continuous outflows of material at speeds of thousands of km/s. These winds convey large amounts of kinetic power, especially in the case of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. When these winds interact with nearby material, they will likely produce shocks. Among other processes, particle acceleration is expected to occur. This is particularly well established in the case of massive binary systems, where the stellar winds collide, allowing these systems to be identified thanks to the detection of synchrotron radio emission, produced by a population of relativistic particles accelerated in the shocks. Our goal is to investigate the occurrence of particle acceleration among massive stars in their pre-supernova evolution phases. To this end, we observed a subset of five WR stars in the radio domain using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT), located in India. The observations were carried out in bands 4 (550-950 MHz) and 5 (1050-1450 MHz) for all the targets. We detected radio emission for only WR 110 in bands 4 and 5. Its thermal spectrum displays a consistent index of +0.74 down to uGMRT bands. The four other targets were not detected and we derived 3$\sigma$ upper limits. Our upper limits in Band 4 are the first provided for these targets below 1 GHz. None of the targets was identified as a synchrotron radio emitter in these radio bands. If some synchrotron emission is produced in these systems, the non-detection with uGMRT can be most likely attributed to strong free-free absorption (FFA). This is especially relevant for WR 98a, which is catalogued as a particle accelerator based on previous measurements at higher radio frequencies. We discuss how the prominence of FFA constitutes a severe obstacle to identifying particle accelerators in the radio domain.</description>

      <title>Properties of sunspot light bridges on a geometric height scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating light bridges (LBs) helps us comprehend key aspects of sunspots. However, few studies have analyzed the properties of LBs in terms of the geometric height, which is a more realistic perspective given the corrugation of the solar atmosphere. We aim to shed light on LBs by studying the variation in their physical properties with geometric height. We used the SICON code to infer the physical quantities in terms of the optical depth and the Wilson depression values of three LBs hosted by a sunspot observed with Hinode/SP in the Fe I 630 nm pair lines. We also used SIR inversions to cross-check the height variation of the field inclination in the LBs. In both output sets, we performed linear interpolation to convert the physical parameters from optical depth into a geometric height scale in each pixel. We classified each LB as filamentary, grainy, or umbral. They appear as ridges that reach different maximum heights, with the umbral LB being the deepest. While the filamentary LB hosts a plasma inflow from the penumbra, the results for the grainy LB are compatible with an injection of hot plasma through convective cells of reduced field strength. Only a few positions reveal hints suggesting a cusp-like magnetic canopy. Moreover, strong gradients in the magnetic field strength and inclination usually exhibit enhanced electric currents, with the filamentary LB having remarkably strong currents that appear to be related to chromospheric events. The height stratification in filamentary and grainy LBs differ, indicating diverse mechanisms at work. Our results are in general incompatible with a magnetic canopy scenario, and further analysis is needed to confirm whether it exists along the entire LB or only at specific locations. Furthermore, this work assesses the usefulness of SICON when determining the height stratification of solar structures.</description>

      <title>Improving Radial Velocities by Marginalizing over Stars and Sky: Achieving 30 m/s RV Precision for APOGEE in the Plate Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radial velocity catalog from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) is unique in its simultaneously large volume and high precision as a result of its decade-long survey duration, multiplexing (600 fibers), and spectral resolution of $R \sim 22,500$. However, previous data reductions of APOGEE have not fully realized the potential radial velocity (RV) precision of the instrument. Here we present an RV catalog based on a new reduction of all 2.6 million visits of APOGEE DR17 and validate it against improved estimates for the theoretical RV performance. The core ideas of the new reduction are the simultaneous modeling of all components in the spectra, rather than a separate subtraction of point estimates for the sky, and a marginalization over stellar types, rather than a grid search for an optimum. We show that this catalog, when restricted to RVs measured with the same fiber, achieves noise-limited precision down to 30 m/s and delivers well-calibrated uncertainties. We also introduce a general method for calibrating fiber-to-fiber constant RV offsets and demonstrate its importance for high RV precision work in multi-fiber spectrographs. After calibration, we achieve 47 m/s RV precision on the combined catalog with RVs measured with different fibers. This degradation in precision relative to measurements with only a single fiber suggests that refining line spread function models should be a focus in SDSS-V to improve the fiber-unified RV catalog.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Crab supernova is interesting because we know that it was not a binary at death, the outcome was a neutron star, and because of the supernova remnant's apparently low energy and mass. Using Gaia EDR3 parallaxes and photometry, we examine the stellar population local to the Crab in a cylinder with a projected radius of 100 pc and parallax range $0.427 &lt; \varpi &lt; 0.619$ mas set by the uncertainties in the Crab's parallax. We also individually model the most luminous stars local to the Crab. The two most luminous stars are blue, roughly main sequence stars with masses of $\sim11 M_{\odot}$. We estimate the stellar population's age distribution using Solar metallicity PARSEC isochrones. The estimated age distribution of the 205 $M_{G} &lt; 0$ stars modestly favor lower mass stars consistent with an AGB star or a lower mass binary merger as the progenitor, but we cannot rule out higher masses. This may be driven by contamination due to the $\sim700$ pc length of the cylinder in distance.</description>

      <title>The physical mechanism of the streaming instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The main hurdle of planet formation theory is the metre-scale barrier. One of the most promising ways to overcome it is via the streaming instability (SI). Unfortunately, the mechanism responsible for the onset of this instability remains mysterious. It has recently been shown that the SI is a Resonant Drag Instability (RDI) involving inertial waves. We build on this insight and clarify the physical picture of how the SI develops, while bolstering this picture with transparent mathematics. Like all RDIs, the SI is built on a feedback loop: in the `forward action', an inertial wave concentrates dust into clumps; in the `backward reaction', those drifting dust clumps excite an inertial wave. Each process breaks into two mechanisms, a fast one and a slow one. At resonance, each forward mechanism can couple with a backward mechanism to close a feedback loop. Unfortunately, the fast-fast loop is stable, so the SI uses the fast-slow and slow-fast loops. Despite this last layer of complexity, we hope that our explanation will help understand how the SI works, in which conditions it can grow, how it manifests itself, and how it saturates.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Metal-Poor Red Giant Star with the Highest Ultra-Lithium Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.02184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.02184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 2MASS J05241392-0336543 (hereafter J0524-0336), a very metal-poor ([Fe/H]=-2.43 +- 0.16), highly r-process-enhanced ([Eu/Fe]= +1.34 +- 0.10) Milky Way halo field red giant star, with an ultra high Li abundance of A(Li)(3D,NLTE)= 6.15 +- 0.25 and [Li/Fe]= +7.64 +- 0.25, respectively. This makes J0524-0336 the most lithium-enhanced giant star discovered to date. We present a detailed analysis of the star's atmospheric stellar parameters and chemical abundance determinations. Additionally, we detect indications of infrared excess, as well as observe variable emission in the wings of the H_alpha absorption line across multiple epochs, indicative of a potential enhanced mass-loss event with possible outflows. Our analysis reveals that J0524-0336 lies either between the bump and the tip of the Red Giant Branch (RGB), or on the early-Asymptotic Giant Branch (e-AGB). We investigate the possible sources of lithium enrichment in J0524-0336, including both internal and external sources. Based on current models and on the observational evidence we have collected, our study shows that J0524-0336 may be undergoing the so-called lithium flash that is expected to occur in low-mass stars when they reach the RGB bump and/or the early-AGB.</description>

      <title>Transverse oscillations in 3D along Ca II K bright fibrils in the solar chromosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.14089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.14089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fibrils in the solar chromosphere carry transverse oscillations as determined from non-spectroscopic imaging data. They are estimated to carry an energy flux of several $\mathrm{kW~m}^{-2}$, which is a significant fraction of the average chromospheric radiative energy losses. We aim to determine oscillation properties of fibrils not only in the plane-of-the-sky (horizontal) direction, but also along the line-of-sight (vertical) direction. We obtained imaging-spectroscopy data in $\mathrm{Fe~I}$, $\mathrm{Ca~II~IR}$, and $\mathrm{Ca~II~K}$ with the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope. We created a sample of 605 bright $\mathrm{Ca~II~K}$ fibrils and measured their horizontal motions. Their vertical motion was determined through non-LTE inversion of the observed spectra. We determined the periods and velocity amplitudes of the fibril oscillations, as well as phase differences between vertical and horizontal oscillations in the fibrils. The bright $\mathrm{Ca~II~K}$ fibrils carry transverse waves with a mean period of $2.1\times10^2~$s, and a horizontal velocity amplitude of 1$~\mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$, consistent with earlier results. The mean vertical velocity amplitude is 1.1$~\mathrm{km~s}^{-1}$. We find that 77% of the fibrils carry waves in both the vertical and horizontal directions, and 80% of this subsample exhibits oscillations with similar periods in both horizontal and vertical directions. For the latter, we find that all phase differences between $0$ and $2\pi$ occur, with a mild but significant preference for linearly polarized waves (phase difference of $0$ or $\pi$). The results are consistent with the scenario where transverse waves are excited by granular buffeting at the photospheric footpoints of the fibrils. Estimates of transverse wave flux based only on imaging data are too low because they ignore the contribution of the vertical velocity.</description>

      <title>Seeds and Sequences of Element Abundances in Solar Energetic Particle Events</title>

Abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs) in the small "impulsive" events, primarily accelerated during magnetic reconnection in solar jets, have strong enhancements of the abundances of increasingly heavy elements. In contrast, the shock acceleration of ambient coronal plasma in most large "gradual" SEP events produces flat or decreasing abundances vs. element mass-to-charge ratios A/Q. However, heavy-ion enhancements in the largest gradual SEP events can occur in two ways: (1) strong streaming of protons away from the shock amplifies Alfven waves that preferentially scatter and retard protons near the shock while increasingly-heavy ions can leak out, and (2) strong shock waves re-accelerate SEPs fed from persistent impulsive SEP events streaming from some active regions, with their pre-enhanced heavy ions becoming dominant. Power-law fits of abundance enhancements vs. A/Q can distinguish the latter events by the presence of both impulsive and coronal-seed components, and the best-fit charges Q define characteristic source temperatures. Intense impulsively-seeded events can occur in sequences fed from a single persistent active-region as it rotates across the disk of the Sun. Three week-long event sequences, each producing two or three very large events, occur early in the strong solar-cycle 23. The weak solar-cycle 24, produces only one impulsively-seeded event sequence - perhaps a dearth of both impulsive seeds and sufficiently strong shocks. Solar cycle 25 has produced an unusual active period of short strong impulsive events In contrast, there are other active regions where large events alternate SEPs with and without impulsively-seeded sources. We also find that events with moderate Alfven-wave trapping near the shock can release ions slowly or rapidly as a function of A/Q. This A/Q-dependent trapping acts almost as a magnetic spectrometer that separates elements in space and time.</description>

      <title>Three types of solar coronal rain during magnetic reconnection between open and closed magnetic structures</title>

Abstract: Coronal rain (CR) is a crucial part of the mass cycle between the corona and chromosphere. It includes the flare-driven CR and two types of quiescent CR separately along the non-flaring active region closed loops and along the open structures, labeled as types I, II, and III CR, respectively. Among them, types I and III CR are generally associated with magnetic reconnection. In this study, employing data taken by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the Solar Upper Transition Region Imager (SUTRI) on 2022 October 11, we report three types of CR during an interchange reconnection between open and closed magnetic filed structures above the southeastern solar limb. The open and closed structures converge, with the formation of current sheet at the interface, and reconnect. The newly-formed closed and open structures then recede from the reconnection region. During the reconnection, coronal condensation occurs along the reconnecting closed loops, and falls toward the solar surface along both loop legs as the type II CR. Subsequently, condensation happens in the newly-formed closed loops, and moves down toward the solar surface along both loop legs as the type I CR. Magnetic dips of the reconnecting open structures form during the reconnection. In the dips, condensation occurs, and propagates along the open structures toward the solar surface as the type III CR. Our results suggest that the reconnection rate may be crucial for the formation of types I and III CR during the reconnection.</description>

      <title>Planet migration in massive circumbinary discs</title>

Abstract: Most stars are in multiple systems, with the majority of those being binaries. A large number of planets have been confirmed in binary stars and therefore it is important to understand their formation and dynamical evolution. We perform simulations to investigate the migration of wide-orbit giant planets (semi-major axis 100 AU) in massive circumbinary discs (mass 0.1 M$_{\odot}$) that are marginally gravitationally unstable, using the three-dimensional Smooth Particle Hydrodynamic code SEREN. We vary the binary parameters to explore their effect on planet migration. We find that a planet in a massive circumbinary disc initially undergoes a period of rapid inward migration before switching to a slow outward migration, as it does in a circumstellar disc. However, the presence of the binary enhances planet migration and mass growth. We find that a high binary mass ratio (binary with equal mass stars) results in more enhanced outward planet migration. Additionally, larger binary separation and/or higher binary eccentricity results to a faster outward planet migration and stronger planet growth. We conclude that wide-orbit giant planets attain wider final orbits due to migration around binary stars than around single stars.</description>

      <title>The Gaia-ESO Survey: 3D dynamics of young groups and clusters from GES and Gaia EDR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first large-scale 3D kinematic study of ~2000 spectroscopically-confirmed young stars (&lt;20 Myr) in 18 star clusters and OB associations (hereafter groups) from the combination of Gaia astrometry and Gaia-ESO Survey spectroscopy. We measure 3D velocity dispersions for all groups, which range from 0.61 to 7.4 km/s (1D velocity dispersions of 0.35 to 4.3 km/s). We find the majority of groups have anisotropic velocity dispersions, suggesting they are not dynamically relaxed. From the 3D velocity dispersions, measured radii and estimates of total mass we estimate the virial state and find that all systems are super-virial when only the stellar mass is considered, but that some systems are sub-virial when the mass of the molecular cloud is taken into account. We observe an approximately linear correlation between the 3D velocity dispersion and the group mass, which would imply that the virial state of groups scales as the square root of the group mass. However, we do not observe a strong correlation between virial state and group mass. In agreement with their virial state we find that nearly all of the groups studied are in the process of expanding and that the expansion is anisotropic, implying that groups were not spherical prior to expansion. One group, Rho Oph, is found to be contracting and in a sub-virial state (when the mass of the surrounding molecular cloud is considered). This work provides a glimpse of the potential of the combination of Gaia and data from the next generation of spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Solar Wind Structures from the Gaussianity of Magnetic Magnitude</title>

Abstract: One of the primary science objectives of Parker Solar Probe (PSP) is to determine the structures and dynamics of the plasma and magnetic fields at the sources of the solar wind. However, establishing the connection between {\it in situ} measurements and structures and dynamics in the solar atmosphere is challenging: most of the magnetic footpoint mapping techniques have significant uncertainties in the source localization of a plasma parcel observed {\it in situ}, and the PSP plasma measurements suffer from a limited field of view. Therefore it is of interest to investigate whether {\it in situ} measurements can be used on their own to identify streams originating from the same structures in the corona more finely than the well known fast wind-coronal hole, slow wind-elsewhere distinction. Here we develop a novel time series visualization method \textcolor{red}{(time-frequency representation or TFR)} named Gaussianity Scalogram. Utilizing this method, by analyzing the magnetic magnitude data from both PSP and Ulysses, we successfully identify {\it in situ} structures that are possible remnants of solar atmospheric and magnetic structures spanning more than seven orders of magnitude, from years to seconds, including polar and mid-latitude coronal holes, as well as structures compatible with super-granulation , ``jetlets'' and ``picoflares''. \textcolor{red}{Furthermore, computer simulations of Alfv\'enic turbulence successfully reproduce the Gaussianization of the magnetic magnitude for locally homogeneous structures.} Building upon these discoveries, the Gaussianity Scalogram can help future studies to reveal the fractal-like fine structures in the solar wind time series from both PSP and decades-old data archive.</description>
