      <title>OpenCity: A Scalable Platform to Simulate Urban Activities with Massive LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) have long been employed to explore how individual behaviors aggregate into complex societal phenomena in urban space. Unlike black-box predictive models, ABMs excel at explaining the micro-macro linkages that drive such emergent behaviors. The recent rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to the development of LLM agents capable of simulating urban activities with unprecedented realism. However, the extreme high computational cost of LLMs presents significant challenges for scaling up the simulations of LLM agents. To address this problem, we propose OpenCity, a scalable simulation platform optimized for both system and prompt efficiencies. Specifically, we propose a LLM request scheduler to reduce communication overhead by parallelizing requests through IO multiplexing. Besides, we deisgn a "group-and-distill" prompt optimization strategy minimizes redundancy by clustering agents with similar static attributes. Through experiments on six global cities, OpenCity achieves a 600-fold acceleration in simulation time per agent, a 70% reduction in LLM requests, and a 50% reduction in token usage. These improvements enable the simulation of 10,000 agents' daily activities in 1 hour on commodity hardware. Besides, the substantial speedup of OpenCity allows us to establish a urban simulation benchmark for LLM agents for the first time, comparing simulated urban activities with real-world data in 6 major cities around the globe. We believe our OpenCity platform provides a critical infrastructure to harness the power of LLMs for interdisciplinary studies in urban space, fostering the collective efforts of broader research communities.

      <title>Heterogeneous Interaction Modeling With Reduced Accumulated Error for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical complex systems composed of interactive heterogeneous agents are prevalent in the world, including urban traffic systems and social networks. Modeling the interactions among agents is the key to understanding and predicting the dynamics of the complex system, e.g., predicting the trajectories of traffic participants in the city. Compared with interaction modeling in homogeneous systems such as pedestrians in a crowded scene, heterogeneous interaction modeling is less explored. Worse still, the error accumulation problem becomes more severe since the interactions are more complex. To tackle the two problems, this paper proposes heterogeneous interaction modeling with reduced accumulated error for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Based on the historical trajectories, our method infers the dynamic interaction graphs among agents, featured by directed interacting relations and interacting effects. A heterogeneous attention mechanism is defined on the interaction graphs for aggregating the influence from heterogeneous neighbors to the target agent. To alleviate the error accumulation problem, this paper analyzes the error sources from the spatial and temporal perspectives, and proposes to introduce the graph entropy and the mixup training strategy for reducing the two types of errors respectively. Our method is examined on three real-world datasets containing heterogeneous agents, and the experimental results validate the superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>Deploying Ten Thousand Robots: Scalable Imitation Learning for Lifelong Multi-Agent Path Finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifelong Multi-Agent Path Finding (LMAPF) is a variant of MAPF where agents are continually assigned new goals, necessitating frequent re-planning to accommodate these dynamic changes. Recently, this field has embraced learning-based methods, which reactively generate single-step actions based on individual local observations. However, it is still challenging for them to match the performance of the best search-based algorithms, especially in large-scale settings. This work proposes an imitation-learning-based LMAPF solver that introduces a novel communication module and systematic single-step collision resolution and global guidance techniques. Our proposed solver, Scalable Imitation Learning for LMAPF (SILLM), inherits the fast reasoning speed of learning-based methods and the high solution quality of search-based methods with the help of modern GPUs. Across six large-scale maps with up to 10,000 agents and varying obstacle structures, SILLM surpasses the best learning- and search-based baselines, achieving average throughput improvements of 137.7% and 16.0%, respectively. Furthermore, SILLM also beats the winning solution of the 2023 League of Robot Runners, an international LMAPF competition sponsored by Amazon Robotics. Finally, we validated SILLM with 10 real robots and 100 virtual robots in a mockup warehouse environment.</description>

      <title>EconoJax: A Fast &amp; Scalable Economic Simulation in Jax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate economic simulations often require many experimental runs, particularly when combined with reinforcement learning. Unfortunately, training reinforcement learning agents in multi-agent economic environments can be slow. This paper introduces EconoJax, a fast simulated economy, based on the AI economist. EconoJax, and its training pipeline, are completely written in JAX. This allows EconoJax to scale to large population sizes and perform large experiments, while keeping training times within minutes. Through experiments with populations of 100 agents, we show how real-world economic behavior emerges through training within 15 minutes, in contrast to previous work that required several days. To aid and inspire researchers to build more rich and dynamic economic simulations, we open-source EconoJax on Github at: https://github.com/ponseko/econojax.</description>

      <title>Improving DeFi Mechanisms with Dynamic Games and Optimal Control: A Case Study in Stablecoins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stablecoins are a class of cryptocurrencies which aim at providing consistency and predictability, typically by pegging the token's value to that of a real world asset. Designing resilient decentralized stablecoins is a challenge, and prominent stablecoins today either (i) give up on decentralization, or (ii) rely on user-owned cryptocurrencies as collateral, exposing the token to exogenous price fluctuations. In this latter category, it is increasingly common to employ algorithmic mechanisms to automate risk management, helping maintain the peg. One example of this is Reflexer's RAI, which adapts its system-internal exchange rate (redemption price) to secondary market conditions according to a proportional control law. In this paper, we take this idea of active management a step further, and introduce a new kind of control scheme based on a Stackelberg game model between the token protocol and its users. By doing so, we show that (i) we can mitigate adverse depeg events that inevitably arise in a fixed-redemption scheme such as MakerDao's DAI and (ii) generally outperform a simpler, adaptive-redemption scheme such as RAI in the task of targeting a desired market price. We demonstrate these results through extensive simulations over a range of market conditions.</description>

      <title>You Can't Always Get What You Want : Games of Ordered Preference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study noncooperative games, in which each agent's objective is composed of a sequence of ordered-and potentially conflicting-preferences. Problems of this type naturally model a wide variety of scenarios: for example, drivers at a busy intersection must balance the desire to make forward progress with the risk of collision. Mathematically, these problems possess a nested structure, and to behave properly agents must prioritize their most important preference, and only consider less important preferences to the extent that they do not compromise performance on more important ones. We consider multi-agent, noncooperative variants of these problems, and seek generalized Nash equilibria in which each agent's decision reflects both its hierarchy of preferences and other agents' actions. We make two key contributions. First, we develop a recursive approach for deriving the first-order optimality conditions of each agent's nested problem. Second, we propose a sequence of increasingly tight relaxations, each of which can be transcribed as a mixed complementarity problem and solved via existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach reliably converges to equilibrium solutions that strictly reflect agents' individual ordered preferences.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Testbed for Cognitive Radio Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Technological trends show that Radio Frequency Reinforcement Learning (RFRL) will play a prominent role in the wireless communication systems of the future. Applications of RFRL range from military communications jamming to enhancing WiFi networks. Before deploying algorithms for these purposes, they must be trained in a simulation environment to ensure adequate performance. For this reason, we previously created the RFRL Gym: a standardized, accessible tool for the development and testing of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in the wireless communications space. This environment leveraged the OpenAI Gym framework and featured customizable simulation scenarios within the RF spectrum. However, the RFRL Gym was limited to training a single RL agent per simulation; this is not ideal, as most real-world RF scenarios will contain multiple intelligent agents in cooperative, competitive, or mixed settings, which is a natural consequence of spectrum congestion. Therefore, through integration with Ray RLlib, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) functionality for training and assessment has been added to the RFRL Gym, making it even more of a robust tool for RF spectrum simulation. This paper provides an overview of the updated RFRL Gym environment. In this work, the general framework of the tool is described relative to comparable existing resources, highlighting the significant additions and refactoring we have applied to the Gym. Afterward, results from testing various RF scenarios in the MARL environment and future additions are discussed.</description>

      <title>MARCO: Multi-Agent Real-time Chat Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model advancements have enabled the development of multi-agent frameworks to tackle complex, real-world problems such as to automate tasks that require interactions with diverse tools, reasoning, and human collaboration. We present MARCO, a Multi-Agent Real-time Chat Orchestration framework for automating tasks using LLMs. MARCO addresses key challenges in utilizing LLMs for complex, multi-step task execution. It incorporates robust guardrails to steer LLM behavior, validate outputs, and recover from errors that stem from inconsistent output formatting, function and parameter hallucination, and lack of domain knowledge. Through extensive experiments we demonstrate MARCO's superior performance with 94.48% and 92.74% accuracy on task execution for Digital Restaurant Service Platform conversations and Retail conversations datasets respectively along with 44.91% improved latency and 33.71% cost reduction. We also report effects of guardrails in performance gain along with comparisons of various LLM models, both open-source and proprietary. The modular and generic design of MARCO allows it to be adapted for automating tasks across domains and to execute complex usecases through multi-turn interactions.</description>

      <title>Inverse Attention Agent for Multi-Agent System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major challenge for Multi-Agent Systems is enabling agents to adapt dynamically to diverse environments in which opponents and teammates may continually change. Agents trained using conventional methods tend to excel only within the confines of their training cohorts; their performance drops significantly when confronting unfamiliar agents. To address this shortcoming, we introduce Inverse Attention Agents that adopt concepts from the Theory of Mind, implemented algorithmically using an attention mechanism and trained in an end-to-end manner. Crucial to determining the final actions of these agents, the weights in their attention model explicitly represent attention to different goals. We furthermore propose an inverse attention network that deduces the ToM of agents based on observations and prior actions. The network infers the attentional states of other agents, thereby refining the attention weights to adjust the agent's final action. We conduct experiments in a continuous environment, tackling demanding tasks encompassing cooperation, competition, and a blend of both. They demonstrate that the inverse attention network successfully infers the attention of other agents, and that this information improves agent performance. Additional human experiments show that, compared to baseline agent models, our inverse attention agents exhibit superior cooperation with humans and better emulate human behaviors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01945v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an efficient framework using Dynnikov coordinates for homotopy-aware multi-agent path planning in planar domains that may contain obstacles. We developed a method for generating multiple homotopically distinct solutions for the multi-agent path planning problem in planar domains by combining our framework with revised prioritized planning and proved its completeness under specific assumptions. Experimentally, we demonstrated that our method is significantly faster than a method without Dynnikov coordinates. We also confirmed experimentally that homotopy-aware planning contributes to avoiding locally optimal solutions when searching for low-cost trajectories for a swarm of agents in a continuous environment.</description>

      <title>Fair Voting Outcomes with Impact and Novelty Compromises? Unraveling Biases in Electing Participatory Budgeting Winners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Participatory budgeting, as a paradigm for democratic innovations, engages citizens in the distribution of a public budget to projects, which they propose and vote for implementation. So far, voting algorithms have been proposed and studied in social choice literature to elect projects that are popular, while others prioritize on a proportional representation of voters' preferences, for instance, the rule of equal shares. However, the anticipated impact and novelty in the broader society by the winning projects, as selected by different algorithms, remains totally under-explored, lacking both a universal theory of impact for voting and a rigorous unifying framework for impact and novelty assessments. This paper tackles this grand challenge towards new axiomatic foundations for designing effective and fair voting methods. This is via new and striking insights derived from a large-scale analysis of biases over 345 real-world voting outcomes, characterized for the first time by a novel portfolio of impact and novelty metrics. We find strong causal evidence that equal shares comes with impact loss in several infrastructural projects of different cost levels that have been so far over-represented. However, it also comes with a novel, yet over-represented, impact gain in welfare, education and culture. We discuss broader implications of these results and how impact loss can be mitigated at the stage of campaign design and project ideation.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal Reward Influence Encourages Cooperation From Self-Interested Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cooperation between self-interested individuals is a widespread phenomenon in the natural world, but remains elusive in interactions between artificially intelligent agents. Instead, naive reinforcement learning algorithms typically converge to Pareto-dominated outcomes in even the simplest of social dilemmas. An emerging literature on opponent shaping has demonstrated the ability to reach prosocial outcomes by influencing the learning of other agents. However, such methods differentiate through the learning step of other agents or optimize for meta-game dynamics, which rely on privileged access to opponents' learning algorithms or exponential sample complexity, respectively. To provide a learning rule-agnostic and sample-efficient alternative, we introduce Reciprocators, reinforcement learning agents which are intrinsically motivated to reciprocate the influence of opponents' actions on their returns. This approach seeks to modify other agents' $Q$-values by increasing their return following beneficial actions (with respect to the Reciprocator) and decreasing it after detrimental actions, guiding them towards mutually beneficial actions without directly differentiating through a model of their policy. We show that Reciprocators can be used to promote cooperation in temporally extended social dilemmas during simultaneous learning.

      <title>CulturePark: Boosting Cross-cultural Understanding in Large Language Models</title>

Abstract: Cultural bias is pervasive in many large language models (LLMs), largely due to the deficiency of data representative of different cultures. Typically, cultural datasets and benchmarks are constructed either by extracting subsets of existing datasets or by aggregating from platforms such as Wikipedia and social media. However, these approaches are highly dependent on real-world data and human annotations, making them costly and difficult to scale. Inspired by cognitive theories on social communication, this paper introduces CulturePark, an LLM-powered multi-agent communication framework for cultural data collection. CulturePark simulates cross-cultural human communication with LLM-based agents playing roles in different cultures. It generates high-quality cross-cultural dialogues encapsulating human beliefs, norms, and customs. Using CulturePark, we generated 41,000 cultural samples to fine-tune eight culture-specific LLMs. We evaluated these models across three downstream tasks: content moderation, cultural alignment, and cultural education. Results show that for content moderation, our GPT-3.5-based models either match or outperform GPT-4 on datasets. Regarding cultural alignment, our models surpass GPT-4 on Hofstede's VSM 13 framework. Furthermore, for cultural education of human participants, our models demonstrate superior outcomes in both learning efficacy and user experience compared to GPT-4. CulturePark proves an important step in addressing cultural bias and advancing the democratization of AI, highlighting the critical role of culturally inclusive data in model training.

      <title>INDICT: Code Generation with Internal Dialogues of Critiques for Both Security and Helpfulness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) for code are typically trained to align with natural language instructions to closely follow their intentions and requirements. However, in many practical scenarios, it becomes increasingly challenging for these models to navigate the intricate boundary between helpfulness and safety, especially against highly complex yet potentially malicious instructions. In this work, we introduce INDICT: a new framework that empowers LLMs with Internal Dialogues of Critiques for both safety and helpfulness guidance. The internal dialogue is a dual cooperative system between a safety-driven critic and a helpfulness-driven critic. Each critic provides analysis against the given task and corresponding generated response, equipped with external knowledge queried through relevant code snippets and tools like web search and code interpreter. We engage the dual critic system in both code generation stage as well as code execution stage, providing preemptive and post-hoc guidance respectively to LLMs. We evaluated INDICT on 8 diverse tasks across 8 programming languages from 5 benchmarks, using LLMs from 7B to 70B parameters. We observed that our approach can provide an advanced level of critiques of both safety and helpfulness analysis, significantly improving the quality of output codes ($+10\%$ absolute improvements in all models).</description>

Abstract: The universe involves many independent co-learning agents as an ever-evolving part of our observed environment. Yet, in practice, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) applications are usually constrained to small, homogeneous populations and remain computationally intensive. In this paper, we study how large heterogeneous populations of learning agents evolve in normal-form games. We show how, under assumptions commonly made in the multi-armed bandit literature, Multi-Agent Policy Gradient closely resembles the Replicator Dynamic, and we further derive a fast, parallelizable implementation of Opponent-Learning Awareness tailored for evolutionary simulations. This enables us to simulate the evolution of very large populations made of heterogeneous co-learning agents, under both naive and advanced learning strategies. We demonstrate our approach in simulations of 200,000 agents, evolving in the classic games of Hawk-Dove, Stag-Hunt, and Rock-Paper-Scissors. Each game highlights distinct ways in which Opponent-Learning Awareness affects evolution.</description>
