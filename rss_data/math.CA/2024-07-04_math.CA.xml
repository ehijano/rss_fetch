      <title>Solving Moving Sofa Problem Using Calculus of Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1966, Leo Moser introduced the "moving sofa problem," which seeks to determine the largest area of a shape that can be maneuvered through a 90-degree hallway of unit-width. This problem remains unsolved and open yet. In this paper, we employ calculus of variations method to solve this problem. Assuming the trajectories and envelopes are convex, the sofa's area is formulated as an integral functional on a set of parametric equations for curves. The final shape is determined by solving the Euler-Lagrange equations. Utilizing numerical methods, we obtain the non-trivial area of 2.2195316, consistent with the previously well-known Gerver's constant since 1992. We prove that both the results of Gerver's sofa and Romik's car satisfy the Euler-Lagrange equations for the necessary condition of maximal area. We also explore additional cases and asymmetric conditions, and discuss other variant problems.</description>

      <title>Quadratic differential equations in two variables free of movable critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ordinary differential equations in the complex domain, and investigate the absence of movable critical points (the Painlev\'e property) for systems of non-autonomous polynomial quadratic differential equations in two variables. We classify the systems having this property by studying, when it is possible, some obstructions described by Malmquist, and by reducing them to second-order equations of the first degree in one variable, for which the analysis of Painlev\'e and Gambier can be applied. We find that, in many cases, overcoming Malmquist's obstructions guarantees the absence of movable critical points.</description>

      <title>Counting Rational Points In Non-Isotropic Neighborhoods of Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we initiate the study of the number of rational points with bounded denominators, contained in a non-isotropic $\delta_1\times\ldots\times \delta_R$ neighborhood of a compact submanifold $\mathcal{M}$ of codimension $R$ in $\mathbb{R}^{M}$. We establish an upper bound for this counting function which holds when $\mathcal{M}$ satisfies a strong curvature condition, first introduced by Schindler-Yamagishi in \cite{schindler2022density}. Further, even in the isotropic case when $\delta_1=\ldots=\delta_R=\delta$, we obtain an asymptotic formula which holds beyond the range of distance to $\mathcal{M}$ established in \cite{schindler2022density}. Our result is also a generalization of the work of J.J. Huang \cite{huangduke} for hypersurfaces.
  As an application, we establish for the first time an upper bound for the Hausdorff dimension of the set of weighted simultaneously well approximable points on a manifold $\mathcal{M}$ satisfying the strong curvature condition, which agrees with the lower bound obtained by Allen-Wang in \cite{allen2022note}. Moreover, for $R&gt;1$, we obtain a new upper bound for the number of rational points \textit{on} $\mathcal{M}$, which goes beyond the bound in an analogue of Serre's dimension growth conjecture for submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^M$ .</description>

      <title>Loomis-Whitney inequalities on corank $1$ Carnot groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we provide another way to deduce the Loomis-Whitney inequality on higher dimensional Heisenberg groups $\mathbb{H}^n$ based on the one on the first Heisenberg group $\mathbb{H}^1$ and the known nonlinear Loomis-Whitney inequality (which has more projections than ours). Moreover, we generalize the result to the case of corank $1$ Carnot groups and products of such groups. Our main tool is the modified equivalence between the Brascamp--Lieb inequality and the subadditivity of the entropy developed in arXiv:0710.0870v2.</description>

      <title>Differential equations on a $k$-dimensional torus: Poincar\'e type results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ordinary differential equations of the first order on the torus have been investigated in detail by H. Poincar\'e and A. Denjoy. The long-standing problem of generalising these results for the equations of the order $k&gt;1$ (or for the systems of equations) is both important and difficult, requiring an essentially new approach. (See, e.g., an interesting old paper by P. Bohl.)
  In this paper, we propose a new (non-Hamiltonian) and promising approach. We use Hamiltonians, that is, ordinary differential systems of equations of the first order, only for heuristics. In the main scheme and corresponding proofs we do not use these systems. Instead of differential systems, we study sets of continuous vector functions $\phi(t,\eta)$ satisfying important conditions, which follow from the analogy with the solutions in the case $k=1$. Some of our results are new even in the case $k=1.$</description>

      <title>Propagation of Waves from Finite Sources Arranged in Line Segments within an Infinite Triangular Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines the propagation of time-harmonic waves in a two-dimensional triangular lattice with a lattice constant $a = 1$. The sources are positioned along line segments within the lattice. Specifically, we investigate the discrete Helmholtz equation with a wavenumber $k \in \left( 0,2\sqrt{2} \right)$, where input data is prescribed on finite rows or columns of lattice sites. We focus on two main questions: the efficacy of the numerical methods employed in evaluating the Green's function, and the necessity of the cone condition. Consistent with a continuum theory, we employ the notion of radiating solution and establish a unique solvability result and Green's representation formula using difference potentials. Finally, we propose a numerical computation method and demonstrate its efficiency through examples related to the propagation problems in the left-handed two-dimensional inductor-capacitor metamaterial.</description>

      <title>On the stochastic selection of integral curves of a rough vector field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that for bounded, divergence-free vector fields b in L^1_{loc}((0,1];BV(\T^d;\R^d)), there exists a unique incompressible measure on integral curves of b. We recall the vector field constructed by Depauw in [Depauw, C. R. Math. Acad. Sci. Paris, 2003], which lies in the above class, and prove that for this vector field, the unique incompressible measure on integral curves exhibits stochasticity.</description>
