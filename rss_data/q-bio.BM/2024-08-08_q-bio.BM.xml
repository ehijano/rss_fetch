      <title>ProS2Vi: a Python Tool for Visualizing Proteins Secondary Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Protein Secondary Structure Visualizer ProS2Vi is a novel Python-based visualization tool designed to enhance the analysis and accessibility of protein secondary structures calculated and identified by the Dictionary of Secondary Structure of Proteins algorithm. Leveraging robust Python libraries such as Biopython for data handling, Flask, for Graphical User Interface, Jinja2, and wkhtmltopdf for visualization, ProS2Vi offers a modern and intuitive representation for visualization of the DSSP assigned secondary structures to each residue of any proteins amino acid sequence. Significant features of ProS2Vi include customizable icon colors, the number of residues per line, and the ability to export visualizations as scalable PDFs, enhancing both visual appeal and functional versatility through a user-friendly GUI. We have designed ProS2Vi specifically for secure and local operation, which significantly increases security when dealing with novel protein data.</description>

      <title>Resolving the kinetics of an ensemble of muscle myosin motors via a temperature-dependent fitting procedure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A data fitting procedure is devised and thoroughly tested to provide self-consistent estimates of the relevant mechanokinetic parameters involved in a plausible scheme underpinning the output of an ensemble of myosin II molecular motors mimicking the muscle contraction. The method builds on a stochastic model accounting for the force exerted by the motor ensemble operated both in the low and high force-generating regimes corresponding to different temperature ranges. The proposed interpretative framework is successfully challenged against simulated data, meant to mimic the experimental output of a unidimensional synthetic nanomachine powered by pure muscle myosin isoforms.</description>

      <title>CardioGenAI: A Machine Learning-Based Framework for Re-Engineering Drugs for Reduced hERG Liability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07632v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The link between in vitro hERG ion channel inhibition and subsequent in vivo QT interval prolongation, a critical risk factor for the development of arrythmias such as Torsade de Pointes, is so well established that in vitro hERG activity alone is often sufficient to end the development of an otherwise promising drug candidate. It is therefore of tremendous interest to develop advanced methods for identifying hERG-active compounds in the early stages of drug development, as well as for proposing redesigned compounds with reduced hERG liability and preserved on-target potency. In this work, we present CardioGenAI, a machine learning-based framework for re-engineering both developmental and commercially available drugs for reduced hERG activity while preserving their pharmacological activity. The framework incorporates novel state-of-the-art discriminative models for predicting hERG channel activity, as well as activity against the voltage-gated NaV1.5 and CaV1.2 channels due to their potential implications in modulating the arrhythmogenic potential induced by hERG channel blockade. We applied the complete framework to pimozide, an FDA-approved antipsychotic agent that demonstrates high affinity to the hERG channel, and generated 100 refined candidates. Remarkably, among the candidates is fluspirilene, a compound which is of the same class of drugs (diphenylmethanes) as pimozide and therefore has similar pharmacological activity, yet exhibits over 700-fold weaker binding to hERG. We envision that this method can effectively be applied to developmental compounds exhibiting hERG liabilities to provide a means of rescuing drug development programs that have stalled due to hERG-related safety concerns. We have made all of our software open-source to facilitate integration of the CardioGenAI framework for molecular hypothesis generation into drug discovery workflows.</description>
