      <title>Semi-implicit Lax-Wendroff kinetic scheme for hydrodynamic phonon transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A semi-implicit Lax-Wendroff kinetic scheme is developed for hydrodynamic phonon transport in solid materials based on the Boltzmann transport equation under the double relaxation time approximation, in which both the normal and resistive scattering processes are accounted. The trapezoidal and midpoint rules are adopted for the temporal integration of the scattering and migration terms under the framework of finite volume method, respectively. Instead of direct numerical interpolation, the kinetic equation is solved again when reconstructing the interfacial flux, in order to realize the coupling of phonon migration and scattering within a numerical time step. Specifically, the finite difference scheme is introduced and the second-order upwind or central schemes are used for the reconstruction of the interfacial distribution function and its spatial gradient. Consequently, the cell size and time step of the present method could be larger than the phonon mean free path and relaxation time in the limit of small Knudsen numbers. Numerical tests demonstrate that the present method can accurately capture multi-scale thermal conduction phenomena within different normal or resistive scattering rates.</description>

      <title>Acquiring Human-Like Mechanics Intuition from Scarce Observations via Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humans can infer accurate mechanical outcomes from only a few observations, a capability known as mechanics intuition. The mechanisms behind such data-efficient learning remain unclear. Here, we propose a reinforcement learning framework in which an agent encodes continuous physical observation parameters into its state and is trained via episodic switching across closely related observations. With merely two or three observations, the agent acquires robust mechanics intuition that generalizes accurately over wide parameter ranges, substantially beyond the training data, as demonstrated on the brachistochrone and a large-deformation elastic plate. We explain this generalization through a unified theoretical view: it emerges when the learned value function enforces Bellman consistency across neighboring task parameters, rendering the Bellman residual stationary with respect to physical variations. This induces a smooth policy that captures a low-dimensional solution manifold underlying the continuum of tasks. Our work establishes episodic switching as a principled route to artificial mechanics intuition and offers a theoretical link to similar generalization abilities in biological learners.</description>

      <title>Phase analysis of Ising machines and their implications on optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08533v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines, which are dynamical systems designed to operate in a parallel and iterative manner, have emerged as a new paradigm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Despite computational advantages, the quality of solutions depends heavily on the form of dynamics and tuning of parameters, which are in general set heuristically due to the lack of systematic insights. Here, we focus on optimal Ising machine design by analyzing phase diagrams of spin distributions in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model. We find that that the ground state can be achieved in the phase where the spin distribution becomes binary, and optimal solutions are produced where the binary phase and gapless phase coexist. Our analysis shows that such coexistence phase region can be expanded by carefully placing a digitization operation, giving rise to a family of superior Ising machines, as illustrated by the proposed algorithm digCIM.</description>

      <title>Accelerated Inorganic Electrides Discovery by Generative Models and Hierarchical Screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electrides are exotic compounds in which excess electrons occupy interstitial regions of the crystal lattice and serve as anions, exhibiting exceptional properties such as low work function, high electron mobility, and strong catalytic activity. Although they show promise for diverse applications, identifying new electrides remains challenging due to the difficulty of achieving energetically favorable electron localization in crystal cavities. Here, we present an accelerated materials discovery framework that combines physical principles, diffusion-based materials generation with hierarchical thermodynamic and electronic structure screening. Using this workflow, we systematically explored 1,510 binary and 6,654 ternary chemical compositions containing excess valence electrons from electropositive alkaline, alkaline-earth, and early transition metals, and then filtered them with a high throughput validation on both thermodynamical stability and electronic structure analysis. As a result, we have identified 264 new electron rich compounds within 0.05 eV/atom above the convex hull at the density functional theory (DFT) level, including 13 thermodynamically stable electrides. Our approach demonstrates a generalizable strategy for targeted materials discovery in a vast chemical space.</description>

      <title>Multiple binding modes of AKT on PIP$_3$-containing membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is triggered by recruitment of AKT to cellular membranes. Although AKT is a multidomain serine/threonine kinase composed of an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and a C-terminal kinase domain, how these domains cooperate to regulate AKT activation on membranes remains unclear at the molecular level. Here, using molecular dynamics simulations of full-length AKT on PIP$_3$-containing lipid bilayers, we identify four distinct membrane-binding modes that differ in the orientations and membrane contacts of the PH and kinase domains. In addition to PIP$_3$ binding to the PH domain, we observe specific PIP$_3$ interactions with basic residues in the kinase domain. In the most stable mode, PIP$_3$ interacts with both the canonical and a secondary binding site in the PH domain, while the kinase domain adopts an orientation in which the activation-loop phosphorylation site is exposed to the solvent. Interestingly, the populations of these binding modes depend on the PIP$_3$ concentration in the membrane, leading to changes in the preferred orientation of AKT. These findings shed light on how lipid recognition by the PH domain and the kinase domain of AKT cooperatively shape its membrane-bound conformations.</description>

      <title>Dynamically training machine-learning-based force fields for strongly anharmonic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) force fields have emerged as a powerful tool for computing materials properties at finite temperatures, particularly in regimes where traditional phonon-based perturbation theories fail or cannot be extended beyond the harmonic approximation. These approaches offer accuracy comparable to ab initio molecular dynamics (MD), but at a fraction of the computational cost. However, their reliability critically depends on the quality and representativeness of the training data. In particular, static training datasets often lead to failure when the force field encounters previously unseen atomic configurations during MD simulations. In this work, we present a framework for dynamically training ML force fields and demonstrate its effectiveness across materials with varying degrees of anharmonicity, including cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs), silicon (Si), and tin selenide (SnSe). Our method builds on the conventional lattice dynamics expansion of total energy and incorporates Bayesian error estimation to guide adaptive data acquisition during simulation. Specifically, we show that trajectory-averaged Bayesian errors enable efficient and targeted exploration of the configuration space, significantly enhancing the robustness and transferability of the resulting force fields. We further demonstrate how Bayesian error estimation can be applied to determine the convergence of the dynamic training without requiring additional ab initio data. This proposed framework offers a practical and easily implementable scheme to improve the training process, which is the most critical step in developing reliable ML force fields.</description>

      <title>High-precision Dynamic Monte Carlo Study of Rigidity Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rigidity percolation provides an important basis for understanding the onset of mechanical stability in disordered materials. While most studies on the triangular lattice have focused on static properties at fixed bond~(site) occupation probabilities, the dynamics of the rigidity transition remain less explored. In this work, we formulate a dynamic pebble game algorithm that monitors how rigid clusters emerge and evolve as bonds are added sequentially to an empty lattice, with computational efficiency comparable to the standard static pebble game. We uncover a previously overlooked temporal self-similarity exhibited in multiple quantities, including the cluster size changes and merged cluster sizes during bond addition, as well as the number of simultaneously merging clusters. We identify large-scale cascade events in which a single bond addition triggers the merger of an extensive number of clusters that scales with system size with inverse correlation-length exponent. Using an event-based ensemble approach, we obtain high-precision estimates of the critical point $p_c = 0.660\,277\,8(10)$, the inverse correlation-length exponent $1/\nu = 0.850(3)$, and the fractal dimension $d_f = 1.850(2)$, representing substantial improvements over existing values.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid semi-Lagrangian Flow Mapping Approach for Vlasov Systems: Combining Iterative and Compositional Flow Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a hybrid semi-Lagrangian scheme for the Vlasov--Poisson equation that combines the Numerical Flow Iteration (NuFI) method with the Characteristic Mapping Method (CMM). Both approaches exploit the semi-group property of the underlying diffeomorphic flow, enabling the reconstruction of solutions through flow maps that trace characteristics back to their initial positions. NuFI builds this flow map iteratively, preserving symplectic structure and conserving invariants, but its computational cost scales quadratically with time. Its advantage lies in a compact, low-dimensional representation depending only on the electric field. In contrast, CMM achieves low computational costs when remapping by composing the global flow map from explicitly stored submaps. The proposed hybrid method merges these strengths: NuFi is employed for accurate and conservative local time stepping, while CMM efficiently propagates the solution through submap composition. This approach reduces storage requirements, maintains accuracy, and improves structural properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the scheme and highlight the trade-offs between memory usage and computational cost. We benchmark against a semi-Lagrangian predictor-corrector scheme used in modern gyrokinetic codes, evaluating accuracy and conservation properties.</description>

      <title>Model density approach to Ewald summations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evaluation of the electrostatic potential is fundamental to the study of condensed phase systems. We discuss the calculation of the relevant lattice summations by Ewald-type techniques. A model charge density is introduced, that cancels multipole moments of the crystalline charge distribution up to a desired order, for accelerating convergence of the Ewald sums. The method is applicable to calculations of bulk systems, employing arbitrary unit cells in a classical or quantum context, and with arbitrary basis functions to represent the charge density. The approach clarifies a decades-old implementation in the CRYSTAL code.</description>

      <title>Description of electromagnetic fields in inhomogeneous accelerating sections. IV couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new approach to incorporating coupling elements into a generalized coupled mode theory is presented. The simplest model of coupling of a structured waveguide with an external RF power source and load through loops and transmission lines was used. Even such a simple model significantly complicated the system of coupled equations. It turned into a coupled integro-differential system of the Barbashin type with degenerate kernels. Since the integral kernels are degenerate, this system is reduced to three independent systems of differential equations. Instead of solving a system of coupled integro-differential equations, we need to find solutions to three systems of ordinary differential equations. Two systems describe the distribution of the field excited by one loop and the specified value of the excitation current in it. In the first system the loop is located at the section's input, and in the second, at the section's output. The third system does not depend on the loop parameters at all. It describes the distribution of the field excited by an electron beam in a section without loops. Based on the developed analytical model, the computer code was developed for matching the loop couplers for the uniform accelerating sections of X-band. The calculation results were used to simulate the non-uniform section. Without additional matching, we obtained an input reflection coefficient of 8E-3.</description>

      <title>MEIDNet: Multimodal generative AI framework for inverse materials design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present Multimodal Equivariant Inverse Design Network (MEIDNet), a framework that jointly learns structural information and materials properties through contrastive learning, while encoding structures via an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN). By combining generative inverse design with multimodal learning, our approach accelerates the exploration of chemical-structural space and facilitates the discovery of materials that satisfy predefined property targets. MEIDNet exhibits strong latent-space alignment with cosine similarity 0.96 by fusion of three modalities through cross-modal learning. Through implementation of curriculum learning strategies, MEIDNet achieves ~60 times higher learning efficiency than conventional training techniques. The potential of our multimodal approach is demonstrated by generating low-bandgap perovskite structures at a stable, unique, and novel (SUN) rate of 13.6 %, which are further validated by ab initio methods. Our inverse design framework demonstrates both scalability and adaptability, paving the way for the universal learning of chemical space across diverse modalities.</description>

      <title>Near Real-time Full-wave Inverse Design of Electromagnetic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18054v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inverse design enables automating the discovery and optimization of devices achieving performance significantly exceeding that of traditional human-engineered designs. However, existing methodologies to inverse-design electromagnetic devices require computationally expensive and time-consuming full-wave electromagnetic simulation at each iteration or generation of large datasets for training neural-network surrogate models. This work introduces the Precomputed Numerical Green Function method, an approach for ultrafast electromagnetic inverse design. The static components of the design are incorporated into a numerical Green function obtained from a single fully-parallelized precomputation step, reducing the cost of evaluating candidate designs during optimization to only being proportional to the size of the region under modification. A low-rank matrix update technique is introduced that further decreases the cost of the method to milliseconds per iteration without any approximations or compromises in accuracy. This method is shown to have linear time complexity, reducing the total runtime for an inverse design by several orders of magnitude compared to using conventional electromagnetics solvers. The design examples considered demonstrate speedups of up to 16,000x, shortening the design process from multiple days to weeks down to minutes. The approach enables practical and ultrafast design of complex structures that are prohibitively time-consuming for prior inverse design methods.</description>

      <title>Universal Generalization Theory for Physical Intuitions from Small Artificial Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physical intuitions are native functions from human brains, yet the understanding of how physical intuitions are formulated has remained elusive. In this Letter, we propose a mechanism that simulates how human brain can quickly develop intuitional understandings from limited observations. Conceiving a training algorithm adapted from the well-known variational principle in physics, small artificial neural networks can possess strong physical intuitions that master the problems of brachistochrone and quantum harmonic oscillators, by learning from a few highly similar samples. Our simulations suggest that the variational principle is the governing mechanism for artificial physical intuitions. This generalization is explained by a unified theory: it arises when the network approximates a solution manifold where the Euler-Lagrange operator is stationary with respect to observation features. Our theory also rationalizes that there is a threshold of artificial neural network size below which satisfactory physical intuitions are not possible. Our work offers insights into how strong physical intuition can be formulated as humans or as artificial intelligences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03924v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive exact, universal, closed-form quantum Monte Carlo estimators for finite-temperature energy susceptibility and fidelity susceptibility, applicable to essentially arbitrary Hamiltonians. Combined with recent advancements in Monte Carlo, our approach enables a black-box framework for studying quantum phase transitions--without requiring prior knowledge of an order parameter or the manual design of model-specific ergodic quantum Monte Carlo update rules. We demonstrate the utility of our method by applying a single implementation to the transverse-field Ising model, the XXZ model, and an ensemble of models related by random unitaries.</description>

Abstract: Discovering explicit physical laws has traditionally depended on human intuition and domain expertise. Recent advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), offer a new route to accelerate this process by automating key steps from hypothesis generation to interpretable model construction. Here we develop an LLM-based multi-agent framework for physical-law discovery that integrates literature-guided variable selection, hypothesis formulation, symbolic regression, formula derivation, and mechanistic explanation. We validate the framework on three representative materials problems: the glass-forming ability (GFA) of metallic glasses, the Vickers hardness of compounds, and the Young's modulus of multi-component alloys. Using physically and chemically meaningful descriptors as inputs, the discovered formulas achieve strong agreement with reference data, with correlation coefficients up to 0.94 (GFA), 0.86 (hardness), and 0.94 (Young's modulus), while remaining compact and interpretable. Beyond fitting, the Young's modulus formula generalizes to quaternary and quinary alloys, improving prediction accuracy by up to 78.8% relative to the classical rule of mixtures. By integrating cross-disciplinary knowledge, reflection mechanisms, and expert-like reasoning ability into symbolic regression, our AI-centric framework offers a robust and extensible platform for automated physical laws discovery, demonstrating that AI can increasingly serve as an essential role in modern scientific research by thinking and acting like field experts.</description>

      <title>Advanced measurement techniques in quantum Monte Carlo: The permutation matrix representation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07295</link>

Abstract: In a typical finite temperature quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulation, estimators for simple static observables such as specific heat and magnetization are known. With a great deal of system-specific manual labor, one can sometimes also derive more complicated non-local or even dynamic observable estimators. Within the permutation matrix representation (PMR) flavor of QMC, however, we show that one can derive formal estimators for arbitrary static observables. We also derive exact, explicit estimators for general imaginary-time correlation functions and non-trivial integrated susceptibilities thereof. We demonstrate the practical versatility of our method by estimating various non-local, random observables for the transverse-field Ising model on a square lattice.</description>

      <title>Deriving effective electrode-ion interactions from free-energy profiles at electrochemical interfaces</title>

Abstract: Understanding ion adsorption at electrified metal-electrolyte interfaces is essential for accurate modeling of electrochemical systems. Here, we systematically investigate the free energy profiles of Na$^+$, Cl$^-$, and F$^-$ ions at the Au(111)-water interface using enhanced sampling molecular dynamics with both classical force fields and machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). Our classical metadynamics results reveal a strong dependence of predicted ion adsorption on the Lennard-Jones parameters, highlighting that --without due care-- standard mixing rules can lead to qualitatively incorrect descriptions of ion-metal interactions. We present a systematic methodology for tuning the cross-term LJ parameters to control adsorption energetics in agreement with more accurate models. As a surrogate for an ab initio model, we employed the recently released Universal Models for Atoms (UMA) MLIP, which validates classical trends and displays strong specific adsorption for chloride, weak adsorption for fluoride, and no specific adsorption for sodium, in agreement with experimental and theoretical expectations. By integrating molecular-level adsorption free energies into continuum models of the electric double layer, we show that specific ion adsorption substantially alters the interfacial ion population, the potential of zero charge, and the differential capacitance of the system. Our results underscore the critical importance of force field parameterization and advanced interatomic potentials for the predictive modeling of ion-specific effects at electrified interfaces and provide a robust framework for bridging molecular simulations and continuum electrochemical models.</description>

      <title>MORPH: PDE Foundation Models with Arbitrary Data Modality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21670v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce MORPH, a modality-agnostic, autoregressive foundation model for partial differential equations (PDEs). MORPH is built on a convolutional vision transformer backbone that seamlessly handles heterogeneous spatiotemporal datasets of varying data modality (1D--3D) at different resolutions, and multiple fields with mixed scalar and vector components. The architecture combines (i) component-wise convolution, which jointly processes scalar and vector channels to capture local interactions, (ii) inter-field cross-attention, which models and selectively propagates information between different physical fields, (iii) axial attentions, which factorize full spatiotemporal self-attention along individual spatial and temporal axes to reduce computational burden while retaining expressivity. We pretrain multiple model variants on a diverse collection of heterogeneous PDE datasets and evaluate transfer to a range of downstream prediction tasks. Using both full-model fine-tuning and parameter-efficient low-rank adapters, MORPH outperforms models trained from scratch. Across extensive evaluations, MORPH matches or surpasses strong baselines and recent state-of-the-art models. Collectively, these capabilities present a flexible and powerful backbone for learning from the heterogeneous and multimodal nature of scientific observations, charting a path toward scalable and data-efficient scientific machine learning. The source code, datasets, and models are publicly available at https://github.com/lanl/MORPH.</description>

      <title>The seeding method: A test case for classical nucleation theory in small systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are widely used to investigate nucleation in first-order phase transitions. Brute-force simulations, though popular, are limited to conditions of high metastability, where the critical cluster and the nucleation barrier are small. The seeding method has recently emerged as a powerful alternative for exploring lower supersaturation regimes by initiating simulations with a pre-formed nucleus. In confined systems (NVT ensemble), the seeded simulations are particularly effective for determining stable cluster properties and provide a stringent test case for classical nucleation theory (CNT). In this work, we perform NVT seeded simulations of Lennard-Jones condensation in small systems and compare them with CNT predictions based on several thermodynamic models, including equations of state, perturbation theory, and ideal gas approximation. We find that CNT accurately predicts stable cluster radii across a wide range of conditions. Notably, even the very simple ideal gas approximation proves useful for initializing seeded simulations. Furthermore, seeded simulation results correspond to the critical cluster radii of infinite systems: CNT predictions with good equations of state show very good agreement with simulations, while the perturbation theory and the ideal gas approximation perform well at low temperatures but deviate significantly at high temperatures.</description>
