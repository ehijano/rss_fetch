      <title>Advances in aviation radiation mitigation were demonstrated during the Gannon storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The validation of a strategy for aviation radiation hazard mitigation in development for decades has been completed using two commercial airline flights in 2024 and 2025. This article provides a historical review of the primary elements leading to that strategy, including the building of aviation radiation awareness and collaborative efforts by global aviation and radiological bodies that established mitigation standards. The validation of an ALARA strategy was accomplished using two UAL 990 flights on B777 200 aircraft between San Francisco and Paris. Each carried the same ARMAS FM7 radiation monitoring unit, where one flight occurred during the extreme geomagnetic storm (Gannon storm) May 10 to 11, 2024 and one flight occurred during quiet geomagnetic conditions June 8 to 9, 2025. The flight results validated the strategy using the ALARA principle in an area that is under operational control during extreme space weather, i.e., applying shielding from two domains to reduce dose. One method is flying lower magnetic latitudes to gain more Earth magnetic field shielding and the other is flying lower altitudes to use atmosphere depth shielding. Both of these ALARA shielding methods are controllable in airline operations and air traffic management and have now been validated with total dose measurements by ARMAS. This study shows the effectiveness of the strategy to deviate flight paths to lower magnetic latitude routes and lower altitudes during major geomagnetic storms. Not only does this approach mitigate HF communication outages but it also reduces risks from increased GNSS errors for takeoff and landing navigation. Magnetic field shielding is a major risk reduction factor for radiation, communication, and navigation while altitude shielding substantially reduces radiation hazard risks.</description>

      <title>Self-organization of earth's inner magnetospheric multi-ion plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-organization of a magnetized multi-ion plasma, composed of inertialess electrons and inertial H+, He+, and O+ ions, leads to the formation of quadruple Beltrami (QB) field structures. The QB self-organized state is a linear combination of four single Beltrami fields, and it is a non-force-free state that shows strong magnetofluid coupling. Moreover, the QB state is characterized by four relaxed state structures of different length scales. The investigation reveals that the generalized helicities of plasma species and the densities of ion species have a significant impact on the characteristics of the self-organized vortices in the QB state. The study also highlights the potential consequences of QB field structures on earth's inner magnetosphere, including diamagnetic and paramagnetic trends as well as heating effects resulting from disparate length scales.</description>

      <title>Inverse Velocity Dispersion of Solar Energetic Protons Observed by Solar Orbiter and Its Shock Acceleration Explanation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The particle acceleration and transport process during solar eruptions is one of the critical and long-standing problems in space plasma physics. Through decades of research, it is well accepted that particles with higher energies released during a solar eruption arrive at observers earlier than the particles with lower energies, forming a well-known structure in the dynamic energy spectrum called particle velocity dispersion (VD), as frequently observed by space missions. However, this picture is challenged by new observations from NASA's Parker Solar Probe and ESA's Solar Orbiter which show an unexpected inverse velocity dispersion (IVD) phenomenon, where particles with higher-energies arrive later at the observer. Facing on the challenge, we here report the recent discovery of such IVD structures with 10 solar energetic proton events observed by Solar Orbiter, and then analyze the mechanisms causing this unusual phenomenon. We suggest that shock diffusive acceleration, with respect to magnetic reconnection, is probably a dominant mechanism to accelerate protons to tens of MeV in such events where particles need longer time to reach higher energies. And we determine, innovatively, the physical conditions and time scales during the actual shock acceleration process that cannot be observed directly.</description>
