      <title>Dual Topology as a Fingerprint of Relativistic Altermagnetism in AgF$_2$ Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets have emerged as a fertile ground for quantum phenomena, but topological phases unifying different quasiparticles remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that monolayer AgF$_2$ hosts a dual topological state, driven by a single ferroelastic distortion. This polar transition breaks inversion symmetry and unleashes relativistic spin-orbit effects, simultaneously imparting non-trivial topology to electrons and magnons. The result is valence bands with opposite Chern numbers, $C^E=\pm3$, and a magnon spectrum with a full topological gap and chiral bands, $C^M=\pm1$. This work realizes topological altermagnonics in a tangible material platform, with a clear experimental fingerprint in the transverse thermal Hall effect. The coexistence of fermionic and bosonic topology in AgF$_2$ opens new directions for designing intrinsically hybrid quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Strong Correlation Driven Quadrupolar to Dipolar Exciton Transitions in a Trilayer Moir\'e Superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The additional layer degree of freedom in trilayer moir\'e superlattices of transition metal dichalcogenides enables the emergence of novel excitonic species, such as quadrupolar excitons, which exhibit unique excitonic interactions and hold promise for realizing intriguing excitonic phases and their quantum phase transitions. Concurrently, the presence of strong electronic correlations in moir\'e superlattices, as exemplified by the observations of Mott insulators and generalized Wigner crystals, offers a direct route to manipulate these new excitonic states and resulting collective excitonic phases. Here, we demonstrate that strong exciton-exciton and electron-exciton interactions, both stemming from robust electron correlations, can be harnessed to controllably drive transitions between quadrupolar and dipolar excitons. This is achieved by tuning either the exciton density or electrostatic doping in a trilayer semiconducting moir\'e superlattice. Our findings not only advance the fundamental understanding of quadrupolar excitons but also usher in new avenues for exploring and engineering many-body quantum phenomena through novel correlated excitons in semiconducting moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Controlling resonant spin photocurrent using magnetic field; application to a magnetoelectric oxide Cr2O3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the magnon spin photocurrent in effective spin models for Cr2O3, a material known for its magnetoelectric effect. Using nonlinear response theory, we show that magnon spin current can be generated by both linearly and circularly polarized electromagnetic waves via one-magnon processes. While linearly polarized waves induce a spin current even in the absence of a static magnetic field, circularly polarized waves lead to a spin current only when a static field is present, and the current reverses its direction upon field inversion. The distinct dependence on the external magnetic field and the contrasting responses to different polarizations allow the spin photocurrent to be differentiated from competing effects such as spin pumping or inhomogeneous heating, facilitating experimental verification. These results suggest that Cr2O3 is a promising candidate for experimental studies of magnon photocurrent.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Laser-Induced Magnetic Relaxation in Artificial Spin Ice Driven by Dipolar Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is of great interest to develop methods to rapidly and effectively control the magnetic configurations in artificial spin ices, which are arrangements of dipolar coupled nanomagnets that have a variety of fascinating collective magnetic phenomena associated with them. This is not only valuable in terms of acquiring fundamental understanding but is also important for future high-performance applications. Here, we demonstrate ultrafast control of magnetic relaxation in square artificial spin ice through femtosecond laser pulsed excitation, enabling rapid access to low-energy states via dipolar interactions. Time-resolved magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements reveal that, after laser-induced demagnetization, the magnetization recovers within picoseconds. During this brief transient window, dipolar coupling drives a collective magnetic ordering. Ex-situ magnetic force microscopy confirms the emergence of extended Type I vertex domains, characteristic of ground-state ordering, thus establishing ultrafast laser-driven relaxation as a route to attain the low-energy states. Through complementary energy barrier calculations and micromagnetic simulations incorporating Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch dynamics, we elucidate the underlying mechanism: transient ultrafast demagnetization followed by rapid remagnetization that enables a dipolar-driven collective rearrangement. Moreover, a tailored decreasing-fluence laser annealing protocol is shown to enhance ground-state ordering, consistently achieving over 92% ground-state vertex populations. This work opens the way to ultrafast and spatially selective control of magnetic states in artificial spin ice for spin-based computation and memory technologies, and highlights the critical interplay of thermal fluctuations, magnetostatic coupling, and transient magnetization dynamics.</description>

      <title>Magneto-conductivity and CME in Dirac semimetals from Keldysh technique in Landau levels basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Negative magnetoresistance in Dirac semimetals is conventionally considered as a manifestation of chiral magnetic effect (CME), by means of a postulated Chiral Kinetic equation. In this paper we study magnetoconductivity in large Fermi energy Dirac semimetals, in one of which (ZrTe$_5$) the effect was observed for the first time. Starting with a Hamiltonian for a semi-realistic model of such a Dirac semimetal, we apply the Non-equilibrium Diagram Technique (NDT, or the Keldysh technique) to derive the kinetic equations, to investigate the electrons relaxation due to interaction with phonons and disorder, and, finally, to calculate the DC magnetoconductivity (the longitudinal to magnetic field component of conductivity) as a function of magnetic field strength and temperature. Finally, we compare the obtained temperature dependencies with available to us experimental data.</description>

      <title>Observation of negative orbital torque from Vanadium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present systematic investigations of orbital torques generated from the light metal $V$, revealing a negative orbital torque. We observe that the damping-like torque (DLT) per unit electric field depends on the choice of the ferromagnetic layer, with approximately seven times higher torque efficiency in $Ni/V$ as compared to $Fe_{60}Co_{20}B_{20}/V$. We find the sign of DLT per unit electric field from $V$ is opposite to that from $Pt$. These results collectively confirm the existence of negative orbital Hall effect (OHE) in $V$. Furthermore, the DLT per unit electric field increases with the $V$ layer thickness, maintaining the negative sign at all thicknesses. We also note that the DLT per unit electric field exceeds that of the $Pt$ reference samples at higher $V$ thicknesses. Through fitting using the drift-diffusion equation, we extract a high effective orbital Hall conductivity of $-(1.46 \pm 0.09)\,\frac{\hbar}{2e}\,\times 10^{5}\,\Omega^{-1}\,\mathrm{m}^{-1}$ and a long orbital diffusion length of $(13.7 \pm 0.9)\,\mathrm{nm}$ in $V$. .</description>

      <title>Mechanical Reinforcement of Graphene via Wrinkling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical cantilevers are central to nanotechnology, with ultimate sensitivity achieved at the atomic limit, where low bending rigidity makes stability the fundamental challenge. Here, we introduce a wrinkle-induced stiffening approach that enhances the bending rigidity of monolayer graphene by several orders of magnitude, enabling the fabrication of mechanically robust graphene cantilevers. When suspended over microcavities, these wrinkled membranes exhibit significant increases in both in-plane and out-of-plane stiffness, as confirmed by nanoindentation and resonance measurements, which also reveal that enhanced bending rigidity strongly influences their vibrational response. This behavior marks a transition from tension-dominated mechanics to a regime where bending effects become prominent, even in a single atomic layer. By sculpting these structures, we realize graphene cantilevers with measured bending rigidities between $10^6$ and $10^7$ eV, while maintaining femtogram-scale mass. These findings open new directions in nanomechanical sensing and cantilever-based technologies.</description>

      <title>Thermomodulated intrinsic Josephson effect in Kagome CsV3Sb5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting chiral domains associated with a time-reversal symmetry-breaking order parameter have garnered significant attention in Kagome systems. In this work, we demonstrate both the intrinsic direct-current and alternating-current Josephson effects in the nanoplates of the vanadium-based Kagome material CsV3Sb5, as evidenced by Fraunhofer-like patterns and Shapiro steps. Moreover, both the Fraunhofer-like patterns and Shapiro steps are modulated by thermal cycling, suggesting that the Josephson effects arise from dynamic superconducting domains. These findings may provide new insights into chiral superconductivity in CsV3Sb5 and highlight the potential of these intrinsic Josephson junctions for applications in chiral superconductor based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Autonomous conversion of particle-exchange to quantum self-oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle-exchange machines utilize electronic transport to continuously transfer heat between fermionic reservoirs. Here, we couple a quantum mechanical resonator to a particle-exchange machine hosted in a quantum dot and let the system run autonomously. This way, part of the energy exchanged between the reservoirs can be stored in the resonator in the form of self-oscillations. Our analysis goes well beyond previous works by exploring the slow transport regime and accessing arbitrarily strong dot--resonator coupling. First, we introduce a faithful measure of self-oscillations, and use it to certify that they can occur in the slow-transport regime. We furthermore show that the electrical current through the dot can be used to witness self-oscillations. Finally, we establish that, under realistic conditions, self-oscillations occur only when the machine operates as a heater. We define an experimentally measurable performance metric characterizing the efficiency of current--to--self-oscillations conversion. It reveals that, counterintuitively, strong dot--resonator coupling is detrimental to the conversion performance. The framework developed here can be readily implemented in a variety of nanoscale devices, such as a suspended carbon nanotube with an embedded quantum dot.</description>

      <title>Double excitations in molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double excitations in organic molecules have garnered significant interest as a result of their importance in singlet fission and photophysics. These excitations play a crucial role in understanding the photoexcitation processes in polyenes. To describe photoexcited states with both single and double excitation character, we use a first-principles many-body theory that combines the GW / Bethe-Salpeter equation and the configuration interaction (CI) methods. Specifically, we develop and employ two CI-based methods: screened configuration interaction singles and doubles (scrCISD) and screened configuration interaction singles with perturbative doubles (scrCIS(D)), applied to an effective many-body Hamiltonian that incorporates screening. We apply these methods to Thiel's set of molecules, which exhibit excited states predominantly characterized by single excitations with a partial double excitation character. Our results indicate that the scrCISD method systematically underestimates the excitation energies compared to the best theoretical estimates, while the scrCIS(D) method shows good agreement with these estimates. Furthermore, we used the scrCISD method to calculate the binding energies of the dominantly doubly excited correlated triplet pair states, $\mathrm{TT^1}$, in pentacene dimers, finding that the $\mathrm{TT^1}$ binding energies agree well with empirical calculations.</description>

      <title>Signatures of spin-glass superconductivity in nickelate (La, Pr, Sm)3Ni2O7 films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of Ruddlesden-Popper (R-P) nickelate superconductors under high pressure heralds a new chapter of high-transition temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity. Recently, ambient-pressure superconductivity is achieved in R-P bilayer nickelate thin films through epitaxial compressive strain, unlocking in-depth investigations into the superconducting characteristics. Here, through electrical transport study, we report the observation of spin-glass superconductivity with hysteretic magnetoresistance and glass-like dynamics in the bilayer nickelate (La, Pr, Sm)3Ni2O7 films. The superconductivity develops in a two-step transition, with onset Tc exceeding 50 K and zero-resistance Tc around 15 K. Remarkably, magnetoresistance hysteresis, indicative of time-reversal symmetry breaking, is observed exclusively during the second-step transition to zero resistance. The hysteresis is observed under both out-of-plane and in-plane magnetic fields with significant anisotropy, and exhibits coalescing minima at zero field, fundamentally distinct from trapped vortices or long-range-ordered magnetism with coercivity. Successive oxygen reductions simultaneously suppress the superconductivity and hysteresis, revealing their mutual connections to the selective electronic orbitals. The removal of magnetic field triggers spontaneous and logarithmically slow resistance relaxations in the second-step transition, signatures of glassy dynamics, indicating that the superconducting ground state is correlated with an electronic spin-glass order. Our findings uncover an unprecedented superconducting state in the nickelate superconductors, providing phenomenological and conceptual advances for future investigations on high-Tc superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Optical Spectroscopy of Nodal-Line Semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16494v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intense laser-driven nonlinear optical phenomena in two-dimensional (2D) nodal-line semimetals (NLS) exhibit complex mechanisms, particularly in the NbSi$_{x}$Te$_{2}$ material systems characterized by nonsymmorphic symmetry-protected band degeneracy. Our findings reveal how nonsymmorphic symmetry-protected band degeneracy fundamentally influences the material's nonlienar optical responses. Notably, the nonsymmorphic glide-mirror symmetry leads to the exclusive generation of odd-order harmonics from inversion-symmetry-broken NLS. Moreover, harmonics are emitted parallel and perpendicular to the driving laser's polarization. We demonstrate distinct generation mechanisms arise from intrachain and interchain processes, with their relative contributions varying significantly with the polarization of the driving laser pulse. The polarization-dependence exhibits two-fold anisotropy, with each harmonic order showing characteristic angular distributions of maximum yield. Additionally, our analysis of the ellipticity-dependence reveals an intricate interplay between interband and intraband mechanisms. These insights open new possibilities for controlling harmonic generation through precise tuning parameters of the driving laser and highlight the potentials of NLS materials to fabricate lightwave-based photonics, optoelectronic and quantum devices operating on ultrafast timescales.</description>

      <title>Chemical and Conformational Control of the Spectroscopic Properties of Multi-Layer and Multi-Defect Carbon Dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon dots (CDs) are renowned for their bright and tunable photoluminescence (PL), stability, and biocompatibility, yet it remains challenging to link their heterogeneous structures to their spectroscopic properties. This study utilizes density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) to systematically investigate how the spectroscopic properties of CDs of complex CDs with multiple layers and multiples defects are determined by their structures and compositions. Calculations reveal that strongly oxidizing groups, such as carbonyl and carbonyl acetate, significantly redshift absorption and emission spectra. In contrast, less oxidizing groups, such as hydroxyl, behave as spectators with minimal impact on absorption and emission, except when they interact strongly with more oxidizing groups. We find that not only the excitation energy, but also the excitation character itself is impacted by the presence of specific groups, and the pH-dependence of the spectroscopic properties can be attributed to their protonation state-dependent excitation character. We show that the twisting, sliding, and linker-mediated folding of surface-functionalized layers in CDs markedly alter excitation energies and characters, offering a molecular explanation for experimentally observed emission intermittency and polarization fluctuations. These insights provide strategies for optimizing CDs for various applications, including bioimaging, photocatalysis, and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Symmetry classification correspondence between quadratic Lindbladians and their steady states</title>

Abstract: Symmetry classification is crucial in understanding universal properties of quantum matter. Recently, the scope of symmetry classification has been extended to open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation. However, the classification of Lindbladians and steady states remains largely separate. Because the former requires the non-Hermitian classification framework, while the latter relies on the classification scheme for Hermitian matrices. In this paper we build connections between symmetry classes of quadratic Lindbladian and its steady state, despite their different classification frameworks. We classify the full matrix representation of generic quadratic Lindbladians with particle conservation, showing they fall into 27 non-Hermitian symmetry classes. Among these, 22 classes lead to an infinite-temperature steady state. The remaining five classes have one-to-one correspondence with five steady-state Hermitian symmetry classes. Numerical simulations of random Lindbladian dynamics confirm the convergence to the correct steady-state symmetry classes at long time.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic charge transport in extended SSH models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the topological properties of extended SSH models, considering four sub-lattices in a unit cell and second-nearest-neighbor intercell hopping for SSH4 and SSH long-range (SSHLR) models, respectively. The additional tuning parameters cause the SSH4 (SSHLR) model to host chiral symmetry protected two (two and four) zero-energy modes producing a richer phase diagram that we characterize by momentum space, periodic-bulk and open-bulk real space winding numbers. We introduce time to study charge transport in the periodically driven SSH4 and SSHLR models under the adiabatic limit. We remarkably find that the whole parameter space turned topological for a certain choice of the remaining parameters leading to always finite quantized value of pumped charge at the end of a complete cycle. Considering time as another variable, we characterize these new phases of the driven models by momentum space Chern number, periodic-bulk and open-bulk real space Bott index. We also investigate the time evolution of pumped charge for these models and connect it with the intriguing windings of the mid-gap energy levels with time. Interestingly, the maximum value of Chern number or Bott index for the driven models is more than that of the winding number associated with the static model indicating the fact that there exist more zero-energy modes during the full course of a driving cycle compared to the underlying static models. We further extend our study to the quantum metric where the fluctuations in the above quantity can identify the presence of a topological phase boundary.</description>

      <title>Impact of Broken Inversion Symmetry on Molecular States in multi-Weyl fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study inversion-symmetry (IS) breaking in impurity dimers coupled to topological multi-Weyl systems in the low-energy dispersion domain. In the IS-preserved multi-Weyl semimetal phase, Hubbard bands split into symmetric and antisymmetric molecular-like subbands. Breaking IS induces a transition to a multi-Weyl metal, lifting the degeneracy of the Weyl node and closing the pseudogap. This causes opposite energy shifts: valence-band symmetric (antisymmetric) subbands red- (blue-) shift, reversing in the conduction band until a degeneracy point. Beyond this threshold, symmetric bands flatten near band cutoffs, whereas antisymmetric bands form quasi-zero energy modes asymptotically approaching -- yet never crossing -- the Fermi level. Crucially, identical molecular symmetries maintain nondegeneracy even as energy separation vanishes with stronger IS breaking. Our results demonstrate symmetry-selective mechanisms for topological molecular states in multi-Weyl systems.</description>

      <title>Bimodal distribution of delay times and splitting of the zero-bias conductance peak in a double-barrier normal-superconductor junction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a scattering theory of the proximity effect in a weakly disordered SININ junction (S = superconductor, I = insulating barrier, N = normal metal). This allows to relate the conductance and density of states of the junction to the scattering times $\tau$ (eigenvalues of the Wigner-Smith time-delay matrix). The probability density $P(\tau)$ has two peaks, at a short time $\tau_{\rm min}$ and a late time $\tau_{\rm max}$. The density of states at the Fermi level is the geometric mean of the two times. The splitting of the zero-bias conductance peak is given by $\hbar/\tau_{\rm max}$.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast thermal boundary conductance under large temperature discontinuities of ultrathin epitaxial Pb films on Si(111)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heat transfer is a critical aspect of modern electronics, and a deeper understanding of the underlying physics is essential for building faster, smaller, and more powerful devices with an improved performance and efficiency. In such nanoscale structures, the heat transfer between two materials is limited by the finite thermal boundary conductance across their interface. Using ultrafast electron diffraction under grazing incidence we investigated the heat transfer from ultrathin epitaxial Pb films to an Si(111) substrate under strong non-equilibrium conditions. Applying an intense femtosecond laser pulse, the 5-7 ML thin Pb film experiences a strong heat up by 10-120 K while the Si substrate remains cold at $\approx$ 10 K. At such large temperature discontinuities we observe a significantly faster cooling for stronger excited Pb films. The decrease of the corresponding cooling time constant is explained through the thermal boundary conductance in the framework of the diffuse mismatch model. The thermal boundary conductance is reduced by more than a factor of three in comparison with Pb films grown on H-terminated substrates, pointing out the importance of the morphology of substrate, heterofilm and their interface.</description>

      <title>Quantum stochastic thermodynamics in the mesoscopic-leads formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a numerical method to sample the distributions of charge, heat, and entropy production in open quantum systems coupled strongly to macroscopic reservoirs, with both temporal and energy resolution and beyond the linear-response regime. Our method exploits the mesoscopic-leads formulation, where macroscopic reservoirs are modeled by a finite collection of modes that are continuously damped toward thermal equilibrium by an appropriate Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation. Focussing on non-interacting fermionic systems, we access the time-resolved full counting statistics through a trajectory unraveling of the master equation. We show that the integral fluctuation theorems for the total entropy production, as well as the martingale and uncertainty entropy production, hold. Furthermore, we investigate the fluctuations of the dissipated heat in finite-time information erasure. Conceptually, our approach extends the continuous-time trajectory description of quantum stochastic thermodynamics beyond the regime of weak system-environment coupling.</description>

Abstract: Hyperbolic lattices present a unique opportunity to venture beyond the conventional paradigm of crystalline many-body physics and explore correlated phenomena in negatively curved space. As a theoretical benchmark for such investigations, we extend Kitaev's spin-1/2 honeycomb model to hyperbolic lattices and exploit their non-Euclidean space-group symmetries to solve the model exactly. We elucidate the ground-state phase diagram on the $\{8,3\}$ lattice and find a gapped $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid with Abelian anyons, a gapped chiral spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and chiral edge states, and a Majorana metal whose finite low-energy density of states is dominated by non-Abelian Bloch states.</description>

      <title>Photon-instanton scattering in a superconducting circuit: Beyond the very high impedance regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Instantons, semi-classical trajectories of quantum tunneling in imaginary time, have long been used to study thermodynamic and transport properties in a myriad of condensed matter and high energy systems. A recent experiment in superconducting circuits [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 197701, (2021)] provided first evidence for direct dynamical signatures of instantons (phase slips), manifested by order-unity inelastic decay probabilities for photons with which they interact, motivating the development of a scattering theory of instantons [Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 137701, (2021)]. While this framework successfully predicted the measured inelastic decay rates of the photons for several experimental devices, it is valid only if the tunneling time of the instantons is much shorter than the relaxation time due to the environment in which they are embedded, and requires a closed analytical expression for the instanton trajectory. Here, we alleviate these restrictions by incorporating numerical methods that eliminate some of the previously applied approximations. Our results improve the agreement with the experimental measurements, also for devices with lower impedances and thus shorter relaxation times, without fitting parameters. This framework should be useful in many other quantum field theoretical contexts.</description>

      <title>Itinerant topological magnons and spin excitons in twisted transition metal dichalcogenides: Mapping electron topology to spin counterpart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (tTMDs) provide a highly tunable platform to explore the interplay between strong correlation and topology. Among them, the properties involving the charge degree of freedom have been extensively studied, while those related to spin are much less investigated. Motivated by the recent discovery of integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall effects in tMoTe$_2$, where the flat-band ferromagnetism is one of the essential prerequisites, we investigate theoretically the spin excitations out of the flat-band ferromagnetic ground state in tMoTe$_2$. Remarkably, we identify the itinerant magnons and spin excitons with nontrivial topology. We elaborate that the topology of these itinerant spin excitations, which are described as particle-hole bound states, inherits directly from that of the underlying electrons and is essentially different from that in local spin systems. Thus, we establish a direct relationship of the topology between the many-body excitations and their fundamental constituents. We further demonstrate that by tuning the displacement field, a topological transition for both the magnon and spin exciton happens, leading to a step-like change and bifurcation in the thermal Hall conductance, which could serve as unique and compelling evidence to be tested experimentally.</description>

      <title>Current-based metrology with two-terminal mesoscopic conductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12907v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The traditional approach to quantum parameter estimation focuses on the quantum state, deriving fundamental bounds on precision through the quantum Fisher information. In most experimental settings, however, performing arbitrary quantum measurements is highly unfeasible. In open quantum systems, an alternative approach to metrology involves the measurement of stochastic currents flowing from the system to its environment. However, the present understanding of current-based metrology is mostly limited to Markovian master equations. Considering a parameter estimation problem in a two-terminal mesoscopic conductor, we identify the key elements that determine estimation precision within the Landauer-B\"uttiker formalism. Crucially, this approach allows us to address arbitrary coupling and temperature regimes. Furthermore, we obtain analytical results for the precision in linear-response and zero-temperature regimes. For the specific parameter estimation task that we consider, we demonstrate that the boxcar transmission function is optimal for current-based metrology in all parameter regimes.</description>
