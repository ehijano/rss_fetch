      <title>In-between Transatlantic (Monetary) Disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the spillovers of European Central Bank (ECB) interest rate shocks into the Canadian economy and compares them with those of the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed). We combine a VAR model and local projection regressions with identification strategies that explicitly purge information effects around policy announcements. We find that an ECB rate hike leads to a depreciation of the Canadian dollar and a sharp contraction in economic activity. The main transmission channel is international trade: ECB shocks trigger a decline in oil prices and exports, while leaving domestic financial conditions largely unaffected. By contrast, Fed shocks tighten Canadian financial conditions significantly, with more limited effects on trade flows. These findings show that Canada is exposed to foreign monetary policy both directly and indirectly, through its integration in global financial and trade markets.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning in the Sequence Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a deep learning algorithm for approximating functional rational expectations equilibria of dynamic stochastic economies in the sequence space. We use deep neural networks to parameterize equilibrium objects of the economy as a function of truncated histories of exogenous shocks. We train the neural networks to fulfill all equilibrium conditions along simulated paths of the economy. To illustrate the performance of our method, we solve three economies of increasing complexity: the stochastic growth model, a high-dimensional overlapping generations economy with multiple sources of aggregate risk, and finally an economy where households and firms face uninsurable idiosyncratic risk, shocks to aggregate productivity, and shocks to idiosyncratic and aggregate volatility. Furthermore, we show how to design practical neural policy function architectures that guarantee monotonicity of the predicted policies, facilitating the use of the endogenous grid method to simplify parts of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Can the decoy effect increase cooperation in networks? An experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates whether the decoy effect - specifically the attraction effect - can foster cooperation in social networks. In a lab experiment, we show that introducing a dominated option increases the selection of the target choice, especially in early decisions. The effect is stronger in individual settings but persists in networks despite free-riding incentives, with variation depending on the decision-maker's strategic position.</description>

      <title>Machines are more productive than humans until they aren't, and vice versa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growth of artificial skills, organizations may increasingly confront with the problem of optimizing skill policy decisions guided by economic principles. This paper addresses the underlying complexity of this challenge by developing an in-silico framework based on Monte Carlo simulations grounded in empirical realism to analyze the economic impact of human and machine skills, individually or jointly deployed, in the execution of tasks presenting varying levels of complexity. Our results provide quantitative support for the established notions that automation tends to be the most economically-effective strategy for tasks characterized by low-to-medium generalization difficulty, while automation struggles to match the economic utility of human skills in more complex scenarios. Critically, our simulations highlight that combining human and machine skills can be the most effective strategy when a high level of generalization is required, but only if genuine augmentation is achieved. In contrast, when failing to realize this synergy, the human-machine policy is severely penalized by the inherent costs of its dual skill structure, causing it to destroy value and becoming the worst choice from an economic perspective. The takeaway for decision-makers is unambiguous: simply allocating human and machine skills to a task is insufficient, and a human-machine skill policy is neither a silver-bullet solution nor a low-risk compromise. Rather, it is a critical opportunity to boost competitiveness that demands a strong organizational commitment to enabling augmentation. Also, our findings show that improving the cost-effectiveness of machine skills over time, while useful, does not replace the fundamental need to focus on achieving augmentation.</description>

      <title>Incentivizing High Quality Entrants When Creators Are Strategic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how a platform should design early exposure and rewards when creators strategically choose quality before release. A short testing window with a pass/fail bar induces a pass probability, the slope of which is the key sufficient statistic for incentives. We derive three main results. First, a closed-form ``implementability bounty'' can perfectly align creator and platform objectives, correcting for incomplete revenue sharing. Second, front-loading guaranteed impressions is the most effective way to strengthen incentives for a given attention budget. Third, when impression and cash budgets are constrained, the optimal policy follows an equal-marginal-value rule based on the prize spread and certain exposure. We map realistic ranking engines (e.g., Thompson sampling) into the model's parameters and provide telemetry-based estimators. The framework is simple to operationalize and offers a direct, managerially interpretable solution for platforms to solve the creator cold-start problem and cultivate high-quality supply.</description>

      <title>Minimum pricing or volumetric taxation? Quantity, quality and competition effects of price regulations in alcohol markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reforming alcohol price regulations in wine-producing countries is challenging, as current price regulations reflect the alignment of cultural preferences with economic interests rather than public health concerns. We evaluate and compare the impact of counterfactual alcohol pricing policies on consumer behaviors, firms, and markets in France. We develop a micro-founded partial equilibrium model that accounts for consumer preferences over purchase volumes across alcohol categories and over product quality within categories, and for firms' strategic price-setting. After calibration on household scanner data, we compare the impacts of replacing current taxes by ethanol-based volumetric taxes with a minimum unit price (MUP) policy of 0.50 Euro per standard drink. The results show that the MUP in addition to the current tax outperforms a tax reform in reducing ethanol purchases (-15% vs. -10% for progressive taxation), especially among heavy drinking households (-17%). The MUP increases the profits of small and medium wine firms (+39%) while decreasing the profits of large manufacturers and retailers (-39%) and maintaining tax revenues stable. The results support the MUP as a targeted strategy to reduce harmful consumption while benefiting small and medium wine producers. This study provides ex-ante evidence that is crucial for alcohol pricing policies in wine-producing countries.</description>

      <title>Jihad over Centuries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the origins of Islamist insurgencies, or jihad, through the lens of past prosperity, decline, and cultural revival in West Africa. Using shrinking water sources as an instrument, we show that trans-Saharan cities once-thriving under pre-colonial Islamic states but now deserted have become contemporary hotspots of jihadist violence. We argue that military power asymmetries between Islamic states and colonizers during historical jihad shaped the persistence of jihadist ideology, fueling today's resurgence especially in areas that lacked intense armed resistance against colonial invasions. Extensive qualitative evidence, a dynamic model of conflict, and individual-level surveys examining ideologies support this mechanism.</description>

      <title>The Arrival of Fast Internet and Employment in Africa: Comment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hjort and Poulsen (2019) frames the staggered arrival of submarine Internet cables on the shores of Africa circa 2010 as a difference-in-differences natural experiment. The paper finds positive impacts of broadband on individual- and firm-level employment -- with a bias toward skilled employment -- and on nighttime light emissions. These results largely are not robust to alternative geocoding of survey locations, to correcting for a satellite changeover at end-2009, and to revisiting a definition of the treated zone that has no clear technological basis, is narrower than the spatial resolution of nearly all the data sources, and is empirically suboptimal as a representation of the geography of broadband.</description>

      <title>Trial Length, Pricing, and Rationally Inattentive Customers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The "free trial" followed by automatic renewal is a dominant business model in the digital economy. Standard models explain trials as a mechanism for consumers to learn their valuation for a product. We propose a complementary theory based on the rational inattention framework. Consumers know their valuation but face a cognitive cost to remember to cancel an unwanted subscription. We model this using a Shannon entropy-based cost of information processing, where a consumer's baseline attention level decays with the length of the trial period. This creates a novel trade-off for a monopolist firm: a longer trial increases "inattentive revenue" from consumers who fail to cancel, but it also lowers ex-ante consumer utility, making the initial offer less attractive. We show that this trade-off leads to an interior optimal trial length, even for products where value-learning is instantaneous. Our model, under standard assumptions about demand elasticity and the distribution of consumer valuations, generates sharp, testable predictions about the relationship between contract terms. We find that the optimal renewal price and trial length are complements: firms offering longer trials will also set higher post-trial prices. We analyze the impact of policies aimed at curbing consumer exploitation, such as "click-to-cancel" regulations. We show that such policies, by making attention effectively cheaper, lead firms to reduce trial lengths. The effect on price depends directly on the elasticity of demand from loyal subscribers. We also extend the model to include paid trials, showing that introductory prices and trial lengths act as strategic substitutes. Our framework provides a micro-founded explanation for common features of subscription contracts and offers a new lens through which to evaluate consumer protection policies in digital markets.</description>

      <title>Beyond pay: AI skills reward more job benefits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the non-monetary rewards associated with artificial intelligence (AI) skills in the U.S. labour market. Using a dataset of approximately ten million online job vacancies from 2018 to 2024, we identify AI roles-positions requiring at least one AI-related skill-and examine the extent to which these roles offer non-monetary benefits such as tuition assistance, paid leave, health and well-being perks, parental leave, workplace culture enhancements, and remote work options. While previous research has documented substantial wage premiums for AI-related roles due to growing demand and limited talent supply, our study asks whether this demand also translates into enhanced non-monetary compensation. We find that AI roles are significantly more likely to offer such perks, even after controlling for education requirements, industry, and occupation type. It is twice as likely for an AI role to offer parental leave and almost three times more likely to provide remote working options. Moreover, the highest-paying AI roles tend to bundle these benefits, suggesting a compound premium where salary increases coincide with expanded non-monetary rewards. AI roles offering parental leave or health benefits show salaries that are, on average, 12% to 20% higher than AI roles without this benefit. This pattern is particularly pronounced in years and occupations experiencing the highest AI-related demand, pointing to a demand-driven dynamic. Our findings underscore the strong pull of AI talent in the labor market and challenge narratives of technological displacement, highlighting instead how employers compete for scarce talent through both financial and non-financial incentives.</description>

      <title>Predicting Qualification Thresholds in UEFA's incomplete round-robin tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the 2024/25 season, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) introduced an incomplete round-robin format in the Champions League, Europa League, and Conference League, replacing the traditional group stage with a single league table of all 36 teams. Under this structure, the top eight teams advance directly to the round of 16, while those ranked 9th-24th compete in a play-off round. Simulation-based analyses, such as those by commercial data analyst Opta, provide indicative point thresholds for qualification but reveal deviations when compared with actual outcomes in the first season. To overcome these discrepancies, we employ a bivariate Dixon-Coles model that accounts for the lower frequency of draws observed in the 2024/25 UCL season, with team strengths proxied by Elo ratings. This framework enables the simulation of match outcomes and the estimation of qualification thresholds for both direct advancement and play-off participation. Our results provide scientific guidance for clubs and managers, supporting strategic decision-making under uncertainty regarding their progression prospects in the new UEFA club competition formats.</description>
