      <title>Optimal Control-Based Falsification of Learnt Dynamics via Neural ODEs and Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a falsification framework that integrates learned surrogate dynamics with optimal control to efficiently generate counterexamples for cyber-physical systems specified in signal temporal logic (STL). The unknown system dynamics are identified using neural ODEs, while known a-priori structure is embedded directly into the model, reducing data requirements. The learned neural ODE is converted into an analytical form via symbolic regression, enabling fast and interpretable trajectory optimization. Falsification is cast as minimizing STL robustness over input trajectories; negative robustness yields candidate counterexamples, which are validated on the original system. Spurious traces are iteratively used to refine the surrogate, while true counterexamples are returned as final results. Experiments on ARCH-COMP 2024 benchmarks show that this method requires orders of magnitude fewer experiments of the system under test than optimization-based approaches that do not model system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Motion Planning with Metric Temporal Logic Using Reachability Analysis and Hybrid Zonotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metric temporal logic (MTL) provides a formal framework for defining time-dependent mission requirements on autonomous vehicles. However, optimizing control decisions subject to these constraints is often computationally expensive. This article presents a method that uses reachability analysis to implicitly express the set of states satisfying an MTL specification and then optimizes to find a motion plan. The hybrid zonotope set representation is used to efficiently and conveniently encode MTL specifications into reachable sets. A numerical benchmark highlights the proposed method's computational advantages as compared to existing methods in the literature. Further numerical examples and an experimental application demonstrate the ability to address time-varying environments, region-dependent disturbances, and multi-agent coordination.</description>

      <title>Stealthy Coverage Control for Human-enabled Real-Time 3D Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel semi-autonomous image sampling strategy, called stealthy coverage control, for human-enabled 3D structure reconstruction. The present mission involves a fundamental problem: while the number of images required to accurately reconstruct a 3D model depends on the structural complexity of the target scene to be reconstructed, it is not realistic to assume prior knowledge of the spatially non-uniform structural complexity. We approach this issue by leveraging human flexible reasoning and situational recognition capabilities. Specifically, we design a semi-autonomous system that leaves identification of regions that need more images and navigation of the drones to such regions to a human operator. To this end, we first present a way to reflect the human intention in autonomous coverage control. Subsequently, in order to avoid operational conflicts between manual control and autonomous coverage control, we develop the stealthy coverage control that decouples the drone motion for efficient image sampling from navigation by the human. Simulation studies on a Unity/ROS2-based simulator demonstrate that the present semi-autonomous system outperforms the one without human interventions in the sense of the reconstructed model quality.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Data-Efficient and Robust Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A data-efficient learning-based control design method is proposed in this paper. It is based on learning a system dynamics model that is then leveraged in a two-level procedure. On the higher level, a simple but powerful optimization procedure is performed such that, for example, energy consumption in a vehicle can be reduced when hard state and action constraints are also introduced. Load disturbances and model errors are compensated for by a feedback controller on the lower level. In that regard, we briefly examine the robustness of both model-free and model-based learning approaches, and it is shown that the model-free approach greatly suffers from the inclusion of unmodeled dynamics. In evaluating the proposed method, it is assumed that a path is given, while the velocity and acceleration can be modified such that energy is saved, while still keeping speed limits and completion time. Compared with two well-known actor-critic reinforcement learning strategies, the suggested learning-based approach saves more energy and reduces the number of evaluated time steps by a factor of 100 or more.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Control of Hybrid Distribution Transformers for Simultaneous Grid Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid distribution transformers (HDTs) integrate conventional transformers with partially rated power electronic converters to improve power quality, enable advanced ancillary services and increase penetration of renewable energy sources in the national power grid. In this paper, we present an averaged mathematical model of a three-phase HDT equipped with two back-to-back voltage source converters connected in a series-shunt configuration. Cascaded PI controllers are designed in the synchronously rotating dq0 reference frame to regulate load voltage, compensate reactive power, achieve grid frequency regulation, and perform load phase balancing. Simulation results implemented in Python confirm that these simple yet effective control mechanisms allow HDTs to offer simultaneous grid services without introducing complexity. The complete model, control architecture, and implementation steps are detailed, enabling further validation and adoption.</description>

      <title>Cognitive-Flexible Control via Latent Model Reorganization with Predictive Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-enabled control systems must maintain safety when system dynamics and sensing conditions change abruptly. Although stochastic latent-state models enable uncertainty-aware control, most existing approaches rely on fixed internal representations and can degrade significantly under distributional shift. This letter proposes a \emph{cognitive-flexible control} framework in which latent belief representations adapt online, while the control law remains explicit and safety-certified. We introduce a Cognitive-Flexible Deep Stochastic State-Space Model (CF--DeepSSSM) that reorganizes latent representations subject to a bounded \emph{Cognitive Flexibility Index} (CFI), and embeds the adapted model within a Bayesian model predictive control (MPC) scheme. We establish guarantees on bounded posterior drift, recursive feasibility, and closed-loop stability. Simulation results under abrupt changes in system dynamics and observations demonstrate safe representation adaptation with rapid performance recovery, highlighting the benefits of learning-enabled, rather than learning-based, control for nonstationary cyber-physical systems.</description>

      <title>Robust Energy Shaping Control of an Underactuated Inverted Pendulum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the stabilization of underactuated systems remains a challenging problem, the total energy shaping approach provides a general framework for addressing this objective. However, the practical implementation of this method is hindered by the need to analytically solve a set of partial differential equations (PDEs), which constitutes a major obstacle. In this paper, a rotary inverted pendulum system is considered, and an interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) scheme is developed by deriving concise analytical solutions to the kinetic and potential energy PDEs. Furthermore, a novel robust term is incorporated into the control law to compensate for a specific class of disturbances that has not been addressed within the existing IDA-PBC literature. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating satisfactory control performance.</description>

      <title>Reduction of Velocity-Dependent Terms in Total Energy Shaping Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Total energy shaping through interconnection and damping assignment passivity-based control (IDA-PBC) provides a powerful and systematic framework for stabilizing underactuated mechanical systems. Despite its theoretical appeal, incorporating actuator limitations into total energy shaping remains a largely open problem, with only limited results reported in the existing literature. In practice, the closed-loop behavior of energy-shaping controllers is strongly affected by the kinetic energy shaping terms. In this paper, a simultaneous IDA-PBC (SIDA-PBC) framework is employed to systematically attenuate the kinetic energy shaping terms by exploiting generalized forces, without altering the matching partial differential equations (PDEs). The free component of the generalized forces is derived analytically via an $\ell_\infty$-norm optimization formulation. Although a reduction in kinetic energy shaping terms does not necessarily guarantee a decrease in the overall control effort, the proposed approach effectively suppresses kinetic energy shaping components and achieves a reduced control magnitude whenever such a reduction is structurally feasible. Unlike existing approaches based on gyroscopic terms, which require multiple actuators, the proposed method is applicable to mechanical systems with a single actuator. Simulation and experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Robust Adaptive Learning Control for a Class of Non-affine Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the tracking problem for a class of uncertain non-affine nonlinear systems with high relative degrees, performing non-repetitive tasks. We propose a rigorously proven, robust adaptive learning control scheme that relies on a gradient descent parameter adaptation law to handle the unknown time-varying parameters of the system, along with a state estimator that estimates the unmeasurable state variables. Furthermore, despite the inherently complex nature of the non-affine system, we provide an explicit iterative computation method to facilitate the implementation of the proposed control scheme. The paper includes a thorough analysis of the performance of the proposed control strategy, and simulation results are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Data Centers Load Risks and Enabling Grid Support Functions through Grid-Forming Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid growth of hyperscale data centers driven by Large Language Models and Artificial Intelligence workloads has introduced new challenges for power systems. These facilities experience abrupt power variations during model training and check-point-saving events, causing voltage deviations and frequency disturbances. Moreover, they operate as passive loads that draw power without offering any grid support. This paper presents an integrated architecture that combines Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) within data centers using Grid-Forming inverters to provide active grid-support functions. Simulation results through MATLAB/Simulink demonstrate accurate power reference tracking under dynamic loading, with eight coordinated BESS units supplying instantaneous power during training and saving conditions. Under single-phase voltage depression near the data center bus, the BESS delivered reactive power support similar to a Static Synchronous Compensator. During grid disconnection, seamless islanded operation was achieved with stable voltage, frequency, and continuous power delivery at the data center bus.</description>

      <title>Scientific Machine Learning for Resilient EV-Grid Planning and Decision Support Under Extreme Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure introduces complex challenges to urban distribution networks, particularly under extreme demand events. A critical barrier to resilience assessment is the scale gap between micro-level charging physics and city-scale planning: minute-resolution deliverability constraints remain invisible in hourly aggregated datasets, causing purely data-driven models to exhibit non-physical behavior in high-stress regimes. This paper develops a five-stage scientific machine learning framework bridging this gap through physics-informed knowledge transfer. Stage 1 learns a temperature-pressure deliverability surface from Swiss DC fast-charging telemetry with monotonicity constraints. Stage 2 performs cross-scale injection via anchored quantile mapping. Stage 3 deploys a dual-head spatio-temporal graph neural network for joint forecasting of demand and service loss rate. Stage 4 simulates backlog dynamics under stress shocks and evaluates policy interventions. Stage 5 couples service outcomes to distribution-grid stress via transformer loading analysis. Validation on the Shenzhen UrbanEV dataset demonstrates that physics injection restores monotone stress-to-risk response (Spearman correlation coefficient equals +1.0 versus -0.8 without injection) and improves forecasting accuracy. Under a representative demand shock, the hybrid policy reduces backlog by 79.1%, restores full service within the study horizon, and limits grid stress to only 2 additional hours. The derived resilience boundary m_crit as a function of epsilon approximately equals 1.7 minus 1.0 times epsilon, providing actionable guidance linking demand flexibility to maximum absorbable stress, enabling risk-aware emergency planning under extreme events.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sizing of Charging Energy Hubs for Heavy-Duty Electric Transport through Co-Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrification of heavy-duty vehicles places substantial stress on distribution grids, and Charging Energy Hubs (CEHs) mitigate these impacts by integrating charging infrastructure with renewable energy sources and battery storage. Optimal sizing of CEH components is therefore a critical investment decision, yet challenging because design choices depend strongly on operational dynamics. This work presents a mixed-integer linear programming model for the optimal sizing of CEH components, using a co-design approach that jointly optimizes component sizing and operational decisions. A case study for a heavy-duty fleet demonstrates the effectiveness of the method for cost-efficient, scalable, and grid-compliant CEH planning.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Flexible Spatial and Temporal Data Center Workloads for Grid Regulation Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data centers (DCs) are increasingly recognized as flexible loads that can support grid frequency regulation. Yet, most existing methods treat workload scheduling and regulation capacity bidding separately, overlooking how queueing dynamics and spatial-temporal dispatch decisions affect the ability to sustain real-time regulation. As a result, the committed regulation may become infeasible or short-lived. To address this issue, we propose a unified day-ahead co-optimization framework that jointly decides workload distribution across geographically distributed DCs and regulation capacity commitments. We construct a space-time network model to capture workload migration costs, latency requirements, and heterogeneous resource limits. To ensure that the committed regulation remains deliverable, we introduce chance constraints on instantaneous power flexibility based on interactive load forecasts, and apply Value-at-Risk queue-state constraints to maintain sustainable response under cumulative regulation signals. Case studies on a modified IEEE 68-bus system using real data center traces show that the proposed framework lowers system operating costs, enables more viable regulation capacity, and achieves better revenue-risk trade-offs compared to strategies that optimize scheduling and regulation independently.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Control Technique for Switched LPV Systems and Its Application to Active Magnetic Bearing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel hybrid control framework for switched linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems under hysteresis switching logic. By introducing a controller state-reset mechanism, the hybrid LPV synthesis problem is reformulated as a convex optimization problem expressed in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), enabling efficient computation of both switching LPV controller gains and reset matrices. The proposed approach is then applied to active magnetic bearing (AMB) systems, whose rotor dynamics exhibit strong dependence on rotational speed. Conventional LPV designs are often conservative due to large speed variations. The proposed hybrid gain-scheduled controller explicitly accounts for bounds on parameter variation rates, employs multiple LPV controllers over distinct operating regions, and uses hysteresis switching to reduce chattering and ensure stability. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through a detailed AMB control design example.</description>

      <title>LMI Optimization Based Multirate Steady-State Kalman Filter Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an LMI-based design framework for multirate steady-state Kalman filters in systems with sensors operating at different sampling rates. The multirate system is formulated as a periodic time-varying system, where the Kalman gains converge to periodic steady-state values that repeat every frame period. Cyclic reformulation transforms this into a time-invariant problem; however, the resulting measurement noise covariance becomes semidefinite rather than positive definite, preventing direct application of standard Riccati equation methods. We address this through a dual LQR formulation with LMI optimization that naturally handles semidefinite covariances. The framework enables multi-objective design, supporting pole placement for guaranteed convergence rates and mixed H_2/l_2-induced norm design for balancing average and worst-case performance. Numerical validation using an automotive navigation system with GPS and wheel speed sensors demonstrates that the proposed filter achieves estimation errors well below raw measurement noise levels.</description>

Abstract: Data collaboration between municipal authorities (MA) and mobility providers (MPs) has brought tremendous benefits to transportation systems in the era of big data. Engaging in collaboration can improve the service operations (e.g., reduced delay) of these data owners, however, it can also raise privacy concerns and discourage data-sharing willingness. Specifically, data owners may be concerned that the shared data may leak sensitive information about their customers' mobility patterns or business secrets, resulting in the failure of collaboration. This paper investigates how privacy-preserving mechanisms can foster data collaboration in such settings. We propose a game-theoretic framework to investigate data-sharing among transportation stakeholders, especially considering perturbation-based privacy-preserving mechanisms. Numerical studies demonstrate that lower data quality expectations can incentivize voluntary data sharing, improving transport-related welfare for both MAs and MPs. Our findings provide actionable insights for policymakers and system designers on how privacy-preserving technologies can help bridge data silos and promote collaborative, privacy-aware transportation systems.</description>

      <title>Super-twisting over networks: A Lyapunov approach for distributed differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study distributed differentiation, where agents in a networked system estimate the average of local time-varying signals and their derivatives under mild assumptions on the agents' signals and their first and second derivatives. Existing sliding-mode methods provide only local stability guarantees and lack systematic gain selection. By isolating the structural features shared with the super-twisting algorithm and encoding them into an abstract model, we construct a Lyapunov function enabling systematic gain design and proving global finite-time convergence to consensus for the distributed differentiator. Building on this framework, we develop an event-triggered hybrid system implementation using time-varying and state dependent threshold rules and derive minimum inter-event time guarantees and accuracy bounds that quantify the trade-off between estimation accuracy and communication effort.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Power Management Unit With Continuous MPPT and Energy Recycling for Wireless Millimetric Biomedical Implants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.02376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomedical implants offer transformative tools to improve medical outcomes. To realize minimally invasive implants with miniaturized volume and weight, wireless power transfer has been extensively studied to replace bulky batteries that dominate the volume of traditional implants and require surgical replacements. Ultra-sonic and magnetoelectric WPT modalities, which leverage low frequency acoustic electrical coupling for energy transduction, become viable solutions for mm-scale receivers. This work presents a fully integrated power management unit for ME WPT in millimetric implants. The PMU achieves load independent maximum power extraction and usage by continuously matching the impedance of the transducer, dynamically optimizing the power stage across varying input divided by load conditions, and reusing the storage energy to sustain the system when input power drops. Its parallel-input regulation and storing stages architecture prevent the cascading power loss. With the skewed-duty-cycle MPPT technique and regulation efficiency optimizer, the PMU achieves a peak MPPT efficiency of 98.5 percent and a peak system overall efficiency of 73.33 percent. Additionally, the PMU includes an adaptive high-voltage charging stage that charges the stimulation capacitor up to 12 V with an improved efficiency of 37.88 percent.</description>

      <title>Robust Safety-Critical Control of Networked SIR Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a robust safety-critical control framework tailored for networked susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) epidemic dynamics, leveraging control barrier functions (CBFs) and robust control barrier functions to address the challenges of epidemic spread and mitigation. In our networked SIR model, each node must keep its infection level below a critical threshold, despite dynamic interactions with neighboring nodes and inherent uncertainties in the epidemic parameters and measurement errors, to ensure public health safety. We first derive a CBF-based controller that guarantees infection thresholds are not exceeded in the nominal case. We enhance the framework to handle realistic epidemic scenarios under uncertainties by incorporating compensation terms that reinforce safety against uncertainties: an independent method with constant bounds for uniform uncertainty, and a novel approach that scales with the state to capture increased relative noise in early or suppressed outbreak stages. Simulation results on a networked SIR system illustrate that the nominal CBF controller maintains safety under low uncertainty, while the robust approaches provide formal safety guarantees under higher uncertainties; in particular, the novel method employs more conservative control efforts to provide larger safety margins, whereas the independent approach optimizes resource allocation by allowing infection levels to approach the boundaries in steady epidemic regimes.</description>

      <title>Representation Learning Enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Operation of Hydrogen-based Multi-Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydrogen-based multi-energy systems (HMES) have emerged as a promising low-carbon and energy-efficient solution, as it can enable the coordinated operation of electricity, heating and cooling supply and demand to enhance operational flexibility, improve overall energy efficiency, and increase the share of renewable integration. However, the optimal operation of HMES remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-physics coupled dynamics of hydrogen energy storage systems (HESS) (consisting of electrolyters, fuel cells and hydrogen tanks) as well as the presence of multiple uncertainties from supply and demand. To address these challenges, this paper develops a comprehensive operational model for HMES that fully captures the nonlinear dynamics and multi-physics process of HESS. Moreover, we propose an enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework by integrating the emerging representation learning techniques, enabling substantially accelerated and improved policy optimization for spatially and temporally coupled complex networked systems, which is not provided by conventional DRL. Experimental studies based on real-world datasets show that the comprehensive model is crucial to ensure the safe and reliable of HESS. In addition, the proposed SR-DRL approaches demonstrate superior convergence rate and performance over conventional DRL counterparts in terms of reducing the operation cost of HMES and handling the system operating constraints. Finally, we provide some insights into the role of representation learning in DRL, speculating that it can reorganize the original state space into a well-structured and cluster-aware geometric representation, thereby smoothing and facilitating the learning process of DRL.</description>

      <title>AIRE-Prune: Asymptotic Impulse-Response Energy for State Pruning in State Space Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State space models (SSMs) often sacrifice capacity, search space, or stability to offset the memory and compute costs of large state dimensions. We introduce a structured post-training pruning method for SSMs -- AIRE-Prune (Asymptotic Impulse-Response Energy for State PRUN(E)) -- that reduces each layer's state dimension by directly minimizing long-run output-energy distortion. AIRE-Prune assigns every state a closed-form asymptotic impulse-response energy-based score, i.e., the total impulse-response energy it contributes over an infinite horizon (time), and normalizes these scores layer-wise to enable global cross-layer comparison and selection. This extends modal truncation from single systems to deep stacks and aligns pruning with asymptotic response energy rather than worst-case gain. Across diverse sequence benchmarks, AIRE-Prune reveals substantial redundancy in SISO and MIMO SSMs with average pruning of 60.8%, with average accuracy drop of 0.29% without retraining, while significantly lowering compute.

      <title>Equilibrium of Feasible Zone and Uncertain Model in Safe Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of environmental exploration is a critical problem in reinforcement learning (RL). While limiting exploration to a feasible zone has become widely accepted as a way to ensure safety, key questions remain unresolved: what is the maximum feasible zone achievable through exploration, and how can it be identified? This paper, for the first time, answers these questions by revealing that the goal of safe exploration is to find the equilibrium between the feasible zone and the environment model. This conclusion is based on the understanding that these two components are interdependent: a larger feasible zone leads to a more accurate environment model, and a more accurate model, in turn, enables exploring a larger zone. We propose the first equilibrium-oriented safe exploration framework called safe equilibrium exploration (SEE), which alternates between finding the maximum feasible zone and the least uncertain model. Using a graph formulation of the uncertain model, we prove that the uncertain model obtained by SEE is monotonically refined, the feasible zones monotonically expand, and both converge to the equilibrium of safe exploration. Experiments on classic control tasks show that our algorithm successfully expands the feasible zones with zero constraint violation, and achieves the equilibrium of safe exploration within a few iterations.</description>

      <title>Ocean Current-Harnessing Stage-Gated MPC: Monotone Cost Shaping and Speed-to-Fly for Energy-Efficient AUV Navigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are a highly promising technology for ocean exploration and diverse offshore operations, yet their practical deployment is constrained by energy efficiency and endurance. To address this, we propose Current-Harnessing Stage-Gated MPC, which exploits ocean currents via a per-stage scalar which indicates the "helpfulness" of ocean currents. This scalar is computed along the prediction horizon to gate lightweight cost terms only where the ocean currents truly aids the control goal. The proposed cost terms, that are merged in the objective function, are (i) a Monotone Cost Shaping (MCS) term, a help-gated, non-worsening modification that relaxes along-track position error and provides a bounded translational energy rebate, guaranteeing the shaped objective is never larger than a set baseline, and (ii) a speed-to-fly (STF) cost component that increases the price of thrust and softly matches ground velocity to the ocean current, enabling near zero water-relative "gliding". All terms are C1 and integrate as a plug-and-play in MPC designs. Extensive simulations with the BlueROV2 model under realistic ocean current fields show that the proposed approach achieves substantially lower energy consumption than conventional predictive control while maintaining comparable arrival times and constraint satisfaction.</description>

Abstract: We propose a computationally tractable, tube-based robust nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) framework using difference-of-convex (DC) functions and sequential convex programming. For systems with differentiable discrete time dynamics, we show how to construct systematic, data-driven DC model representations using polynomials and machine learning techniques. We develop a robust tube MPC scheme that convexifies the online optimization by linearizing the concave components of the model, and we provide guarantees of recursive feasibility and robust stability. We present three data-driven procedures for computing DC models and compare performance using a planar vertical take-off and landing (PVTOL) aircraft case study.</description>

      <title>SPOT: Spatio-Temporal Obstacle-free Trajectory Planning for UAVs in an Unknown Dynamic Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of reactive motion planning for quadrotors operating in unknown environments with dynamic obstacles. Our approach leverages a 4-dimensional spatio-temporal planner, integrated with vision-based Safe Flight Corridor (SFC) generation and trajectory optimization. Unlike prior methods that rely on map fusion, our framework is mapless, enabling collision avoidance directly from perception while reducing computational overhead. Dynamic obstacles are detected and tracked using a vision-based object segmentation and tracking pipeline, allowing robust classification of static versus dynamic elements in the scene. To further enhance robustness, we introduce a backup planning module that reactively avoids dynamic obstacles when no direct path to the goal is available, mitigating the risk of collisions during deadlock situations. We validate our method extensively in both simulation and real-world hardware experiments, and benchmark it against state-of-the-art approaches, showing significant advantages for reactive UAV navigation in dynamic, unknown environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies preview control in both the $H_\infty$ and regret-optimal settings. The plant is modeled as a discrete-time, linear time-invariant system subject to external disturbances. The performance baseline is the optimal non-causal controller that has full knowledge of the disturbance sequence. We first review the construction of the $H_\infty$ preview controller with $p$-steps of disturbance preview. We then show that the closed-loop $H_\infty$ performance of this preview controller converges as $p\to \infty$ to the performance of the optimal non-causal controller. Furthermore, we prove that the optimal regret of the preview controller converges to zero. These results demonstrate that increasing preview length allows controllers to asymptotically achieve non-causal performance in both the $H_\infty$ and regret frameworks. A numerical example illustrates the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying the dynamic precompensator that renders a nonlinear control system feedback linearizable is a challenging problem. Researchers have explored the problem -- dynamic feedback linearization -- and produced existence conditions and constructive procedures for the dynamic precompensator. These remain, in general, either computationally expensive or restrictive. Treating the challenge as intrinsic, this article views the problem as a search problem over a category. Dynamic programming applies and, upon restriction to a finite category, classic search algorithms find the minimal dynamic extension. Alternatively, a heuristic aiming towards feedback linearizable systems can be employed to select amongst the infinitely-many extensions. This framing provides a distinctive, birds-eye view of the search for the dynamic precompensator.</description>

      <title>From Discrete to Continuous Mixed Populations of Conformists, Nonconformists, and Imitators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In two-strategy decision-making problems, individuals often imitate the highest earners or choose either the common or rare strategy.
  Individuals who benefit from the common strategy are conformists, whereas those who profit by choosing the less common one are called nonconformists.
  The population proportions of the two strategies may undergo perpetual fluctuations
  in finite, discrete, heterogeneous populations of imitators, conformists, and nonconformists.
  How these fluctuations evolve as population size increases was left as an open question and is addressed in this paper.
  We show that the family of Markov chains describing the discrete population dynamics forms a generalized stochastic approximation process for a differential inclusion--the continuous-time dynamics.
  Furthermore, we prove that the continuous-time dynamics always equilibrate.
  Then, by leveraging results from the stochastic approximation theory, we show that the amplitudes of fluctuations in the proportions of the two strategies in the population approach zero with probability one when the population size grows to infinity.
  Our results suggest that large-scale perpetual fluctuations are unlikely in large, well-mixed populations consisting of these three types, particularly when imitators follow the highest earners.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.01516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a white-box adaptive NMPC architecture that resolves vehicular plasticity (adaptation to varying operating regimes without retraining) by arbitrating among frozen, regime-specific neural specialists using a Modular Sovereignty paradigm. The ensemble dynamics are maintained as a fully traversable symbolic graph in CasADi, enabling maximal runtime auditability. Synchronous simulation validates rapid adaptation (~7.3 ms) and near-ideal tracking fidelity under compound regime shifts (friction, mass, drag) where non-adaptive baselines fail. Empirical benchmarking quantifies the transparency cost: symbolic graph maintenance increases solver latency by 72-102X versus compiled parametric physics models, establishing the efficiency price of strict white-box implementation.</description>

      <title>AdaptNC: Adaptive Nonconformity Scores for Uncertainty-Aware Autonomous Systems in Dynamic Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rigorous uncertainty quantification is essential for the safe deployment of autonomous systems in unconstrained environments. Conformal Prediction (CP) provides a distribution-free framework for this task, yet its standard formulations rely on exchangeability assumptions that are violated by the distribution shifts inherent in real-world robotics. Existing online CP methods maintain target coverage by adaptively scaling the conformal threshold, but typically employ a static nonconformity score function. We show that this fixed geometry leads to highly conservative, volume-inefficient prediction regions when environments undergo structural shifts. To address this, we propose \textbf{AdaptNC}, a framework for the joint online adaptation of both the nonconformity score parameters and the conformal threshold. AdaptNC leverages an adaptive reweighting scheme to optimize score functions, and introduces a replay buffer mechanism to mitigate the coverage instability that occurs during score transitions. We evaluate AdaptNC on diverse robotic benchmarks involving multi-agent policy changes, environmental changes and sensor degradation. Our results demonstrate that AdaptNC significantly reduces prediction region volume compared to state-of-the-art threshold-only baselines while maintaining target coverage levels.</description>

      <title>Synthesized-Isotropic Narrowband Channel Parameter Extraction from Angle-Resolved Wideband Channel Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Angle-resolved channel sounding using antenna arrays or mechanically steered high-gain antennas is widely employed at millimeter-wave and terahertz bands. To extract antenna-independent large-scale channel parameters such as path loss, delay spread, and angular spread, the radiation-pattern effects embedded in the measured responses must be properly compensated. This paper revisits the technical challenges of path-gain calculation from angle-resolved wideband measurements, with emphasis on angular-domain power integration where the scan beams are inherently non-orthogonal and simple power summation leads to biased omni-equivalent power estimates. We first formulate the synthesized-isotropic narrowband power in a unified matrix form and introduce a beam-accumulation correction factor, including an offset-averaged variant to mitigate scalloping due to off-grid angles. The proposed framework is validated through simulations using channel models and 154~GHz corridor measurements.</description>

      <title>Path Tracking with Dynamic Control Point Blending for Autonomous Vehicles: An Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.01892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an experimental study of a path-tracking framework for autonomous vehicles in which the lateral control command is applied to a dynamic control point along the wheelbase. Instead of enforcing a fixed reference at either the front or rear axle, the proposed method continuously interpolates between both, enabling smooth adaptation across driving contexts, including low-speed maneuvers and reverse motion. The lateral steering command is obtained by barycentric blending of two complementary controllers: a front-axle Stanley formulation and a rear-axle curvature-based geometric controller, yielding continuous transitions in steering behavior and improved tracking stability. In addition, we introduce a curvature-aware longitudinal control strategy based on virtual track borders and ray-tracing, which converts upcoming geometric constraints into a virtual obstacle distance and regulates speed accordingly. The complete approach is implemented in a unified control stack and validated in simulation and on a real autonomous vehicle equipped with GPS-RTK, radar, odometry, and IMU. The results in closed-loop tracking and backward maneuvers show improved trajectory accuracy, smoother steering profiles, and increased adaptability compared to fixed control-point baselines.</description>

      <title>Position: The Need for Ultrafast Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain-specialized FPGAs have delivered unprecedented performance for low-latency inference across scientific and industrial workloads, yet nearly all existing accelerators assume static models trained offline, relegating learning and adaptation to slower CPUs or GPUs. This separation fundamentally limits systems that must operate in non-stationary, high-frequency environments, where model updates must occur at the timescale of the underlying physics. In this paper, I argue for a shift from inference-only accelerators to ultrafast on-chip learning, in which both inference and training execute directly within the FPGA fabric under deterministic, sub-microsecond latency constraints. Bringing learning into the same real-time datapath as inference would enable closed-loop systems that adapt as fast as the physical processes they control, with applications spanning quantum error correction, cryogenic qubit calibration, plasma and fusion control, accelerator tuning, and autonomous scientific experiments. Enabling such regimes requires rethinking algorithms, architectures, and toolflows jointly, but promises to transform FPGAs from static inference engines into real-time learning machines.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast On-chip Online Learning via Spline Locality in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast online learning is essential for high-frequency systems, such as controls for quantum computing and nuclear fusion, where adaptation must occur on sub-microsecond timescales. Meeting these requirements demands low-latency, fixed-precision computation under strict memory constraints, a regime in which conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) are both inefficient and numerically unstable. We identify key properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) that align with these constraints. Specifically, we show that: (i) KAN updates exploiting B-spline locality are sparse, enabling superior on-chip resource scaling, and (ii) KANs are inherently robust to fixed-point quantization. By implementing fixed-point online training on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), a representative platform for on-chip computation, we demonstrate that KAN-based online learners are significantly more efficient and expressive than MLPs across a range of low-latency and resource-constrained tasks. To our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate model-free online learning at sub-microsecond latencies.</description>

      <title>DCoPilot: Generative AI-Empowered Policy Adaptation for Dynamic Data Center Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02137v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern data centers (DCs) hosting artificial intelligence (AI)-dedicated devices operate at high power densities with rapidly varying workloads, making minute-level adaptation essential for safe and energy-efficient operation. However, manually designing piecewise deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents cannot keep pace with frequent dynamics shifts and service-level agreement (SLA) changes of an evolving DC. This specification-to-policy lag causes a lack of timely, effective control policies, which may lead to service outages. To bridge the gap, we present DCoPilot, a hybrid framework for generative control policies in dynamic DC operation. DCoPilot synergizes two distinct generative paradigms, i.e., a large language model (LLM) that performs symbolic generation of structured reward forms, and a hypernetwork that conducts parametric generation of policy weights. DCoPilot operates through three coordinated phases: (i) simulation scale-up, which stress-tests reward candidates across diverse simulation-ready (SimReady) scenes; (ii) meta policy distillation, where a hypernetwork is trained to output policy weights conditioned on SLA and scene embeddings; and (iii) online adaptation, enabling zero-shot policy generation in response to updated specifications. Evaluated across five control task families spanning diverse DC components, DCoPilot achieves near-zero constraint violations and outperforms all baselines across specification variations. Ablation studies validate the effectiveness of LLM-based unified reward generation in enabling stable hypernetwork convergence.</description>

      <title>Generating Causal Temporal Interaction Graphs for Counterfactual Validation of Temporal Link Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal link prediction (TLP) models are commonly evaluated based on predictive accuracy, yet such evaluations do not assess whether these models capture the causal mechanisms that govern temporal interactions. In this work, we propose a framework for counterfactual validation of TLP models by generating causal temporal interaction graphs (CTIGs) with known ground-truth causal structure. We first introduce a structural equation model for continuous-time event sequences that supports both excitatory and inhibitory effects, and then extend this mechanism to temporal interaction graphs. To compare causal models, we propose a distance metric based on cross-model predictive error, and empirically validate the hypothesis that predictors trained on one causal model degrade when evaluated on sufficiently distant models. Finally, we instantiate counterfactual evaluation under (i) controlled causal shifts between generating models and (ii) timestamp shuffling as a stochastic distortion with measurable causal distance. Our framework provides a foundation for causality-aware benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Online Fine-Tuning of Pretrained Controllers for Autonomous Driving via Real-Time Recurrent RL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02236v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deploying pretrained policies in real-world applications presents substantial challenges that fundamentally limit the practical applicability of learning-based control systems. When autonomous systems encounter environmental changes in system dynamics, sensor drift, or task objectives, fixed policies rapidly degrade in performance. We show that employing Real-Time Recurrent Reinforcement Learning (RTRRL), a biologically plausible algorithm for online adaptation, can effectively fine-tune a pretrained policy to improve autonomous agents' performance on driving tasks. We further show that RTRRL synergizes with a recent biologically inspired recurrent network model, the Liquid-Resistance Liquid-Capacitance RNN. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this closed-loop approach in a simulated CarRacing environment and in a real-world line-following task with a RoboRacer car equipped with an event camera.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Sim-to-Real Gap with multipanda ros2: A Real-Time ROS2 Framework for Multimanual Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present $multipanda\_ros2$, a novel open-source ROS2 architecture for multi-robot control of Franka Robotics robots. Leveraging ros2 control, this framework provides native ROS2 interfaces for controlling any number of robots from a single process. Our core contributions address key challenges in real-time torque control, including interaction control and robot-environment modeling. A central focus of this work is sustaining a 1kHz control frequency, a necessity for real-time control and a minimum frequency required by safety standards. Moreover, we introduce a controllet-feature design pattern that enables controller-switching delays of $\le 2$ ms, facilitating reproducible benchmarking and complex multi-robot interaction scenarios. To bridge the simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap, we integrate a high-fidelity MuJoCo simulation with quantitative metrics for both kinematic accuracy and dynamic consistency (torques, forces, and control errors). Furthermore, we demonstrate that real-world inertial parameter identification can significantly improve force and torque accuracy, providing a methodology for iterative physics refinement. Our work extends approaches from soft robotics to rigid dual-arm, contact-rich tasks, showcasing a promising method to reduce the sim2real gap and providing a robust, reproducible platform for advanced robotics research.</description>

      <title>Sequential Quadratic Sum-of-squares Programming for Nonlinear Control Systems</title>

Abstract: Many problems in nonlinear systems analysis and control design, such as local region-of-attraction estimation, inner-approximations of reachable sets or control design under state and control constraints can be formulated as nonconvex sum-of-squares programs. Yet tractable and efficient solution methods are still lacking, limiting their application in control engineering. To address this gap, we propose a filter line-search algorithm that solves a sequence of quadratic subproblems. Numerical benchmarks demonstrate that the algorithm can significantly reduce the number of iterations, resulting in a substantial decrease in computation time compared to established methods for nonconvex sum-of-squares programs. An open-source implementation of the algorithm along with the numerical benchmarks is provided</description>

      <title>Preemptive Scheduling for Age of Job Minimization in Task-Specific Machine Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a time-slotted job-assignment system consisting of a central server, $N$ task-specific networks of machines, and multiple users. Each network specializes in executing a distinct type of task. Users stochastically generate jobs of various types and forward them to the central server, which routes each job to the appropriate network of machines. Due to resource constraints, the server cannot serve all users' jobs simultaneously, which motivates the design of scheduling policies with possible preemption. To evaluate scheduling performance, we introduce a novel timeliness metric, the age of job, inspired by the well-known metric, the age of information. We study the problem of minimizing the long-term weighted average age of job. We first propose a max-weight policy by minimizing the one-step Lyapunov drift and then derive the Whittle index (WI) policy when the job completion times of the networks of machines follow geometric distributions. For general job completion time distributions, we introduce a Whittle index with max-weight fallback (WIMWF) policy. We also investigate the Net-gain maximization (NGM) policy. Numerically, we show that the proposed WIMWF policy achieves the best performance in the general job completion time setting. We also observe a scaling trend: two different max-weight policies can outperform the NGM policy in small systems, whereas the NGM policy improves as we scale the system size and becomes asymptotically better than max-weight policies. For geometric service times, the WI policy yields the lowest age across all considered system sizes.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the Generalized Action Governor (AG), a supervisory scheme that augments a nominal closed-loop system with the capability to enforce state and input constraints through online action adjustment. We develop a generalized AG theory for discrete-time systems under bounded uncertainties, and relax the usual requirement of positive invariance to returnability of a safe set. Based on the theory, we present tailored AG design procedures for linear systems and for discrete systems with finite state and action spaces. We further study safe online learning enabled by the AG and present two safe learning strategies, namely safe Q-learning and safe data-driven Koopman operator-based control, both integrated with the AG to guarantee constraint satisfaction during learning. Numerical results illustrate the proposed methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we present a distributed source-seeking and flocking control method for networked multi-agent systems with non-holonomic constraints. Based solely on identical on-board sensor systems, which measure the source local field, the group objective is attained by appointing a leader agent to seek the source while the remaining follower agents safely form a cohesive flocking with their neighbors using a distributed flocking control law in a connectivity-preserved undirected network. To guarantee safe separation and group motion for all agents and to solve the conflicts with the "cohesion" flocking rule of Reynolds, the distributed control algorithm is solved individually through feasible CBF-based optimization problem with complex constraints, which guarantees the inter-agent collision avoidance and connectivity preservation. Stability analysis of the closed-loop system is presented and the efficacy of the methods is shown in simulation results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06469v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a stochastic model predictive control method for linear systems affected by additive Gaussian disturbances that optimizes over disturbance feedback matrices online. Closed-loop satisfaction of probabilistic constraints and recursive feasibility of the underlying convex optimization problem is guaranteed. Optimization over feedback policies online increases performance and reduces conservatism compared to fixed-feedback approaches. The central mechanism is a finitely determined maximal admissible set for probabilistic constraints, together with the reconditioning of the predicted probabilistic constraints on the current knowledge at every time step. The proposed method's applicability is demonstrated on a building temperature control example.</description>

Abstract: Controlling complex physics systems is important in diverse domains. While diffusion-based methods have demonstrated advantages over classical model-based approaches and myopic sequential learning methods in achieving global trajectory consistency, they are limited by sample efficiency.This paper presents SEDC (Sample-Efficient Diffusion-based Control), a novel framework addressing core challenges in complex physics systems: high-dimensional state-control spaces, strong nonlinearities, and the gap between non-optimal training data and near-optimal control laws.Our approach introduces a novel control paradigm by architecturally decoupling state-control modeling and decomposing dynamics, while a guided self-finetuning process iteratively refines the control law towards optimality. We validate SEDC across diverse complex nonlinear systems, including high-dimensional fluid dynamics (Burgers), chaotic synchronization networks (Kuramoto), and real-world power grid stability control (Swing Equation). Our method achieves 39.5\%-47.3\% better control accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines while using only 10\% of the training samples. The implementation is available at \href{https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DIFOCON-C019}{here}.</description>

      <title>State Estimation and Control for Continuous-Time Nonlinear Systems: A Unified SDRE-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a unified approach for state estimation and control of nonlinear dynamic systems, employing the State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) framework. The proposed approach naturally extends classical linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) methods into nonlinear scenarios, avoiding linearization by using state-dependent coefficient (SDC) matrices. An SDRE-based Kalman filter (SDRE-KF) is integrated within an SDRE-based control structure, providing a coherent and intuitive strategy for nonlinear system analysis and control design. To evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed methodology, comparative simulations are conducted on two benchmark nonlinear systems: a simple pendulum and a Van der Pol oscillator. Results demonstrate that the SDRE-KF achieves comparable or superior estimation accuracy compared to traditional methods, including the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and the Particle Filter (PF). These findings underline the potential of the unified SDRE-based approach as a viable alternative for nonlinear state estimation and control, providing valuable insights for both educational purposes and practical engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Learning-Augmented Power System Operations: A Unified Optimization View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable energy, traditional physics-based power system operation faces growing challenges in achieving economic efficiency, stability, and robustness. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for modeling complex system dynamics to address these challenges. However, existing ML designs are often developed in isolation and lack systematic integration with established operational decision frameworks. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a holistic framework of Learning-Augmented Power System Operations (LAPSO, pronounced Lap-So). From a native mathematical optimization perspective, LAPSO is centered on the operation stage and aims to unify traditionally siloed power system tasks such as forecasting, operation, and control. The framework jointly optimizes machine learning and physics-based models at both the training and inference stages. Then, a complete set of design metrics is introduced to quantify and evaluate the impact of ML models on the existing decision-makings. These metrics facilitate a deeper understanding of representative applications such as stability-constrained optimization (SCO) and objective-based forecasting (OBF). Moreover, LAPSO is inherently extensible to emerging learning paradigms that integrate forecasting, operation, and control in a closed loop. It also enables the systematic identification and mitigation of different sources and timings of uncertainty from Bayesian perspective. Finally, a dedicated Python package \texttt{lapso} is developed to automatically augment existing power system optimization models with learnable components. All source code and datasets are publicly available at: https://github.com/xuwkk/lapso_exp.</description>

      <title>System Identification for Virtual Sensor-Based Model Predictive Control: Application to a 2-DoF Direct-Drive Robotic Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) offers a powerful approach for controlling complex nonlinear systems, yet faces two key challenges. First, accurately modeling nonlinear dynamics remains difficult. Second, variables directly related to control objectives often cannot be directly measured during operation. Although high-cost sensors can acquire these variables during model development, their use in practical deployment is typically infeasible. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Predictive Virtual Sensor Identification (PVSID) framework that leverages temporary high-cost sensors during the modeling phase to create virtual sensors for NMPC implementation. We validate PVSID on a Two-Degree-of-Freedom (2-DoF) direct-drive robotic arm with complex joint interactions, capturing tip position via motion capture during modeling and utilize an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in NMPC. Experimental results show our NMPC with identified virtual sensors achieves precise tip trajectory tracking without requiring the motion capture system during operation. PVSID offers a practical solution for implementing optimal control in nonlinear systems where the measurement of key variables is constrained by cost or operational limitations.</description>

      <title>Bio-inspired density control of multi-agent swarms via leader-follower plasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15781v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of control systems for the spatial self-organization of mobile agents is an open challenge across several engineering domains, including swarm robotics and synthetic biology. Here, we propose a bio-inspired leader-follower solution, which is aware of energy constraints of mobile agents and is apt to deal with large swarms. Akin to many natural systems, control objectives are formulated for the entire collective, and leaders and followers are allowed to plastically switch their role in time. We frame a density control problem, modeling the agents' population via a system of nonlinear partial differential equations. This approach allows for a compact description that inherently avoids the curse of dimensionality and improves analytical tractability. We derive analytical guarantees for the existence of desired steady-state solutions and their local stability for one-dimensional and higher-dimensional problems. We numerically validate our control methodology, offering support to the effectiveness, robustness, and versatility of our proposed bio-inspired control strategy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a distributed Koopman operator learning framework for modeling unknown nonlinear dynamics using sequential observations from multiple agents. Each agent estimates a local Koopman approximation based on lifted data and collaborates over a communication graph to reach exponential consensus on a consistent distributed approximation. The approach supports distributed computation under asynchronous and resource-constrained sensing. Its performance is demonstrated through simulation results, validating convergence and predictive accuracy under sensing-constrained scenarios and limited communication.</description>

      <title>DER Day-Ahead Offering: A Neural Network Column-and-Constraint Generation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the day-ahead energy market, the offering strategy of distributed energy resource (DER) aggregators must be submitted before the uncertainty realization in the form of price-quantity pairs. This work addresses the day-ahead offering problem through a two-stage adaptive robust stochastic optimization model, wherein the first-stage price-quantity pairs and second-stage operational commitment decisions are made before and after DER uncertainty is realized, respectively. Uncertainty in day-ahead price is addressed using a stochastic programming-based approach, while uncertainty of DER generation is handled through robust optimization. To address the max-min structure of the second-stage problem, a neural network-accelerated column-and-constraint generation method is developed. A dedicated neural network is trained to approximate the value function, while optimality is maintained by the design of the network architecture. Numerical studies indicate that the proposed method yields high-quality solutions and is up to 100 times faster than Gurobi and 33 times faster than classical column-and-constraint generation on the same 1028-node synthetic distribution network.</description>

      <title>ARCAS: An Augmented Reality Collision Avoidance System with SLAM-Based Tracking for Enhancing VRU Safety</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vulnerable road users (VRUs) face high collision risks in mixed traffic, yet most existing safety systems prioritize driver or vehicle assistance over direct VRU support. This paper presents ARCAS, a real-time augmented reality (AR) collision avoidance system that provides personalized spatial alerts to VRUs via wearable AR headsets. By fusing roadside 360{\deg} 3D LiDAR with SLAM-based headset tracking and an automatic 3D calibration procedure, ARCAS accurately overlays world-locked 3D bounding boxes and directional arrows onto approaching hazards in the user's passthrough view. The system also enables multi-headset coordination through shared world anchoring. Evaluated in real-world pedestrian interactions with e-scooters and vehicles (180 trials), ARCAS nearly doubles pedestrians' time to collision and increases counterparts' reaction margins by up to 4x compared to unaided eye conditions. Results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of LiDAR-driven AR guidance and highlight the potential of wearable AR as a promising next generation safety tool for urban mobility.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Equipment Monitoring via Cascaded Anomaly Detection and Thermal Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24755v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictive maintenance demands both accurate anomaly detection and interpretable explanations. We demonstrate that naive multimodal fusion of sensor time-series and thermal imagery can degrade performance, and instead propose a cascaded, hybrid architecture. Our approach utilizes Random Forest on statistical sensor features for detection ($94.66\%$ F1), triggering a CNN with spatial attention for thermal fault localization only post-detection. Rigorous analysis reveals that statistical feature-based detection significantly outperforms both LSTM ($89.57\%$ F1) and end-to-end fusion ($84.79\%$ F1) at typical industrial noise levels. However, we identify a critical noise crossover phenomenon: while Random Forest excels at low noise, deep learning approaches demonstrate superior resilience at high noise ($\sigma &gt; 0.3$). Additionally, we introduce an explainability pipeline integrating TreeSHAP and attention heatmaps to diagnose "modality bias," where fusion models irrationally favor weaker thermal inputs. Validated on 13,121 real-world samples from automated transport systems, this work provides evidence-based guidelines for model selection, proving that traditional machine learning often surpasses complex deep learning for industrial monitoring while offering superior interpretability.</description>

      <title>Probability-Aware Parking Selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00521v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current navigation systems conflate time-to-drive with the true time-to-arrive by ignoring parking search duration and the final walking leg. Such underestimation can significantly affect user experience, mode choice, congestion, and emissions. To address this issue, this paper introduces the probability-aware parking selection problem, which aims to direct drivers to the best parking location rather than straight to their destination. An adaptable dynamic programming framework is proposed that leverages probabilistic, lot-level availability to minimize the expected time-to-arrive. Closed-form analysis determines when it is optimal to target a specific parking lot or explore alternatives, as well as the expected time cost. Sensitivity analysis and three illustrative cases are examined, demonstrating the model's ability to account for the dynamic nature of parking availability. Given the high cost of permanent sensing infrastructure, we assess the error rates of using stochastic observations to estimate availability. Experiments with real-world data from the US city of Seattle indicate this approach's viability, with mean absolute error decreasing from 7% to below 2% as observation frequency increases. In data-based simulations, probability-aware strategies demonstrate time savings up to 66% relative to probability-unaware baselines, yet still take up to 123% longer than time-to-drive estimates.</description>

      <title>Reliable Grid Forecasting: State Space Models for Safety-Critical Energy Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01410v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate grid load forecasting is safety-critical: under-predictions risk supply shortfalls, while symmetric error metrics can mask this operational asymmetry. We introduce an operator-legible evaluation framework -- Under-Prediction Rate (UPR), tail Reserve$_{99.5}^{\%}$ requirements, and explicit inflation diagnostics (Bias$_{24h}$/OPR) -- to quantify one-sided reliability risk beyond MAPE.
  Using this framework, we evaluate state space models (Mamba variants) and strong baselines on a weather-aligned California Independent System Operator (CAISO) dataset spanning Nov 2023--Nov 2025 (84,498 hourly records across 5 regional transmission areas) under a rolling-origin walk-forward backtest. We develop and evaluate thermal-lag-aligned weather fusion strategies for these architectures.
  Our results demonstrate that standard accuracy metrics are insufficient proxies for operational safety: models with comparable MAPE can imply materially different tail reserve requirements (Reserve$_{99.5}^{\%}$). We show that explicit weather integration narrows error distributions, reducing the impact of temperature-driven demand spikes. Furthermore, while probabilistic calibration reduces large-error events, it can induce systematic schedule inflation. We introduce Bias/OPR-constrained objectives to enable auditable trade-offs between minimizing tail risk and preventing trivial over-forecasting.</description>

      <title>An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Continuous-Time Control and Filtering Limitations by the I-MMSE Relationships</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.00995v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While information theory has been introduced to characterize the fundamental limitations of control and filtering for a few decades, the existing information-theoretic methods are indirect and cumbersome for analyzing the limitations of continuous-time systems. To answer this challenge, we lift the information-theoretic analysis to continuous function spaces by the I-MMSE relationships. Continuous-time control and filtering systems are modeled into the additive Gaussian channels with and without feedback, and the total information rate is identified as a control and filtering trade-off metric and calculated from the estimation error of channel inputs. Fundamental constraints for this trade-off metric are first derived in a general setup and then used to capture the limitations of various control and filtering systems subject to linear and nonlinear plant models. For linear scenarios, we show that the total information rate quantifies the performance limits, such as the minimum entropy cost and the lowest achievable mean-square estimation error, in the time domain. For nonlinear systems, we provide a direct method to calculate and interpret the total information rate and its lower bound by the Stratonovich-Kushner equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of rolling-element bearing faults is crucial for implementing proactive maintenance strategies and for minimizing the economic and operational consequences of unexpected failures. However, many existing techniques are developed and tested under strictly controlled conditions, limiting their adaptability to the diverse and dynamic settings encountered in practical applications. This paper presents an efficient real-time convolutional neural network (CNN) for diagnosing multiple bearing faults under various noise levels and time-varying rotational speeds. Additionally, we propose a novel Fisher-based spectral separability analysis (SSA) method to elucidate the effectiveness of the designed CNN model. We conducted experiments on both healthy bearings and bearings afflicted with inner race, outer race, and roller ball faults. The experimental results show the superiority of our model over the current state-of-the-art approach in three folds: it achieves substantial accuracy gains of up to 15.8%, it is robust to noise with high performance across various signal-to-noise ratios, and it runs in real-time with processing durations five times less than acquisition. Additionally, by using the proposed SSA technique, we offer insights into the model's performance and underscore its effectiveness in tackling real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Data Significance in Remote Estimation of Discrete-State Markov Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18270v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider semantics-aware remote estimation of a discrete-state Markov source with both normal (low-priority) and alarm (high-priority) states. Erroneously announcing a normal state at the destination when the source is actually in an alarm state (i.e., missed alarm) incurs a significantly higher cost than falsely announcing an alarm state when the source is in a normal state (i.e., false alarm). Moreover, consecutive estimation errors may cause significant lasting impacts, such as maintenance costs and misoperations. Motivated by this, we introduce two new metrics, the Age of Missed Alarm (AoMA) and the Age of False Alarm (AoFA), to capture the lasting impacts incurred by different estimation errors. Notably, these two age processes evolve interdependently and distinguish between different error types. Our goal is to design a transmission policy that achieves an optimized trade-off between lasting impact and communication cost. The problem is formulated as a countably infinite-state Markov decision process (MDP) with an unbounded cost function. We show the existence of a simple switching policy with distinct thresholds for each age process and derive closed-form expressions for its performance. For symmetric and non-prioritized sources, we show that the optimal policy reduces to a threshold policy with identical thresholds. For numerical tractability, we propose a finite-state approximate MDP and prove that it converges exponentially fast to the original MDP in the truncation size. Finally, we develop an efficient search algorithm to compute the optimal switching policy and validate our theoretical findings with numerical results.</description>

Abstract: We develop a novel switching dynamics that converges to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point of a nonlinear optimisation problem. This new approach is particularly notable for its lower dimensionality compared to conventional primal-dual dynamics, as it focuses exclusively on estimating the primal variable. Our method is successfully illustrated on general quadratic optimisation problems, the minimisation of the classical Rosenbrock function, and a nonconvex optimisation problem stemming from the control of energy-efficient buildings.</description>

      <title>Line-Search Filter Differential Dynamic Programming for Optimal Control with Nonlinear Equality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08278v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present FilterDDP, a differential dynamic programming algorithm for solving discrete-time, optimal control problems (OCPs) with nonlinear equality constraints. Unlike prior methods based on merit functions or the augmented Lagrangian class of algorithms, FilterDDP uses a step filter in conjunction with a line search to handle equality constraints. We identify two important design choices for the step filter criteria which lead to robust numerical performance: 1) we use the Lagrangian instead of the cost in the step acceptance criterion and, 2) in the backward pass, we perturb the value function Hessian. Both choices are rigorously justified, for 2) in particular by a formal proof of local quadratic convergence. In addition to providing a primal-dual interior point extension for handling OCPs with both equality and inequality constraints, we validate FilterDDP on three contact implicit trajectory optimisation problems which arise in robotics.</description>

      <title>DiTOX: Fault Detection and Localization in the ONNX Optimizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01892v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ONNX Optimizer, part of the official ONNX repository and widely adopted for graph-level model optimizations, is used by default to optimize ONNX models. Despite its popularity, its ability to preserve model correctness has not been systematically evaluated. We present DiTOX, an automated framework for comprehensively assessing the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer using differential testing, fault localization, and evaluation techniques that generalize to other compiler optimizers. DiTOX applies optimization passes to a corpus of ONNX models, executes both original and optimized versions on user-defined inputs, and detects discrepancies in behavior or optimizer failures. When divergences are observed, DiTOX isolates the responsible optimization pass through iterative, fine-grained analysis. We evaluated DiTOX on 130 models from the ONNX Model Hub spanning vision and language tasks. We found that 9.2% of model instances crashed the optimizer or produced invalid models under default settings. Moreover, output discrepancies occurred in 30% of classification models and 16.6% of object detection and segmentation models, while text-based models were largely robust. Overall, DiTOX uncovered 15 issues -- 14 previously unknown -- affecting 9 of the 47 optimization passes as well as the optimizer infrastructure. All issues were reported to the ONNX Optimizer developers. Our results demonstrate that DiTOX provides a simple and effective approach for validating AI model optimizers and is readily extensible beyond ONNX.</description>

      <title>A Selective Quantization Tuner for ONNX Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantization reduces the precision of deep neural networks to lower model size and computational demands, but often at the expense of accuracy. Fully quantized models can suffer significant accuracy degradation, and resource-constrained hardware accelerators may not support all quantized operations. A common workaround is selective quantization, where only some layers are quantized while others remain at full precision. However, determining the optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency is a challenging task. To this direction, we propose SeQTO, a framework that enables selective quantization, deployment, and execution of ONNX models on diverse CPU and GPU devices, combined with profiling and multi-objective optimization. SeQTO generates selectively quantized models, deploys them across hardware accelerators, evaluates performance on metrics such as accuracy and size, applies Pareto Front-based objective minimization to identify optimal candidates, and provides visualization of results. We evaluated SeQTO on four ONNX models under two quantization settings across CPU and GPU devices. Our results show that SeQTO effectively identifies high-quality selectively quantized models, achieving up to 54.14% lower accuracy loss while maintaining up to 98.18% of size reduction compared to fully quantized models.</description>

      <title>SCAR: State-Space Compression for Scalable AI-Based Network Management of Vehicular Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06243v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for connected vehicular services poses significant challenges for AI-based network and service management due to the high volume and rapid variability of network state information. Traditional management and control mechanisms struggle to scale when processing fine-grained metrics such as Channel Quality Indicators (CQIs) in dynamic vehicular environments. To address this challenge, we propose SCAR (State-Space Compression for AI-Based Network Management), an edge-assisted framework that improves scalability and fairness in vehicular services through network state abstraction. SCAR employs machine-learning (ML)-based compression techniques, including clustering and radial basis function (RBF) networks, to reduce the dimensionality of CQI-derived state information while preserving essential features relevant to management decisions. The resulting compressed states are used to train reinforcement learning (RL)-based management policies that aim to maximize network efficiency while satisfying service-level fairness objectives defined by the NGMN. Simulation results show that SCAR increases the time spent in feasible management regions by 14% and reduces unfair service allocation time by 15% compared to reinforcement learning baselines operating on uncompressed state information. Furthermore, simulated annealing with stochastic tunneling (SAST)-based clustering reduces state compression distortion by 10%, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach. These results demonstrate that SCAR enables scalable and fair AI-assisted network and service management in dynamic vehicular systems.</description>

      <title>SPARC: Spine with Prismatic and Revolute Compliance for Quadruped Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01984v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quadruped mammals coordinate spinal bending and axial compression to enhance locomotion agility and efficiency. However, existing robotic spines typically lack the active compliance required to support such dynamic behaviours. We present SPARC, a compact 3-DoF sagittal-plane spine module that enables simultaneous revolute and prismatic motions within a 1.26 kg package. Using a floating-base impedance controller, we facilitate independent, task-space tuning of spinal stiffness and damping to mimic biological load-bearing strategies. Benchtop experiments confirm high-fidelity rendering of commanded impedance, with linear force-displacement error within 1.5%. Systematic locomotion simulations reveal a critical speed-dependency: while low-speed efficiency is insensitive to spinal properties, precise impedance tuning becomes indispensable for high-speed performance. Our results demonstrate that an optimally compliant spine reduces power consumption by 21% at 0.9 m/s compared to a rigid-spine baseline. This efficiency gain is mechanistically attributed to the spine's role in augmenting stride length and acting as a mechanical low-pass filter to attenuate high-frequency torque fluctuations. SPARC provides an open-source platform for systematic studies of spine compliance in legged locomotion. Available at: github.com/YueWang996/sparc</description>

      <title>MOBIUS: A Multi-Modal Bipedal Robot that can Walk, Crawl, Climb, and Roll</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01774v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the MOBIUS platform, a bipedal robot capable of walking, crawling, climbing, and rolling. MOBIUS features four limbs, two 6-DoF arms with two-finger grippers for manipulation and climbing, and two 4-DoF legs for locomotion--enabling smooth transitions across diverse terrains without reconfiguration. A hybrid control architecture combines reinforcement learning for locomotion and force control for compliant contact interactions during manipulation. A high-level MIQCP planner autonomously selects locomotion modes to balance stability and energy efficiency. Hardware experiments demonstrate robust gait transitions, dynamic climbing, and full-body load support via pinch grasp. Overall, MOBIUS demonstrates the importance of tight integration between morphology, high-level planning, and control to enable mobile loco-manipulation and grasping, substantially expanding its interaction capabilities, workspace, and traversability.</description>

      <title>Safe and Stable Neural Network Dynamical Systems for Robot Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning safe and stable robot motions from demonstrations remains a challenge, especially in complex, nonlinear tasks involving dynamic, obstacle-rich environments. In this paper, we propose Safe and Stable Neural Network Dynamical Systems S$^2$-NNDS, a learning-from-demonstration framework that simultaneously learns expressive neural dynamical systems alongside neural Lyapunov stability and barrier safety certificates. Unlike traditional approaches with restrictive polynomial parameterizations, S$^2$-NNDS leverages neural networks to capture complex robot motions, providing probabilistic guarantees through split conformal prediction in learned certificates. Experimental results in various 2D and 3D datasets -- including LASA handwriting and demonstrations recorded kinesthetically from the Franka Emika Panda robot -- validate the effectiveness of S$^2$-NNDS in learning robust, safe, and stable motions from potentially unsafe demonstrations.
