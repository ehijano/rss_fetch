      <title>Underlying Physical Mechanisms in Upward Positive Flashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the first observation of a mixed mode of charge transfer during an upward positive flash, which was initiated from the S\"antis Tower in Switzerland. High-speed camera footage, along with current and electric field measurements, revealed a downward-propagating recoil leader connecting to the grounded current-carrying plasma channel at a junction height of &lt; 1 km above the tip of the tower. This event triggered the "return stroke"-like main pulse associated with Type 1 upward positive flashes, leading us to propose a mixed mode of charge transfer (normally observed in upward negative flashes) as the physical mechanism at play. Furthermore, the observed pulse shared characteristics with both mixed-mode and M-component -type initial continuous current (ICC) pulses, challenging existing classification criteria, and supporting the notion of a singular mode of charge transfer with a range of junction-dependent pulse characteristics, as opposed to two distinct modes. The recoil leader itself was accompanied by a sequence of fast electric field pulses indicative of step-like propagation, also an observational first. These findings contribute to improving our understanding of the mechanisms of charge transfer in upward lightning flashes.</description>

      <title>Fast, Scale-Adaptive, and Uncertainty-Aware Downscaling of Earth System Model Fields with Generative Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02774v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution Earth system model (ESM) simulations are essential to assess the ecological and socio-economic impacts of anthropogenic climate change, but are computationally too expensive to be run at sufficiently high spatial resolution. Recent machine learning approaches have shown promising results in downscaling ESM simulations, outperforming state-of-the-art statistical approaches. However, existing methods require computationally costly retraining for each ESM and extrapolate poorly to climates unseen during training. We address these shortcomings by learning a consistency model (CM) that efficiently and accurately downscales arbitrary ESM simulations without retraining in a zero-shot manner. Our approach yields probabilistic downscaled fields at a resolution only limited by the observational reference data. We show that the CM outperforms state-of-the-art diffusion models at a fraction of computational cost while maintaining high controllability on the downscaling task. Further, our method generalizes to climate states unseen during training without explicitly formulated physical constraints.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric stability sets maximum moist heat and convection in the midlatitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme moist heatwaves pose a serious threat to society and human health. To manage heat-related risks, it is crucial to improve our understanding of what sets the maximum moist heat. This question has been extensively studied for moist heat in the tropics under the assumption of moist neutrality, but it remains less explored over midlatitude continents, where this assumption is not applicable. The frequent concurrent occurrence of extreme moist heat and intense convection over midlatitude land reinforces the prevailing hypothesis that deep convection terminates heatwaves and sets their peak intensity. Here, a theory is developed based on the onset of convection to provide a theoretical prediction for both the maximum near-surface moist heat and potential convection over midlatitude land. Our framework demonstrates that the intensities of moist heat and convection are constrained by a preexisting energy barrier in the lower free troposphere, which suppresses convection and enables the buildup of moist heat and convective instability. This barrier, often marked by a temperature or energy inversion, varies only slightly during moist heatwave evolution. Our results suggest the potential to predict maximum moist heat and convection from predefined lower free tropospheric properties and offer insights into the evolution of extreme heat and convection across climate states.</description>
