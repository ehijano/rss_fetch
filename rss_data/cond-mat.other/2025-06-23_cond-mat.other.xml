      <title>The influence of nitrogen doping and annealing on the silicon vacancy in 4H-SiC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The silicon vacancy ($V_{Si}$) in 4H-SiC at its cubic site (V2-center) has shown significant promise for quantum technologies, due to coherent spin states, the mature material system, and stable optical emission. In these SiC-based applications, doping plays a crucial role. It can be used to control the charge state of $V_{Si}$ and formation of different types of defects. Despite its importance, there has been little research on the effects of doping. In this work, we perform a study of the effects of nitrogen doping and annealing on the photoluminescence (PL), optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) contrast, and dephasing times of ensembles of V2 in epilayers of 4H-SiC. The results show an enhancement of PL that depends on the electron irradiation dose for a given electron concentration, supported by theoretical modeling of the charge state of $V_{Si}$ in the presence of nitrogen. Nitrogen substituted for carbon is shown to very efficiently donate one electron to $V_{Si}$. We also observe that the ODMR contrast can be increased from 0.5% in low doped SiC to 1.5% by nitrogen doping of $10^{17}$ to $10^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$ and annealing at 500-600 $^{\circ}$C for 1 hour, with only a 20% decrease in PL compared to unannealed. Some of the improvement in contrast is offset by a reduction in $T_2^*$ at these doping levels, but the estimated cw ODMR shot-noise limited sensitivity is still 1.6 times higher than that of undoped, unannealed SiC.</description>

      <title>The physics, travels, and tribulations of Ronald Wilfrid Gurney</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ronald Wilfrid Gurney is one of the lesser-known research students of the Cavendish Laboratory in the mid 1920s. Gurney made significant contributions to the application of quantum mechanics to problems related to tunneling of alpha-particles from nuclei, to formation of images in photographic plates, the understanding of the origin of color-centres in salt crystals, and in the theory of semiconductors. He was the first physicist to apply quantum mechanics to the theory of electrochemistry and ionic solutions. He also made fundamental contributions to ballistics research. Gurney wrote a number of textbooks on fundamental and applied quantum mechanics in a distinctive style which are still useful as educational resources. In addition to his scientific contributions, he travelled extensively, and during and after World War II worked in the United States. During the cold war, he got entangled in the Klaus Fuchs affair and lost his employment. He died at the age of 54 in 1953 from a stroke. With the approach of the 100th year anniversary of quantum mechanics, it is timely to commemorate the life and contributions of this somewhat forgotten physicist.</description>

      <title>Filtering Spin and Orbital Moment in Centrosymmetric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10773v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of spin and orbital angular momentum without relying on magnetic materials is commonly accomplished by breaking of inversion symmetry, which enables charge-to-spin conversion and spin selectivity in electron transfer processes occurring in chiral media. In contrast to this perspective, we show that orbital moment filtering can be accomplished in centrosymmetric systems: the electron states can be selectively manipulated allowing for the preferential transfer of electrons with a particular orbital momentum orientation. We find that orbital moment filtering is indeed efficiently controlled through orbital couplings that break both mirror and rotational symmetries. We provide the symmetry conditions required for the electron transmission to achieve orbital filtering and relate them to the orientation of the orbital moment. The presence of atomic spin-orbit interaction in the centrosymmetric transmission medium leads to the selective filtering of spin and orbital moments. Our findings allow to identify optimal regimes for having highly efficient simultaneous spin and orbital moment filtering.</description>

      <title>Area laws and tensor networks for maximally mixed ground states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show an area law in the mutual information for the
  maximally-mixed state $\Omega$ in the ground space of general
  Hamiltonians, which is independent of the underlying ground space
  degeneracy. Our result assumes the existence of a `good'
  approximation to the ground state projector (a good AGSP), a
  crucial ingredient in previous area-law proofs. Such approximations
  have been explicitly derived for 1D gapped local Hamiltonians and
  2D frustration-free locally-gapped Hamiltonians. As a
  corollary, we show that in 1D gapped local Hamiltonians, for any
  $\varepsilon&gt;0$ and any bi-partition $L\cup L^c$ of the system,
  \begin{align*}
  \mathrm I_{\max}^\varepsilon (L:L^c)_{\Omega} \le \mathrm O \big( \log (|L|\log(d))+\log(1/\varepsilon)\big),
  \end{align*}
  where $|L|$ represents the number of sites in $L$, $d$ is the dimension of a site and
  $ \mathrm I_{\max}^\varepsilon (L:L^c)_{\Omega} $ represents the $\varepsilon$-\emph{smoothed
  maximum mutual information} with respect to the $L:L^c$ partition
  in $\Omega$. From this bound we then conclude $\mathrm I (L:L^c)_\Omega
  \le \mathrm O\big(\log(|L|\log(d))\big)$ -- an area law for the mutual information in
  1D systems with a logarithmic correction. In addition, we show
  that $\Omega$ can be approximated in trace norm up to $\varepsilon$ with
  a state of Schmidt rank of at most $\mathrm{poly}(|L|/\varepsilon)$, leading to
  a good MPO approximation for $\Omega$ with polynomial bond
  dimension. Similar corollaries are derived for the mutual
  information of 2D frustration-free and locally-gapped local
  Hamiltonians.</description>
