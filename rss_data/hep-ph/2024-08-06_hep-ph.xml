      <title>Magnets are Weber Bar Gravitational Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a gravitational wave (GW) passes through a DC magnetic field, it couples to the conducting wires carrying the currents which generate the magnetic field, causing them to oscillate at the GW frequency. The oscillating currents then generate an AC component through which the GW can be detected - thus forming a resonant mass detector or a Magnetic Weber Bar. We quantify this claim and demonstrate that magnets can have exceptional sensitivity to GWs over a frequency range demarcated by the mechanical and electromagnetic resonant frequencies of the system; indeed, we outline why a magnetic readout strategy can be considered an optimal Weber bar design. The concept is applicable to a broad class of magnets, but can be particularly well exploited by the powerful magnets being deployed in search of axion dark matter, for example by DMRadio and ADMX-EFR. Explicitly, we demonstrate that the MRI magnet that is being deployed for ADMX-EFR can achieve a broadband GW strain sensitivity of $\sim$$10^{-20}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ from a few kHz to about 10 MHz, with a peak sensitivity down to $\sim$$10^{-22}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at a kHz exploiting a mechanical resonance.</description>

      <title>Old neutron stars as a new probe of relic neutrinos and sterile neutrino dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the kinetic cooling (heating) of old neutron stars due to coherent scattering with relic neutrinos (sterile neutrino dark matter) via Standard Model neutral-current interactions. We take into account several important physical effects, such as gravitational clustering, coherent enhancement, neutron degeneracy and Pauli blocking. We find that the anomalous cooling of nearby neutron stars due to relic neutrino scattering might actually be observable by current and future telescopes operating in the optical to near-infrared frequency band, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), provided there is a large local relic overdensity that is still allowed. Similarly, the anomalous heating of neutron stars due to coherent scattering with keV-scale sterile neutrino dark matter, could also be observed by JWST or future telescopes, which would probe hitherto unexplored parameter space in the sterile neutrino mass-mixing plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiable programming opens exciting new avenues in particle physics, also affecting future event generators. These new techniques boost the performance of current and planned MadGraph implementations. Combining phase-space mappings with a set of very small learnable flow elements, MadNIS-Lite, can improve the sampling efficiency while being physically interpretable. This defines a third sampling strategy, complementing VEGAS and the full MadNIS.</description>

      <title>Restricting Sterile Neutrinos by Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bounds on parameters of the eV and higher scale sterile neutrinos from the $0\nu \beta \beta$ decay have been refined and updated. We present a simple and compact analytic expression for the bound in the $\Delta m^2_{41} - \sin^2 2\theta_{14}$ plane, which includes all relevant parameters. Dependencies of the bound on unknown CP-phases and the type of mass spectrum of light neutrinos (mass ordering and level of degeneracy) are studied in detail. We have computed the bounds using the latest and most stringent data from KamLAND-Zen. The projected constraints from future experiments are estimated. The obtained bounds are confronted with positive indications of the presence of sterile neutrinos as well as with the other existing bounds. The $0\nu \beta \beta$ decay results exclude the regions of parameters implied by BEST and Neutrino-4, and the regions indicated by LSND and MiniBooNE are in conflict with $0\nu \beta \beta$ results combined with $\nu_\mu-$ disappearance bounds.</description>

      <title>Neutron Stars as a Probe of Cosmic Neutrino Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B) constitutes the last observable prediction of the standard cosmological model, which has yet to be detected directly. In this work, we show how the coherent scattering of neutrinos off dense neutron matter can lead to an additional cooling channel in neutron stars (NSs). We also include the effects of gravitational capture and boosting, but find that the cooling is efficient only in the presence of large overdensities. We further discuss the impact of boosted C$\nu$B flux on Earth from nearby NSs and the potential detection prospects in the case of a future nearby galactic supernova. Although currently these ideas do not offer any detection prospects, they can be used to constrain overdensities on short length scales $\mathcal{O}(10\text{ km})$. We also discuss the impact of new physics scenarios, such as long-range forces, on neutron star cooling through the C$\nu$B.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of an Extended $1+2$ Higgs Doublet Model with $S_3$ Family Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to explain the mass hierarchy and mixing pattern in the leptonic sector, we explore an extension of the Standard Model whose scalar sector includes one active and two inert doublets as well as some scalar singlets. The model includes a $S_3$ family symmetry supplemented by extra cyclic symmetries. As a consequence of our construction, a Dark Matter (DM) candidate is predicted and its properties are consistent with the observed cosmic abundances and the constraints imposed by direct and indirect detection experiments. The model allows Charged Lepton Flavor Violation (CLFV) processes like $\mu \rightarrow e\gamma$ and $\mu \rightarrow 3e$, but the predicted branching ratios align with experimental limits. Additionally, our analysis elucidates the generation of the active neutrino masses through a one-loop radiative seesaw mechanism matching the observed neutrino oscillation data. The model agrees with experimental data on Higgs Diphoton decay rates and on oblique parameters.</description>

      <title>A novel global charge conservation in the symmetric phase of the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Standard Model at high temperatures, anomalous effects contribute to the violation of baryon number ($B$) and lepton number ($L$), separately, while $B-L$ remains conserved. There are also corresponding changes in the helicity of the hypermagnetic field ($h$) and the Chern-Simons numbers of the non-Abelian gauge fields ($N_{\rm CS,W}$ and $N_{\rm CS,S}$). In this study, we investigate a baryogenesis process in the symmetric phase of the early Universe by taking into account the Abelian and non-Abelian anomalous effects as well as the perturbative chirality-flip processes of all fermions. We calculate explicitly the time evolution of all relevant physical quantities, including those of $h$ and $N_{\rm CS,W}$, and show that there is another conserved global charge involving total matter-antimatter asymmetry $B+L$, hypermagnetic helicity $h_B$ and $N_{\rm CS,W}$.</description>

      <title>Investigating Lorentz Invariance Violation Effects on CP Violation and Mass Hierarchy sensitivity at DUNE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the current goals of neutrino experiments is to precisely determine standard unknown oscillation parameters such as the leptonic CP phase and mass hierarchy. Lorentz invariance violation represents a potential physics factor that could influence the experiment's ability to achieve these precise determinations. This study investigates the influence of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) on oscillation dynamics, particularly through non-isotropic CPT-violating ($a^{X}_{e\mu}$, $a^{X}_{e\tau}$, $a^{X}_{\mu\tau}$) and CPT-conserving ($c^{XY}_{e\mu}$, $c^{XY}_{e \tau}$, $c^{XY}_{\mu \tau}$) parameters within the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE). We analyze the impact of these parameters on the mass hierarchy (MH) and Dirac CP phase sensitivity measurements. Our findings indicate that while MH sensitivity remains relatively unaffected, only the presence of $c^{XY}_{\mu \tau}$ significantly deteriorates MH sensitivity, albeit remaining above the $5 \sigma$ threshold. Additionally, we observe a substantial compromise in CP sensitivity due to the $c^{XY}_{e \mu}$ and $c^{XY}_{e \tau}$ parameters.</description>

      <title>A Superconducting Levitated Detector of Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A magnetically levitated mass couples to gravity and can act as an effective gravitational wave detector. We show that a superconducting sphere levitated in a quadrupolar magnetic field, when excited by a gravitational wave, will produce magnetic field fluctuations that can be read out using a flux tunable microwave resonator. With a readout operating at the standard quantum limit, such a system could achieve broadband strain noise sensitivity of $h \lesssim 10^{-19}/\sqrt{\rm Hz}$ for frequencies of $10~\mathrm{kHz}~-~1~\mathrm{MHz}$, opening new corridors for astrophysical probes of new physics.</description>

      <title>The charge and magnetic radii of the nucleons from the generalized parton distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proton-radius puzzle refers to the discrepancy observed in measurements of the proton's charge radius when using different methods. This inconsistency has prompted extensive research and debate within the physics community, as it challenges the understanding of quantum electrodynamics and the fundamental properties of protons. In the present study, we determine the charge and magnetic radii of the proton and neutron through a global analysis of the generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at zero skewness for the first time. Our results challenge the measurements or analyses in which the nucleon's radii are extracted considering just a particular experiment or observable, or using only data points covering particular kinematic regions. We emphasize that simultaneous analysis of all available experimental data related to the radii of the nucleons would be preferable to determine their exact values. The final results obtained from our analysis by this way are: $ r_{pE} = 0.8558 \pm 0.0135~\textrm{fm} $, $ r_{pM} = 0.8268 \pm 0.0533~\textrm{fm} $, $ \left&lt;r_{nE}^2\right&gt; = -0.1181 \pm 0.0270~\textrm{fm}^2 $, and $ r_{nM} = 0.8367 \pm 0.0845~\textrm{fm} $.</description>

      <title>A new probe of dark matter-baryon interactions in compact stellar systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the astrophysical consequences of an attractive long-range interaction between dark matter and baryonic matter. Our study highlights the role of this interaction in inducing dynamical friction between dark matter and stars, which can significantly influence the evolution of compact stellar systems. Using the star cluster in Eridanus II as a case study, we derive a new stringent upper bound on the interaction strength $\tilde{\alpha}\leq 333.7$ for the interaction range $\lambda = 1$ pc. This constraint is independent of the dark matter mass and can improve the existing model-independent limits on $\tilde{\alpha}$ by a few orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we observe that the constraint is insensitive to the mass of the stellar system and the dark matter density in the stellar system as long as the system is dark matter dominated. This new approach can be applied to many other stellar systems, and we obtain comparable constraints from compact stellar halos observed in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies.</description>

      <title>Exclusive photoproduction of $\eta_{c}\gamma$ pairs with large invariant mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this preprint we analyzed the exclusive photoproduction of $\eta_{c}\gamma$ pairs in the collinear factorization framework and evaluated its cross-section in leading order in the strong coupling $\alpha_{s}$. We found that this process is mostly sensitive to the behavior of the unpolarized gluon GPD $H_{g}$ in the Efremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-Lepage kinematics. We estimated numerically the cross-section and the expected counting rates in the kinematics of middle-energy photoproduction experiments which can be realized at the future Electron-Ion Collider and in the kinematics of ultraperipheral collisions at LHC. We found that the cross-section is sufficiently large for dedicated experimental study.</description>

      <title>An evidence of pion condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pion condensation is a theoretical prediction, where pions form a special state of matter under certain extreme conditions in heavy ion collisions or neutron stars. However, there is currently no solid experimental evidence confirming the existence of pion condensation. We present a near-direct evidence for the existence of pion condensation. In actively changing galactic processes protons can be accelerated to very high energies and collide with the medium (protons or nuclei). The kinetic energy of the protons is mainly used to produce a large number of pions in the central region via gluons. When the collision energy exceeds a certain threshold, the huge amount of soft gluons condensed in protons pour into the central region, the number of pion increases abruptly to the saturation limit, and almost all the available collision energy is used to make pions, creating a dense, low-temperature pion condensation environment. Due to energy conservation and relativistic covariance, the gamma ray spectra produced by condensed pions exhibit recognizable broken power law with the gluon condensation characteristics. We find that they are already present in many recorded gamma ray spectra. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism for the generation of pion condensation, which is prevalent in the formation of high-energy cosmic rays, and deepen our understanding of related topics in a variety of disciplines, including particle physics, astrophysics, condensed matter physics and nuclear physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The article describes Boltzmann equations for a potential case of multi-particle dark matter with symmetric and asymmetric dark matter components in a model-independent approach. We focus on the specific scenario where one of the DM candidates remains completely invisible, having only hidden sector interactions with the other dark matter constituent referred to as ``dark annihilation". The possible effect of non-standard expansion of the universe on the dark matter abundance is also taken into account.</description>

Abstract: Odderon is the C-odd amplitude which does not die out (or die very slowly) with energy. We consider the constrains on the Odderon properties and the perturbative QCD Odderon given at the lowest $\alpha_s$ order by the three gluon exchange. Then we discuss the experimental indications for the Odderon contribution to high energy proton-proton elastic scattering and some other processes in which the Odderon may reveal itself.</description>

      <title>Topological diagram analysis of $\mathcal{B}_{c\overline 3}\to \mathcal{B}_{10}M$ decays in the $SU(3)_F$ limit and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Charm baryon decay plays an important role in studying non-perturbative baryonic transition. Compared to other hadron multiplets, the flavor symmetry of baryon decuplet is more simple and attractive. In this work, we study the topological amplitudes of charmed baryon decays into decuplet baryon in the flavor symmetry and the linear $SU(3)_F$ breaking. It is found most of topological diagrams are suppressed by the Korner-Pati-Woo theorem in the $SU(3)_F$ limit. Only two independent amplitudes contributing to the $\mathcal{B}_{c\overline 3}\to \mathcal{B}_{10}M$ decays and one of them is dominated in the branching fractions. The Lee-Yang parameters of all $\mathcal{B}_{c\overline 3}\to \mathcal{B}_{10}M$ modes are the same in the $SU(3)_F$ limit, and there are only four possible values for the CP asymmetries. After including the first-order $SU(3)_F$ breaking effects, the $\Xi^+_c\to \Sigma^{* +}\overline K^0$ and $\Xi^+_c\to \Xi^{* 0}\pi^+$ decays have non-zero branching fractions. The amount of free parameters contributing to the $\mathcal{B}_{c\overline 3}\to \mathcal{B}_{10}M$ decays in the linear $SU(3)_F$ breaking is smaller than the available data. The $SU(3)_F$ breaking part of quark loop diagram can be extracted by a global fitting of branching fractions, which could help us to understand the CP violation in charm sector. Besides, some new isospin equations are proposed to test the Korner-Pati-Woo theorem and the isospin symmetry.</description>

      <title>Decoding the gaugino code, naturally, at high-lumi LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural supersymmetry with light higgsinos is most likely to emerge from the string landscape since the volume of scan parameter space shrinks to tiny volumes for electroweak unnatural models. Rather general arguments favor a landscape selection of soft SUSY breaking terms tilted to large values, but tempered by the atomic principle: that the derived value of the weak scale in each pocket universe lie not too far from its measured value in our universe. But that leaves (at least) three different paradigms for gaugino masses in natural SUSY models: unified (as in nonuniversal Higgs models), anomaly-mediation form (as in natural AMSB) and mirage mediation form (with comparable moduli- and anomaly-mediated contributions). We perform landscape scans for each of these, and show they populate different, but overlapping, positions in m(\ell\bar{\ell}) and m(wino) space. The first of these may be directly measurable at high-lumi LHC via the soft opposite-sign dilepton plus jets plus MET signature arising from higgsino pair production while the second of these could be extracted from direct wino pair production leading to same-sign diboson production.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the parameters of the neutrino extension of the Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are hypothetical particles proposed as a potential explanation for neutrino oscillations and the generation of the baryon asymmetry in the Universe. This paper focuses on HNLs with masses significantly above the electroweak scale. It is challenging to test for the presence of such particles directly. However, they leave behind effective interactions of Standard Model particles, leading in particular to charged lepton flavor violation (cLFV) processes. Non-observation of cLFV processes puts therefore constraints on the parameters of the HNLs. In this paper, we find the relations between the effective operators in the realistic case when neutrino masses are non-zero and the HNLs are non-degenerate. This allows us to strengthen the existing cLFV constraints. We also link the baryon asymmetry of the Universe to the same higher-dimensional effective operators, providing complementary bounds on these parameters.</description>

      <title>Fant\^omas4QCD: pion PDFs with epistemic uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these proceedings, we reiterate and extend the discussion of the Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) QCD analysis of the charged pion Parton Distribution Function (PDF) obtained within the Fant\^omas4QCD framework. The goal of the Fant\^omas analysis is to quantify the dependence on the parametrization form in global QCD analyses, with a first application to the pion PDFs. We highlight the anti-correlation between the experimentally allowed gluon and sea distributions in the pion, as made apparent by the sampling over parametrization forms. This result, for the sea and gluon sector, illustrates the importance of accounting for epistemic uncertainties in data-driven QCD analyses. In that regard, we further discuss the meaning of the sampling uncertainty and why it is key in phenomenological studies of hadron structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analytical method to calculate the three-loop massive Feynman integral in arbitrary dimensions. The method is based on the Mellin-Barnes representation of the Feynman integral. The Meijer theorem and its corollary are used to perform the integration over the Gamma functions, exponential functions, and hypergeometric functions. We also discuss the application of the method in other multi-loop Feynman integrals.</description>

      <title>Exploring a Gauge Horizontal Model for Charged Fermion Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate an extension of the Standard Model (SM) incorporating a gauge $ U(1) $ horizontal symmetry that is free of anomalies. This extension introduces four additional un-Higgsed scalar doublets that do not develop vacuum expectation values, two scalar singlets, and a pair of vector-like fermionic singlets. Within this framework, the masses of third-generation charged fermions are generated through the conventional SM Yukawa interactions, while the masses of second-generation charged fermions are suppressed via a mechanism reminiscent of Froggatt-Nielsen. In contrast, the masses of first-generation charged fermions are predominantly determined by radiative corrections.
  Unlike traditional implementations of the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism, our model does not require additional colored vector or chiral fermions beyond the SM. This model provides an economical ultraviolet-complete mechanism to explain the observed patterns in charged fermion masses and Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix elements. Notably, the electron electric dipole moment vanishes automatically at the two-loop level, and there is no charged lepton flavor violation to all orders. We also discuss potential experimental signatures that could distinguish this model from other $ Z' $ models, such as specific patterns in gauge boson decays and associated collider signatures.</description>

      <title>Reduced cross section and gluon distribution in momentum space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a calculation of the reduced cross section in momentum space utilizing the Block-Durand-Ha (BDH) parameterization of the proton structure function $F_{2}(x,Q^2)$ and the leading-order (LO) longitudinal structure function $F_{L}(x,Q^2)$, proposed by Boroun and Ha [G.R. Boroun and P.Ha, Phys. Rev. D {\bf 109} (2024) 094037] using Laplace transform techniques. Our results are compared with the HERA I (H1) data and extended to the Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC) domain. We also examine the ratio $F_{L2}(x, Q^2)=F_{L}(x, Q^2)/F_{2}(x, Q^2)$ obtained from our work, comparing it with both the H1 data and the color dipole (CDP) bounds. We find that our results for the reduced cross section and the ratio $F_{L2}(x, Q^2)$ agree with the H1 data. Finally, our evaluation of the gluon distribution functions $G(x,Q^2)$ in momentum space shows very good concordance with the NNPDF3.0LO gluon structure functions for moderate $Q^2$ in the range $10^{-5}{\leq}x{\leq}1$.</description>

      <title>Effect of anomalous $HHH$ and $ZZHH$ couplings on the decay width of $H\rightarrow \nu_e\bar{\nu}_e\nu_\mu\bar{\nu}_\mu$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the discovery of the Higgs boson, the Higgs sector of the standard model is still not fully established. In particular, the self couplings of the Higgs boson, and its couplings with gauge bosons, are still to be fully determined. We consider electroweak corrections to the process $H\rightarrow \nu_e\bar{\nu}_e\nu_\mu\bar{\nu}_\mu$. The corrections depend on the $HHH$ and $ZZHH$ couplings. We investigate this dependence in $\kappa$-framework. We find that the width depends on $HHH$ coupling significantly. The dependence on $ZZHH$ coupling is only marginal. We also discuss the dependence on $ZZWW$ coupling.</description>

      <title>Cosmology and Astrophysics of CP-Violating Axions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the cosmology and astrophysics of axion-like particles (ALPs) with CP-violating Yukawa couplings to nucleons. At finite nucleon density, the ALP's dynamics is governed by an effective potential which is the sum of the bare periodic potential and a linear potential whose strength depends on the nucleon density. We identify a critical nucleon density $\rho_c$ controlling the dynamics. At densities smaller than $\rho_c$ the effective potential is a tilted sinusoidal curve and the field is displaced from its zero-density minimum. At densities larger than $\rho_c$ the minima (and maxima) are absent, and the ALP is destabilized. Astrophysically, this implies that neutron stars can source a radial ALP field, providing a complementary probe to equivalence principle tests. Cosmologically, the ALP may have been destabilized in the early Universe and could have made large field excursions. We discuss model-building applications of our results for such early universe scenarios.</description>

      <title>Impact of the Electroweak Weinberg Operator on the Electric Dipole Moment of Electron</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent progresses in the measurements of the electric dipole moment (EDM) of the electron using the paramagnetic atom or molecule are remarkable. In this paper, we calculate a contribution to the electron EDM at three-loop level, introducing the CP-violating Yukawa couplings of new SU(2)$_L$ multiplets. At two-loop level, the Yukawa interactions generate a CP-violating dimension-six operator, composed of three SU(2)$_L$ field strengths, called the electroweak Weinberg operator. Another one-loop diagram with the operator inserted induces the electron EDM. We find that even if new SU(2)$_L$ particles have masses around TeV-scale, the electron EDM may be larger than the Standard Model contribution to the paramagnetic atom or molecule EDMs. We also discuss the relation between the Barr-Zee diagram contribution at two-loop level and the three-loop one, assuming that the SM Higgs has new Yukawa interactions with the SU(2)$_L$ multiplets.</description>

      <title>Study of lepton flavor universality and angular distributions in $D\to K^*_{J} (\to K\pi)\ell\nu_{\ell}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The decay of the D meson into multibody final states is a complex process that provides valuable insights into the fundamental interactions within the Standard Model of particle physics. This study focuses on the decay cascade $D^{+}\to K^{*}_{J} \ell^{+}\nu \to K^{\pm}\pi^{\mp} \ell^{+}\nu$ where the $K^*_J$ resonance encompasses the $K^*(892),K^{*}(1410),K^{*}_0(1430)$ states. We employ the helicity amplitude technique to derive the angular distributions for the decay chain, enabling the extraction of one-dimensional and two-dimensional distributions. Utilizing form factors for the $D\to K^*$ transition derived from the quark model, we calculate the differential and integrated partial decay widths, explicitly considering the electron and muon masses.
  Decay branching fractions are calculated, the ratios of the branching fractions are found to be $\frac{\mathcal{B}r(D^{+}\to K^{*}(892)(\to K ^{-}\pi^{+}) \, \mu^{+}\nu_{\mu})}{\mathcal{B}r(D^{+}\to K^{*}(892)(\to K ^{-}\pi^{+}) \, e^{+}\nu_{e})} = 0.975$, $\frac{\mathcal{B}r(D^{+}\to K^{*}(1410)(\to K ^{-}\pi^{+}) \, \mu^{+}\nu_{\mu})}{\mathcal{B}r(D^{+}\to K^{*}(1410)(\to K ^{-}\pi^{+}) \, e^{+}\nu_{e})} = 0.714$ and $\frac{\mathcal{B}r(D^{+}\to K^{*}_{0}(1430)(\to K ^{+}\pi^{-}) \, \mu^{+}\nu_{\mu})}{\mathcal{B}r(D^{+}\to K^{*}_{0}(1430)(\to K ^{+}\pi^{-}) \, e^{+}\nu_{e})} = 0.774$. Results in this work will serve a calibration for the study of $c \to s $ in $D$ meson decays in future and provide useful information towards the understanding of the properties of the $K^{*}$ meson, as well as $K \pi$ system.</description>

      <title>The Fate of Weakly Bound Light Nuclei in Central Collider Experiments: a Challenge in Favor of a Late Continuous Decoupling Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arguments are presented that the reaction products of central high energy nuclear collisions up to collider energies can rigorously be interpreted in terms of a continuous decoupling mechanism based on continuous equations of motion. The various aspects of the collision dynamics are investigate in terms of the individual decoupling processes. Thereby each observed particle decouples during its own temporal decoupling window. This includes a ``very late'' decoupling of the faintly bound Hypertritons observed in recent ALICE experiments. The success of the strategy relays on 200 years old wisdom and leads to a revised interpretation of the entire decoupling process.</description>

      <title>AC Currents from Gravitational Waves in Plasma Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that gravitational waves can induce electromagnetic perturbations in magnetised plasmas, with production occurring via the direct coupling of gravitational waves to the background magnetic field: this is the so-called Gertsenshtein effect. In this short work, we consider the direct gravitational perturbations of charge carriers via their minimal coupling to gravity in a collisionless plasma. We find that for isotropic plasmas, no secondary plasma perturbations are generated. However, when an anisotropy is introduced in the form of a background plasma current, we find that gravitational waves can induce a secondary current. For a constant DC background current, the secondary current inherits the AC frequency of the gravitational waves. It will certainly be interesting to investigate this effect in astrophysical plasmas in future work as well as its wider phenomenological consequences.</description>

      <title>Searching for dark matter with a 1000 km baseline interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) arise from well-motivated extensions to the Standard Model and could account for dark matter. ALP dark matter would manifest as a nearly monochromatic field oscillating at an (as of yet) unknown frequency. The frequency depends on the ALP mass, which could plausibly range from $10^{-22}$ eV/$c^2$ to $10$ eV/$c^2$. We report on a direct search for ALP dark matter through the ALP-nucleon interaction by interfering the signals of two atomic K-Rb-$^3$He comagnetometers, with one situated in Mainz, Germany, and the other in Krak\'ow, Poland. We use the ALP dark matter's spatiotemporal coherence properties assuming the standard halo model of dark matter in the Milky Way to improve the sensitivity and exclude spurious candidates. The search extends over nine orders of magnitude in ALP mass. In this range, no significant evidence of an ALP signal is found. We thus place new upper limits on the ALP-neutron and ALP-proton couplings of $g_{aNN}&lt;10^{-5}$ GeV$^{-1}$ and $g_{aPP}&lt;5 \times 10^{-4}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at a mass of $10^{-22}$ eV/$c^2$ and extending to a mass of $10^{-15}$ eV/$c^2$ where the upper limits reach below $g_{aNN}&lt;10^{-9}$ GeV$^{-1}$ and $g_{aPP}&lt;10^{-7}$ GeV$^{-1}$, respectively. For both neutron and proton couplings, this work is an improvement of up to four orders of magnitude compared to previous laboratory constraints.</description>

      <title>On the Generality and Persistence of Cosmological Stasis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical decays of $N$ matter species to radiation may balance against Hubble expansion to yield stasis, a new phase of cosmological evolution with constant matter and radiation abundances. We analyze stasis with various machine learning techniques on the full $2N$-dimensional space of decay rates and abundances, which serve as inputs to the system of Boltzmann equations that governs the dynamics. We construct a differentiable Boltzmann solver to maximize the number of stasis $e$-folds $\mathcal{N}$. High-stasis configurations obtained by gradient ascent motivate log-uniform distributions on rates and abundances to accompany power-law distributions of previous works. We demonstrate that random configurations drawn from these families of distributions regularly exhibit many $e$-folds of stasis. We additionally use them as priors in a Bayesian analysis conditioned on stasis, using stochastic variational inference with normalizing flows to model the posterior. All three numerical analyses demonstrate the generality of stasis and point to a new model in which the rates and abundances are exponential in the species index. We show that the exponential model solves the exact stasis equations, is an attractor, and satisfies $\mathcal{N}\propto N$, exhibiting inflation-level $e$-folding with a relatively low number of species. This is contrasted with the $\mathcal{N}\propto \log(N)$ scaling of power-law models. Finally, we discuss implications for the emergent string conjecture and string axiverse.</description>

      <title>An Infrared On-Shell Action and its Implications for Soft Charge Fluctuations in Asymptotically Flat Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the infrared on-shell action of Einstein gravity in asymptotically flat spacetimes, obtaining an effective, gauge-invariant boundary action for memory and shockwave spacetimes. We show that the phase space is in both cases parameterized by the leading soft variables in asymptotically flat spacetimes, thereby extending the equivalence between shockwave and soft commutators to spacetimes with non-vanishing Bondi mass. We then demonstrate that our on-shell action is equal to three quantities studied separately in the literature: $(i)$ the soft supertranslation charge; $(ii)$ the shockwave effective action, or equivalently the modular Hamiltonian; and $(iii)$ the soft effective action. Finally, we compute the quantum fluctuations in the soft supertranslation charge and, assuming the supertranslation parameter may be promoted to an operator, we obtain an area law, consistent with earlier results showing that the modular Hamiltonian has such fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Jet-Induced Enhancement of Deuteron Production in $pp$ and $p$-Pb Collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet-associated deuteron production in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and $p$-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02$ TeV is studied in the coalescence model by using the phase-space information of proton and neutron pairs from a multiphase transport (AMPT) model at the kinetic freezeout. In the low transverse momentum ($p_T$) region $p_T/A &lt; 1.5$ GeV/$c$, where $A$ is the mass number of a nucleus, the in-jet coalescence factor $B_2^\text{In-jet}$ for deuteron production, given by the ratio of the in-jet deuteron number to the square of the in-jet proton number, is found to be larger than the coalescence factor $B_2$ in the medium perpendicular to the jet by a factor of about 10 in $pp$ collisions and of 25 in $p-$Pb collisions, which are consistent with the ALICE measurements at the LHC. Such large low-momentum enhancements mainly come from coalescence of nucleons inside the jet with the medium nucleons. Coalescence of nucleons inside the jet dominates deuteron production only at the higher $p_T$ region of $p_T/A\gtrsim 4$ GeV/$c$, where both the yield ratio $d/p$ of deuteron to proton numbers and the $B_2$ are also significantly larger in the jet direction than in the direction perpendicular to the jet due to the strong collinear correlation among particles produced from jet fragmentation. Studying jet-associated deuteron production in relativistic nuclear collisions thus opens up a new window to probe the phase-space structure of nucleons inside jets.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the linear cosmological perturbations in the context of the so-called energy-momentum squared gravity (EMSG) theory. Recent researches show that the EMSG theory can reproduce viable background cosmological evolution comparable to $\Lambda$CDM, while the matter-dominated era exhibits slight distinctions. In this paper, we mainly focus on the power-law EMSG models and derive the equations for the linear cosmological perturbations. We explore the propagation of the gravitational wave (GW) and the growth of matter density perturbation at the first order, and estimate the model parameters from the simulated GW data and the observed redshift space distortion data. Our analysis reveals that the model parameters should be small and positive in $1\sigma$ confidence interval, which indicates that the theory is in good agreement with the observational data and can be regarded as an alternative for the standard cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Reproduction of NGC1052-DF4 by self-interacting dark matter: dark matter deficiency and tidal features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of the velocity dispersion indicate a severe dark matter (DM) deficit in the ultra-diffuse galaxy, NGC1052-DF4 (DF4). The ultra-deep images obtained with the Gemini telescope, which has the deepest imaging data till now, confirm the presence of tidal tails in DF4, suggesting its tidal formation. To enhance tidal effects, we consider the self-interaction among DM particles. Using an N-body simulation in the scenario of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM), we reproduce a DM-deficient galaxy that is consistent with all observational data of DF4. Specifically, our simulation result yields an extremely low DM-to-star mass ratio and a radial surface brightness profile very similar to that from deep images, showing accurate tidal features. By performing simulations with similar tidal effects and various cross-sections of SIDM, we show a significant impact of SIDM on the DM-to-star mass ratio in the central region of the galaxy. Our work confirms the tidal formation of DF4 in theory.</description>

      <title>Linearized fluctuating hydrodynamics via random polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that an ensemble of backgrounds best understands hydrodynamic dispersion relations in a medium with few degrees of freedom and is therefore subject to strong thermal fluctuations. In the linearized regime, dispersion relations become describeable by polynomials with random coefficients. We give a short review of this theory and perform a numerical study of the distribution of the roots of polynomials whose coefficients are of the order of a Knudsen series but fluctuate in accordance with canonical fluctuations of temperature. We find that, remarkably, the analytic structure of the poles of fluctuating dispersion relations is very different from deterministic ones, particularly regarding the distribution of imaginary parts with respect to real components. We argue that this provides evidence that hydrodynamic behavior persists, and is enhanced, by non-perturbative background fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Resonant excitation of eccentricity in spherical extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational radiation reaction, has been one of the fundamental issues in general relativity. Over a span of decades, this process has been analyzed in the adiabatic limit, in order to comprehend how it drives extreme-mass-ratio binaries, that are prime targets for space-borne detectors. It has been shown that spherical orbits around Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes remain spherical (zero eccentricity) under the influence of gravitational radiation reaction. Here, we show that spherical orbits in non-Kerr black holes, that still preserve most of the good qualities and symmetries of Kerr spacetime, can access certain resonances in such a way that an initially spherical inspiral acquires non-zero eccentricity and becomes non-spherical. Therefore, the crossing of resonances under radiation reaction interrupts and even inverts, up to some small radius close to plunge, the process of circularization of orbits. The strength of resonant excitation of eccentricity depends on the initial position and inclination of the integrable extreme-mass-ratio system, as well as the integrability-breaking parameter introduced in the background spacetime that amplifies further the excitation. We find that the harmonics of gravitational waves emitted from these inspirals undergo a frequency modulation as the orbit `metamorphoses' from spherical to non-spherical, due to the effect of resonant eccentricity excitation. The gain that low-amplitude harmonics experience in these oligochromatic EMRIs, due to resonances, may be detectable with future spaceborne detectors and serves as an indicator of non-Kerrness of the background spacetime.</description>

      <title>Highly excited $B$, $B_s$ and $B_c$ meson spectroscopy from lattice QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Excited state spectra of $B$, $B_s$ and $B_c$ mesons are computed using lattice QCD. Working with a large basis of carefully constructed, approximately-local $q\bar{q}$-like operators we determine a rich spectrum of states up to $J=4$ in $B, B_s$ and $B_c$, that can be grouped into patterns matching those of the quark model. In addition, hybrid-like states are identified at approximately 1500 MeV above the ground states in each of $B, B_s$ and $B_c$, in a multiplet pattern already found in similar computations at a range of quark masses spanning light to bottom. This study is performed using an anisotropic, relativistic Wilson-clover action at a single spatial lattice spacing of $a_s\approx 0.12$ fm and with a light-quark mass corresponding to $m_\pi\approx 391$ MeV. We find good agreement with experimental results where known and discuss prospects for further work in interesting $J^P$ quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>Correlation of neutrinoless double-beta decay nuclear matrix elements with nucleon-nucleon phase shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an ab initio study of the correlation between nuclear matrix elements of neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay and nucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts in the $^1S_0$ channel. Starting from thirty-four statistically weighted interactions derived from chiral effective field theory, we apply the valence-space in-medium similarity renormalization group to calculate nuclear matrix elements in four key experimental isotopes. Comparing with the $^1S_0$-channel phase shifts given from each interaction, in all cases we observe a strong correlation for scattering energies above 75 MeV. Furthermore, a global sensitivity analysis, enabled by newly developed machine-learning emulators, confirms that the nuclear matrix elements of the decay depend primarily on the $C_{1S0}$ low-energy constant, which is associated with the phase shifts in that partial wave. These results provide the first clear correlation between $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay nuclear matrix elements and a measured observable and will therefore serve as a crucial component in ongoing and future refinements of ab initio uncertainty estimates.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Emission from Cosmic String Loops, II: Local Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using lattice field simulations of the Abelian-Higgs model, we characterize the simultaneous emission of (scalar and gauge) particles and gravitational waves (GWs) by local string loops. We use {\it network} loops created in a phase transition, and {\it artificial} loops formed by either crossing straight-boosted or curved-static infinite strings. Loops decay via both particle and GW emission, on time scales $\Delta t_{\rm dec} \propto L^p$, where $L$ is the loop length. For particle production, we find $p \simeq 2$ for artificial loops and $p \lesssim 1$ for network loops, whilst for GW emission, we find $p \simeq 1$ for all loops. We find that below a critical length, artificial loops decay primarily through particle production, whilst for larger loops GW emission dominates. However, for network loops, which represent more realistic configurations, particle emission always dominates, as supported by our data with length-to-core ratios up to $L/r_\text{c} \lesssim 3500$. Our results indicate that the GW background from a local string network should be greatly suppressed compared to estimations that ignore particle emission.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric late-time expansion history reconstruction and implications for the Hubble tension in light of DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We non-parametrically reconstruct the late-time expansion history in light of the latest Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements from DESI combined with various Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) catalogs, using interpolation through piece-wise natural cubic splines, and a reconstruction procedure based on Gaussian Processes (GPs). Applied to DESI BAO and PantheonPlus SNeIa data, both methods indicate that deviations from a reference $\Lambda$CDM model in the $z \lesssim 2$ unnormalized expansion rate $E(z)$ are constrained to be $\lesssim 10\%$, but also consistently identify two features in $E(z)$: a bump at $z \sim 0.5$, and a depression at $z \sim 0.9$, which cannot be simultaneously captured by a $w_0w_a$CDM fit. These features, which are stable against assumptions regarding spatial curvature, interpolation knots, and GP kernel, disappear if one adopts the older SDSS BAO measurements in place of DESI, and decrease in significance when replacing the PantheonPlus catalog with the Union3 and DESY5 ones. We infer $c/(r_dH_0)=29.90 \pm 0.33$ (with $r_d$ the sound horizon at baryon drag), which slightly reduces the Hubble tension and makes room for a more important role of late-time new physics in this context, albeit still remaining a sub-dominant part of the solution. If substantiated in forthcoming data releases, our results tentatively point to oscillatory/non-monotonic features in the shape of the expansion rate at $z \lesssim 2$, of potential interest for dark energy model-building.</description>

      <title>First search for dark photon dark matter with a MADMAX prototype</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first result from a dark photon dark matter search in the mass range from ${78.62}$ to $83.95~\mathrm{\mu eV}/c^2$ with a dielectric haloscope prototype for MADMAX (Magnetized Disc and Mirror Axion eXperiment). Putative dark photons would convert to observable photons within a stack consisting of three sapphire disks and a mirror. The emitted power of this system is received by an antenna and successively digitized using a low-noise receiver. No dark photon signal has been observed. Assuming unpolarized dark photon dark matter with a local density of $\rho_{\chi}=0.3~\mathrm{GeV/cm^3}$ we exclude a dark photon to photon mixing parameter $\chi &gt; 3.0 \times 10^{-12}$ over the full mass range and $\chi &gt; 1.2 \times 10^{-13}$ at a mass of $80.57~\mathrm{\mu eV}/c^2$ with a 95\% confidence level. This is the first physics result from a MADMAX prototype and exceeds previous constraints on $\chi$ in this mass range by up to almost three orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Neutrino oscillation measurements with KamLAND and JUNO in the presence of scalar NSI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07343v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Determination of neutrino mass ordering and precision measurement of neutrino oscillation parameters are the foremost goals of the JUNO experiment. Here, we explore the effects of scalar non-standard interactions (sNSI) on the electron neutrino survival probability measured by JUNO. sNSI appears as a correction to the neutrino mass term in the Hamiltonian. We have considered the simplest scenario where there is only one NSI ($\eta_{ee}$) present in the theory. Our results show that sNSI can have significant effect on neutrino oscillation probabilities at the medium- and long-baseline reactor experiments. We fit KamLAND data assuming non-zero sNSI in theory and find that {\it estimates of $\Delta m^2_{21}$ and $\theta_{12}$ from KamLAND deviate significantly from their standard best-fit values} if one assumes sNSI in the theory. $\eta_{ee} \in [-1.0, 1.0]$ is allowed by KamLAND. JUNO cannot constrain sNSI but it can robustly measure $\Delta m^2_{21}$ and $\theta_{12}$ even when they differ widely from their current best-fit values. {\it Our works highlight the necessity of global analysis of constraints on sNSI and standard two-flavour oscillation parameters before arduous three-flavour questions such as neutrino mass ordering or CP violation in their presence is attempted.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mixing between the chiral condensate and the density in hot and dense QCD matter is familiar. We show that the mixing relevant for the ground state is considerably more extensive, and in particular also involves gluonic degrees of freedom. As a result, the Hessian of the QCD effective action is non-Hermitian, but retains a symmetry under combined charge- and complex conjugation. This can lead to complex-conjugate pairs of eigenvalues of this Hessian, signaling regimes with spatially modulated correlations. Furthermore, based on the analytic structure of the quark determinant at a chiral critical point, we demonstrate that the corresponding massless critical mode is composed of the chiral condensate, the density and the Polyakov loops. Due to an avoided crossing, the critical mode turns out to be disconnected from the chiral condensate in vacuum. We present general arguments for all these features and illustrate them through explicit model calculations.</description>

      <title>Revealing the mystery of the double charm tetraquark in $pp$ collision</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel approach is proposed to probe the nature of the double charm tetraquark through the prompt production asymmetry between $T_{\bar{c}\bar{c}}^-$ and $T_{cc}^+$ in $pp$ collisions. When comparing two theoretical pictures, i.e. the compact tetraquark and hadronic molecular pictures, we find that the former one exhibits a significantly larger production asymmetry, enabling the unambiguous determination of the tetraquark's internal structure. Additionally, distinctive differences in the transverse momentum and rapidity distributions of $T_{\bar{c}\bar{c}}^-$ and $T_{cc}^+$ cross sections emerge, particularly at $p_\mathrm{T}\approx 2~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $y\approx \pm 6$ at a center-of-mass energy of 14$~\mathrm{TeV}$. The insignificant asymmetry in hadronic molecular picture is because that hadronic molecules are produced in hadronic phase, where the phase space of their constituents needs to be taken into account rigorously. Our work can be extended to the exploration of other double heavy tetraquark candidates, offering a versatile approach to advance our understanding of exotic hadrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the hadronization and decay of excited heavy mesons and heavy baryons in Herwig 7 general-purpose event-generator, following four distinct steps: (i) Passing through the polarization of heavy hadrons at the end of parton shower through the application of heavy quark effective theory (HQET), where the emergence of a spin-flavour symmetry allows for the determination of the polarizations of the excited heavy mesons and heavy baryons from the helicity states of the light and heavy quarks. (ii) Improving the strong and radiative decay modes of the excited heavy mesons, where in the absence of conclusive experimental data on many of the decays, one needs to rely on HQET symmetries to determine the favoured decay modes, widths and branching ratios. (iii) Re-examination of the production rates of heavy hadrons using all available experimental data sources and (iv) performing a general tune for Herwig's free parameters to reflect the implemented changes. We compare our predictions against existing experimental data in the presence/absence of the newly implemented updates. These improvements will be available with Herwig-7.3.0 public release.</description>

      <title>Hadron Production in Ultra-relativistic Nuclear Collisions and Finite Baryon-Size Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13079v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate relative hadron yield production of various like and unlike mass particles in ultra-relativistic heavy ion collisions by employing a statistical thermal model with finite-sized baryons (antibaryons) to imitate the hard-core repulsive interactions leading to the excluded volume type effect. A strong evidence of strangeness suppression relative to the non-strange ones, mainly pions, particularly at higher energies is also observed. This study also indicates that at chemical freeze-out the particle ratios and strangeness suppression in the system obtained theoretically are sensitive to baryonic (antibaryonic) hard-core radius ($r_B$). A comparison with earlier analysis involving the strangeness suppression effect is made where baryons and antibaryons were treated as point-like particles. The available experimental data showing energy dependence of various particle ratios are well described throughout the range of centre-of-mass energy ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$). The value of hard-core radius between 0.76 to 0.79 fm is found to fit the data quite well using $\chi^{2}$ minimization technique. Two different chemical freeze-out stages are found where the earlier one belongs to baryonic (hyperonic), antibaryonic (antihyperonic) states and the later one to mesonic degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Probing Inert Triplet Model at a multi-TeV muon collider via vector boson fusion with forward muon tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential of a multi-TeV Muon Collider (MuC) for probing the Inert Triplet Model (ITM), which introduces a triplet scalar field with hypercharge $Y=0$ to the Standard Model. The ITM stands out as a compelling Beyond the Standard Model scenario, featuring a neutral triplet $T^0$ and charged triplets $T^\pm$. Notably, $T^0$ is posited as a dark matter (DM) candidate, being odd under a $Z_2$ symmetry. Rigorous evaluations against theoretical, collider, and DM experimental constraints corner the triplet scalar mass to a narrow TeV-scale region, within which three benchmark points are identified, with $T^\pm$ masses of 1.21 TeV, 1.68 TeV, and 3.86 TeV, for the collider study. The ITM's unique $TTVV$ four-point vertex, differing from fermionic DM models, facilitates efficient pair production through Vector Boson Fusion (VBF). This characteristic positions the MuC as an ideal platform for exploring the ITM, particularly due to the enhanced VBF cross-sections at high collision energies. To address the challenge of the soft decay products of $T^\pm$ resulting from the narrow mass gap between $T^\pm$ and $T^0$, we propose using Disappearing Charged Tracks (DCTs) from $T^\pm$ and Forward muons as key signatures. We provide event counts for these signatures at MuC energies of 6 TeV and 10 TeV, with respective luminosities of 4 ab$^{-1}$ and 10 ab$^{-1}$. Despite the challenge of beam-induced backgrounds contaminating the signal, we demonstrate that our proposed final states enable the MuC to achieve a $5\sigma$ discovery for the identified benchmark points, particularly highlighting the effectiveness of the final state with one DCT and one Forward muon.</description>

      <title>On interpretation of fluctuations of conserved charges at high T</title>

Abstract: Fluctuations of conserved charges calculated on the lattice which can be measured experimentally, are well reproduced by a hadron resonanse gas model at temperatures below T_{ch} ~ 155 MeV and radically deviate from the hadron resonance gas predictions above the chiral restoration crossover. This behavior is typically interpreted as an indication of deconfinement in the quark-gluon plasma regime. We present an argument that this interpretation may be too simple. The argument is based on the scaling of quantities with the number of colors: demonstration of deconfinement and QGP requires observable that is sensitive to N_c^2 gluons while the conserved charges are sensitive only to quarks and above T_{ch} scale as N_c^1. The latter scaling is consistent with the existence of an intermediate regime characterized by restored chiral symmetry and by approximate chiral spin symmetry which is a symmetry of confining interaction. In this regime the energy density, pressure and entropy density scale as N_c^1. In the large N_c limit this regime might become a distinct phase separated from the hadron gas and from QGP by phase transitions. A natural observable that associates with deconfinement and is directly sensitive to deconfined N_c^2-1 gluons is the Polyakov loop; in the N_c=3 world it remains very close to 0 at temperatures well above chiral crossover, reaches the value 0.5 around 3T_{ch} and the value close to 1 at temperatures ~1 GeV.</description>

      <title>Two Types of Gluons in QCD: Re-interpretation of ALEPH and CMS Gluon Jet Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08704v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Abelian decomposition of QCD tells that there are two types of gluons in QCD, the color neutral neurons and colored chromons, which behave differently. This strongly implies that QCD has two types of gluon jets, the neuron jet and chromon jet. One quarter of the gluon jets is made of the neuron jets which have sharper jet radius and smaller particle multiplicity, while three quarters of them are made of chromon jets which have the broader jet radius and larger particle multiplicity. Moreover, the neuron jet has a distinct color flow which forms an ideal color dipole pattern, while the chromon jets have distorted dipole pattern. In this paper we provide five circumferential evidences of the existence of two types of gluon jets from the existing ALEPH and DELPHI data on $e \bar e \rightarrow Z \rightarrow b \bar b g$ decay and the CMS data on Pb-Pb heavy ion collision.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the stability of the Standard Model vacuum, and investigate its quantum effective potential using the highest available orders in perturbation theory and the most accurate determination of input parameters to date. We observe that the stability of the electroweak vacuum centrally depends on the values of the top mass and the strong coupling constant. We estimate that reducing their uncertainties by a factor of two to three is sufficient to establish or refute SM vacuum stability at the $5\sigma$ level. We further investigate vacuum stability for a variety of singlet scalar field extensions with and without flavor using the Higgs portal mechanism. We identify the BSM parameter spaces for stability and find sizable room for new physics. We further study the phenomenology of Planck-safe models at colliders, and determine the impact on the Higgs trilinear, the Higgs-to-electroweak-boson, and the Higgs quartic couplings, some of which can be significant. The former two can be probed at the HL-LHC, the latter requires a future collider with sufficient energy and precision such as the FCC-hh.</description>

      <title>A Simple Dirac Prescription for Two-Loop Anomalous Dimension Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel method to treat effects from evanescent operators in next-to-leading order (NLO) computations is introduced. The approach allows, besides further simplifications, to discard evanescent-to-physical mixing contributions in NLO calculations. The method is independent of the treatments of $\gamma_5$ and can therefore be combined with different renormalization schemes. We illustrate the utility of this result by reproducing literature results of two-loop anomalous dimension matrices for both $|\Delta F| = 1$ and $|\Delta F| = 2$ transitions.</description>

      <title>Axion-like Quasiparticles and Topological States of Matter: Finite Density Corrections of the Chiral Anomaly Vertex</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03151v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the general structure of the chiral anomaly $AVV/AAA$ and $(LLL, RRR)$ vertices, in the presence of chemical potentials in perturbation theory. The study finds application in anomalous transport, whenever chirally unbalanced matter is present, with propagating external currents that are classically conserved. Examples are topological materials and the chiral magnetic effect in the plasma state of matter of the early universe. We classify the minimal number of form factors of the $AVV$ parameterization, by a complete analysis of the Schouten identities in the presence of a heat bath. We show that the longitudinal (anomaly) sector in the axial-vector channel, for on-shell and off-shell photons, is protected against corrections coming from the insertion of a chemical potential in the fermion loop. When the photons are on-shell, we prove that also the transverse sector, in the same channel, is $\mu$-independent and vanishes. The related effective action is shown to be always described by the exchange of a massless anomaly pole, as in the case of vanishing chemical potentials. The pole is interpreted as an interpolating axion-like quasiparticle generated by the anomaly. In each axial-vector channel, it is predicted to be a correlated fermion/antifermion pseudoscalar (axion-like) quasiparticle appearing in the response function, once the material is subjected to an external chiral perturbation. The cancellation of the $\mu$ dependence extends to any chiral current within the Standard Model, including examples like $B$ (baryon), $L$ (lepton), and $B-L$. This holds true irrespective of whether these currents exhibit anomalies.</description>

      <title>Probing the internal structures of $p\Omega$ and $\Omega\Omega$ with their production at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strange dibaryons $p\Omega$ ($^5\rm{S}_2$) and $\Omega\Omega$ ($^1\rm{S}_0$) are likely bound, existing either in molecular states like the deuteron or as more exotic compact six-quark states. Here, we investigate the production of these two dibaryons in Pb+Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=2.76 TeV at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) within a covariant coalescence model, which employs a blast-wave-like parametrization for the phase-space configurations of constituent particles at freeze-out. For the molecular states, the $p\Omega$ and $\Omega\Omega$ are produced via $p$-$\Omega$ and $\Omega$-$\Omega$ coalescence, respectively, while for the six-quark states, they are formed through $uudsss$ and $ssssss$ coalescence. We find that the yield ratio $N_{p\Omega}/N_{\Omega}$ and $N_{\Omega\Omega}/N_{\Omega}$ have a distinct centrality dependence between the molecular and multi-quark states, thus offering a promising way for distinguishing the two states. Our results suggest that the measurements of $p\Omega$ and $\Omega\Omega$ production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions can shed light on their internal structures.</description>

      <title>Fully Charmed Tetraquark States in $8_{[c\bar{c}]}\otimes8_{[c\bar{c}]}$ Color Structure via QCD Sum Rules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stimulated by the recent experimental results on the fully-charm tetraquark states, we systematically calculate the mass spectra of the fully-charm tetraquark states in $8_{[c\bar{c}]}\otimes8_{[c\bar{c}]}$ color configuration via QCD sum rules. By constructing nine $8_{[c\bar{c}]}\otimes8_{[c\bar{c}]}$ type currents with quantum numbers $J^{PC}=0^{-+},0^{--},1^{-+},1^{+-},1^{--}$ and $2^{++}$, we perform analytic calculation up to dimension six in the Operator Product Expansion (OPE). We find the fully-charm tetraquark states with $J^{PC}=1^{+-},2^{++}$ lie around 6.48 $\sim$ 6.62 GeV while the fully-charm tetraquark states with $J^{PC}=0^{-+},0^{--},1^{--},1^{-+}$ are about 6.85 $\sim$ 7.02 GeV. Notably, the mass predictions for the $c\bar{c}c\bar{c}$ tetraquarks, specifically those with $J^{PC}=2^{++}$, align with the broad structure identified by LHCb. Moreover, the masses of fully-charm tetraquarks with $J^{PC}=0^{-+}$ and $1^{-+}$ are anticipated to match closely with the mass of X(6900), considering the margin of error. Such findings hint at the presence of some $8_{[c\bar{c}]}\otimes8_{[c\bar{c}]}$ components within the di-$J/\psi$ structures observed by LHCb. The predictions for tetraquark states with $J^{PC}=0^{--},1^{+-},1^{--}$ may be accessible in the future BelleII, Super-B, PANDA, and LHCb experiments.</description>

      <title>Heavy-quark dominance and fine structure of excited heavy baryons $\Sigma_{Q}$, $\Xi '_{Q}$ and $\Omega_{Q}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the framework of the relativized quark model, the calculation of spin-orbit interactions is improved by considering the contribution from the light quark cluster in a singly heavy baryon. It modifies the energy level splitting of the orbital excitation significantly and causes the emergence of fine structures for $\Sigma_{Q}$, $\Xi '_{Q}$ and $\Omega_{Q}$ baryons. Based on this improvement, we systematically analyze the fine structures and retest the heavy quark dominance mechanism. This mechanism is found to be violated in the $1P$-wave states of the $\Sigma_{c}$, $\Xi '_{c}$ and $\Omega_{c}$ baryons although it remains effective overall, which may help to understand the nature of the heavy quarks and strong interactions. With the predicted fine structures, we make the precise assignments of those observed heavy baryons which once could not be accurately explained due to their close mass values. The method used in this work is instructive and applicable for the study of more complex exotic hadrons, such as the heavy tetraquarks and pentaquarks.</description>

      <title>Topological amplitudes of charmed baryon decays in the $SU(3)_F$ limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charmed baryon decay plays an important role in studying the weak and strong interactions. In this work, we investigate the topological diagrams of charmed baryon anti-triplet decays into light baryon octet and light meson. The topological diagrams of the $\mathcal{B}_{c\overline 3}\to \mathcal{B}_8^S M$ modes and the diagrams with quark loop are presented for the first time. The completeness of topologies is confirmed by permutation. The linear correlation of topologies are obtained by deriving the relation between the topological amplitudes constructed by the third- and second-rank octet tensors. It is found the topologies contributing to the $\mathcal{B}_{c\overline 3}\to \mathcal{B}_8^S M$ modes can be determined by the topologies contributing to the $\mathcal{B}_{c\overline 3}\to \mathcal{B}_8^A M$ modes, vice versa. The equations of $SU(3)$ irreducible amplitudes decomposed by topologies are derived through two different intermediate amplitudes, but the inverse solution does not exist since the number of topologies is larger than number of $SU(3)$ irreducible amplitudes. Applying this framework to the Standard Model, it is found there are thirteen independent $SU(3)$ irreducible amplitudes contributing to the $\mathcal{B}_{c\overline 3}\to \mathcal{B}_8 M$ decays. Considering the suppressions induced by the small CKM matrix elements and the Korner-Pati-Woo theorem, the branching fractions of charmed baryon decays are dominated by five $SU(3)$ irreducible amplitudes in the $SU(3)_F$ limit. The quark-loop diagrams could enhance the $U$-spin breaking effects and then increase the branching fraction difference of two decay channels. The systematic measurements of branching fractions of the singly Cabibbo-suppressed modes could help us to find which modes are promising in searching for CP asymmetries in charmed baryon sector.</description>

Abstract: The shear viscosity is a fundamental transport property of matter. Here we derive a general theory of the viscosity of gases based on the relativistic Langevin equation (deduced from a relativistic Lagrangian) and nonaffine linear response theory. The proposed relativistic theory is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic classical gases, with all its key dependencies on mass, temperature, particle diameter and Boltzmann constant, in the limit of Lorentz factor $\gamma=1$. It also unveils the relativistic enhancement mechanism of viscosity. In the limit of ultrarelativistic fluids, the theory provides a new analytical formula which reproduces the cubic increase of viscosity with temperature in agreement with various estimates for hot dense matter and the QGP-type fluid.</description>

Abstract: Lord Kelvin's pioneering hypothesis that the identity of atoms is knots of vortices of the aether had a profound impact on the fields of mathematics and physics despite being subsequently refuted by experiments. While knot-like excitations emerge in various systems of condensed matter physics, the fundamental constituents of matter have been revealed to be elementary particles such as electrons and quarks, seemingly leaving no room for the appearance of knots in particle physics. Here, we show that knots indeed appear as meta-stable solitons in a realistic extension of the standard model of particle physics that provides the QCD axion and right-handed neutrinos. This result suggests that during the early Universe, a "knot dominated era" may have existed, where knots were a dominant component of the Universe, and this scenario can be tested through gravitational wave observations. Furthermore, we propose that the end of this era involves the collapse of the knots via quantum tunneling, leading to the generation of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the Universe. Our findings exhibit the significant role of knots in particle physics and represent a modern version of Kelvin's hypothesis.</description>

Abstract: Fixed-target proton-beam experiments produce a multitude of charged pions that rescatter in the beam dump. These charged pion scattering events can be an additional irreducible source of exotic particles which couple to photons or hadrons. We analyze the sensitivity of the DUNE Near Detector complex to millicharged particles (MCPs) and heavy axion-like particles (ALPs) with low-energy couplings to gluons. Using the framework of chiral perturbation theory, we demonstrate regimes of parameter space where the charged pion production channel dominates over previously-considered production mechanisms for both MCPs and ALPs, thereby improving the sensitivity of DUNE to these new particles compared to previous studies.</description>

Abstract: In this work we consider the Standard Model Effective Field Theory extended with right-handed neutrinos, the $\nu$SMEFT, and calculate the full set of one-loop anomalous dimensions that are proportional to Yukawa couplings. These contributions are particularly relevant when symmetry-protected low scale seesaw models are embeded in the SMEFT, since large neutrino Yukawa couplings are expected. By combining our results with the already available gauge anomalous dimensions, we provide the complete set of one-loop renormalization group evolution equations for the dimension six $\nu$SMEFT. As a possible phenomenological implication of our results, we discuss the sensitivity of lepton flavor-violating observables to $\nu$SMEFT operators, focusing on the more sensitive $\mu\to e$ transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As LHC's Run3 unfolds, we peer deeper into the couplings of the 125GeV Higgs ($h_{125}$) and also test for extra scalars. Even before such extra scalars are found, one can probe them by using the fact that theories with multiple Higgs doublets allow for substantial deviations of the couplings of $h_{125}$ from their SM values. Indeed, the observed couplings already place stringent limits on such theories. We investigate the curious possibility that $h_{125}$ couples to the top quark mostly as a scalar, while it couples to the bottom quark mostly as a pseudoscalar. This possibility was allowed by 2017 data for the so-called C2HDM; a two Higgs doublet model with a single source of explicit CP violation. It was shown recently that this possibility disappears when using the full experimental data of 2024. Here we discuss a three Higgs doublet with explicit CP violation (C3HDM), and show that the curious CP-even/CP-odd $t$/$b$ possibility is partly resuscitated, prompting further experimental exploration of this prospect.</description>

      <title>CFT Correlators and CP-Violating Trace Anomalies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03038v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the parity-odd correlators $\langle JJO\rangle_{odd}$, $\langle JJT\rangle_{odd}$, $\langle TTO\rangle_{odd}$ and $\langle TTT\rangle_{odd}$ in momentum space, constrained by conformal Ward identities, extending our former investigation of the parity-odd chiral anomaly vertex. We investigate how the presence of parity-odd trace anomalies affect such correlators. Motivations for this study come from holography, early universe cosmology and from a recent debate on the chiral trace anomaly of a Weyl fermion. In the current CFT analysis, $O$ can be either a scalar or a pseudoscalar operator and it can be identified with the trace of the stress energy tensor. We find that the $\langle JJO\rangle_{odd}$ and $\langle TTO\rangle_{odd}$ can be different from zero in a CFT. This occurs when the conformal dimension of the scalar operator is $\Delta_3=4$, as in the case of $O=T^\mu_\mu$. Moreover, if we assume the existence of parity-odd trace anomalies, the conformal $\langle JJT\rangle_{odd}$ and $\langle TTT\rangle_{odd}$ are nonzero. In particular, in the case of $\langle JJT\rangle_{odd}$ the transverse-traceless component is constrained to vanish, and the correlator is determined only by the trace part with the anomaly pole.</description>

      <title>Gauge-independent transition dividing the confinement phase in the lattice SU(2) gauge-adjoint scalar model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The lattice SU(2) gauge-scalar model with the scalar field in the adjoint representation of the gauge group has two completely separated confinement and Higgs phases according to the preceding studies based on numerical simulations which have been performed in the specific gauge fixing based on the conventional understanding of the Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism.
  In this paper, we re-examine this phase structure in the gauge-independent way based on the numerical simulations performed without any gauge fixing. This is motivated to confirm the recently proposed gauge-independent Brout-Englert-Higgs mechanism for generating the mass of the gauge field without relying on any spontaneous symmetry breaking. For this purpose we investigate correlation functions between gauge-invariant operators obtained by combining the original adjoint scalar field and the new field called the color-direction field which is constructed from the gauge field based on the gauge-covariant decomposition of the gauge field due to Cho-Duan-Ge-Shabanov and Faddeev-Niemi.
  Consequently, we reproduce gauge-independently the transition line separating confinement phase and Higgs phase, and show surprisingly the existence of a new transition line that divides completely the confinement phase into two parts. Finally, we discuss the physical meaning of the new transition and implications to confinement mechanism.</description>

      <title>Mass and Isospin Breaking Effects in the Skyrme Model and in Holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss how the quark masses and their mass splitting affect the baryons in the Skyrme model as well as the Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto (WSS) model. In both cases baryons are described by solitonic objects, i.e. Skyrmions and instantons, respectively. After the quantization of their zeromodes the nucleons become quantum states of a rotor. We show how the quark mass affects the moment of inertia and we provide a semi-analytic approach valid in the small-mass limit. Additionally, we show how the two lightest quarks' mass splitting affects the moments of inertia of the Skyrmion and induces an isospin breaking effect. This effect turns out not to be enough to split the degeneracy in the neutron-proton multiplet, but it splits some of the states in the Delta multiplet. Unlike the basic Skyrme model, the WSS model already includes vector mesons and another mechanism to transfer isospin breaking from quark masses to the solitons is known. We compute the splitting of the moment of inertia in the small-mass limit in the WSS model and combine the two effects on the spectrum of baryons, in particular the Deltas.</description>

      <title>Galaxy-galaxy lensing data: $f(T)$ gravity challenges General Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17053v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use galaxy-galaxy lensing data to test General Relativity and $f(T)$ gravity at galaxies scales. We consider an exact spherically symmetric solution of $f(T)$ theory which is obtained from an approximate quadratic correction, and thus it is expected to hold for every realistic deviation from General Relativity. Quantifying the deviation by a single parameter $Q$, and following the post-Newtonian approximation, we obtain the corresponding deviation in the gravitational potential, shear component, and effective excess surface density profile. We used five stellar mass samples and divided them into blue and red to test the model dependence on galaxy color, and we modeled the excess surface density (ESD) profiles using the Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) profiles. Based on the group catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 7 (SDSS DR7) we finally extract $Q=-2.138^{+0.952}_{-0.516}\times 10^{-5}\,$Mpc$^{-2}$ at $1\sigma$ confidence. This result indicates that $f(T)$ corrections on top of General Relativity are favored. Finally, we apply information criteria, such as the AIC and BIC ones, and although the dependence of $f(T)$ gravity on the off-center effect implies that its optimality needs to be carefully studied, our analysis shows that $f(T)$ gravity is more efficient in fitting the data comparing to General Relativity and $\Lambda$CDM paradigm, and thus it offers a challenge to the latter.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the primordial inflationary power spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that the effects of renormalization significantly reduce the amplitude of the inflationary spectra at scales measurable in the cosmic microwave background. Via a gauge-invariant analysis, we compute the renormalized scalar and tensor power spectra and follow their evolution in an inflating universe that undergoes a transition to an FRW phase with a growing horizon. For perturbations originating from Minkowski vacuum fluctuations, we show that the standard prediction for the spectra on superhorizon scales is a late-time attractor, while they are UV finite at all times. Our result is independent of the equation of state after inflation, showing that the standard prediction is fully robust.</description>

      <title>Hairy black holes in extended Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theories with magnetic charge and kinetic couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study black hole (BH) solutions in extended Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theories, which are classified in a subclass of the $U(1)$ gauge-invariant scalar-vector-tensor theories. The scalar field is coupled to the vector field, which has electric and magnetic charges. For the static and spherically symmetric spacetime, we investigate modifications to the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solutions focusing on the three types of scalar-vector interactions, including derivative couplings. We solve the field equations analytically in two asymptotic regions which are the vicinity of the BH horizon and the spatial infinity, and clarify the condition for the existence of scalar hair. To understand the behaviors of solutions in intermediate scales, the field equations are integrated numerically for concrete models with different types of couplings. We find new hairy BH solutions with scalar hair in the presence of magnetic charge and kinetic coupling. The magnetic charge plays an important role in distinguishing hairy BH solutions originated from three types of different interactions at a large coupling limit.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Curvature Perturbation and Primordial Black Hole Formation in Two-stage Inflation with a break</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02492v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a model of $R^2$-gravity with a non-minimally coupled scalar field that gives rise to two-stage inflation with a break, that is, with an intermediate stage where inflation momentarily halts. We find that the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation is significantly enhanced at the break scale, which can account for the primordial black hole (PBH) formation, without affecting the CMB constraint on large scales. The behavior of the curvature perturbation is carefully analyzed and we find a few notable new features in the spectrum. In particular, we find that the $k^3$ growth of the spectrum of toward the end of the first stage of inflation. We argue that this is a universal feature common to all two-stage models where the field dominating the second stage is heavy during the first stage. By appropriately tuning the model parameters, we find that our model can realize the scenario of PBHs as the cold dark matter of the Universe. We also find that we can choose the parameters so that the spectrum of the induced gravitational waves from the enhanced curvature perturbation fits the NANOGrav-15yr data of pulsar timing array observation.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes and curvature perturbations from false vacuum islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, much attention has been focused on the false vacuum islands that are flooded by an expanding ocean of true-vacuum bubbles slightly later than most of the other parts of the world. These delayed decay regions will accumulate locally larger vacuum energy density by staying in the false vacuum longer than those already transited into the true vacuum. A false vacuum island with thus acquired density contrast of a super-horizon size will evolve locally from radiation dominance to vacuum dominance, creating a local baby Universe that can be regarded effectively as a local closed Universe. If such density contrasts of super-horizon sizes can ever grow large enough to exceed the threshold of gravitational collapse, primordial black holes will form similar to those collapsing curvature perturbations on super-horizon scales induced by small-scale enhancements during inflation. If not, such density contrasts can still induce curvature perturbations potentially observable today. In this paper, we revisit and elaborate on the generations of primordial black holes and curvature perturbations from delayed-decayed false vacuum islands during asynchronous first-order phase transitions with fitting formulas convenient for future model-independent studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study multi-particle azimuthal correlations in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV. We use initial conditions obtained from a Monte-Carlo Glauber model and evolve them within a viscous relativistic hydrodynamics framework that eventually gives way to a transport model in the late hadronic stage of the evolution. We compute the multi-particle symmetric and asymmetric cumulants and present the results for their sensitivity to the shear and bulk viscosities during the hydrodynamic evolution. We also check their sensitivity to resonance decay and hadronic interactions. We show that these observables are more sensitive to the transport properties than the traditional flow observables.</description>

      <title>Galaxy groups in the presence of Cosmological Constant: Increasing the Masses of Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The boundaries of galaxy groups and clusters are defined by the interplay between the Newtonian attractive force and the decoupling from the local expansion of the Universe. This work extends the definition of a zero radial acceleration surface (ZRAS) and the turnaround surface (TS) for a general distribution of the masses in an expanding background, governed by the cosmological constant. We apply these definitions to different galaxy groups in the local Universe, mapping these groups up to ten megaparsec distances. We discuss the dipole and the quadrupole rate for the Local Group of Galaxies and the implementations on the Hubble diagram correction and galaxy groups virialization. With these definitions, we present the surfaces showing the interplay between the local expansion vs the local Newtonian attraction for galaxy groups in the local Universe. Further, we estimate the masses of different galaxy groups and show that the Cosmological Constant requires these masses to be higher. For the groups with enough tracers close to the TS, the contribution of the Cosmological Constant makes the masses to be even higher. The results show the importance of including the local cosmic expansion in analyzing the Cosmic Flow of the local Universe.</description>

      <title>Discrete $Z_4$ symmetry in quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00718v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the discrete $Z_4$ symmetry ${\hat {\bf i}}$, which takes place in the scenario of quantum gravity where the gravitational tetrads emerge as the order parameter. Under this symmetry operation $\hat {\bf i}$, the emerging tetrads are multiplied by the imaginary unit, $\hat {\bf i}\,e^a_\mu = - i e^a_\mu$. The existence of such symmetry and the spontaneous breaking of this symmetry are also supported by the consideration of the symmetry breaking scheme in the topological superfluid $^3$He-B. The order parameter $^3$He-B is the analogue of the tetrad field, but it has complex values. The $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry operation changes the phase of the complex order parameter by $\pi/2$, which corresponds to the $Z_4$ discrete symmetry in quantum gravity. We also considered the alternative scenario of the breaking of this $Z_4$ symmetry, in which the $\hat {\bf i}$-operation changes sign of the scalar curvature, $\hat {\bf i} \,{\cal R} = - {\cal R}$, and thus the Einstein-Hilbert action violates the $\hat {\bf i}$-symmetry. In the alternative scenario of symmetry breaking, the gravitational coupling $K=1/16\pi G$ plays the role of the order parameter, which changes sign under $\hat {\bf i}$-transformation.</description>

      <title>Two-Loop Spacelike Splitting Amplitude for N=4 Super-Yang-Mills Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of collinear behavior for gauge theories in the spacelike region is of great phenomenological and theoretical importance. We analytically calculate the two-loop spacelike splitting amplitude for the full color N=4 Super-Yang-Mills theory. The result is derived by two complementary methods starting from the known amplitude: one is based on a discontinuity analysis, while the other one is based on analytic continuation. Our result explicitly shows terms that violate naive factorization. However we show that factorization is restored at the level of color-summed unpolarized squared amplitudes at next-to-next-to-next-to leading order. We conjecture that the two-loop tripole terms in the generalized splitting amplitudes in QCD are identical to what we obtain in N=4 super Yang-Mills theory.</description>

      <title>Electron scattering cross section for light nuclei within the unified electroweak theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06407v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the multipole expansion within the unified electroweak theory to develop a complete calculation method of the electron scattering cross section for light nuclei. The specific calculations for 6,7Li and 7Be nuclei indicate that the conventional impulse approximation can be applied to the electron-nucleus scattering only when the incident electron energy does not exceed twice the nucleon mass. In addition, the quasi-elastic scattering cross section of 7Li in the excitation from its ground state to the nearest excited state and that of elastic scattering in the ground state are independently treated, whereas they have not been separately measured in experiments. The obtained scattering cross sections corresponding to an appropriate adjustment of the harmonic oscillator parameter along with the V-A structure interpret reasonably well the available experimental data at MeV energies and provide predictive information at GeV energies. This gives new perspectives in studying the structure of nuclei and the weak interactions via electron or lepton scattering at high (GeV) energies, considering nuclei rather than quarks.</description>

      <title>On a possible $^{3}_{\phi}$H hypernucleus with HAL QCD interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of the Faddeev formalism in configuration space, we investigate bound states in the $\phi NN$ system with total isospin $T=0$ and $T=1$. The recently proposed lattice HAL QCD $\phi N$ potential in the $^{4}S_{3/2}$ channel does not support either $\phi N$ or $\phi NN$ bound states. The HAL QCD $\phi N$ potential in the $^{2}S_{1/2}$ channel suggests the bound states for $\phi N$ and $\phi NN (S=0)$ systems. However, the binding energies are highly sensitive to variations of the enhancement factor $\beta$, and the $\phi NN$ system is extremely strongly bound in the state $S=0$. Considering a spin-averaged potential %$(\frac{1}{3}V_{\phi N}^{1/2}+\frac{2}{3}V_{\phi N}^{3/2})$ for the state $S=1$ yields a bound state for $^3_\phi$H $(S=1)$ hypernucleus with the binding energy (BE) 14.9 MeV when $\beta = 6.9$. The evaluation of the BE for the $S=1$, $T=1$ three-body state results in 5.47 MeV. %Also, We evaluated the BE for the $S=1$, $T=1$ three-body state as 5.47 MeV. Additionally, calculations using our approach confirm the bound states for the $\phi NN$ ($S=2,T=0$ and $S=1, T=1$) system previously predicted with the Yukawa-type potential motivated by the QCD van der Waals attractive force, mediated by multi-gluon exchanges.</description>

      <title>The Smile of Cheshire Cat At High Density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Baryons in finite nuclei, nuclear matter and dense compact-star matter are described in terms of Cheshire Cat for QCD. A potential conceptual link, admittedly short in mathematical rigor, between their manifestations is made by what's called Cheshire Cat Principle. Put in terms taken ``dual" to QCD variables, going to very high density exposes quantum Hall droplets -- or pancakes -- at which the dilaton-limit fixed point with $g_A\to 1$, $f_\pi\to f_\chi$ -- where $f_\pi$ and $f_\chi$ are respectively the pion and dilaton decay constants -- and the baryon parity-doubling are reached. This scenario suggests a thus-far totally unexplored structure of dual baryonic matter at high density which does neither require nor rule out (rapid) first-order phase transitions from hadrons to quarks in the core of compact stars on the verge of gravitational collapse.</description>
