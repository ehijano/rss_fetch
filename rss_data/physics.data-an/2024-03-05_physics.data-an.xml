      <title>Pattern-detection in the global automotive industry: a manufacturer-supplier-product network analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Production networks arise from supply and customer relations among firms. These systems are gaining growing attention as a consequence of disruptions due to natural or man-made disasters that happened in the last years, such as the Covid-19 pandemic or the Russia-Ukraine war. However, data constraints force the few, available studies to consider only country-specific production networks. In order to fully capture the cross-country structure of modern supply chains, here we focus on the global automotive industry as represented by the MarkLines Automotive dataset. After representing this data as a network of manufacturers, suppliers, and products, we perform a pattern-detection exercise using a statistically grounded validation technique based on the maximum entropy principle. We reveal the presence of a significantly large number of V-shaped and square-shaped motifs, indicating that manufacturing firms compete and are seldom engaged in a buyer-supplier relationship, while they typically have many suppliers in common. Interestingly, generalist and specialist suppliers coexist in the network. Additionally, we unveil the presence of geographical patterns, with manufacturers clustering around groups of suppliers; for instance, Chinese firms constitute a disconnected community, likely an effect of the protectionist policies promoted by the Chinese government. We also show the tendency of suppliers to organize their production by targeting specific functional modules of a vehicle. Besides shedding light on the self-organising principles shaping production networks, our findings open up the possibility of designing realistic generative models of supply chains, to be used for testing the resilience of the interconnected global economy.</description>

      <title>Exploring a new machine learning based probabilistic model for high-resolution indoor radon mapping, using the German indoor radon survey data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radon is a carcinogenic, radioactive gas that can accumulate indoors. Therefore, accurate knowledge of indoor radon concentration is crucial for assessing radon-related health effects or identifying radon-prone areas. Indoor radon concentration at the national scale is usually estimated on the basis of extensive measurement campaigns. However, characteristics of the sample often differ from the characteristics of the population due to the large number of relevant factors that control the indoor radon concentration such as the availability of geogenic radon or floor level. Furthermore, the sample size usually does not allow estimation with high spatial resolution. We propose a model-based approach that allows a more realistic estimation of indoor radon distribution with a higher spatial resolution than a purely data-based approach. A two-stage modelling approach was applied: 1) a quantile regression forest using environmental and building data as predictors was applied to estimate the probability distribution function of indoor radon for each floor level of each residential building in Germany; (2) a probabilistic Monte Carlo sampling technique enabled the combination and population weighting of floor-level predictions. In this way, the uncertainty of the individual predictions is effectively propagated into the estimate of variability at the aggregated level. The results show an approximate lognormal distribution with an arithmetic mean of 63 Bq/m3, a geometric mean of 41 Bq/m3 and a 95 %ile of 180 Bq/m3. The exceedance probability for 100 Bq/m3 and 300 Bq/m3 are 12.5 % (10.5 million people) and 2.2 % (1.9 million people), respectively.</description>

      <title>Roadmap on Data-Centric Materials Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Science is and always has been based on data, but the terms "data-centric" and the "4th paradigm of" materials research indicate a radical change in how information is retrieved, handled and research is performed. It signifies a transformative shift towards managing vast data collections, digital repositories, and innovative data analytics methods. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its subset Machine Learning (ML), has become pivotal in addressing all these challenges. This Roadmap on Data-Centric Materials Science explores fundamental concepts and methodologies, illustrating diverse applications in electronic-structure theory, soft matter theory, microstructure research, and experimental techniques like photoemission, atom probe tomography, and electron microscopy. While the roadmap delves into specific areas within the broad interdisciplinary field of materials science, the provided examples elucidate key concepts applicable to a wider range of topics. The discussed instances offer insights into addressing the multifaceted challenges encountered in contemporary materials research.</description>
