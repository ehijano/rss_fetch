      <title>Forming Coordinated Teams that Balance Task Coverage and Expert Workload</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a new formulation of the team-formation problem, where the goal is to form teams to work on a given set of tasks requiring different skills. Deviating from the classic problem setting where one is asking to cover all skills of each given task, we aim to cover as many skills as possible while also trying to minimize the maximum workload among the experts. We do this by combining penalization terms for the coverage and load constraints into one objective. We call the corresponding assignment problem $\texttt{Balanced-Coverage}$, and show that it is NP-hard. We also consider a variant of this problem, where the experts are organized into a graph, which encodes how well they work together. Utilizing such a coordination graph, we aim to find teams to assign to tasks such that each team's radius does not exceed a given threshold. We refer to this problem as $\texttt{Network-Balanced-Coverage}$. We develop a generic template algorithm for approximating both problems in polynomial time, and we show that our template algorithm for $\texttt{Balanced-Coverage}$ has provable guarantees. We describe a set of computational speedups that we can apply to our algorithms and make them scale for reasonably large datasets. From the practical point of view, we demonstrate how to efficiently tune the two parts of the objective and tailor their importance to a particular application. Our experiments with a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the utility of our problem formulation as well as the efficiency of our algorithms in practice.</description>

      <title>Relationships between Students' Social Roles and Academic Performance based on Social Network Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peer interaction and social roles have been important factors in students' academic performance. Recent work on what influences academic performance in Thailand has focused on the quality of a school, students' backgrounds, and students themselves. A few works have analyzed the correlation between social roles and students' academic achievement. Therefore, this study was designed to measure the social networks of Thai undergraduate students and analyze the relationship between their roles in social networks and academic outcomes. The data analysis was based on social network theory and permutation test. Social network theory was used to measure essential network characteristics and extract social roles. Four roles were extracted in a social network: central members, clique members, liaisons, and isolators, and analyzed a relationship between the roles and academic performance. Data was collected via questionnaires from 384 students and used to build two types of networks: friend networks and study-helper networks. A permutation test was used for statistical hypothesis testing. The results showed that 1) Being a central member positively correlates with academic performance in friend and study-helper networks. The correlation coefficients between the degree of being a central member and academic performance are also positive in all schools and both types of networks. 2) Being an isolator negatively correlates with academic performance in study-helper networks. These results indicate that a social network plays a vital role in academic performance. The results suggest that academic institutes should encourage the development of students' social networks and strengthen the networks so that students can exchange their knowledge easier and help each other in learning, leading to better academic performance.</description>

      <title>An Agent-based Model of Citation Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether citations can be objectively and reliably used to measure productivity and scientific quality of articles and researchers can, and should, be vigorously questioned. However, citations are widely used to estimate the productivity of researchers and institutions, effectively creating a 'grubby' motivation to be well-cited. We model citation growth, and this grubby interest using an agent-based model (ABM) of network growth. In this model, each new node (article) in a citation network is an autonomous agent that cites other nodes based on a 'citation personality' consisting of a composite bias for locality, preferential attachment, recency, and fitness. We ask whether strategic citation behavior (reference selection) by the author of a scientific article can boost subsequent citations to it. Our study suggests that fitness and, to a lesser extent, out_degree and locality effects are influential in capturing citations, which raises questions about similar effects in the real world.</description>

      <title>Impacts of Physical-Layer Information on Epidemic Spreading in Cyber-Physical Networked Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since Granell et al. proposed a multiplex network for information and epidemic propagation, researchers have explored how information propagation affects epidemic dynamics. However, the role of individuals acquiring information through physical interactions has received relatively less attention. In this work, we introduce a novel source of information: physical layer information, and derive the epidemic outbreak threshold using the Microscopic Markov Chain Approach (MMCA). Our simulation results indicate that the outbreak threshold derived from the MMCA is consistent with the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation results, thereby confirming the accuracy of the theoretical model. Furthermore, we find that the physical-layer information effectively increases the population's awareness density and the infection threshold $\beta_c$, while reducing the population's infection density, thereby suppressing the spreading of the epidemic. Another interesting finding is that when the density of 2-simplex information is relatively high, the 2-simplex plays a role similar to pairwise interaction, significantly enhancing the population's awareness density and effectively preventing large-scale epidemic outbreaks. In addition, our model works equally well for cyber physical systems with similar interaction mechanisms, while we simulate and validate it in a real grid system.</description>

      <title>Comparing User Activity on X and Mastodon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "Fediverse", a federation of decentralized social media servers, has emerged after a decade in which centralized platforms like X (formerly Twitter) have dominated the landscape. The structure of a federation should affect user activity, as a user selects a server to access the Fediverse and posts are distributed along the structure. This paper reports on the differences in user activity between Twitter and Mastodon, a prominent example of decentralized social media. The target of the analysis is Japanese posts because both Twitter and Mastodon are actively used especially in Japan. Our findings include a larger number of replies on Twitter, more consistent user engagement on mstdn.jp, and different topic preferences on each server.</description>

      <title>Multi-view Spectral Clustering on the Grassmannian Manifold With Hypergraph Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph-based multi-view spectral clustering methods have achieved notable progress recently, yet they often fall short in either oversimplifying pairwise relationships or struggling with inefficient spectral decompositions in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that begins to generate hypergraphs by leveraging sparse representation learning from data points. Based on the generated hypergraph, we propose an optimization function with orthogonality constraints for multi-view hypergraph spectral clustering, which incorporates spectral clustering for each view and ensures consistency across different views. In Euclidean space, solving the orthogonality-constrained optimization problem may yield local maxima and approximation errors. Innovately, we transform this problem into an unconstrained form on the Grassmannian manifold. Finally, we devise an alternating iterative Riemannian optimization algorithm to solve the problem. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, we test it on four real-world multi-view datasets and compare its performance with seven state-of-the-art multi-view clustering algorithms. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baselines in terms of clustering performance due to its superior low-dimensional and resilient feature representation.</description>

      <title>Socioeconomic centers in cities worldwide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urban centers serve as engines of regional development, yet accurately defining and identifying the socioeconomic centers of cities globally remains a big challenge. Existing mapping efforts are often limited to large cities in developed regions and rely on data sources that are unavailable in many developing countries. This data scarcity hinders the establishment of consistent urban indicators, such as accessibility, to assess progress towards the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Here, we develop and validate a global map of the socioeconomic centers of cities for 2020 by integrating nighttime light and population density data within an advanced geospatial modeling framework. Our analysis reveals that monocentric cities -- the standard urban model -- still dominate our planet, accounting for over 80% of cities worldwide. However, these monocentric cities encompass only approximately 20% of the total urbanized area, urban population, and nighttime light intensity; this 80/20 pattern underscores significant disparities in urban development. Further analysis, combined with socioeconomic datasets, reveals a marked difference between developed and developing regions: high-income countries exhibit greater polycentricity than low-income countries, demonstrating a positive correlation between urban sprawl and economic growth. Our global dataset and findings provide critical insights into urban structure and development, with important implications for urban planning, policymaking, and the formulation of indicators for urban sustainability assessment.</description>

      <title>Improving Access to Trade and Investment Information in Thailand through Intelligent Document Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Overseas investment and trade can be daunting for beginners due to the vast amount of complex information. This paper presents a chatbot system that integrates natural language processing and information retrieval techniques to simplify the document retrieval process. The proposed system identifies the most relevant content, enabling users to navigate the intricate landscape of foreign trade and investment more efficiently. Our methodology combines the BM25 model and a deep learning model to rank and retrieve documents, aiming to reduce noise in the document content and enhance the accuracy of the results. Experiments with Thai natural language queries have demonstrated the effectiveness of our system in retrieving pertinent documents. A user satisfaction survey further validated the system's effectiveness. Most respondents found the system helpful and agreed with the suggested documents, indicating its potential as a valuable tool for Thai entrepreneurs navigating foreign trade and investment.</description>

      <title>Exact Community Recovery under Side Information: Optimality of Spectral Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of exact community recovery in general, two-community block models, in the presence of node-attributed $side$ $information$. We allow for a very general side information channel for node attributes, and for pairwise (edge) observations, consider both Bernoulli and Gaussian matrix models, capturing the Stochastic Block Model, Submatrix Localization, and $\mathbb{Z}_2$-Synchronization as special cases. A recent work of Dreveton et al. 2024 characterized the information-theoretic limit of a very general exact recovery problem with side information. In this paper, we show algorithmic achievability in the above important cases by designing a simple but optimal spectral algorithm that incorporates side information (when present) along with the eigenvectors of the pairwise observation matrix. Using the powerful tool of entrywise eigenvector analysis of Abbe et al. 2020, we show that our spectral algorithm can mimic the so called $genie$-$aided$ $estimators$, where the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ genie-aided estimator optimally computes the estimate of the $i^{\mathrm{th}}$ label, when all remaining labels are revealed by a genie. This perspective provides a unified understanding of the optimality of spectral algorithms for various exact recovery problems in a recent line of work.</description>

      <title>Prestige bias drives the viral spread of content reposted by influencers in online communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05448v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cultural evolution theory suggests that prestige bias - whereby individuals preferentially learn from prestigious figures - has played a key role in human ecological success. However, its impact within online environments remains unclear, particularly with respect to whether reposts by prestigious individuals amplify diffusion more effectively than reposts by noninfluential users. We analyzed over 55 million posts and 520 million reposts on Twitter (currently X) to examine whether users with high influence scores (hg indices) more effectively amplified the reach of others' content. Our findings indicate that posts shared by influencers are more likely to be further shared than those shared by non-influencers. This effect persisted over time, especially in viral posts. Moreover, a small group of highly influential users accounted for approximately half of the information flow within repost cascades. These findings demonstrate a prestige bias in information diffusion within the digital society, suggesting that cognitive biases shape content spread through reposting.</description>

      <title>Applicability of the Minimal Dominating Set for Influence Maximisation in Multilayer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The minimal dominating set (MDS) is a well-established concept in network controllability and has been successfully applied in various domains, including sensor placement, network resilience, and epidemic containment. In this study, we adapt the local-improvement MDS routine and explore its potential for enhancing seed selection for influence maximisation in multilayer networks (MLN). We employ the Linear Threshold Model (LTM), which offers an intuitive representation of influence spread or opinion dynamics by accounting for peer influence accumulation. To ensure interpretability, we utilise rank-refining seed selection methods, with the results further filtered with MDS. Our findings reveal that incorporating MDS into the seed selection process improves spread only within a specific range of situations. Notably, the improvement is observed for larger seed set budgets, lower activation thresholds, and when an "AND" strategy is used to aggregate influence across network layers. This scenario reflects situations where an individual does not require the majority of their acquaintances to hold a target opinion, but must be influenced across all social circles.</description>

      <title>The amplifier effect of artificial agents in social contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in artificial intelligence have led to the proliferation of artificial agents in social contexts, ranging from education to online social media and financial markets, among many others. The increasing rate at which artificial and human agents interact makes it urgent to understand the consequences of human-machine interactions for the propagation of new ideas, products, and behaviors in society. Across two distinct empirical contexts, we find here that artificial agents lead to significantly faster and wider social contagion. To this end, we replicate a choice experiment previously conducted with human subjects by using artificial agents powered by large language models (LLMs). We use the experiment's results to measure the adoption thresholds of artificial agents and their impact on the spread of social contagion. We find that artificial agents tend to exhibit lower adoption thresholds than humans, which leads to wider network-based social contagions. Our findings suggest that the increased presence of artificial agents in real-world networks may accelerate behavioral shifts, potentially in unforeseen ways.</description>

      <title>Detecting mental disorder on social media: a ChatGPT-augmented explainable approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the digital era, the prevalence of depressive symptoms expressed on social media has raised serious concerns, necessitating advanced methodologies for timely detection. This paper addresses the challenge of interpretable depression detection by proposing a novel methodology that effectively combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and conversational agents like ChatGPT. In our methodology, explanations are achieved by integrating BERTweet, a Twitter-specific variant of BERT, into a novel self-explanatory model, namely BERT-XDD, capable of providing both classification and explanations via masked attention. The interpretability is further enhanced using ChatGPT to transform technical explanations into human-readable commentaries. By introducing an effective and modular approach for interpretable depression detection, our methodology can contribute to the development of socially responsible digital platforms, fostering early intervention and support for mental health challenges under the guidance of qualified healthcare professionals.</description>

Abstract: When learning from graph data, the graph and the node features both give noisy information about the node labels. In this paper we propose an algorithm to jointly denoise the features and rewire the graph (JDR), which improves the performance of downstream node classification graph neural nets (GNNs). JDR works by aligning the leading spectral spaces of graph and feature matrices. It approximately solves the associated non-convex optimization problem in a way that handles graphs with multiple classes and different levels of homophily or heterophily. We theoretically justify JDR in a stylized setting and show that it consistently outperforms existing rewiring methods on a wide range of synthetic and real-world node classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Signed Graph Autoencoder for Explainable and Polarization-Aware Network Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10452</link>

Abstract: Autoencoders based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have garnered significant attention in recent years for their ability to extract informative latent representations, characterizing the structure of complex topologies, such as graphs. Despite the prevalence of Graph Autoencoders, there has been limited focus on developing and evaluating explainable neural-based graph generative models specifically designed for signed networks. To address this gap, we propose the Signed Graph Archetypal Autoencoder (SGAAE) framework. SGAAE extracts node-level representations that express node memberships over distinct extreme profiles, referred to as archetypes, within the network. This is achieved by projecting the graph onto a learned polytope, which governs its polarization. The framework employs a recently proposed likelihood for analyzing signed networks based on the Skellam distribution, combined with relational archetypal analysis and GNNs. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the SGAAEs' capability to successfully infer node memberships over the different underlying latent structures while extracting competing communities formed through the participation of the opposing views in the network. Additionally, we introduce the 2-level network polarization problem and show how SGAAE is able to characterize such a setting. The proposed model achieves high performance in different tasks of signed link prediction across four real-world datasets, outperforming several baseline models.</description>

      <title>Transparent Tagging for Strategic Social Nudges on User-Generated Misinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00825v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social network platforms (SNP) rely heavily on user-generated content to attract users, yet they have limited control over content provision, which leads to misinformation. As countermeasures, SNPs have implemented policies to notify users by tagging the content and influencing users' responses to the tagged content. The population-level response creates a social nudge to the content provider that encourages it to supply more authentic content. Yet, when designing tags to leverage social nudges, SNP must be cautious about misdetection, which impairs its ability to create social nudges. We establish a Bayesian persuaded branching process to study SNP's tagging policy design under misdetection. Misinformation circulation is modeled by a multi-type branching process, where users are persuaded through tags to give positive/negative comments that influence misinformation spread. When translated into posterior belief space, the SNP's problem is reduced to an equality-constrained optimization, the optimal condition of which is given by the Lagrangian characterization. The key finding is that SNP's optimal policy is transparent tagging, albeit misdetection, which nudges the provider not to generate misinformation.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Scale-free Graph Generator under Limited Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13888v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph generation is one of the most challenging tasks in recent years, and its core is to learn the ground truth distribution hiding in the training data. However, training data may not be available due to security concerns or unaffordable costs, which severely blows the learning models, especially the deep generative models. The dilemma leads us to rethink non-learned generation methods based on graph invariant features. Based on the observation of scale-free property, we propose a hierarchical scale-free graph generation algorithm. Specifically, we design a two-stage generation strategy. In the first stage, we sample multiple anchor nodes to further guide the formation of substructures, splitting the initial node set into multiple ones. Next, we progressively generate edges by sampling nodes through a degree mixing distribution, adjusting the tolerance towards exotic structures via two thresholds. We provide theoretical guarantees for hierarchical generation and verify the effectiveness of our method under 12 datasets of three categories. Experimental results show that our method fits the ground truth distribution better than various generation strategies and other distribution observations.</description>

      <title>Targeted incentives for social tipping in heterogeneous networked populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many societal challenges, such as climate change or disease outbreaks, require coordinated behavioral changes. For many behaviors, the tendency of individuals to adhere to social norms can reinforce the status quo. However, these same social processes can also result in rapid, self-reinforcing change. Interventions may be strategically targeted to initiate endogenous social change processes, often referred to as social tipping. While recent research has considered how the size and targeting of such interventions impact their effectiveness at bringing about change, they tend to overlook constraints faced by policymakers, including the cost, speed, and distributional consequences of interventions. To address this complexity, we introduce a game-theoretic framework that includes heterogeneous agents and networks of local influence. We implement various targeting heuristics based on information about individual preferences and commonly used local network properties to identify individuals to incentivize. Analytical and simulation results suggest that there is a trade-off between preventing backsliding among targeted individuals and promoting change among non-targeted individuals. Thus, where the change is initiated in the population and the direction in which it propagates is essential to the effectiveness of interventions. We identify cost-optimal strategies under different scenarios, such as varying levels of resistance to change, preference heterogeneity, and homophily. These results provide insights that can be experimentally tested and help policymakers to better direct incentives.</description>

      <title>Competing LLM Agents in a Non-Cooperative Game of Opinion Polarisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel non-cooperative game to analyse opinion formation and resistance, incorporating principles from social psychology such as confirmation bias, resource constraints, and influence penalties. Our simulation features Large Language Model (LLM) agents competing to influence a population, with penalties imposed for generating messages that propagate or counter misinformation. This framework integrates resource optimisation into the agents' decision-making process. Our findings demonstrate that while higher confirmation bias strengthens opinion alignment within groups, it also exacerbates overall polarisation. Conversely, lower confirmation bias leads to fragmented opinions and limited shifts in individual beliefs. Investing heavily in a high-resource debunking strategy can initially align the population with the debunking agent, but risks rapid resource depletion and diminished long-term influence.</description>

      <title>Invisible Walls in Cities: Leveraging Large Language Models to Predict Urban Segregation Experience with Social Media Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding experienced segregation in urban daily life is crucial for addressing societal inequalities and fostering inclusivity. The abundance of user-generated reviews on social media encapsulates nuanced perceptions and feelings associated with different places, offering rich insights into segregation. However, leveraging this data poses significant challenges due to its vast volume, ambiguity, and confluence of diverse perspectives. To tackle these challenges, we propose using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate online review mining for segregation prediction. We design a Reflective LLM Coder to digest social media content into insights consistent with real-world feedback, and eventually produce a codebook capturing key dimensions that signal segregation experience, such as cultural resonance and appeal, accessibility and convenience, and community engagement and local involvement. Guided by the codebook, LLMs can generate both informative review summaries and ratings for segregation prediction. Moreover, we design a REasoning-and-EMbedding (RE'EM) framework, which combines the reasoning and embedding capabilities of language models to integrate multi-channel features for segregation prediction. Experiments on real-world data demonstrate that our framework greatly improves prediction accuracy, with a 22.79% elevation in R2 and a 9.33% reduction in MSE. The derived codebook is generalizable across three different cities, consistently improving prediction accuracy. Moreover, our user study confirms that the codebook-guided summaries provide cognitive gains for human participants in perceiving POIs' social inclusiveness. Our study marks an important step toward understanding implicit social barriers and inequalities, demonstrating the great potential of promoting social inclusiveness with AI.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the temporal dynamics of linguistic features contained in misinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consumption of misinformation can lead to negative consequences that impact the individual and society. To help mitigate the influence of misinformation on human beliefs, algorithmic labels providing context about content accuracy and source reliability have been developed. Since the linguistic features used by algorithms to estimate information accuracy can change across time, it is important to understand their temporal dynamics. As a result, this study uses natural language processing to analyze PolitiFact statements spanning between 2010 and 2024 to quantify how the sources and linguistic features of misinformation change between five-year time periods. The results show that statement sentiment has decreased significantly over time, reflecting a generally more negative tone in PolitiFact statements. Moreover, statements associated with misinformation realize significantly lower sentiment than accurate information. Additional analysis shows that recent time periods are dominated by sources from online social networks and other digital forums, such as blogs and viral images, that contain high levels of misinformation containing negative sentiment. In contrast, most statements during early time periods are attributed to individual sources (i.e., politicians) that are relatively balanced in accuracy ratings and contain statements with neutral or positive sentiment. Named-entity recognition was used to identify that presidential incumbents and candidates are relatively more prevalent in statements containing misinformation, while US states tend to be present in accurate information. Finally, entity labels associated with people and organizations are more common in misinformation, while accurate statements are more likely to contain numeric entity labels, such as percentages and dates.</description>
