      <title>Rapidly-rotating quantum droplets confined in a harmonic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a "symmetric" quantum droplet in two spatial dimensions, which rotates in a harmonic potential, focusing mostly on the limit of "rapid" rotation. We examine this problem using a purely numerical approach, as well as a semi-analytic Wigner-Seitz approximation (first developed by Baym, Pethick et al.) for the description of the state with a vortex lattice. Within this approximation we assume that each vortex occupies a cylindrical cell, with the vortex-core size treated as a variational parameter. Working with a fixed angular momentum, as the angular momentum increases and depending on the atom number, the droplet accommodates none, few, or many vortices, before it turns to center-of-mass excitation. For the case of a "large" droplet, working with a fixed rotational frequency of the trap $\Omega$, as $\Omega$ approaches the trap frequency $\omega$, a vortex lattice forms, the number of vortices increases, the mean spacing between them decreases, while the "size" of each vortex increases as compared to the size of each cell. In contrast to the well-known problem of contact interactions, where we have melting of the vortex lattice and highly-correlated many-body states, here no melting of the vortex lattice is present, even when $\Omega = \omega$. This difference is due to the fact that the droplet is self-bound. Actually, for $\Omega = \omega$, the "smoothed" density distribution becomes a flat top, very much like the static droplet. When $\Omega$ exceeds $\omega$, the droplet maintains its shape and escapes to infinity, via center-of-mass motion.</description>

      <title>Unveiling Supersolid Order via Vortex Trajectory Correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02481v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The task of experimentally investigating the inherently dual properties of a supersolid, a simultaneous superfluid and solid, has become more critical following the recent experimental evidence for supersolids in dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) of $^{164}\text{Dy}$. We introduce a supersolid order parameter that uses vortex-vortex trajectory correlations to simultaneously reveal the periodic density of the underlying solid and superfluidity in a single measure. We propose experiments using existing technology to optically create and image trajectories of vortex dipoles in dipolar BECs. We numerically test our observable and find that vortex-vortex correlations reveal the supersolid lattice structure while distinguishing it from superfluidity. Our method sets the stage for experiments to use vortex trajectory correlations to investigate fundamental properties of supersolids arising from their dynamics and phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Cluster truncated Wigner approximation for bond-disordered Heisenberg spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive numerical investigation of the cluster Truncated Wigner Approximation (cTWA) applied to quench dynamics in bond-disordered Heisenberg spin chains with power-law interactions. We find that cTWA yields highly accurate results over a wide parameter range. However, its accuracy hinges on a suitable choice of clusters. By using a clustering strategy inspired by the strong disorder renormalisation group (SDRG)/real-space renormalization group (RSRG), clusters of two spins are sufficient to obtain essentially exact results in the regime of strong disorder. Surprisingly, even for rather weak disorder, e.g.\ in the presence of very long-range interactions, this choice of clustering outperforms a naive choice of clusters of consecutive spins. Additionally, we develop a discrete sampling scheme for the initial Wigner function, as an alternative to the originally introduced scheme based on Gaussian approximations. This sampling scheme puts cTWA on the same conceptional footing as regular dTWA for single spins and yields some reduction in the Monte Carlo shot noise compared to the Gaussian scheme.</description>

      <title>Localization beyond Dirac and Weyl fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In condensed matter, limited symmetry constraints allow free fermionic excitations to exist beyond the conventional Weyl and Dirac electrons of high-energy physics. These excitations carry a higher pseudospin, providing a natural generalization to the Weyl fermion. How do electrons beyond the conventional Dirac and Weyl fermions localize under disorder? In this Letter, we solve the problem of localization of free fermionic excitations carrying an arbitrary pseudospin-s. We derive exact analytical expressions for fermionic wavefunctions, scattering time, renormalized velocity, Cooperon, and the magnetoconductivity. We discover that the gapless Cooperon mode solely depends on the pseudospin even when Fermi surface is composed of multiple pockets, leading to weak localization (antilocalization) behavior for even (odd) s. Remarkably, we find the localization correction to scale exponentially with s, i.e., faster moving electrons are strongly susceptible to disorder effects. This opens up intriguing possibility for Anderson localization and many-body localization in these materials.</description>

      <title>The role of the effective range in strongly-interacting few-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly interacting systems appear in several areas of physics and are characterized by attractive interactions that can almost, or just barely, loosely bind two particles. Although this definition is made at the two-body level, this gives rise to fascinating effects in larger systems, including the so-called Efimov physics. In this context, the zero-range theory aims to describe low-energy properties based only on the scattering length. However, for a broad range of physical applications, the finite range of the interactions plays an important role. In this work, I discuss some aspects of finite-range effects in strongly interacting systems. I present the zero-range and shapeless universalities in two-body systems with applications in atomic and nuclear physics. I derived an analytical expression for the $s$-wave bound-state spectrum of the modified P\"oschl-Teller potential for two particles in three dimensions, which is compared with the approximations to illustrate their usefulness. Concerning three identical bosons, I presented a trimer energy scaling function that explicitly includes the effective range. The implications for larger systems are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Emerging supersolidity from a polariton condensate in a photonic crystal waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A supersolid is a counter-intuitive phase of matter where its constituent particles are arranged into a crystalline structure, yet they are free to flow without friction. This requires the particles to share a global macroscopic phase while being able to reduce their total energy by spontaneous, spatial self-organisation. This exotic state of matter has been achieved in different systems using Bose-Einstein condensates coupled to cavities, possessing spin-orbit coupling, or dipolar interactions. Here we provide experimental evidence of a new implementation of the supersolid phase in a novel non-equilibrium context based on exciton-polaritons condensed in a topologically non-trivial, bound-in-the-continuum state with exceptionally low losses. We measure the density modulation of the polaritonic state indicating the breaking of translational symmetry with a remarkable precision of a few parts in a thousand. Direct access to the phase of the wavefunction allows us to additionally measure the local coherence of the superfluid component. We demonstrate the potential of our synthetic photonic material to host phonon dynamics and a multimode excitation spectrum.</description>

      <title>Observation of a stripe phase in a spin-orbit coupled exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Bose-Einstein condensates, spin-orbit coupling produces supersolidity. It is a peculiar state of matter, which, in addition to the superfluid behaviour of weakly interacting Bose condensates, shows a periodic modulation of its density typical for crystals and called stripe phase. Here, we report the fabrication of a new type of samples allowing to achieve room-temperature supersolidity for a quantum fluid of light. The structure is an optical microcavity filled with a nematic liquid crystal (LC) sandwiched between two layers of the organic polymer MeLPPP. We demonstrate the formation of cavity exciton-polaritons in the presence of Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling (RDSOC), which is tuned by external voltage controlling the LC birefringence. In the RDSOC regime, we demonstrate exciton-polariton condensation in the two distinct degenerate minima of the dispersion. The condensate real space distribution shows both polarization and density stripes, which stem from the interference between phase-coherent condensate components characterized by different wavevectors and polarizations. The possibilities offered by this platform to tune the particle dispersion and to perform full state tomography, including time-resolved, open wide perspectives for detailed future studies of the static and dynamical behaviour of supersolids and of quantum fluids in presence of SOC and topologically non-trivial bands.</description>

Abstract: We study driven atomic Josephson junctions realized by coupling two two-dimensional atomic clouds with a tunneling barrier. By moving the barrier at a constant velocity, dc and ac Josephson regimes are characterized by a zero and nonzero atomic density difference across the junction, respectively. Here, we monitor the dynamics resulting in the system when, in addition to the above constant velocity protocol, the position of the barrier is periodically driven. We demonstrate that the time-averaged particle imbalance features a step-like behavior that is the analog of Shapiro steps observed in driven superconducting Josephson junctions. The underlying dynamics reveals an intriguing interplay of the vortex and phonon excitations, where Shapiro steps are induced via suppression of vortex growth. We study the system with a classical-field dynamics method, and benchmark our findings with a driven circuit dynamics.</description>

      <title>Interactions enable Thouless pumping in a nonsliding lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03756v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A topological 'Thouless' pump represents the quantised motion of particles in response to a slow, cyclic modulation of external control parameters. The Thouless pump, like the quantum Hall effect, is of fundamental interest in physics because it links physically measurable quantities, such as particle currents, to geometric properties of the experimental system, which can be robust against perturbations and thus technologically useful. So far, experiments probing the interplay between topology and inter-particle interactions have remained relatively scarce. Here we observe a Thouless-type charge pump in which the particle current and its directionality inherently rely on the presence of strong interactions. Experimentally, we utilise a two-component Fermi gas in a dynamical superlattice which does not exhibit a sliding motion and remains trivial in the single-particle regime. However, when tuning interparticle interactions from zero to positive values, the system undergoes a transition from being stationary to drifting in one direction, consistent with quantised pumping in the first cycle. Remarkably, the topology of the interacting pump trajectory cannot be adiabatically connected to a non-interacting limit, highlighted by the fact that only one atom is transferred per cycle. Our experiments suggest that Thouless charge pumps are promising platforms to gain insights into interaction-driven topological transitions and topological quantum matter.</description>

Abstract: Superfluid and dissipative regimes in the dynamics of a two-component quasi-one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with unequal atom numbers in the components have been explored. The system supports localized waves of the symbiotic type owing to the same-species repulsion and cross-species attraction. The minority BEC component moves through the majority component and creates excitations. To quantify the emerging excitations we introduce a time-dependent function called disturbance. Through numerical simulations of the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations with periodic boundary conditions, we have revealed a critical velocity of the localized wave, above which a transition from superfluid to dissipative regime occurs, evidenced by a sharp increase in the disturbance function. The factors responsible for the discrepancy between the actual critical velocity and the speed of sound, expected from theoretical arguments, have been discussed.</description>

      <title>Phase driven unconventional superradiance phase transition in non-Hermitian cascaded quantum Rabi cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates phase-driven symmetry breaking leading to superradiance phase transitions in cascaded non-Hermitian quantum Rabi cavities. Non-Hermiticity is introduced via the phase coupling $\varphi$ between the atom and the optical field. In the thermodynamic limit of the quantum harmonic oscillator, we analytically derive the superradiance phase boundary, validated by observables. An unconventional quantum phase transition without a Hermitian analogue arises when $|\varphi|=\frac{\pi}{4}$ or $|\varphi|=\frac{3\pi}{4}$, where the phase boundary is uniquely determined by the cavity coupling, at $\mathcal{J}=\frac{1}{2}$, independent of the atom-photon coupling strength $g$. For other $\varphi$, the phase boundary relies on both $\mathcal{J}$ and $g$, similar to the scenario observed in Hermitian systems. Furthermore, we identify phase-driven first- and second-order superradiance phase transitions, focusing on the quantum criticality of the second-order transition by determining the critical exponents and the universality class. The feasibility of experimental realization is also discussed, aiming to inspire further studies on non-Hermitian superradiance quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Odd-frequency superfluidity from a particle-number-conserving perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06325v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate odd-in-time - or odd-frequency - pairing of fermions in equilibrium systems within the particle-number-conserving framework of Penrose, Onsager and Yang, where superfluid order is defined by macroscopic eigenvalues of reduced density matrices. We show that odd-frequency pair correlations are synonymous with even fermion-exchange symmetry in a time-dependent correlation function that generalises the two-body reduced density matrix. Macroscopic even-under-fermion-exchange pairing is found to emerge from conventional Penrose-Onsager-Yang condensation in two-body or higher-order reduced density matrices through the symmetry-mixing properties of the Hamiltonian. We identify and characterise a transformer matrix responsible for producing macroscopic even fermion-exchange correlations that coexist with a conventional Cooper-pair condensate, while a generator matrix is shown to be responsible for creating macroscopic even fermion-exchange correlations from hidden orders such as a multi-particle condensate. The transformer scenario is illustrated using the spin-balanced s-wave superfluid with Zeeman splitting as an example. The generator scenario is demonstrated by the composite-boson condensate arising for itinerant electrons coupled to magnetic excitations. Structural analysis of the transformer and generator matrices is shown to provide general conditions for odd-frequency pairing order to arise in a given system. Our formalism facilitates a fully general derivation of the Meissner effect for odd-frequency superconductors that holds also beyond the regime of validity for mean-field theory.</description>
