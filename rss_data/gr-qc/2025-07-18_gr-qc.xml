      <title>Chaos of charged particles in quadrupole magnetic fields under Schwarzschild backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A four-vector potential of an external test electromagnetic field in a Schwarzschild background is described in terms of a combination of dipole and quadrupole magnetic fields. This combination is an interior solution of the source-free Maxwell equations. Such external test magnetic fields cause the dynamics of charged particles around the black hole to be nonintegrable, and are mainly responsible for chaotic dynamics of charged particles. In addition to the external magnetic fields, some circumstances should be required for the onset of chaos. The effect of the magnetic fields on chaos is shown clearly through an explicit symplectic integrator and a fast Lyapunov indicator. The inclusion of the quadrupole magnetic fields easily induces chaos, compared with that of the dipole magnetic fields. This result is because the Lorentz forces from the quadrupole magnetic fields are larger than those from the dipole magnetic fields. In addition, the Lorentz forces act as attractive forces, which are helpful to bring the occurrence of chaos in the nonintegrable case.</description>

      <title>The Preheating Stage on The Starobinsky Inflation after ACT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we reinvestigate the Starobinsky inflation and its reheating features after the ACT results. To make the Starobinsky model satisfy ACT with $68\%$ CL, the number of e-folds increases to $&gt;70$ while the reheating temperature drops to $10^4$ GeV. The preheating stages and the reheating temperature need to be adjusted drastically in favor of the lower temperature. We obtain that the preheating stage of Starobinsky inflation should be mixed between tachyonic and non-tachyonic preheating to favor the analytical estimation, PBH abundance, and the low reheating temperature at once. For that purpose, a varied momentum is necessary to obtain the favored results.</description>

      <title>Space-based mm/mg-scale Laser Interferometer for Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The experimental verification of the quantum nature of gravity represents a milestone in quantum gravity research. Recently, interest has grown for testing it via gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE). Here, we propose a space-based interferometer inspired by the LISA Pathfinder (LPF). Unlike the LPF, our design employs two smaller gold-platinum test masses, each weighing the milligram scale, surrounded by a shield below 2 K, and positioned side by side with a millimeter scale separation. This configuration enables the detection of GIE through simultaneous measurements of differential and common-mode motions. We simulate quantum measurements of these modes taking into account gas damping, black-body radiation, and cosmic-ray collisions to estimate the integration time for GIE detection. Our results show that GIE can be demonstrated with a few modifications to the LPF setup.</description>

      <title>Deflection of light by dark matter supporting traversable wormholes in the framework of Kalb-Ramond gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the possible formation of asymptotically flat traversable wormholes within dark matter halos under the framework of Kalb-Ramond gravity. The wormhole solutions are derived based on the King and Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter density profiles associated with anisotropic matter sources. For a particular set of parameters, the proposed shape functions are found to be positively increasing and satisfy all the essential geometric conditions along with the flare-out condition, thereby supporting asymptotically flat traversable wormholes. To study the underlying matter content responsible for the wormhole structures, we analyze the null energy condition at the wormhole throat and provide graphical representations of various energy conditions, highlighting both the regions where they are satisfied and where they are violated. The stability of the reported wormhole solutions is confirmed through the generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. In addition, we explore several physical features of the wormhole configurations, including the embedding surface, complexity factor, active gravitational mass, and total gravitational energy. Moreover, we investigate the deflection of light by these wormholes, finding that the deflection angle approaches zero at large distances, where the wormhole's gravity is negligible, and diverges near the throat, where the gravitational influence is extremely strong.</description>

      <title>Relativistic second gradient theory of continuous media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Relativity is a framework developed by Souriau in the sixties to better formulate General Relativity and its classical limit\,: Classical Continuum Mechanics. It has been used, for instance, to formulate Hyperelasticity in General Relativity. In that case, two primary variables are involved, the universe (Lorentzian) metric $g$ and the matter field $\Psi$. A Lagrangian density depending on the 1-jet of these variables is then introduced which must satisfy the principle of General Covariance. Souriau proved in 1958 that under these hypotheses, the Lagrangian density depends only on the punctual value of the matter field $\Psi$ and of a secondary variable $\mathbf{K}$, the conformation, an invariant of the diffeomorphism group, which is the Relativistic analog of the inverse of the right Cauchy--Green tensor. In the present work, an extension of Souriau's results to a second order gradient theory in General Relativity is presented. Accordingly, new higher order diffeomorphisms invariants are found. Their classical limits are calculated, showing that the 3-dimensional Continuum Mechanics second gradient theory can be derived from such a relativistic theory. Some of these invariants converge to objective quantities in the Galilean limit, others to non-objective quantities. The present work contributes thus to clarify the theoretical foundation of higher gradient Continuum Mechanics theory.</description>

      <title>Area-charge inequalities and rigidity of time-symmetric initial data sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish new area-charge inequalities for the boundary of time-symmetric Einstein-Maxwell initial data sets, in both compact and noncompact cases, under the dominant energy condition. These inequalities lead to novel rigidity theorems with no analogues in the uncharged setting. In the noncompact case, our result is obtained by applying Gromov's $\mu$-bubble technique in a new geometric context.</description>

      <title>Challenges in the nonlinear evolution of unequal mass binaries in sGB gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has only recently become possible to simulate the full nonlinear dynamics of binary black holes in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories of gravity. The simulations remain technically challenging and evolutions of unequal mass binaries in particular have been difficult to follow through the merger. Even when the merger is successful, accurately quantifying the physical dephasing, as opposed to contributions from transients in the initial data and gauge adjustments, remains difficult. We show the first full simulations of 2:1 and 3:1 binaries through merger, and we discuss how specific choices in the setup affect the dephasing observed and our ability to obtain reliable results. In cases with weaker couplings, we match the expected PN value for the dephasing, whereas for larger couplings, eccentricity introduced by the initial data transients can lead to artificial deviations. Our work highlights the need for improvements in the initial data methods used, to ensure reliable waveforms are obtained for data analysis in beyond-GR models.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Lensing by Black Holes in Einstein-nonlinear Electrodynamic Theories with Multiple Photon Spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the gravitational lensing effects of non-linear electrodynamic black holes. Non-linear electrodynamic black holes serve as typical models for multi-event horizon black holes. Depending on the choice of metric parameters, these black holes can possess more than five event horizons. Consequently, within certain parameter ranges, black holes can have more than three photon spheres of varying sizes outside the event horizon. Specifically, we focus on the strong gravitational lensing effects near the triple photon spheres, particularly the formation of higher-order images of point sources and celestial spheres. The presence of one, two, or three or more photon spheres significantly increases the number of higher-order images of a point source. When a black hole is illuminated by a celestial sphere, the three photon spheres generate three critical curves in the black hole image, with the smallest critical curve coinciding with the shadow's edge. Additionally, since non-linear electrodynamic black holes are models of multi-event horizon black holes, we can infer the gravitational lensing effects and the changes in celestial images for black holes with more than three photon spheres by analyzing the distinctions and patterns between the gravitational lensing effects of one, two, and three photon spheres.</description>

      <title>Effect of Non-commutativity on Accretion Disks around RGI-Schwarzschild Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the combined effects of quantum gravity induced by non-commutativity and scale-dependent gravitational coupling on the thermal properties of the thin accretion disks around a Schwarzschild black hole. We consider a $\kappa$-deformed Renormalization Group Induced (RGI) Schwarzschild black hole, where the classical Schwarzschild black hole geometry is modified by the $\kappa$-deformation of space-time and the running Newton's coupling constant $G(r)$. Using the modified metric, we derive the geodesic motion of massive particles, the effective potential, and the thermal properties such as the radiated energy flux, and the temperature profile of the accretion disk around the $\kappa$-deformed RGI-Schwarzschild black hole. Our study shows that when non-commutativity is combined with the RGI framework, the effects produce a noticeable deviation from the classical Schwarzschild case. In particular, for small values of the deformation parameter, we observe an increase in the peak energy flux and the temperature of the accretion disk. This suggests that quantum gravity corrections enhance the disk's radiative efficiency, especially in the inner regions close to the black hole.</description>

      <title>Probing the Schwarzschild black hole immersed in a dark matter halo through astrophysical tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a recently derived Schwarzschild-like black hole (BH) immersed in a Dehnen-type $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma)=(1,4,5/2)$ dark matter (DM) halo. We obtain constraints on the two model parameters, i.e., the halo core radius $r_s$ and the DM density parameter $\rho_s$ in both the weak and the strong field regimes. In the weak field, we model test particle geodesics and match the predicted perihelion shift to Mercury (Solar System) and the orbit of the S2 star data, obtaining upper limits on $r_s$ and $\rho_s$. In the strong field, we analyse twin high frequency quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) from four microquasars (e.g., GRO J1655-40, GRS 1915+105, XTE J1859+226, and XTE J1550-564). Because QPO frequencies depend only on the local spacetime curvature, they can serve as a probe of halo-induced deviations from general relativity. Our MCMC analysis produces posterior distributions for model parameters, revealing close agreement between the theoretical QPO frequencies and the observations for GRS 1915+105 and GRO J1655-40. The same analysis also yielded best-fit values and upper bounds for each parameter. Our combined geodesic and QPO analysis demonstrates that timelike orbits and epicyclic oscillations can act as sensitive probes of DM halos around BHs, offering a pathway to distinguish Dehnen-type profiles from alternative DM distributions in future analysis and observations.</description>

      <title>Transverse relative locality effects in de Sitter spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doubly Special Relativity (DSR) models are characterized by the deformation of relativistic symmetries at the Planck scale and constitute one of the cornerstones for quantum gravity phenomenology research, due to the possibility of testing them with cosmological messengers. Some of their predictions manifest themselves as relative locality effects, implying that events local to an observer might not appear to be so for a distant one. In this work we focus on transverse relative locality models, where the delocalization occurs along the direction perpendicular to the one connecting two distant observers. We present the first generalization of these models in curved spacetime, constructing a transverse deformation of the de Sitter algebra in 2 + 1 D and investigating its phenomenological implications on particle propagation.</description>

      <title>Comparing astrophysical models to gravitational-wave data in the observable space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Comparing population-synthesis models to the results of hierarchical Bayesian inference in gravitational-wave astronomy requires a careful understanding of the domain of validity of the models fitted to data. This comparison is usually done using the inferred astrophysical distribution: from the data that were collected, one deconvolves selection effects to reconstruct the generating population distribution. In this letter, we demonstrate the benefits of instead comparing observable populations directly. In this approach, the domain of validity of the models is trivially respected, such that only the relevant parameter space regions as predicted by the astrophysical models of interest contribute to the comparison. We clarify that unbiased inference of the observable compact-binary population is indeed possible. Crucially, this approach still requires incorporating selection effects, but in a manner that differs from the standard implementation. We apply our observable-space reconstruction to LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data from their third observing run and illustrate its potential by comparing the results to the predictions of a fiducial population-synthesis model.</description>

      <title>Gravitational redshift from large-scale structure: nonlinearities, anti-symmetries, and the dipole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational redshift imprints a slight asymmetry in the observed clustering of galaxies, producing odd multipoles (e.g.\ the dipole) in the cross-correlation function. But there are other sources of asymmetry which must also be considered in any model which aims to measure gravitational redshift from large-scale structure. In this work we develop a nonlinear model of the redshift-space correlation function complete down to these subleading, asymmetric effects. In addition to gravitational redshift and the well-known redshift-space distortions, our model, given by a compact nonperturbative formula, also accounts for wide-angle effects (to all orders), lightcone effects, and other kinematic contributions. We compare our model with $N$-body simulations and find good agreement; in particular we find that the observed turnover in the dipole moment around a separation of $20\,h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$ (a feature absent in the linear predictions) is well accounted for. By examining the exchange properties of distinct tracers, we identify the pairwise potential difference as the key physical ingredient of the dipole. Several new insights related to the theory of redshift-space distortions are also given.</description>

      <title>You've got a Freund--Rubin in Me: The Aretakis Instability of Extremal Black Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the Aretakis instability affects non-dilatonic extremal black $p$-branes by focusing on their near-horizon geometry. Crucially, the strength of the instability, \textit{i.e.} the number of transverse derivatives needed to see non-decay/blow-up of fields on the horizon at late null time, is given by the scaling dimensions with respect to the near-horizon $\mathrm{AdS}_{p+2}$-factor. This renders the problem of determining the severity of the Aretakis instability equivalent to computing the Kaluza--Klein spectrum of fields on Freund--Rubin spaces. We use this to argue that non-dilatonic extremal black branes suffer from the Aretakis instability even in the absence of additional fields -- we find that this is weaker than for extremal black holes. We also argue that the scaling dimensions determine the smoothness of stationary deformations to the original black brane background -- here, our findings indicate that generically more modes can lead to worse curvature singularities compared to extremal black holes.</description>

      <title>Systematics from NICER Pulse Profiles Drive Uncertainty in Multi-Messenger Inference of the Neutron Star Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EOS) and mass distribution using a unified Bayesian inference framework that incorporates latest NICER measurements, including PSR J0614$-$3329, alongside gravitational wave data, radio pulsar masses, and nuclear theory. By systematically comparing four inference scenarios--varying in the inclusion of PSR J0614$-$3329 and in the pulse profile model used for PSR J0030+0451--we quantify the impact of observational and modeling choices on dense matter inference. We find that pulse profile systematics dominate EOS uncertainties: the choice of hot spot geometry for PSR J0030+0451 leads to significant shifts in the inferred stiffness of the EOS and maximum neutron star mass. In contrast, PSR J0614$-$3329 mildly softens the EOS at low densities, reducing the radius at \(1.4\,M_\odot\) by \(\sim 100\)~m. A Bayesian model comparison yields a Bayes factor of $\log_{10} \mathrm{BF} \approx 1.58$ in favor of the ST+PDT model over PDT-U, providing strong evidence that multi-messenger EOS inference can statistically discriminate between competing NICER pulse profile models. These results highlight the critical role of NICER systematics in dense matter inference and the power of joint analyses in breaking modeling degeneracies.</description>

      <title>The Physical Origin and Time Lag of Multi-Frequency Flares from SgrA*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sagittarius~A$^*$, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy, exhibits flares across various wavelengths, yet their origins remain elusive. We performed 3D two-temperature General Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of magnetized accretion flows initialized from multi-loop magnetic field configuration onto a rotating black hole and conducted General Relativistic Radiative Transfer (GRRT) calculations considering contributions from both thermal and non-thermal synchrotron emission processes. Our results indicate that the polarity inversion events from the multi-loop magnetic field configurations can generate $138\,\rm THz$ flares consistent with observations with the help of non-thermal emission. By tracing the intensity evolution of light rays in GRRT calculations, we identify the precise location of the flaring region and confirm that it originates from a large-scale polarity inversion event. We observe time delays between different frequencies, with lower-frequency radio flares lagging behind higher frequencies due to plasma self-absorption in the disk. The time delay between near-infrared and 43 GHz flares can reach up to $\sim 50$ min, during which the flaring region gradually shifts outward, becoming visible at lower frequencies. Our study confirms that large-scale polarity inversion in a Standard And Normal Evolution (SANE) accretion flow with a multi-loop initial magnetic configuration can be a potential mechanism driving flares from Sgr~A$^*$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave standard sirens: A brief review of cosmological parameter estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) observations are expected to serve as a powerful and independent probe of the expansion history of the universe. By providing direct and calibration-free measurements of luminosity distances through waveform analysis, GWs provide a fundamentally different and potentially more robust approach to measuring cosmic-scale distances compared to traditional electromagnetic observations, which is known as the standard siren method. In this review, we present an overview of recent developments in GW standard siren cosmology, the latest observational results, and prospects for constraining cosmological parameters using future GW detections. We first introduce standard sirens based on how redshift information is obtained and outline the Bayesian framework used in cosmological parameter estimation. We then review the measurements on the Hubble constant from the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network and present the potential role of future standard siren observations in cosmological parameter estimations. A central focus of this review is the unique ability of GW observations to break cosmological parameter degeneracies inherent in the EM observations. Since the cosmological parameter degeneracy directions of GW and EM observations are quite different (roughly orthogonal in some cases), their combination can significantly improve constraints on cosmological parameters. This complementarity is expected to become one of the most critical advantages for GW standard siren cosmology. Looking forward, we highlight the importance of combining GW standard sirens with other emerging late-universe cosmological probes such as fast radio bursts, 21 cm intensity mapping, and strong gravitational lensing to forge a precise cosmological probe for exploring the late universe. Finally, we introduce the challenges and the role of machine learning in future standard siren analysis.</description>

      <title>Analytic Gravitational Wave Spectrum in Next-to-Minimal Bouncing Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bouncing cosmology offers a singularity-free alternative to inflation, but its minimal realization-comprising only four cosmic phases-predicts a simple power-law stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) with a narrow observational window. We introduce the next-to-minimal bouncing cosmology (NMBC), which adds an extra early contraction phase that imprints a broken power-law feature in the SGWB spectrum, enhancing detectability. Using our matrix-representation method grounded in an inequality algebra, we derive a closed-form expression for the NMBC SGWB spectrum. From this analytical result, we show that all NMBC models satisfying the current \(\Delta N_{\rm eff}\) bound \(\Omega_{\rm GW}h^2(f)&lt;1.7\times10^{-6}\) automatically avoid the trans-Planckian problem, \(\rho_{s\downarrow}^{1/4}&lt;0.79\,m_{\rm pl}\). These findings establish the NMBC as a self-consistent, self-contained framework capable of generating a potentially detectable SGWB in both astrophysical and laboratory searches, and demonstrate the broad utility of our matrix-representation method for future SGWB analyses in multi-phase cosmologies.</description>

      <title>Revealing tensions in neutron star observations with pressure anisotropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pressure isotropy, i.e., radial pressure equal to tangential pressure, is often assumed when studying neutron stars. However, multiple physical mechanisms, including pion/kaon condensation, magnetic fields, superfluidity, dark matter clustering, and violations of general relativity, can lead to a pressure anisotropy. This work presents a comprehensive measurement of pressure anisotropy in neutron stars. Our analysis incorporates both an extensive set of nuclear experimental constraints and multi-messenger astrophysical observations, including gravitational wave detections and electromagnetic observations. The Bayesian framework employed marginalizes over equation of state uncertainties and allows the anisotropy to vary between individual neutron stars. We find the Bayes factor for anisotropy against isotropy is $e^{0.46}=10^{0.20}=1.58\gtrsim 3:2$. Additionally, the posterior indicates a population-wide preference for negative pressure anisotropy, with GW170817 serving as the primary contributor. The individual variability suggests density-scale-independent anisotropy, potentially attributable to magnetic fields, dark matter clustering, or deviations from general relativity rather than phase transitions. While the evidence for pressure anisotropy remains inconclusive, these results demonstrate that pressure anisotropy can be utilized as a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying missing physics in neutron star modeling or revealing tension among observations in the era of multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new mechanism of non-thermal particle production during inflation based on a narrow parametric resonance, akin to the dynamics of post-inflationary preheating. The mechanism is based on the production of scalar particles with a mass that is an oscillating function of the slowly-rolling inflaton field. This is achieved in a scenario for the collective spontaneous breaking of a U(1) gauge symmetry that, while originally proposed in the context of warm inflation, leads to non-equilibrium particle production sustaining a (sub-dominant) non-thermal radiation bath throughout inflation. We show that this may leave an observational imprint, namely oscillatory features in the primordial curvature power spectrum alongside a (mild) resonant enhancement of its amplitude, as well as secondary gravitational waves that can be probed with future CMB experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing the nature of gravity in the low-acceleration limit: wide binaries of extreme separations with perspective effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent statistical analyses of wide binaries have revealed a boost in gravitational acceleration with respect to the prediction by Newtonian gravity at low internal accelerations $\lesssim 10^{-9}$ m\,s$^{-2}$. This phenomenon is important because it does not permit the dark matter interpretation, unlike galaxy rotation curves. We extend previous analyses by increasing the maximum sky-projected separation from 30 to 50 kilo astronomical units (kau). We show that the so-called ``perspective effects'' are not negligible at this extended separation and, thus, incorporate it in our analysis. With wide binaries selected with very stringent criteria, we find that the gravitational acceleration boost factor, $\gamma_g \equiv g_{\rm obs}/g_{\mathrm N}$, is $1.61^{+0.37}_{-0.29}$ (from $\delta_{\rm obs-newt}\equiv (\log_{10}\gamma_g)/\sqrt{2}=0.147\pm0.062$) at Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-11.0}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, corresponding to separations of tens of kau for solar-mass binaries. At Newtonian accelerations $g_{\mathrm N} = 10^{-10.3}$ m\,s$^{-2}$, we find $\gamma_g=1.26^{+0.12}_{-0.10}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.072\pm0.027$). For all binaries with $g_{\rm N}\lesssim10^{-10}$ m\,$s^{-2}$ from our sample, we find $\gamma_g=1.32^{+0.12}_{-0.11}$ ($\delta_{\rm obs-newt}=0.085\pm0.027$). These results are consistent with the generic prediction of MOND-type modified gravity, although the current data are not sufficient to pin down the low-acceleration limiting behavior. Finally, we emphasize that the observed deviation from Newtonian gravity cannot be explained by the perspective effects or any separation-dependent eccentricity variation which we take into account.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The experimentally observed temperature-dependent shear and bulk viscosities of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP), along with its apparent violation of the Kovtun-Son-Starinets (KSS) bound $\eta/s=1/(4\pi)$, necessitate a holographic description that incorporates higher-derivative corrections. We propose a five-dimensional Einstein-Scalar-Maxwell-Gauss-Bonnet model in which a scalar-Gauss-Bonnet coupling $H(\phi)$ encodes leading curvature corrections. Although no closed-form black hole solution is available, we employ an entropy-production analysis at the event horizon to derive exact analytic formulas for the shear viscosity $\eta$ and bulk viscosity $\zeta$. These expressions exhibit apparent deviation from the KSS bound and nontrivial temperature dependence. We then perform an independent computation via the retarded Green function (Kubo) method, finding perfect agreement for $\eta$ and isolating a single constant in $\zeta$ that requires numerical determination. Our dual derivation underscores the pivotal role of higher-derivative terms in realistic QGP modeling and demonstrates the efficacy of nonanalytic holographic backgrounds in capturing the dynamics of strongly coupled fluids.</description>

      <title>Gravity-mediated entanglement via infinite-dimensional systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been a wave of recent interest in detecting the quantum nature of gravity with table-top experiments that witness gravitationally mediated entanglement. Central to these proposals is the assumption that any mediator capable of generating entanglement must itself be nonclassical. However, previous arguments for this have modelled classical mediators as finite, discrete systems such as bits, which excludes physically relevant continuous and infinite-dimensional systems such as those of classical mechanics and field theory. In this work, we close this gap by modelling classical systems as commutative unital C*-algebras, arguably encompassing all potentially physically relevant classical systems. We show that these systems cannot mediate entanglement between two quantum systems A and B, even if A and B are themselves infinite-dimensional or described by arbitrary unital C*-algebras (as in Quantum Field Theory), composed with an arbitrary C*-tensor product. This result reinforces the conclusion that the observation of gravity-induced entanglement would require the gravitational field to possess inherently non-classical features.</description>

      <title>Decay and lifetime of oscillons coupled to an external scalar field: Insights from instability band analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillons are long-lived, spherically symmetric solitons that can arise in real scalar field theories with potentials shallower than quadratic ones. They are considered to form via parametric resonance during the preheating stage after inflation and have extended lifetimes. However, the estimation of their lifespan becomes complicated when taking into account the interactions between the inflaton field and other fields, as naturally expected in realistic reheating scenarios. In this study, we investigate how the lifetime of a single oscillon is affected by the coupling to the external real scalar field. By numerically computing the instability bands of the external field with the inhomogeneous oscillon profile as background, we show that the resonance behavior depends intricately on the coupling strength and shape of the oscillon. We analyze distinct instability mechanisms that dominate across different regimes of the coupling strength and oscillon shapes. Especially, we show that the parametric resonance fails to occur when the oscillon size is too limited to drive enhancement of the external field. Furthermore, our simulations show that as the oscillon loses energy, the exponential growth of the external field can terminate before the oscillon reaches its critical energy for collapse, which indicates that the external field does not necessarily lead to rapid destruction of oscillons even in the presence of strong coupling or with large amplitudes. These results suggest that oscillons can remain long-lived across a wide range of coupling strengths, with potential implications for their role in cosmological evolution.</description>

      <title>On gauge transformations in twistless torsional Newton--Cartan geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Twistless torsional Newton--Cartan (TTNC) geometry exists in two variants, type I and type II, which differ by their gauge transformations. In TTNC geometry there exists a specific locally Galilei-invariant function, called by different names in existing literature, that we dub the `locally Galilei-invariant potential'. We show that in both types of TTNC geometry, there always exists a local gauge transformation that transforms the locally Galilei-invariant potential to zero. For type I TTNC geometry, we achieve this due to the corresponding equation for the gauge parameter taking the form of a Hamilton--Jacobi equation. In the case of type II TTNC geometry, we perform subleading spatial diffeomorphisms. In both cases, our arguments rigorously establish the existence of the respective gauge transformation also in case of only finite-degree differentiability of the geometric fields. This improves upon typical arguments for `gauge fixing' in the literature, which need analyticity.
  We consider two applications of our result. First, it generalises a classical result in standard Newton--Cartan geometry. Second, it allows to (locally) parametrise TTNC geometry in two new ways: either in terms of just the space metric and a unit timelike vector field, or in terms of the distribution of spacelike vectors and a positive-definite cometric.</description>

      <title>Bound-state solutions for the charged Dirac oscillator in a rotating frame in the Bonnor-Melvin-Lambda spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the relativistic bound-state solutions for the charged (DO) Dirac oscillator in a rotating frame in the Bonnor-Melvin-Lambda spacetime in $(2+1)$-dimensions, where such solutions are given by the two-component normalizable Dirac spinor and by the relativistic energy spectrum. To analytically solve our problem, we consider two approximations, where the first is that the cosmological constant is very small (conical approximation), and the second is that the linear velocity of the rotating frame is much less than the speed of light (slow rotation regime). After solving a second-order differential equation, we obtain a generalized Laguerre equation, whose solutions are the generalized Laguerre polynomials. Consequently, we obtain the energy spectrum, which is quantized in terms of the radial and total magnetic quantum numbers $n$ and $m_j$, and depends on the angular frequency $\omega$ (describes the DO), cyclotron frequency $\omega_c$ (describes the external magnetic field), angular velocity $\Omega$ (describes the rotating frame), spin parameter $s$ (describes the ``spin''), spinorial parameter $u$ (describes the components of the spinor), effective rest mass $m_{eff}$ (describes the rest mass modified by the spin-rotation coupling), and on a real parameter $\sigma$ and cosmological constant $\Lambda$ (describes the Bonnor-Melvin-Lambda spacetime). In particular, we note that this spectrum is asymmetrical (due to $\Omega$) and has its degeneracy broken (due to $\sigma$ and $\Lambda$). Besides, we also graphically analyze the behavior of the spectrum and of the probability density as a function of the parameters of the system for different values of $n$ and $m_j$.</description>

      <title>Modified gravitational wave propagations in linearized gravity with Lorentz and diffeomorphism violations and their gravitational wave constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard model extension (SME) is an effective field theory framework that can be used to study the possible violations of Lorentz symmetry and diffeomorphism invariance in the gravitational interaction. In this paper, we explore both the Lorentz- and diffeomorphism-violating effects on the propagations of gravitational waves in the SME's linearized gravity. It is shown that the violations of Lorentz symmetry and diffeomorphism invariance modify the conventional linear dispersion relation of gravitational waves, leading to anisotropy, birefringence, and dispersion effects in the propagation of gravitational waves. With these modified dispersion relations, we then calculate the dephasing effects due to the Lorentz and diffeomorphism violations in the waveforms of gravitational waves produced by the coalescence of compact binaries. With the distorted waveforms, we perform full Bayesian inference with the help of the open source software \texttt{BILBY} on the gravitational wave events of the compact binary mergers in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalogs GWTC-3. We consider the effects from the operators with the lowest mass dimension $d=2$ and $d=3$ due to the Lorentz and diffeomorphism violations in the linearized gravity. No signature of Lorentz and diffeomorphism violations arsing from the SME's linearized gravity are found for most GW events, which allows us to give a $90\%$ confidence interval for each Lorentz- and diffeomorphism-violating coefficient.</description>

Abstract: The future ground- and space-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors offer unprecedented opportunities to test general relativity (GR) with greater precision. In this work, we investigate the capability of future ground-based GW detectors, the Einstein Telescope (ET) and the Cosmic Explorer (CE), and space-based GW detectors, LISA, Taiji, and TianQin, for constraining parity and Lorentz violations in gravity. We inject several typical GW signals from compact binary systems into GW detectors and perform Bayesian inferences with the modified waveforms with parity and Lorentz-violating effects. These effects are modeled in the amplitude and phase corrections to the GW waveforms with their frequency-dependence described by factors $\beta_{\nu}$, $\beta_{\mu}$, $\beta_{\bar \nu}$, and $\beta_{\bar \mu}$. Our results show that the combined observations of ET and CE will impose significantly tighter bounds on the energy scale of parity and Lorentz violations ($M_{\rm PV}$ and $M_{\rm LV}$) compared to those given by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) detectors. For cases with positive values of $\beta_{\nu}$, $\beta_{\mu}$, $\beta_{\bar \nu}$, and $\beta_{\bar \mu}$, the constraints on $M_{\rm PV}$ and $M_{\rm LV}$ from ground-based detectors are tighter than those from the space-based detectors. For the $\beta_{\mu} = -1$ case, space-based GW detectors provide constraints on $M_{\rm PV}$ that are better than current LVK observations and comparable to those from ET and CE. Additionally, space-based detectors exhibit superior sensitivity in constraining $M_{\rm LV}$ for $\beta_{\bar \mu} = -2$ case, which is approximately three orders of magnitude tighter than those from ground-based GW detectors. This scenario also enables bounds on the graviton mass at $m_g \lesssim 10^{-35}\; {\rm GeV}$. These findings highlight the promising role of future GW observatories in probing fundamental physics beyond GR.</description>

Abstract: Adopting the modifications induced by the Kaniadakis entropy on the Friedmann equations, we explore some relevant aspects of this cosmological scenario at the background level. We analyze the constraint imposed on the parameter $K$ obtained from the accelerated cosmic expansion condition, and we also study the role of such a parameter as a cosmological constant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravity is identical to curved spacetime. It is manifested by the curvature of a Riemannian spacetime in general relativity but by torsion or non-metricity in teleparallel gravity models. In this paper, we apply these multiple options to the spacetime perturbation theory and seek the possibilities of representing the gravitation of the background and that of the perturbation in separate ways. We show that the perturbation around a Riemannian background can be described by torsion or non-metricity, so that we have teleparallel like actions for the perturbation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13145v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Tsallis-Cirto non-extensive statistics with $\delta=2$ describes the processes of splitting and merging of black holes and their thermodynamics. Here we consider a toy model, which matches this generalized statistics and extends it by providing the integer valued entropy of the black hole, $S_{\rm BH}(N)=N(N-1)/2$. In this model the black hole consists of $N$ the so-called Planckons -- objects with reduced Planck mass $m_{\rm P}=1/\sqrt{8\pi G}$ -- so that its mass is quantized, $M=Nm_{\rm P}$. The entropy of each Planckon is zero, but the entropy of black hole with $N$ Planckons is provided by the $N(N-1)/2$ degrees of freedom -- the correlations between the gravitationally attracted Planckons. This toy model can be extended to a charged Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole, which consists of charged Planckons. Despite the charge, the statistical ensemble of Planckons remains the same, and the RN black hole with $N$ Planckons has the same entropy as the electrically neutral hole, $S_{\rm RNBH}(N)=N(N-1)/2$. This is supported by the adiabatic process of transformation from the RN to Schwarzschild black hole by varying the fine structure constant. The adiabaticity is violated in the extreme limit, when the gravitational interaction between two Planckons is compensated by the repulsion between their electric charges, and the RN black hole loses stability. The entropy of a white hole formed by the same $N$ Planckons has negative entropy, $S_{\rm WH}(N)=-N(N-1)/2$.</description>

      <title>Spherical Orbital Dynamics and Relativistic Precession in Kerr-MOG Spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and relativistic precessions of massive particles on spherical orbits around Kerr-MOG black holes in scalar-tensor-vector gravity (STVG). By employing the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism, we derive conserved quantities and analyze how the MOG parameter $\alpha$ and orbital tilt angle $\zeta$ influence the innermost stable spherical orbits (ISSOs) and orbital stability. We compute the nodal and periastron precession frequencies, finding that nodal precession increases monotonically with both black hole spin and MOG parameter, while periastron precession exhibits a more complex behavior: MOG amplifies curvature-induced effects, which can be partially counteracted by spin. Furthermore, to complement the orbital analysis, we examine the Lense-Thirring spin precession of a gyroscope and demonstrate its sensitivity to the MOG parameter, spin, and orbital tilt angle. These results reveal distinctive signatures of modified gravity in orbital dynamics and provide a potential observational probe to test deviations from general relativity near rotating black holes.</description>

      <title>Energy Extraction via Magnetic Reconnection in Kerr-Sen-AdS$_{4}$ Black Hole: Circular Plasma and Plunging Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the power and efficiency of energy extraction through magnetic reconnection in the Kerr-Sen-AdS$_{4}$ black hole, with a primary focus on both the circular orbit and plunging region. We plot the allowed regions for energy extraction and present corresponding power and efficiency values, comparing them with those of the Blandford-Znajek (BZ) mechanism. Our analysis reveals that energy extraction remains feasible even at a spin parameter as low as 0.5, significantly below previously reported thresholds, and the extracted power can exceed that of the BZ process under certain conditions. Furthermore, the dilatonic scalar charge $b$ and the AdS radius $l$ collectively contribute to lowering the spin threshold for energy extraction. The energy extraction process in the plunging region was further examined by analyzing the permissible energy extraction region, as well as the corresponding power output and efficiency. One can find that the energy extraction is possible even at a spin as low as 0.25. Crucially, parameter $b$ actively lowers the energy extraction spin threshold, while parameter $l$ exerts a counteracting effect, impeding such reduction. This trend shows a marked contrast with circular orbit behavior. Additionally, both power and efficiency in the plunging region consistently surpass those in the circular orbit region, indicating superior energy extraction capability in plunging region.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances in Simulation-based Inference for Gravitational Wave Data Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11192v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has ushered in a new era of observational astronomy, emphasizing the need for rapid and detailed parameter estimation and population-level analyses. Traditional Bayesian inference methods, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo, face significant computational challenges when dealing with the high-dimensional parameter spaces and complex noise characteristics inherent in gravitational wave data. This review examines the emerging role of simulation-based inference methods in gravitational wave astronomy, with a focus on approaches that leverage machine-learning techniques such as normalizing flows and neural posterior estimation. We provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundations underlying various simulation-based inference methods, including neural posterior estimation, neural ratio estimation, neural likelihood estimation, flow matching, and consistency models. We explore the applications of these methods across diverse gravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter estimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and conducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed improvements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their model-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to their widespread adoption. Their accuracy, which is similar to that of conventional methods, requires further validation across broader parameter spaces and noise conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.01665v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Euclidean path integral of two-dimensional quantum gravity with positive cosmological constant coupled to conformal matter with large and positive central charge. The problem is considered in a semiclassical expansion about a round two-sphere saddle. We work in the Weyl gauge whereby the computation reduces to that for a (timelike) Liouville theory. We present results up to two-loops, including a discussion of contributions stemming from the gauge fixing procedure. We exhibit cancelations of ultraviolet divergences and provide a path integral computation of the central charge for timelike Liouville theory. Combining our analysis with insights from the DOZZ formula we are led to a proposal for an all orders result for the two-dimensional gravitational partition function on the two-sphere.</description>

      <title>Positive mass theorems for spin initial data sets with arbitrary ends and dominant energy shields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05277v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a positive mass theorem for spin initial data sets $(M,g,k)$ that contain an asymptotically flat end and a shield of dominant energy (a subset of $M$ on which the dominant energy scalar $\mu-|J|$ has a positive lower bound). In a similar vein, we show that for an asymptotically flat end $\mathcal{E}$ that violates the positive mass theorem (i.e. $\mathrm{E} &lt; |\mathrm{P}|$), there exists a constant $R&gt;0$, depending only on $\mathcal{E}$, such that any initial data set containing $\mathcal{E}$ must violate the hypotheses of Witten's proof of the positive mass theorem in an $R$-neighborhood of $\mathcal{E}$. This implies the positive mass theorem for spin initial data sets with arbitrary ends, and we also prove a rigidity statement. Our proofs are based on a modification of Witten's approach to the positive mass theorem involving an additional independent timelike direction in the spinor bundle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct two-dimensional supergravity theories endowed with a positive cosmological constant, that admit de Sitter vacua. We consider the cases of $\mathcal{N}=1$ as well as $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry, and couple the supergravity to a superconformal field theory with the same amount of supersymmetry. Upon fixing a supersymmetric extension of the Weyl gauge, the theories are captured, at the quantum level, by supersymmetric extensions of timelike Liouville theory with $\mathcal{N}=1$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry respectively. The theories exhibit good ultraviolet properties and are amenable to a variety of techniques such as systematic loop expansions and, in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ case, supersymmetric localization. Our constructions offer a novel path toward a precise treatment of the Euclidean gravitational path integral for de Sitter, and in turn, the Gibbons-Hawking entropy of the de Sitter horizon. We argue that the supersymmetric localization method applied to the $\mathcal{N}=2$ theory must receive contributions from boundary terms in configuration space. We also discuss how these theories overcome several obstructions that appear upon combining de Sitter space with supersymmetry.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Constraining the Neutron Star Equation of State and Mass Distribution through Multimessenger Observations and Nuclear Benchmarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With ongoing advancements in nuclear theory and experimentation, together with a growing body of neutron star (NS) observations, a wealth of information on the equation of state (EOS) for matter at extreme densities has become accessible. Here, we utilize a hybrid EOS formulation that combines an empirical parameterization centered around the nuclear saturation density with a generic three-segment piecewise polytrope model at higher densities. We incorporate data derived from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), and from experiments such as PREX-II and CREX. Furthermore, we examine the influence of a total of 129 NS mass measurements up to April 2023, as well as simultaneous mass and radius measurements derived from the X-ray emission from surface hot spots on NSs. Additionally, we consider constraints on tidal properties inferred from the gravitational waves emitted by coalescing NS binaries. To integrate this extensive and varied array of constraints, we utilize a hierarchical Bayesian statistical framework to simultaneously deduce the EOS and the distribution of NS masses. We find that incorporating data from $\chi$EFT significantly tightens the constraints on the EOS of NSs near or below the nuclear saturation density. However, constraints derived from pQCD computations and nuclear experiments such as PREX-II and CREX have minimal impact.</description>

      <title>Lepton collider as a window to reheating via freezing in dark matter detection. Part II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18198v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) genesis via Ultraviolet (UV) freeze-in embeds the seed of reheating temperature and dynamics in its relic density. Thus, discovery of such a DM candidate can possibly open the window for post-inflationary dynamics. However, there are several challenges in this exercise, as freezing-in DM possesses feeble interaction with the visible sector and therefore very low production cross-section at the collider. We show that mono-photon (and dilepton) signal at the ILC, arising from DM effective operators connected to the SM field strength tensors, can still warrant a signal discovery. We study both the scalar and fermionic DM production during reheating via UV freeze-in, when the inflaton oscillates at the bottom of a general monomial potential. Interestingly, we see, right DM abundance can be achieved only in the case of bosonic reheating scenario, satisfying bounds from big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). This provides a unique correlation between collider signal and the post-inflationary dynamics of the Universe within single-field inflationary models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02504v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a formalism for computing the scattering amplitudes in maximally symmetric de Sitter spacetime with compact spatial dimensions. We describe quantum states by using the representation theory of de Sitter symmetry group and link the Hilbert space to geodesic observers. The positive and negative ``energy'' wavefunctions are uniquely determined by the requirement that in observer's neighborhood, short wavelengths propagate as plane waves with positive and negative frequencies, respectively; they define a unique ``Euclidean'' (a.k.a.\ Bunch-Davies) de Sitter invariant vacuum, common to all inertial observers. By following the same steps as in Minkowski spacetime, we show that the scattering amplitudes are given by a generalized Dyson's formula. Compared to the flat case, they describe the scattering of wavepackets with the frequency spectrum determined by geometry. The frequency spread shrinks as the masses and/or momenta become larger than the curvature scale. Asymptotically, de Sitter amplitudes agree with the amplitudes evaluated in Minkowski spacetime.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Radio Signals from Radio-Band Gravitational Waves Converted from the Neutron Star Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) can convert into electromagnetic waves in the presence of a magnetic field via the Gertsenshtein-Zeldovich (GZ) effect. The characteristics of the magnetic field substantially affect this conversion probability. This paper confirms that strong magnetic fields in neutron stars significantly enhance the conversion probability, facilitating detectable radio signatures of very high-frequency (VHF, $\left(10^6-10^{11}\mathrm{~Hz}\right)$) gravitational waves. We theoretically identify two distinct signatures using single-dish telescopes (FAST, TMRT, QTT, GBT) and interferometers (SKA1/2-MID): transient signals from burst-like gravitational wave sources and persistent signals from cosmological background gravitational wave sources. These signatures are mapped to graviton spectral lines derived from quantum field theory by incorporating spin-2 and mass constraints, resulting in smooth, featureless profiles that are critical for distinguishing gravitational wave signals from astrophysical foregrounds. FAST attains a characteristic strain bound of $h_c&lt;10^{-23}$, approaching $10^{-24}$ in the frequency range of $1-3\mathrm{~GHz}$ with a 6-hour observation period. This performance exceeds the $5 \sigma$ detection thresholds for GWs originating from primordial black holes (PBHs) and nears the limits set by Big Bang nucleosynthesis. Additionally, projections for SKA2-MID indicate even greater sensitivity. Detecting such gravitational waves would improve our comprehension of cosmological models, refine the parameter spaces for primordial black holes, and function as a test for quantum field theory. This approach addresses significant deficiencies in VHF GW research, improving detection sensitivity and facilitating the advancement of next-generation radio telescopes such as FASTA and SKA, which feature larger fields of view and enhanced gain.</description>

Abstract: We consider an experimentalist, Alice, who creates a quantum superposition of a charged or massive body outside of a black hole (or, more generally, in the presence of a Killing horizon). It was previously shown that emission of soft photons/gravitons into the black hole will result in the decoherence of the components of the superposition if it is held open for a sufficiently long span of time. However, at any finite time, $t_c$, during the process, it is not obvious how much decoherence has irrevocably occurred. Equivalently, it is not obvious how much information an observer inside the black hole can extract about Alice's superposition prior to time $t_c$. In this paper, we solve for the optimal experimental protocol to be followed by Alice for $t &gt; t_c$ so as to minimize the decoherence of the components of her superposition. More precisely, given the entangling radiation that has passed through the horizon prior to the cross-section $\mathcal C$ corresponding to the time $t = t_c$ in Alice's lab, we determine the "optimal purification" of this radiation beyond $\mathcal C$ such that the global quantum state of the radiation through the horizon has maximal overlap (quantum fidelity) with the Hartle-Hawking or Unruh vacuum. Due to the intricate low frequency entanglement structure of the quantum field theory vacuum state, we find this optimal purification to be nontrivial. In particular, even if Alice has already "closed" her superposition by bringing the components back together, we find that she can decrease the net decoherence of the components of her superposition somewhat by re-opening it and performing further manipulations.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Neural Networks approach to fuzzball geodesics</title>

Abstract: The recent increase in computational resources and data availability has led to a significant rise in the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques for data analysis in physics. However, the application of ML methods to solve differential equations capable of describing even complex physical systems is not yet fully widespread in theoretical high-energy physics. Hamiltonian Neural Networks (HNNs) are tools that minimize a loss function defined to solve Hamilton equations of motion. In this work, we implement several HNNs trained to solve, with high accuracy, the Hamilton equations for a massless probe moving inside a smooth and horizonless geometry known as D1-D5 circular fuzzball. We study both planar (equatorial) and non-planar geodesics in different regimes according to the impact parameter, some of which are unstable. Our findings suggest that HNNs could eventually replace standard numerical integrators, as they are equally accurate but more reliable in critical situations.</description>

      <title>Perturbative analysis of the reheating dynamics of $\alpha$-attractors</title>

Abstract: We study the reheating phase following inflation in the context of single-field models, focusing on the perturbative decay of the inflaton into lighter particles. A general analytical framework is presented to compute the reheating temperature $T_{re}$ and related quantities by combining cosmological observations with model-dependent parameters. We derive expressions for $T_{re}$ for three types of interactions: gravitational, scalar, and Yukawa-type fermionic couplings, and apply these results to the class of $\alpha$-attractor inflationary models, which exhibit attractor behavior in the $(n_s, r)$ plane. The main goal of this work is to investigate how key cosmological quantities such as $T_{re}$, $N_{re}$, and $m_\phi$ among others, evolve with the scalar spectral index $n_s$ and the Yukawa coupling constant $y$, within a consistent analytical framework. Although the formulas used are approximate, they are sufficient to capture the qualitative behavior of the relevant quantities across a wide range of parameter values. Here, we are not interested in precise numerical approximations or data analysis, but rather in understanding the general trends and dependence of cosmological quantities of interest. In particular, tendencies observed in the figures, such as the sensitivity of $T_{re}$ to the coupling strength and the equation-of-state parameter $\omega_{re}$, reflect physical features that are not strongly affected by the approximations involved.</description>

      <title>The Carrollian Kaleidoscope</title>

Abstract: The Carroll group arises in the vanishing speed of light limit of the Poincar\'{e} group and was initially discarded as just a mathematical curiosity. However, recent developments have proved otherwise. Carroll and conformal Carroll symmetries are now ubiquitous, appearing in diverse physical phenomena starting from condensed matter physics to quantum gravity. This review aims to provide the reader a gateway into this fast-developing field. After an introduction and setting the stage with basics of the symmetry in question, we detail the construction of Carrollian and Carrollian Conformal field theories (CCFT).
  We then focus on applications. By far the most popular of these applications is in the context of the construction of holography in asymptotically flat spacetimes (AFS) in terms of a co-dimension one dual CCFT. We review the early work on AFS$_3$ /CCFT$_2$ before delving into an in-depth analysis for the construction of the dual to 4D AFS.
  Two other important sets of applications are in hydrodynamics and in condensed matter physics, which we discuss in detail. Carroll hydrodynamics is introduced as the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics first and then reconstructed from a symmetry based approach. Relations to ultrarelativistic flows and connections to the quark-gluon plasma are discussed with concrete examples of the Bjorken and Gubser flow models. In condensed matter applications, we cover connections to fractons, flat bands, and phase separation in Luttinger liquid models. To conclude, we give very brief outlines of other topics of interest including string theory and black hole horizons.</description>

      <title>Quantum stress-energy at timelike boundaries: testing a new beyond-$\Lambda$CDM parameter with cosmological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the basic cosmological effects of a population of timelike boundaries -- a form of nontrivial spacetime topology -- containing a boundary layer of quantum stress energy. This accumulation of vacuum fluctuations of quantum fields can be consistently negative and UV sensitive, providing an additional source of cosmic energy density strong enough to compete with matter and dark energy. For boundary conditions enabling a solution with fixed comoving boundary size, this effect contributes a qualitatively new term to the Friedmann equation determining the expansion history, scaling like $-1/a$ for scale factor $a$. It naturally dominates at relatively late times ($a\approx1/2$), while leaving intact well-measured early universe physics such as big bang nucleosynthesis and recombination. For a wide window of parameters, the boundaries can be larger than the Planck length throughout their history, back through the start of inflation at any viable scale. We analyze CMB and BAO data sets (Planck, ACT, and DESI) allowing for this component, finding a slight preference ($\sim 2\sigma$) and a relaxation of current tensions in the data (including the neutrino mass) in a physical manner. This novel parameter fits into a larger space of physical parameters beyond-$\Lambda$CDM that may serve this role, including negative spatial curvature, which may also be motivated by topological considerations and chaotic dynamics. Finally, we comment on additional phenomenological prospects for testing for this form of topology in the universe.</description>
