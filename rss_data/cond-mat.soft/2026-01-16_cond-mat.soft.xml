      <title>Coalescence of Printed Yield Stress Filaments in Direct Ink Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In direct ink writing (DIW), neighbouring filaments of yield-stress inks are deposited side-by-side and are expected to merge into smooth, mechanically robust structures. Unlike Newtonian filaments, coalescence can arrest in finite time, leaving a permanent, non-flat ridge set by the competition between capillarity and rheology. Here we study the coalescence of two printed yield-stress filaments, combining scaling theory for the arrested state, direct numerical simulations, and DIW experiments on Carbopol gels imaged by optical coherence tomography. In the viscoplastic limit, we predict and observe an approximately linear decrease of the final bridge height with plastocapillary number and a critical yield stress above which coalescence does not initiate. Simulations further show that elasticity becomes important at high plastocapillary number, enabling larger final bridge heights via a crossover from a rigid Herschel--Bulkley solid to a deformable Kelvin--Voigt response. Our findings provide a framework for predicting deposition profiles and, ultimately, for mitigating residual topography in DIW.</description>

      <title>Collapse of a single polymer chain: Effects of chain stiffness and attraction range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chain-like macromolecules in solution, whether biological or synthetic, transform from an extended conformation to a compact one when temperature or other system parameters change. This collapse transition is relevant in various phenomena, including DNA condensation, protein folding, and the behavior of polymers in solution. We investigate the interplay of chain stiffness and range of attraction between monomers in the collapse of a single polymer chain. We use Monte Carlo simulations based on the pruned-enriched Rosenbluth method. Two distinct behaviors are found depending on chain stiffness (represented by the persistence length lp) and attraction range rc. When lp is larger than rc, the chain collapses sharply with decreasing temperature, whereas if lp is smaller than rc, it contracts gradually. Notably, in the regime of small lp and large rc, this rounding into a gradual compaction persists upon increasing the chain length and may remain in place in the limit of infinite chain length. Furthermore, for small rc, the transition temperature (theta-temperature) increases with lp, whereas for large rc the theta-temperature decreases with lp. Thus, stiffness promotes collapse for small rc but suppresses it for large rc. Our findings are in agreement with recent experiments on the contraction of single-stranded RNA as compared to double-stranded DNA, and provide valuable insights for understanding polymer collapse and the essential polymer parameters affecting it.</description>

      <title>Capillary Slinky: Equilibrium and Dynamics of Droplets in a Soft Spring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Springs can be found in many applications and biological systems, and when these are soft, they easily deform. At small scales, capillarity can induce a force leading to spring deformations when the elastocapillary number is small. We demonstrate through experiments the non-trivial equilibrium shape liquid droplets adopt in these soft springs, which form an annulus, Eruciform, and spherical shapes. When these droplets are set in motion, they display different flow regimes with significant dissipation generated by the internal rotational flow. The static and dynamics of droplets in such a capillary slinky is also used to demonstrate how surface tension can actuate springs by stretching/compression, while providing a way for active flow control in soft springs.</description>

      <title>Advanced Manufacturing with Renewable and Bio-based Materials: AI/ML workflows and Process Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced manufacturing with new bio-derived materials can be achieved faster and more economically with first-principle-based artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-derived models and process optimization. Not only is this motivated by increased industry profitability, but it can also be optimized to reduce waste generation, energy consumption, and gas emissions through additive manufacturing (AM) and AI/ML-directed self-driving laboratory (SDL) process optimization. From this perspective, the benefits of using 3D printing technology to manufacture durable, sustainable materials will enable high-value reuse and promote a better circular economy. Using AI/ML workflows at different levels, it is possible to optimize the synthesis and adaptation of new bio-derived materials with self-correcting 3D printing methods, and in-situ characterization. Working with training data and hypotheses derived from Large Language Models (LLMs) and algorithms, including ML-optimized simulation, it is possible to demonstrate more field convergence. The combination of SDL and AI/ML Workflows can be the norm for improved use of biobased and renewable materials towards advanced manufacturing. This should result in faster and better structure, composition, processing, and properties (SCPP) correlation. More agentic AI tasks, as well as supervised or unsupervised learning, can be incorporated to improve optimization protocols continuously. Deep Learning (DL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can be applied to more generative AI directions in both AM and SDL, with bio-based materials.</description>

      <title>Spinodal decomposition in filled polymer blends exhibiting upper critical solution temperature behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By extending the Sanchez-Lacombe lattice-fluid model for mixtures to the case of polymer blends containing solid fillers, we calculate the excess thermodynamic quantities arising from the presence of fillers. These results are then used to derive the spinodal stability condition of a filled polymer blend. In the low-compressibility limit, this condition reduces to a remarkably simple analytical expression that is derived self-consistently within the present framework. Comparison between the exact and approximate spinodal curves shows excellent agreement, with deviations in the spinodal temperature of less than 4 K, thereby validating the proposed approximation. The obtained analytical approximation enables a straightforward evaluation of the spinodal temperature without the extensive numerical calculations required to determine the exact spinodal condition. Both the exact and approximate spinodal conditions yield good quantitative agreement with experimental data for filled and unfilled blends.</description>

      <title>Barrier-crossing and energy relaxation dynamics of non-Markovian inertial systems connected via analytical Green-Fokker-Planck approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From numerical simulations it is known that the barrier-crossing time of a non-Markovian one-dimensional reaction coordinate with a single exponentially decaying memory function exhibits a memory-turnover: for intermediate values of the memory decay time the barrier-crossing time is reduced compared to the Markovian limit and for long memory times increases quadratically with the memory time when keeping the total integrated friction and the mass constant. The intermediate memory acceleration regime is accurately predicted by Grote-Hynes theory, for the asymptotic long-memory slow-down behavior no systematic analytically tractable theory is available. Starting from the Green function for a general inertial (i.e. finite-mass) non-Markovian Gaussian reaction coordinate in a harmonic well, we derive by an exact mapping a generalized Fokker-Planck equation with a time-dependent effective diffusion constant. To first order in a systematic cumulant expansion we derive an analytical Arrhenius expression for the barrier-crossing time with the pre-exponential factor given by the energy relaxation time, which can be used to robustly predict barrier-crossing times from simulation or experimental trajectory data of general non-Markovian inertial systems without the need to extract memory functions. For a single exponential memory kernel we give a closed-form expression for the barrier-crossing time, which reproduces the Kramers turnover between the high-friction and high-mass limits as well as the memory turnover from the intermediate memory acceleration to the asymptotic long-memory slow-down regime. We also show that non-Markovian systems are singular in the zero-mass limit, which suggests that the long-memory barrier-crossing slow-down reflects the interplay between mass and memory effects. Thus, physically sound models for non-Markovian systems have to include a finite mass.</description>

      <title>Collective behavior based on agent-environment interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model of active particles interacting through a dynamic, heterogeneous environment, leading to emergent collective behaviors without direct agent-to-agent communication. Expanding the resource-dependent framework introduced in Briozzo et al., 2025, arXiv:2512.08762, agents perform a persistent random walk combined with chemotaxis, directing toward nutrient-rich patches, whose resources are generated by logistic regrowth. We identify distinct phases of collective organization, ranging from disordered gas-like states to polar traveling waves and nematic independent clusters, depending on the interplay between chemotactic sensitivity and angular noise. The system exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking and density waves driven purely by the coupling between population dynamics (birth-death processes) and environmental feedback. Our results bridge active matter physics and movement ecology, demonstrating that complex spatiotemporal patterns can arise without direct interaction between agents, but solely from the maximization of resource intake in a reactive environment.</description>

      <title>Molecularly Thin Polyaramid Nanomechanical Resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional polyaramids exhibit strong hydrogen bonding to create molecularly thin nanosheets analogous to graphene. Here, we report the first nanomechanical resonators made out of a two-dimensional polyaramid, 2DPA-1, with thicknesses as small as 8 nm. To fabricate these molecular-scale resonators, we transferred nanofilms of 2DPA-1 onto chips with previously etched arrays of circular microwells. We then characterized the thermal resonances of these resonators under different conditions. When there is no residual gas inside the 2DPA-1-covered microwells, the eigenfrequencies are well-described by a tensioned plate theory, providing the Young's modulus and tension of the 2DPA-1 nanofilms. With gas present, the nanofilms bulge up and mechanical resonances are modified due to the adhesion, bulging and slack present in the system. The fabrication and mechanical characterization of these first 2DPA-1 nanomechanical resonators represent a convincing path toward molecular-scale polymeric NEMS with high mechanical strength, low density, and synthetic processability.</description>

      <title>Chirality Amplification and Chiral Segregation in Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Liquid crystal mesophases of achiral molecules are normally achiral, yet in a few materials they spontaneously segregate and form right- and left-handed chiral domains. One mechanism that drives chiral segregation is molecular shape fluctuations between axial chiral conformations, where molecular interactions favor matching chirality and promote helical twist. Cooperative chiral ordering may also play a role in chirality amplification, as when a tiny fraction of chiral dopant drives a nematic phase to become cholesteric. We present a model of cooperative chiral ordering in liquid crystals using Maier-Saupe theory, and predict a phase diagram with a segregated cholesteric phase with alternating domains of left- and right-handed chiral twist, with opposite enantiomeric excess, in addition to racemic nematic and isotropic phases. Our model also demonstrates how chiral molecular fluctuations influence the helical twisting power of dopants in the nematic phase, which may be observed even in materials where the segregated cholesteric phase is preempted by a transition to another phase. We compare these results with Monte Carlo simulation studies of the switchable chiral Lebwohl-Lasher model, where each spin switches between right- and left-handed chiral states. Simulation results validate the predicted phase diagram, demonstrate chiral amplification in the racemic nematic phase, and reveal complex coarsening dynamics in the segregated cholesteric phase. These results suggest that molecular fluctuations between degenerate chiral configurations may be a common mechanism to produce cooperative chiral order in achiral liquid crystals.</description>

      <title>Acoustic transparency and absorption in dense granular suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a frequency band exhibiting acoustic transparency in 2D and 3D dense granular suspensions, enabling the transmission of a low-frequency ballistic wave excited by a high-frequency broadband ultrasound pulse. This phenomenon is attributed to spatial correlations in the structural disorder of the medium. To support this interpretation, we use an existing model that incorporates such correlations via the structure factor. Its predictions are shown to agree well with those of the Generalized Coherent Potential Approximation (GCPA) model, which is known to apply at high volume fractions, including the close packing limit, but does not explicitly account for disorder correlation. Within the transparency band, attenuation is found to be dominated by absorption rather than scattering. Measurements of the frequency dependence of the absorption coefficient reveal significant deviations from conventional models, challenging the current understanding of acoustic absorption in dense granular media.</description>

      <title>Strong anchoring boundary conditions in nematic liquid crystals: Higher-order corrections to the Oseen-Frank limit and a revised small-domain theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00744v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong anchoring boundary conditions are conventionally modelled by imposing Dirichlet conditions on the order parameter in Landau-de Gennes theory, neglecting the finite surface energy of realistic anchoring. This work revisits the strong anchoring limit for nematic liquid crystals in confined two-dimensional domains. By explicitly retaining a Rapini-Papoular surface energy and adopting a scaling where the extrapolation length $l_{ex}$ is comparable to the coherence length $\xi$, we analyse both the small-domain ($\ep = h/\xi\to 0$; $h$ is the domain size) and Oseen-Frank $(\ep \to \infty$) asymptotic regimes. In the small-domain limit, the leading-order equilibrium solution is given by the average of the boundary data, which can vanish in symmetrically frustrated geometries, leading to isotropic melting. In the large-domain limit, matched asymptotic expansions reveal that surface anchoring introduces an $O(1/\ep)$ correction to the director field, in contrast to the $O(1/\ep^2)$ correction predicted by Dirichlet conditions. The analysis captures the detailed structure of interior and boundary defects, showing that mixed boundary conditions yield smoother defect cores and more physical predictions than rigid Dirichlet conditions. Importantly, a stability analysis based on the intrinsic-basis decomposition shows that even small deviations of $O(1/\ep^2)$ from perfect scalar order can destabilise some Oseen-Frank solutions, indicating that only a restricted subset of solutions are realised as stable equilibria in the full Landau-de Gennes theory. Numerical solutions for square and circular wells with tangential anchoring illustrate the differences between the two boundary condition treatments, particularly in defect morphology. These results demonstrate that a consistent treatment of anchoring energetics is essential for modelling nematic equilibria in micro- and nano-scale systems.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of the steady state for run-and-tumble particles with a double-well interaction potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $N$ run-and-tumble particles (RTPs) in one dimension interacting via a double-well potential $W(r)=-k_0 \, r^2/2+g \, r^4/4$, which is repulsive at short interparticle distance $r$ and attractive at large distance. At large time, the system forms a bound state where the density of particles has a finite support. We focus on the determination of the total density of particles in the stationary state $\rho_s(x)$, in the limit $N\to+\infty$. We obtain an explicit expression for $\rho_s(x)$ as a function of the ''renormalized" interaction parameter $k=k_0-3m_2$ where $m_2$ is the second moment of $\rho_s(x)$. Interestingly, this stationary solution exhibits a transition between a connected and a disconnected support for a certain value of $k$, which has no equivalent in the case of Brownian particles. Analyzing in detail the expression of the stationary density in the two cases, we find a variety of regimes characterized by different behaviors near the edges of the support and around $x=0$. Furthermore, we find that the mapping $k_0\to k$ becomes multi-valued below a certain value of the tumbling rate $\gamma$ of the RTPs for some range of values of $k_0$ near the transition, implying the existence of two stable solutions. Finally, we show that in the case of a disconnected support, it is possible to observe steady states where the density $\rho_s(x)$ is not symmetric. All our analytical predictions are in good agreement with numerical simulations already for systems of $N = 100$ particles. The non-uniqueness of the stationary state is a particular feature of this model in the presence of active (RTP) noise, which contrasts with the uniqueness of the Gibbs equilibrium for Brownian particles. We argue that these results are also relevant for a class of more realistic interactions with both an attractive and a repulsive part, but which decay at infinity.</description>

      <title>Hidden long-range correlations in the ion distribution at the graphite / [bmim][NTf$_2$] electrified interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A capacitor consisting of the [bmim][NTf$_2$] ionic liquid (IL) confined in between planar graphite electrodes has been investigated by molecular dynamics based on an all-atom, unpolarizable force field. Despite a few peculiarities due to the size and complexity of the ions, properties such as the density of ions throughout the capacitor, the screening of the surface charge on the electrodes by the IL and exact sum rules for the radial distribution functions of cations and anions generally comply with the results of time honored theories of the electrostatic double layer. This soothing regularity may conceal hidden correlations still compatible with the static screening rules, propagating far inside the IL the information on the state of charge of the capacitor. Evidence in this respect might have been detected by vibrational spectroscopy (see, for instance, Langmuir 2021, vol. 37, 5193-5201) showing changes in optical properties of the IL far from the charged electrodes. We show that grouping the [bmim]$^+$ and [NTf$_2$]$^-$ ions into instantaneous neutral pairs reveals an intriguing long range ordering of ions normal to the interface, driven by the capacitor state of charge. These correlations manifest themselves through the parallel orientation of the dipole moments of the neutral ion pairs. We speculate that this effect changes the average intensity of fluctuating electric fields deep in the IL, while average, static fields vanish in agreement with well established screening laws. This effect, which could change the spectroscopic properties of the IL, is present in the simulated [bmim][NTf$_2$] / graphite capacitor, but too small to be unambiguously confirmed by the present simulations with a safe margin over the error bar. The conceptual interest in these effects, however, will motivate further studies of the same or similar electrode / ionic liquid interfaces.</description>
