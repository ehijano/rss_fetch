      <title>Fitted Q Evaluation Without Bellman Completeness via Stationary Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fitted Q-evaluation (FQE) is a central method for off-policy evaluation in reinforcement learning, but it generally requires Bellman completeness: that the hypothesis class is closed under the evaluation Bellman operator. This requirement is challenging because enlarging the hypothesis class can worsen completeness. We show that the need for this assumption stems from a fundamental norm mismatch: the Bellman operator is gamma-contractive under the stationary distribution of the target policy, whereas FQE minimizes Bellman error under the behavior distribution. We propose a simple fix: reweight each regression step using an estimate of the stationary density ratio, thereby aligning FQE with the norm in which the Bellman operator contracts. This enables strong evaluation guarantees in the absence of realizability or Bellman completeness, avoiding the geometric error blow-up of standard FQE in this setting while maintaining the practicality of regression-based evaluation.</description>

      <title>Energy-Tweedie: Score meets Score, Energy meets Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoising and score estimation have long been known to be linked via the classical Tweedie's formula. In this work, we first extend the latter to a wider range of distributions often called "energy models" and denoted elliptical distributions in this work. Next, we examine an alternative view: we consider the denoising posterior $P(X|Y)$ as the optimizer of the energy score (a scoring rule) and derive a fundamental identity that connects the (path-) derivative of a (possibly) non-Euclidean energy score to the score of the noisy marginal. This identity can be seen as an analog of Tweedie's identity for the energy score, and allows for several interesting applications; for example, score estimation, noise distribution parameter estimation, as well as using energy score models in the context of "traditional" diffusion model samplers with a wider array of noising distributions.</description>

      <title>Stationary Reweighting Yields Local Convergence of Soft Fitted Q-Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fitted Q-iteration (FQI) and its entropy-regularized variant, soft FQI, are central tools for value-based model-free offline reinforcement learning, but can behave poorly under function approximation and distribution shift. In the entropy-regularized setting, we show that the soft Bellman operator is locally contractive in the stationary norm of the soft-optimal policy, rather than in the behavior norm used by standard FQI. This geometric mismatch explains the instability of soft Q-iteration with function approximation in the absence of Bellman completeness. To restore contraction, we introduce stationary-reweighted soft FQI, which reweights each regression update using the stationary distribution of the current policy. We prove local linear convergence under function approximation with geometrically damped weight-estimation errors, assuming approximate realizability. Our analysis further suggests that global convergence may be recovered by gradually reducing the softmax temperature, and that this continuation approach can extend to the hardmax limit under a mild margin condition.</description>

      <title>Implicit geometric regularization in flow matching via density weighted Stein operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for continuous normalizing flows, yet standard FM implicitly performs an unweighted $L^2$ regression over the entire ambient space. In high dimensions, this leads to a fundamental inefficiency: the vast majority of the integration domain consists of low-density ``void'' regions where the target velocity fields are often chaotic or ill-defined. In this paper, we propose {$\gamma$-Flow Matching ($\gamma$-FM)}, a density-weighted variant that aligns the regression geometry with the underlying probability flow. While density weighting is desirable, naive implementations would require evaluating the intractable target density. We circumvent this by introducing a Dynamic Density-Weighting strategy that estimates the \emph{target} density directly from training particles. This approach allows us to dynamically downweight the regression loss in void regions without compromising the simulation-free nature of FM. Theoretically, we establish that $\gamma$-FM minimizes the transport cost on a statistical manifold endowed with the $\gamma$-Stein metric. Spectral analysis further suggests that this geometry induces an implicit Sobolev regularization, effectively damping high-frequency oscillations in void regions. Empirically, $\gamma$-FM significantly improves vector field smoothness and sampling efficiency on high-dimensional latent datasets, while demonstrating intrinsic robustness to outliers.</description>

      <title>Constructive Approximation of Random Process via Stochastic Interpolation Neural Network Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a class of stochastic interpolation neural network operators (SINNOs) with random coefficients activated by sigmoidal functions. We establish their boundedness, interpolation accuracy, and approximation capabilities in the mean square sense, in probability, as well as path-wise within the space of second-order stochastic (random) processes \( L^2(\Omega, \mathcal{F},\mathbb{P}) \). Additionally, we provide quantitative error estimates using the modulus of continuity of the processes. These results highlight the effectiveness of SINNOs for approximating stochastic processes with potential applications in COVID-19 case prediction.</description>

      <title>Topological Spatial Graph Coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial graphs are particular graphs for which the nodes are localized in space (e.g., public transport network, molecules, branching biological structures). In this work, we consider the problem of spatial graph reduction, that aims to find a smaller spatial graph (i.e., with less nodes) with the same overall structure as the initial one. In this context, performing the graph reduction while preserving the main topological features of the initial graph is particularly relevant, due to the additional spatial information. Thus, we propose a topological spatial graph coarsening approach based on a new framework that finds a trade-off between the graph reduction and the preservation of the topological characteristics. The coarsening is realized by collapsing short edges. In order to capture the topological information required to calibrate the reduction level, we adapt the construction of classical topological descriptors made for point clouds (the so-called persistent diagrams) to spatial graphs. This construction relies on the introduction of a new filtration called triangle-aware graph filtration. Our coarsening approach is parameter-free and we prove that it is equivariant under rotations, translations and scaling of the initial spatial graph. We evaluate the performances of our method on synthetic and real spatial graphs, and show that it significantly reduces the graph sizes while preserving the relevant topological information.</description>

      <title>Improving the stability of the covariance-controlled adaptive Langevin thermostat for large-scale Bayesian sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics and its variants approximate the likelihood of an entire dataset, via random (and typically much smaller) subsets, in the setting of Bayesian sampling. Due to the (often substantial) improvement of the computational efficiency, they have been widely used in large-scale machine learning applications. It has been demonstrated that the so-called covariance-controlled adaptive Langevin (CCAdL) thermostat, which incorporates an additional term involving the covariance matrix of the noisy force, outperforms popular alternative methods. A moving average is used in CCAdL to estimate the covariance matrix of the noisy force, in which case the covariance matrix will converge to a constant matrix in long-time limit. Moreover, it appears in our numerical experiments that the use of a moving average could reduce the stability of the numerical integrators, thereby limiting the largest usable stepsize. In this article, we propose a modified CCAdL (i.e., mCCAdL) thermostat that uses the scaling part of the scaling and squaring method together with a truncated Taylor series approximation to the exponential to numerically approximate the exact solution to the subsystem involving the additional term proposed in CCAdL. We also propose a symmetric splitting method for mCCAdL, instead of an Euler-type discretisation used in the original CCAdL thermostat. We demonstrate in our numerical experiments that the newly proposed mCCAdL thermostat achieves a substantial improvement in the numerical stability over the original CCAdL thermostat, while significantly outperforming popular alternative stochastic gradient methods in terms of the numerical accuracy for large-scale machine learning applications.</description>

      <title>MultiRisk: Multiple Risk Control via Iterative Score Thresholding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As generative AI systems are increasingly deployed in real-world applications, regulating multiple dimensions of model behavior has become essential. We focus on test-time filtering: a lightweight mechanism for behavior control that compares performance scores to estimated thresholds, and modifies outputs when these bounds are violated. We formalize the problem of enforcing multiple risk constraints with user-defined priorities, and introduce two efficient dynamic programming algorithms that leverage this sequential structure. The first, MULTIRISK-BASE, provides a direct finite-sample procedure for selecting thresholds, while the second, MULTIRISK, leverages data exchangeability to guarantee simultaneous control of the risks. Under mild assumptions, we show that MULTIRISK achieves nearly tight control of all constraint risks. The analysis requires an intricate iterative argument, upper bounding the risks by introducing several forms of intermediate symmetrized risk functions, and carefully lower bounding the risks by recursively counting jumps in symmetrized risk functions between appropriate risk levels. We evaluate our framework on a three-constraint Large Language Model alignment task using the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset, where the goal is to maximize helpfulness subject to multiple safety constraints, and where scores are generated by a Large Language Model judge and a perplexity filter. Our experimental results show that our algorithm can control each individual risk at close to the target level.</description>

      <title>Sparse Offline Reinforcement Learning with Corruption Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate robustness to strong data corruption in offline sparse reinforcement learning (RL). In our setting, an adversary may arbitrarily perturb a fraction of the collected trajectories from a high-dimensional but sparse Markov decision process, and our goal is to estimate a near optimal policy. The main challenge is that, in the high-dimensional regime where the number of samples $N$ is smaller than the feature dimension $d$, exploiting sparsity is essential for obtaining non-vacuous guarantees but has not been systematically studied in offline RL. We analyse the problem under uniform coverage and sparse single-concentrability assumptions. While Least Square Value Iteration (LSVI), a standard approach for robust offline RL, performs well under uniform coverage, we show that integrating sparsity into LSVI is unnatural, and its analysis may break down due to overly pessimistic bonuses. To overcome this, we propose actor-critic methods with sparse robust estimator oracles, which avoid the use of pointwise pessimistic bonuses and provide the first non-vacuous guarantees for sparse offline RL under single-policy concentrability coverage. Moreover, we extend our results to the contaminated setting and show that our algorithm remains robust under strong contamination. Our results provide the first non-vacuous guarantees in high-dimensional sparse MDPs with single-policy concentrability coverage and corruption, showing that learning a near-optimal policy remains possible in regimes where traditional robust offline RL techniques may fail.</description>

      <title>Are First-Order Diffusion Samplers Really Slower? A Fast Forward-Value Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order ODE solvers have become a standard tool for accelerating diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) sampling, motivating the widespread view that first-order methods are inherently slower and that increasing discretization order is the primary path to faster generation. This paper challenges this belief and revisits acceleration from a complementary angle: beyond solver order, the placement of DPM evaluations along the reverse-time dynamics can substantially affect sampling accuracy in the low-neural function evaluation (NFE) regime.
  We propose a novel training-free, first-order sampler whose leading discretization error has the opposite sign to that of DDIM. Algorithmically, the method approximates the forward-value evaluation via a cheap one-step lookahead predictor. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the resulting sampler provably approximates the ideal forward-value trajectory while retaining first-order convergence. Empirically, across standard image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, FFHQ, and LSUN), the proposed sampler consistently improves sample quality under the same NFE budget and can be competitive with, and sometimes outperform, state-of-the-art higher-order samplers. Overall, the results suggest that the placement of DPM evaluations provides an additional and largely independent design angle for accelerating diffusion sampling.</description>

      <title>A Review of Diffusion-based Simulation-Based Inference: Foundations and Applications in Non-Ideal Data Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For complex simulation problems, inferring parameters of scientific interest often precludes the use of classical likelihood-based techniques due to intractable likelihood functions. Simulation-based inference (SBI) methods forego the need for explicit likelihoods by directly utilizing samples from the simulator to learn posterior distributions over parameters $\mathbf{\theta}$ given observed data $\mathbf{x}_{\text{o}}$. Recent work has brought attention to diffusion models -- a type of generative model rooted in score matching and reverse-time stochastic dynamics -- as a flexible framework SBI tasks. This article reviews diffusion-based SBI from first principles to applications in practice. We first recall the mathematical foundations of diffusion modeling (forward noising, reverse-time SDE/ODE, probability flow, and denoising score matching) and explain how conditional scores enable likelihood-free posterior sampling. We then examine where diffusion models address pain points of normalizing flows in neural posterior/likelihood estimation and where they introduce new trade-offs (e.g., iterative sampling costs). The key theme of this review is robustness of diffusion-based SBI in non-ideal conditions common to scientific data: misspecification (mismatch between simulated training data and reality), unstructured or infinite-dimensional observations, and missingness. We synthesize methods spanning foundations drawing from Schrodinger-bridge formulations, conditional and sequential posterior samplers, amortized architectures for unstructured data, and inference-time prior adaptation. Throughout, we adopt consistent notation and emphasize conditions and caveats required for accurate posteriors. The review closes with a discussion of open problems with an eye toward applications of uncertainty quantification for probabilistic geophysical models that may benefit from diffusion-based SBI.</description>

      <title>Learning Coupled System Dynamics under Incomplete Physical Constraints and Missing Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in data acquisition and computational methods have accelerated the use of differential equation based modelling for complex systems. Such systems are often described by coupled (or more) variables, yet governing equation is typically available for one variable, while the remaining variable can be accessed only through data. This mismatch between known physics and observed data poses a fundamental challenge for existing physics-informed machine learning approaches, which generally assume either complete knowledge of the governing equations or full data availability across all variables. In this paper, we introduce MUSIC (Multitask Learning Under Sparse and Incomplete Constraints), a sparsity induced multitask neural network framework that integrates partial physical constraints with data-driven learning to recover full-dimensional solutions of coupled systems when physics-constrained and data-informed variables are mutually exclusive. MUSIC employs mesh-free (random) sampling of training data and sparsity regularization, yielding highly compressed models with improved training and evaluation efficiency. We demonstrate that MUSIC accurately learns solutions (shock wave solutions, discontinuous solutions, pattern formation solutions) to complex coupled systems under data-scarce and noisy conditions, consistently outperforming non-sparse formulations. These results highlight MUSIC as a flexible and effective approach for modeling partially observed systems with incomplete physical knowledge.</description>

      <title>Neural Optimal Design of Experiment for Inverse Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Neural Optimal Design of Experiments, a learning-based framework for optimal experimental design in inverse problems that avoids classical bilevel optimization and indirect sparsity regularization. NODE jointly trains a neural reconstruction model and a fixed-budget set of continuous design variables representing sensor locations, sampling times, or measurement angles, within a single optimization loop. By optimizing measurement locations directly rather than weighting a dense grid of candidates, the proposed approach enforces sparsity by design, eliminates the need for l1 tuning, and substantially reduces computational complexity. We validate NODE on an analytically tractable exponential growth benchmark, on MNIST image sampling, and illustrate its effectiveness on a real world sparse view X ray CT example. In all cases, NODE outperforms baseline approaches, demonstrating improved reconstruction accuracy and task-specific performance.</description>

      <title>Exploring Cumulative Effects in Survival Data Using Deep Learning Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In epidemiological research, modeling the cumulative effects of time-dependent exposures on survival outcomes presents a challenge due to their intricate temporal dynamics. Conventional spline-based statistical methods, though effective, require repeated data transformation for each spline parameter tuning, with survival analysis computations relying on the entire dataset, posing difficulties for large datasets. Meanwhile, existing neural network-based survival analysis methods focus on accuracy but often overlook the interpretability of cumulative exposure patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce CENNSurv, a novel deep learning approach that captures dynamic risk relationships from time-dependent data. Evaluated on two diverse real-world datasets, CENNSurv revealed a multi-year lagged association between chronic environmental exposure and a critical survival outcome, as well as a critical short-term behavioral shift prior to subscription lapse. This demonstrates CENNSurv's ability to model complex temporal patterns with improved scalability. CENNSurv provides researchers studying cumulative effects a practical tool with interpretable insights.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of applications, yet many of its most effective methods rely on access to large amounts of labeled data or extensive online interaction. In practice, acquiring high-quality labels and making decisions through trial-and-error can be expensive, time-consuming, or risky, particularly in large-scale or high-stakes settings. This dissertation studies interactive machine learning, in which the learner actively influences how information is collected or which actions are taken, using past observations to guide future interactions. We develop new algorithmic principles and establish fundamental limits for interactive learning along three dimensions: active learning with noisy data and rich model classes, sequential decision making with large action spaces, and model selection under partial feedback. Our results include the first computationally efficient active learning algorithms achieving exponential label savings without low-noise assumptions; the first efficient, general-purpose contextual bandit algorithms whose guarantees are independent of the size of the action space; and the first tight characterizations of the fundamental cost of model selection in sequential decision making. Overall, this dissertation advances the theoretical foundations of interactive learning by developing algorithms that are statistically optimal and computationally efficient, while also providing principled guidance for deploying interactive learning methods in large-scale, real-world settings.</description>

      <title>Improved Balanced Classification with Theoretically Grounded Loss Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The balanced loss is a widely adopted objective for multi-class classification under class imbalance. By assigning equal importance to all classes, regardless of their frequency, it promotes fairness and ensures that minority classes are not overlooked. However, directly minimizing the balanced classification loss is typically intractable, which makes the design of effective surrogate losses a central question. This paper introduces and studies two advanced surrogate loss families: Generalized Logit-Adjusted (GLA) loss functions and Generalized Class-Aware weighted (GCA) losses. GLA losses generalize Logit-Adjusted losses, which shift logits based on class priors, to the broader general cross-entropy loss family. GCA loss functions extend the standard class-weighted losses, which scale losses inversely by class frequency, by incorporating class-dependent confidence margins and extending them to the general cross-entropy family. We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of consistency for both loss families. We show that GLA losses are Bayes-consistent, but only $H$-consistent for complete (i.e., unbounded) hypothesis sets. Moreover, their $H$-consistency bounds depend inversely on the minimum class probability, scaling at least as $1/\mathsf p_{\min}$. In contrast, GCA losses are $H$-consistent for any hypothesis set that is bounded or complete, with $H$-consistency bounds that scale more favorably as $1/\sqrt{\mathsf p_{\min}}$, offering significantly stronger theoretical guarantees in imbalanced settings. We report the results of experiments demonstrating that, empirically, both the GCA losses with calibrated class-dependent confidence margins and GLA losses can greatly outperform straightforward class-weighted losses as well as the LA losses. GLA generally performs slightly better in common benchmarks, whereas GCA exhibits a slight edge in highly imbalanced settings.</description>

      <title>A Community-Aware Framework for Influence Maximization with Explicit Accounting for Inter-Community Influence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Influence Maximization (IM) seeks to identify a small set of seed nodes in a social network to maximize expected information spread under a diffusion model. While community-based approaches improve scalability by exploiting modular structure, they typically assume independence between communities, overlooking inter-community influence$\unicode{x2014}$a limitation that reduces effectiveness in real-world networks. We introduce Community-IM++, a scalable framework that explicitly models cross-community diffusion through a principled heuristic based on community-based diffusion degree (CDD) and a progressive budgeting strategy. The algorithm partitions the network, computes CDD to prioritize bridging nodes, and allocates seeds adaptively across communities using lazy evaluation to minimize redundant computations. Experiments on large real-world social networks under different edge weight models show that Community-IM++ achieves near-greedy influence spread at up to 100 times lower runtime, while outperforming Community-IM and degree heuristics across budgets and structural conditions. These results demonstrate the practicality of Community-IM++ for large-scale applications such as viral marketing, misinformation control, and public health campaigns, where efficiency and cross-community reach are critical.</description>

      <title>Assured Autonomy: How Operations Research Powers and Orchestrates Generative AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is shifting from conversational assistants toward agentic systems -- autonomous decision-making systems that sense, decide, and act within operational workflows. This shift creates an autonomy paradox: as GenAI systems are granted greater operational autonomy, they should, by design, embody more formal structure, more explicit constraints, and stronger tail-risk discipline. We argue stochastic generative models can be fragile in operational domains unless paired with mechanisms that provide verifiable feasibility, robustness to distribution shift, and stress testing under high-consequence scenarios. To address this challenge, we develop a conceptual framework for assured autonomy grounded in operations research (OR), built on two complementary approaches. First, flow-based generative models frame generation as deterministic transport characterized by an ordinary differential equation, enabling auditability, constraint-aware generation, and connections to optimal transport, robust optimization, and sequential decision control. Second, operational safety is formulated through an adversarial robustness lens: decision rules are evaluated against worst-case perturbations within uncertainty or ambiguity sets, making unmodeled risks part of the design. This framework clarifies how increasing autonomy shifts OR's role from solver to guardrail to system architect, with responsibility for control logic, incentive protocols, monitoring regimes, and safety boundaries. These elements define a research agenda for assured autonomy in safety-critical, reliability-sensitive operational domains.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limits for weighted empirical approximations of tilted distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the task of generating samples from a tilted distribution of a random vector whose underlying distribution is unknown, but samples from it are available. This finds applications in fields such as finance and climate science, and in rare event simulation. In this article, we discuss the asymptotic efficiency of a self-normalized importance sampler of the tilted distribution. We provide a sharp characterization of its accuracy, given the number of samples and the degree of tilt. Our findings reveal a surprising dichotomy: while the number of samples needed to accurately tilt a bounded random vector increases polynomially in the tilt amount, it increases at a super polynomial rate for unbounded distributions.</description>

      <title>Paired Seed Evaluation: Statistical Reliability for Learning-Based Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning systems appear stochastic but are deterministically random, as seeded pseudorandom number generators produce identical realisations across executions. Learning-based simulators are widely used to compare algorithms, design choices, and interventions under such dynamics, yet evaluation outcomes often exhibit high variance due to random initialisation and learning stochasticity. We analyse the statistical structure of comparative evaluation in these settings and show that standard independent evaluation designs fail to exploit shared sources of randomness across alternatives. We formalise a paired seed evaluation design in which competing systems are evaluated under identical random seeds, inducing matched realisations of stochastic components and strict variance reduction whenever outcomes are positively correlated at the seed level. This yields tighter confidence intervals, higher statistical power, and effective sample size gains at fixed computational budgets. Empirically, seed-level correlations are typically large and positive, producing order-of-magnitude efficiency gains. Paired seed evaluation is weakly dominant in practice, improving statistical reliability when correlation is present and reducing to independent evaluation without loss of validity when it is not.</description>

      <title>Score-based sampling without diffusions: Guidance from a simple and modular scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sampling based on score diffusions has led to striking empirical results, and has attracted considerable attention from various research communities. It depends on availability of (approximate) Stein score functions for various levels of additive noise. We describe and analyze a modular scheme that reduces score-based sampling to solving a short sequence of ``nice'' sampling problems, for which high-accuracy samplers are known. We show how to design forward trajectories such that both (a) the terminal distribution, and (b) each of the backward conditional distribution is defined by a strongly log concave (SLC) distribution. This modular reduction allows us to exploit \emph{any} SLC sampling algorithm in order to traverse the backwards path, and we establish novel guarantees with short proofs for both uni-modal and multi-modal densities. The use of high-accuracy routines yields $\varepsilon$-accurate answers, in either KL or Wasserstein distances, with polynomial dependence on $\log(1/\varepsilon)$ and $\sqrt{d}$ dependence on the dimension.</description>

      <title>Implicit score matching meets denoising score matching: improved rates of convergence and log-density Hessian estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the score function using both implicit score matching and denoising score matching. Assuming that the data distribution exhibiting a low-dimensional structure, we prove that implicit score matching is able not only to adapt to the intrinsic dimension, but also to achieve the same rates of convergence as denoising score matching in terms of the sample size. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both methods allow us to estimate log-density Hessians without the curse of dimensionality by simple differentiation. This justifies convergence of ODE-based samplers for generative diffusion models. Our approach is based on Gagliardo-Nirenberg-type inequalities relating weighted $L^2$-norms of smooth functions and their derivatives.</description>

      <title>Sparse classification with positive-confidence data in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional learning problems, where the number of features exceeds the sample size, often require sparse regularization for effective prediction and variable selection. While established for fully supervised data, these techniques remain underexplored in weak-supervision settings such as Positive-Confidence (Pconf) classification. Pconf learning utilizes only positive samples equipped with confidence scores, thereby avoiding the need for negative data. However, existing Pconf methods are ill-suited for high-dimensional regimes. This paper proposes a novel sparse-penalization framework for high-dimensional Pconf classification. We introduce estimators using convex (Lasso) and non-convex (SCAD, MCP) penalties to address shrinkage bias and improve feature recovery. Theoretically, we establish estimation and prediction error bounds for the L1-regularized Pconf estimator, proving it achieves near minimax-optimal sparse recovery rates under Restricted Strong Convexity condition. To solve the resulting composite objective, we develop an efficient proximal gradient algorithm. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve predictive performance and variable selection accuracy comparable to fully supervised approaches, effectively bridging the gap between weak supervision and high-dimensional statistics.</description>

      <title>What Drives Success in Physical Planning with Joint-Embedding Predictive World Models?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A long-standing challenge in AI is to develop agents capable of solving a wide range of physical tasks and generalizing to new, unseen tasks and environments. A popular recent approach involves training a world model from state-action trajectories and subsequently use it with a planning algorithm to solve new tasks. Planning is commonly performed in the input space, but a recent family of methods has introduced planning algorithms that optimize in the learned representation space of the world model, with the promise that abstracting irrelevant details yields more efficient planning. In this work, we characterize models from this family as JEPA-WMs and investigate the technical choices that make algorithms from this class work. We propose a comprehensive study of several key components with the objective of finding the optimal approach within the family. We conducted experiments using both simulated environments and real-world robotic data, and studied how the model architecture, the training objective, and the planning algorithm affect planning success. We combine our findings to propose a model that outperforms two established baselines, DINO-WM and V-JEPA-2-AC, in both navigation and manipulation tasks. Code, data and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/jepa-wms.</description>

      <title>More Than Bits: Multi-Envelope Double Binary Factorization for Extreme Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For extreme low-bit quantization of large language models (LLMs), Double Binary Factorization (DBF) is attractive as it enables efficient inference without sacrificing accuracy. However, the scaling parameters of DBF are too restrictive; after factoring out signs, all rank components share the same magnitude profile, resulting in performance saturation. We propose Multi-envelope DBF (MDBF), which retains a shared pair of 1-bit sign bases but replaces the single envelope with a rank-$l$ envelope. By sharing sign matrices among envelope components, MDBF effectively maintains a binary carrier and utilizes the limited memory budget for magnitude expressiveness. We also introduce a closed-form initialization and an alternating refinement method to optimize MDBF. Across the LLaMA and Qwen families, MDBF enhances perplexity and zero-shot accuracy over previous binary formats at matched bits per weight while preserving the same deployment-friendly inference primitive.</description>

      <title>Triangulation as an Acceptance Rule for Multilingual Mechanistic Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilingual language models achieve strong aggregate performance yet often behave unpredictably across languages, scripts, and cultures. We argue that mechanistic explanations for such models should satisfy a \emph{causal} standard: claims must survive causal interventions and must \emph{cross-reference} across environments that perturb surface form while preserving meaning. We formalize \emph{reference families} as predicate-preserving variants and introduce \emph{triangulation}, an acceptance rule requiring necessity (ablating the circuit degrades the target behavior), sufficiency (patching activations transfers the behavior), and invariance (both effects remain directionally stable and of sufficient magnitude across the reference family). To supply candidate subgraphs, we adopt automatic circuit discovery and \emph{accept or reject} those candidates by triangulation. We ground triangulation in causal abstraction by casting it as an approximate transformation score over a distribution of interchange interventions, connect it to the pragmatic interpretability agenda, and present a comparative experimental protocol across multiple model families, language pairs, and tasks. Triangulation provides a falsifiable standard for mechanistic claims that filters spurious circuits passing single-environment tests but failing cross-lingual invariance.</description>

      <title>Basic Inequalities for First-Order Optimization with Applications to Statistical Risk Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce \textit{basic inequalities} for first-order iterative optimization algorithms, forming a simple and versatile framework that connects implicit and explicit regularization. While related inequalities appear in the literature, we isolate and highlight a specific form and develop it as a well-rounded tool for statistical analysis. Let $f$ denote the objective function to be optimized. Given a first-order iterative algorithm initialized at $\theta_0$ with current iterate $\theta_T$, the basic inequality upper bounds $f(\theta_T)-f(z)$ for any reference point $z$ in terms of the accumulated step sizes and the distances between $\theta_0$, $\theta_T$, and $z$. The bound translates the number of iterations into an effective regularization coefficient in the loss function. We demonstrate this framework through analyses of training dynamics and prediction risk bounds. In addition to revisiting and refining known results on gradient descent, we provide new results for mirror descent with Bregman divergence projection, for generalized linear models trained by gradient descent and exponentiated gradient descent, and for randomized predictors. We illustrate and supplement these theoretical findings with experiments on generalized linear models.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this article is to provide a firm mathematical foundation for the application of deep gradient flow methods (DGFMs) for the solution of (high-dimensional) partial differential equations (PDEs). We decompose the generalization error of DGFMs into an approximation and a training error. We first show that the solution of PDEs that satisfy reasonable and verifiable assumptions can be approximated by neural networks, thus the approximation error tends to zero as the number of neurons tends to infinity. Then, we derive the gradient flow that the training process follows in the ``wide network limit'' and analyze the limit of this flow as the training time tends to infinity. These results combined show that the generalization error of DGFMs tends to zero as the number of neurons and the training time tend to infinity.</description>

      <title>Efficient Active Learning with Abstention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.00043v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of active learning is to achieve the same accuracy achievable by passive learning, while using much fewer labels. Exponential savings in terms of label complexity have been proved in very special cases, but fundamental lower bounds show that such improvements are impossible in general. This suggests a need to explore alternative goals for active learning. Learning with abstention is one such alternative. In this setting, the active learning algorithm may abstain from prediction and incur an error that is marginally smaller than random guessing. We develop the first computationally efficient active learning algorithm with abstention. Our algorithm provably achieves $\mathsf{polylog}(\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ label complexity, without any low noise conditions. Such performance guarantee reduces the label complexity by an exponential factor, relative to passive learning and active learning that is not allowed to abstain. Furthermore, our algorithm is guaranteed to only abstain on hard examples (where the true label distribution is close to a fair coin), a novel property we term proper abstention that also leads to a host of other desirable characteristics (e.g., recovering minimax guarantees in the standard setting, and avoiding the undesirable "noise-seeking" behavior often seen in active learning). We also provide novel extensions of our algorithm that achieve constant label complexity and deal with model misspecification.</description>

      <title>Generative Modelling of L\'evy Area for High Order SDE Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well understood that, when numerically simulating SDEs with general noise, achieving a strong convergence rate better than $O(\sqrt{h})$ (where h is the step size) requires the use of certain iterated integrals of Brownian motion, commonly referred to as its "L\'evy areas". However, these stochastic integrals are difficult to simulate due to their non-Gaussian nature and for a $d$-dimensional Brownian motion with $d &gt; 2$, no fast almost-exact sampling algorithm is known.
  In this paper, we propose L\'evyGAN, a deep-learning-based model for generating approximate samples of L\'evy area conditional on a Brownian increment. Due to our "Bridge-flipping" operation, the output samples match all joint and conditional odd moments exactly. Our generator employs a tailored GNN-inspired architecture, which enforces the correct dependency structure between the output distribution and the conditioning variable. Furthermore, we incorporate a mathematically principled characteristic-function based discriminator. Lastly, we introduce a novel training mechanism termed "Chen-training", which circumvents the need for expensive-to-generate training data-sets. This new training procedure is underpinned by our two main theoretical results.
  For 4-dimensional Brownian motion, we show that L\'evyGAN exhibits state-of-the-art performance across several metrics which measure both the joint and marginal distributions. We conclude with a numerical experiment on the log-Heston model, a popular SDE in mathematical finance, demonstrating that high-quality synthetic L\'evy area can lead to high order weak convergence and variance reduction when using multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC).</description>

      <title>Are Ensembles Getting Better all the Time?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17885v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensemble methods combine the predictions of several base models. We study whether or not including more models always improves their average performance. This question depends on the kind of ensemble considered, as well as the predictive metric chosen. We focus on situations where all members of the ensemble are a priori expected to perform equally well, which is the case of several popular methods such as random forests or deep ensembles. In this setting, we show that ensembles are getting better all the time if, and only if, the considered loss function is convex. More precisely, in that case, the loss of the ensemble is a decreasing function of the number of models. When the loss function is nonconvex, we show a series of results that can be summarised as: ensembles of good models keep getting better, and ensembles of bad models keep getting worse. To this end, we prove a new result on the monotonicity of tail probabilities that may be of independent interest. We illustrate our results on a medical problem (diagnosing melanomas using neural nets) and a "wisdom of crowds" experiment (guessing the ratings of upcoming movies).</description>

      <title>Distribution-Dependent Rates for Multi-Distribution Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13130v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To address the needs of modeling uncertainty in sensitive machine learning applications, the setup of distributionally robust optimization (DRO) seeks good performance uniformly across a variety of tasks. The recent multi-distribution learning (MDL) framework tackles this objective in a dynamic interaction with the environment, where the learner has sampling access to each target distribution. Drawing inspiration from the field of pure-exploration multi-armed bandits, we provide distribution-dependent guarantees in the MDL regime, that scale with suboptimality gaps and result in superior dependence on the sample size when compared to the existing distribution-independent analyses. We investigate two non-adaptive strategies, uniform and non-uniform exploration, and present non-asymptotic regret bounds using novel tools from empirical process theory. Furthermore, we devise an adaptive optimistic algorithm, LCB-DR, that showcases enhanced dependence on the gaps, mirroring the contrast between uniform and optimistic allocation in the multi-armed bandit literature. We also conduct a small synthetic experiment illustrating the comparative strengths of each strategy.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gradient Descent for Nonparametric Additive Regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00691v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an iterative algorithm for training nonparametric additive models that enjoys favorable memory storage and computational requirements. The algorithm can be viewed as the functional counterpart of stochastic gradient descent, applied to the coefficients of a truncated basis expansion of the component functions. We show that the resulting estimator satisfies an oracle inequality that allows for model mis-specification. In the well-specified setting, by choosing the learning rate carefully across three distinct stages of training, we demonstrate that its risk is minimax optimal in terms of the dependence on both the dimensionality of the data and the size of the training sample. Unlike past work, we also provide polynomial convergence rates even when the covariates do not have full support on their domain.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Linear Bandits with Hidden Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13899v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional linear bandits with low-dimensional structure have received considerable attention in recent studies due to their practical significance. The most common structure in the literature is sparsity. However, it may not be available in practice. Symmetry, where the reward is invariant under certain groups of transformations on the set of arms, is another important inductive bias in the high-dimensional case that covers many standard structures, including sparsity. In this work, we study high-dimensional symmetric linear bandits where the symmetry is hidden from the learner, and the correct symmetry needs to be learned in an online setting. We examine the structure of a collection of hidden symmetry and provide a method based on model selection within the collection of low-dimensional subspaces. Our algorithm achieves a regret bound of $ O(d_0^{2/3} T^{2/3} \log(d))$, where $d$ is the ambient dimension which is potentially very large, and $d_0$ is the dimension of the true low-dimensional subspace such that $d_0 \ll d$. With an extra assumption on well-separated models, we can further improve the regret to $ O(d_0\sqrt{T\log(d)} )$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel deep neural network methodology for density estimation on product Riemannian manifold domains. In our approach, the network directly parameterizes the unknown density function and is trained using a penalized maximum likelihood framework, with a penalty term formed using manifold differential operators. The network architecture and estimation algorithm are carefully designed to handle the challenges of high-dimensional product manifold domains, effectively mitigating the curse of dimensionality that limits traditional kernel and basis expansion estimators, as well as overcoming the convergence issues encountered by non-specialized neural network methods. Extensive simulations and a real-world application to brain structural connectivity data highlight the clear advantages of our method over the competing alternatives.</description>

      <title>coverforest: Conformal Predictions with Random Forest in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal prediction provides a framework for uncertainty quantification, specifically in the forms of prediction intervals and sets with distribution-free guaranteed coverage. While recent cross-conformal techniques such as CV+ and Jackknife+-after-bootstrap achieve better data efficiency than traditional split conformal methods, they incur substantial computational costs due to required pairwise comparisons between training and test samples' out-of-bag scores. Observing that these methods naturally extend from ensemble models, particularly random forests, we leverage existing optimized random forest implementations to enable efficient cross-conformal predictions.
  We present coverforest, a Python package that implements efficient conformal prediction methods specifically optimized for random forests. coverforest supports both regression and classification tasks through various conformal prediction methods, including split conformal, CV+, Jackknife+-after-bootstrap, and adaptive prediction sets. Our package leverages parallel computing and Cython optimizations to speed up out-of-bag calculations. Our experiments demonstrate that coverforest's predictions achieve the desired level of coverage. In addition, its training and prediction times can be faster than an existing implementation by 2--9 times. The source code for the coverforest is hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/donlap/coverforest.</description>

      <title>Concentration Inequalities for Stochastic Optimization of Unbounded Objective Functions with Application to Denoising Score Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive novel concentration inequalities that bound the statistical error for a large class of stochastic optimization problems, focusing on the case of unbounded objective functions. Our derivations utilize the following key tools: 1) A new form of McDiarmid's inequality that is based on sample-dependent one-component mean-difference bounds and which leads to a novel uniform law of large numbers result for unbounded functions. 2) A new Rademacher complexity bound for families of functions that satisfy an appropriate sample-dependent Lipschitz property, which allows for application to a large class of distributions with unbounded support. As an application of these results, we derive statistical error bounds for denoising score matching (DSM), an application that inherently requires one to consider unbounded objective functions and distributions with unbounded support, even in cases where the data distribution has bounded support. In addition, our results quantify the benefit of sample-reuse in algorithms that employ easily-sampled auxiliary random variables in addition to the training data, e.g., as in DSM, which uses auxiliary Gaussian random variables.</description>

      <title>Discovery and inference beyond linearity by integrating Bayesian regression, tree ensembles and Shapley values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is gaining popularity for hypothesis-free discovery of risk and protective factors in healthcare studies. ML is strong at discovering nonlinearities and interactions, but this power is compromised by a lack of reliable inference. Although Shapley values provide local measures of features' effects, valid uncertainty quantification for these effects is typically lacking, thus precluding statistical inference. We propose RuleSHAP, a framework that addresses this limitation by combining a dedicated Bayesian sparse regression model with a new tree-based rule generator and Shapley value attribution. RuleSHAP provides detection of nonlinear and interaction effects with uncertainty quantification at the individual level. We derive an efficient formula for computing marginal Shapley values within this framework. We demonstrate the validity of our framework on simulated data. Finally, we apply RuleSHAP to data from an epidemiological cohort to detect and infer several effects for high cholesterol and blood pressure, such as nonlinear interaction effects between features like age, sex, ethnicity, BMI and glucose level.</description>

      <title>Learning quadratic neural networks in high dimensions: SGD dynamics and scaling laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03688v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the optimization and sample complexity of gradient-based training of a two-layer neural network with quadratic activation function in the high-dimensional regime, where the data is generated as $f_*(\boldsymbol{x}) \propto \sum_{j=1}^{r}\lambda_j \sigma\left(\langle \boldsymbol{\theta_j}, \boldsymbol{x}\rangle\right), \boldsymbol{x} \sim N(0,\boldsymbol{I}_d)$, $\sigma$ is the 2nd Hermite polynomial, and $\lbrace\boldsymbol{\theta}_j \rbrace_{j=1}^{r} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ are orthonormal signal directions. We consider the extensive-width regime $r \asymp d^\beta$ for $\beta \in [0, 1)$, and assume a power-law decay on the (non-negative) second-layer coefficients $\lambda_j\asymp j^{-\alpha}$ for $\alpha \geq 0$. We present a sharp analysis of the SGD dynamics in the feature learning regime, for both the population limit and the finite-sample (online) discretization, and derive scaling laws for the prediction risk that highlight the power-law dependencies on the optimization time, sample size, and model width. Our analysis combines a precise characterization of the associated matrix Riccati differential equation with novel matrix monotonicity arguments to establish convergence guarantees for the infinite-dimensional effective dynamics.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz-Guided Design of Interpolation Schedules in Generative Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the design of interpolation schedules in the stochastic interpolants framework for flow and diffusion-based generative models. We show that while all scalar interpolation schedules achieve identical statistical efficiency under Kullback-Leibler divergence in path space after optimal diffusion coefficient tuning, their numerical efficiency can differ substantially. This motivates focusing on numerical properties of the resulting drift fields rather than purely statistical criteria for schedule design. We propose averaged squared Lipschitzness minimization as a principled criterion for numerical optimization, providing an alternative to kinetic energy minimization used in optimal transport approaches. A transfer formula is derived that enables conversion between different schedules at inference time without retraining neural networks. For Gaussian distributions, the optimized schedules achieve exponential improvements in Lipschitz constants over standard linear schedules, while for Gaussian mixtures, they reduce mode collapse in few-step sampling. We also validate our approach on high-dimensional invariant distributions from stochastic Allen-Cahn equations and Navier-Stokes equations, demonstrating robust performance improvements across resolutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the implicit bias of flow matching (FM) samplers via the lens of empirical flow matching. Although population FM may produce gradient-field velocities resembling optimal transport (OT), we show that the empirical FM minimizer is generally not a gradient field, even when each conditional flow is. Consequently, empirical FM is intrinsically not OT-optimal in the Benamou-Brenier sense. In view of this, we analyze the kinetic energy of generated samples. With Gaussian sources, both instantaneous and integrated kinetic energies exhibit exponential concentration, while heavy-tailed sources lead to polynomial tails. These behaviors are governed primarily by the choice of source distribution rather than the data. Overall, these notes provide a concise mathematical account of the structural and energetic biases arising in empirical FM.</description>

      <title>Active Learning with Neural Networks: Insights from Nonparametric Statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks have great representation power, but typically require large numbers of training examples. This motivates deep active learning methods that can significantly reduce the amount of labeled training data. Empirical successes of deep active learning have been recently reported in the literature, however, rigorous label complexity guarantees of deep active learning have remained elusive. This constitutes a significant gap between theory and practice. This paper tackles this gap by providing the first near-optimal label complexity guarantees for deep active learning. The key insight is to study deep active learning from the nonparametric classification perspective. Under standard low noise conditions, we show that active learning with neural networks can provably achieve the minimax label complexity, up to disagreement coefficient and other logarithmic terms. When equipped with an abstention option, we further develop an efficient deep active learning algorithm that achieves $\mathsf{polylog}(\frac{1}{\epsilon})$ label complexity, without any low noise assumptions. We also provide extensions of our results beyond the commonly studied Sobolev/H\"older spaces and develop label complexity guarantees for learning in Radon $\mathsf{BV}^2$ spaces, which have recently been proposed as natural function spaces associated with neural networks.</description>

      <title>The Power of Preconditioning in Overparameterized Low-Rank Matrix Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01186v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$, a preconditioned gradient descent method to tackle the low-rank matrix sensing problem when the true rank is unknown, and when the matrix is possibly ill-conditioned. Using overparametrized factor representations, $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ starts from a small random initialization, and proceeds by gradient descent with a specific form of damped preconditioning to combat bad curvatures induced by overparameterization and ill-conditioning. At the expense of light computational overhead incurred by preconditioners, $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ is remarkably robust to ill-conditioning compared to vanilla gradient descent ($\textsf{GD}$) even with overprameterization. Specifically, we show that, under the Gaussian design, $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ converges to the true low-rank matrix at a constant linear rate after a small number of iterations that scales only logarithmically with respect to the condition number and the problem dimension. This significantly improves over the convergence rate of vanilla $\textsf{GD}$ which suffers from a polynomial dependency on the condition number. Our work provides evidence on the power of preconditioning in accelerating the convergence without hurting generalization in overparameterized learning.</description>

Abstract: Resided at the intersection of multi-fidelity optimization (MFO) and Bayesian optimization (BO), MF BO has found a niche in solving expensive engineering design optimization problems, thanks to its advantages in incorporating physical and mathematical understandings of the problems, saving resources, addressing exploitation-exploration trade-off, considering uncertainty, and processing parallel computing. The increasing number of works dedicated to MF BO suggests the need for a comprehensive review of this advanced optimization technique. In this paper, we survey recent developments of two essential ingredients of MF BO: Gaussian process (GP) based MF surrogates and acquisition functions. We first categorize the existing MF modeling methods and MFO strategies to locate MF BO in a large family of surrogate-based optimization and MFO algorithms. We then exploit the common properties shared between the methods from each ingredient of MF BO to describe important GP-based MF surrogate models and review various acquisition functions. By doing so, we expect to provide a structured understanding of MF BO. Finally, we attempt to reveal important aspects that require further research for applications of MF BO in solving intricate yet important design optimization problems, including constrained optimization, high-dimensional optimization, optimization under uncertainty, and multi-objective optimization.</description>

      <title>Inference at the data's edge: Gaussian processes for modeling and inference under model-dependency, poor overlap, and extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many inferential tasks involve fitting models to observed data and predicting outcomes at new covariate values, requiring interpolation or extrapolation. Conventional methods select a single best-fitting model, discarding fits that were similarly plausible in-sample but would yield sharply different predictions out-of-sample. Gaussian Processes (GPs) offer a principled alternative. Rather than committing to one conditional expectation function, GPs deliver a posterior distribution over outcomes at any covariate value. This posterior effectively retains the range of models consistent with the data, widening uncertainty intervals where extrapolation magnifies divergence. In this way, the GP's uncertainty estimates reflect the implications of extrapolation on our predictions, helping to tame the "dangers of extreme counterfactuals" (King &amp; Zeng, 2006). The approach requires (i) specifying a covariance function linking outcome similarity to covariate similarity, and (ii) assuming Gaussian noise around the conditional expectation. We provide an accessible introduction to GPs with emphasis on this property, along with a simple, automated procedure for hyperparameter selection implemented in the R package gpss. We illustrate the value of GPs for capturing counterfactual uncertainty in three settings: (i) treatment effect estimation with poor overlap, (ii) interrupted time series requiring extrapolation beyond pre-intervention data, and (iii) regression discontinuity designs where estimates hinge on boundary behavior.</description>

      <title>Minibatch Optimal Transport and Perplexity Bound Estimation in Discrete Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discrete flow matching, a recent framework for modeling categorical data, has shown competitive performance with autoregressive models. However, unlike continuous flow matching, the rectification strategy cannot be applied due to the stochasticity of discrete paths, necessitating alternative methods to minimize state transitions. We propose a dynamic-optimal-transport-like minimization objective and derive its Kantorovich formulation for discrete flows with convex interpolants, where transport cost depends solely on inter-state similarity and can be optimized via minibatch strategies. In the case of bag-of-words (BoW) sourced flows, we show that such methods can reduce the number of transitions up to 8 times (1024 to 128) to reach the same generative perplexity without compromising diversity. Additionally, path nondeterminism in discrete flows precludes an instantaneous change-of-variables analogue, preventing precise probability estimation available to continuous flows. We therefore propose two upper bounds on perplexity, enabling principled training, evaluation and model comparison. Finally, we introduce Multimask Flows which outperform masked flows in generative perplexity, particularly when utilizing minibatch Optimal Transport, without sacrificing diversity.</description>

      <title>A Particle Algorithm for Mean-Field Variational Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20385v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational inference is a fast and scalable alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo and has been widely applied to posterior inference tasks in statistics and machine learning. A traditional approach for implementing mean-field variational inference (MFVI) is coordinate ascent variational inference (CAVI), which relies crucially on parametric assumptions on complete conditionals. We introduce a novel particle-based algorithm for MFVI, named PArticle VI (PAVI), for nonparametric mean-field approximation. We obtain non-asymptotic error bounds for our algorithm. To our knowledge, this is the first end-to-end guarantee for particle-based MFVI.</description>

      <title>New affine invariant ensemble samplers and their dimensional scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce new affine invariant ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers that are easy to construct and improve upon existing methods, especially for high-dimensional problems. We first propose a simple derivative-free side move sampler that improves upon popular samplers in the \texttt{emcee} package by generating more effective proposal directions. We then develop a class of derivative-based affine invariant ensemble Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) samplers based on antisymmetric preconditioning using complementary ensembles, which outperform standard, non-affine-invariant HMC when sampling highly anisotropic distributions. We provide asymptotic scaling analysis for high-dimensional Gaussian targets to further elucidate the properties of these affine invariant ensemble samplers. In particular, with derivative information, the affine invariant ensemble HMC can scale much better with dimension compared to derivative-free ensemble samplers.</description>

      <title>Consistent line clustering using geometric hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many datasets are naturally modeled as graphs, where vertices denote entities and edges encode pairwise interactions. However, some problems exhibit higher-order structure that lies beyond this framework. Among the simplest examples is line clustering, in which points in a Euclidean space are grouped into clusters well approximated by line segments. As any two points trivially determine a line, the relevant structure emerges only when considering higher-order tuples. To capture this, we construct a 3-uniform hypergraph by treating sets of three points as hyperedges whenever they are approximately collinear. This geometric hypergraph encodes information about the underlying line segments, which can be extracted using community recovery algorithms. We characterize the fundamental limits of line clustering and establish the near-optimality of hypergraph-based methods. In particular, we derive information-theoretic thresholds for exact and almost exact recovery for noisy observations from intersecting lines in the plane. Finally, we introduce a polynomial-time spectral algorithm that succeeds up to polylogarithmic factors of the information-theoretic bounds.</description>

      <title>Mathematical artificial data for operator learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a transformative tool for solving differential equations (DEs), yet prevailing methodologies remain constrained by dual limitations: data-driven methods demand costly labeled datasets while model-driven techniques face efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. We present the Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) framework, a new paradigm that integrates physical laws with data-driven learning to facilitate large-scale operator discovery. By exploiting DEs' intrinsic mathematical structure to generate physics-embedded analytical solutions and associated synthetic data, MAD fundamentally eliminates dependence on experimental or simulated training data. This enables computationally efficient operator learning across multi-parameter systems while maintaining mathematical rigor. Through numerical demonstrations spanning 2D parametric problems where both the boundary values and source term are functions, we showcase MAD's generalizability and superior efficiency/accuracy across various DE scenarios. This physics-embedded-data-driven framework and its capacity to handle complex parameter spaces gives it the potential to become a universal paradigm for physics-informed machine intelligence in scientific computing.</description>

      <title>Sampling from Gaussian Processes: A Tutorial and Applications in Global Sensitivity Analysis and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-fidelity simulations and physical experiments are essential for engineering analysis and design, yet their high cost often makes two critical tasks--global sensitivity analysis (GSA) and optimization--prohibitively expensive. This limitation motivates the common use of Gaussian processes (GPs) as proxy regression models that provide uncertainty-aware predictions from a limited number of high-quality observations. GPs naturally enable efficient sampling strategies that support informed decision-making under uncertainty by extracting information from a subset of possible functions for the model of interest. However, direct sampling from GPs is inefficient due to their infinite-dimensional nature and the high cost associated with large covariance matrix operations. Despite their popularity in machine learning and statistics communities, sampling from GPs has received little attention in the community of engineering optimization. In this paper, we present the formulation and detailed implementation of two notable sampling methods--random Fourier features and pathwise conditioning--for generating posterior samples from GPs at reduced computational cost. Alternative approaches are briefly described. Importantly, we detail how the generated samples can be applied in GSA, single-objective optimization, and multi-objective optimization. We show successful applications of these sampling methods through a series of numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Online Convex Optimization with Heavy Tails: Old Algorithms, New Regrets, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Online Convex Optimization (OCO), when the stochastic gradient has a finite variance, many algorithms provably work and guarantee a sublinear regret. However, limited results are known if the gradient estimate has a heavy tail, i.e., the stochastic gradient only admits a finite $\mathsf{p}$-th central moment for some $\mathsf{p}\in\left(1,2\right]$. Motivated by it, this work examines different old algorithms for OCO (e.g., Online Gradient Descent) in the more challenging heavy-tailed setting. Under the standard bounded domain assumption, we establish new regrets for these classical methods without any algorithmic modification. Remarkably, these regret bounds are fully optimal in all parameters (can be achieved even without knowing $\mathsf{p}$), suggesting that OCO with heavy tails can be solved effectively without any extra operation (e.g., gradient clipping). Our new results have several applications. A particularly interesting one is the first provable and optimal convergence result for nonsmooth nonconvex optimization under heavy-tailed noise without gradient clipping. Furthermore, we explore broader settings (e.g., smooth OCO) and extend our ideas to optimistic algorithms to handle different cases simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Diffusion-Based Sampling with Molecular Collective Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion-based samplers learn to sample complex, high-dimensional distributions using energies or log densities alone, without training data. Yet, they remain impractical for molecular sampling because they are often slower than molecular dynamics and miss thermodynamically relevant modes. Inspired by enhanced sampling, we encourage exploration by introducing a sequential bias along bespoke, information-rich, low-dimensional projections of atomic coordinates known as collective variables (CVs). We introduce a repulsive potential centered on the CVs from recent samples, which pushes future samples towards novel CV regions and effectively increases the temperature in the projected space. Our resulting method improves efficiency, mode discovery, enables the estimation of free energy differences, and retains independent sampling from the approximate Boltzmann distribution via reweighting by the bias. On standard peptide conformational sampling benchmarks, the method recovers diverse conformational states and accurate free energy profiles. We are the first to demonstrate reactive sampling using a diffusion-based sampler, capturing bond breaking and formation with universal interatomic potentials at near-first-principles accuracy. The approach resolves reactive energy landscapes at a fraction of the wall-clock time of standard sampling methods, advancing diffusion-based sampling towards practical use in molecular sciences.</description>

      <title>Deep sequence models tend to memorize geometrically; it is unclear why</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep sequence models are said to store atomic facts predominantly in the form of associative memory: a brute-force lookup of co-occurring entities. We identify a dramatically different form of storage of atomic facts that we term as geometric memory. Here, the model has synthesized embeddings encoding novel global relationships between all entities, including ones that do not co-occur in training. Such storage is powerful: for instance, we show how it transforms a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition into an easy-to-learn $1$-step navigation task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry, as against a lookup of local associations, cannot be straightforwardly attributed to typical supervisory, architectural, or optimizational pressures. Counterintuitively, a geometry is learned even when it is more complex than the brute-force lookup.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also points out to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery, and unlearning.</description>
