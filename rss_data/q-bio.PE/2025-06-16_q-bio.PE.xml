      <title>A data-driven analysis of the impact of non-compliant individuals on epidemic diffusion in urban settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Individuals who do not comply with public health safety measures pose a significant challenge to effective epidemic control, as their risky behaviours can undermine public health interventions. This is particularly relevant in urban environments because of their high population density and complex social interactions. In this study, we employ detailed contact networks, built using a data-driven approach, to examine the impact of non-compliant individuals on epidemic dynamics in three major Italian cities: Torino, Milano, and Palermo. We use a heterogeneous extension of the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model that distinguishes between ordinary and non-compliant individuals, who are more infectious and/or more susceptible. By combining electoral data with recent findings on vaccine hesitancy, we obtain spatially heterogeneous distributions of non-compliance. Epidemic simulations demonstrate that even a small proportion of non-compliant individuals in the population can substantially increase the number of infections and accelerate the timing of their peak. Furthermore, the impact of non-compliance is greatest when disease transmission rates are moderate. Including the heterogeneous, data-driven distribution of non-compliance in the simulations results in infection hotspots forming with varying intensity according to the disease transmission rate. Overall, these findings emphasise the importance of monitoring behavioural compliance and tailoring public health interventions to address localised risks.</description>

      <title>Kinetic formulation of compartmental epidemic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a kinetic model that couples the movement of a population of individuals with the dynamics of a pathogen in the same population. The model is formally shown to generalize the well-known compartmental models in mathematical epidemiology. We prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions in appropriate spaces for particular instances of the model. We finish with some examples, and discuss possible applications of this modeling approach.</description>

      <title>Digging deeper: deep joint species distribution modeling reveals environmental drivers of Earthworm Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earthworms are key drivers of soil function, influencing organic matter turnover, nutrient cycling, and soil structure. Understanding the environmental controls on their distribution is essential for predicting the impacts of land use and climate change on soil ecosystems. While local studies have identified abiotic drivers of earthworm communities, broad-scale spatial patterns remain underexplored.
  We developed a multi-species, multi-task deep learning model to jointly predict the distribution of 77 earthworm species across metropolitan France, using historical (1960-1970) and contemporary (1990-2020) records. The model integrates climate, soil, and land cover variables to estimate habitat suitability. We applied SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to identify key environmental drivers and used species clustering to reveal ecological response groups.
  The joint model achieved high predictive performance (TSS &gt;= 0.7) and improved predictions for rare species compared to traditional species distribution models. Shared feature extraction across species allowed for more robust identification of common and contrasting environmental responses. Precipitation variability, temperature seasonality, and land cover emerged as dominant predictors of earthworm distribution. Species clustering revealed distinct ecological strategies tied to climatic and land use gradients.
  Our study advances both the methodological and ecological understanding of soil biodiversity. We demonstrate the utility of interpretable deep learning approaches for large-scale soil fauna modeling and provide new insights into earthworm habitat specialization. These findings support improved soil biodiversity monitoring and conservation planning in the face of global environmental change.</description>

      <title>Foundations of ecological and evolutionary change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Biological evolution is realised through the same mechanisms of birth and death that underlie change in population density. The deep interdependence between ecology and evolution is well-established, and recent models focus on integrating eco-evolutionary dynamics to demonstrate how ecological and evolutionary processes interact and feed back upon each other. Nevertheless, a gap remains between the logical foundations of ecology and evolution. Both population ecology and evolution have fundamental equations that define how the size of a population (ecology) and the average characteristic within a population (evolution) change, respectively, over time. These fundamental equations are a complete and exact description of change for any closed population, but how they are formally linked remains unclear. We link the fundamental equations of population ecology and evolution with an equation that sums how individual characteristics interact with individual fitness in a population. From this equation, we derive the fundamental equations of population ecology and evolutionary biology (the Price equation). We thereby identify an overlooked bridge between ecology and biological evolution. Our unification formally recovers the equivalence between mean population growth rate and evolutionary fitness and links this change to ecosystem function. We outline how our framework can be used to further develop eco-evolutionary theory. .</description>

      <title>Galled Perfect Transfer Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03935v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting horizontal gene transfers often requires comparative sequence data, but recent work has shown that character-based approaches could also be useful for this task. Notably, perfect transfer networks (PTN) explain the character diversity of a set of taxa for traits that are gained once, rarely lost, but that can be transferred laterally. Characterizing the structure of such characters is an important step towards understanding more complex characters. Although efficient algorithms can infer such networks from character data, they can sometimes predict overly complicated transfer histories. With the goal of recovering the simplest possible scenarios in this model, we introduce galled perfect transfer networks, which are PTNs that are galled trees. Such networks are useful for characters that are incompatible in terms of tree-like evolution, but that do fit in an almost-tree scenario. We provide polynomial-time algorithms for two problems: deciding whether one can add transfer edges to a tree to transform it into a galled PTN, and deciding whether a set of characters are galled-compatible, that is, they can be explained by some galled PTN. We also analyze a real dataset comprising of a bacterial species trees and KEGG functions as characters, and derive several conclusions on the difficulty of explaining characters in a galled tree, which provide several directions for future research.</description>
