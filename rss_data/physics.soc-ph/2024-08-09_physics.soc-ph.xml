      <title>The marginal majority effect: when social influence produces lock-in</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: People are influenced by the choices of others, a phenomenon observed across contexts in the social and behavioral sciences. Social influence can lock in an initial popularity advantage of an option over a higher quality alternative. Yet several experiments designed to enable social influence have found that social systems self-correct rather than lock-in. Here we identify a behavioral phenomenon that makes inferior lock-in possible, which we call the 'marginal majority effect': A discontinuous increase in the choice probability of an option as its popularity exceeds that of a competing option. We demonstrate the existence of marginal majority effects in several recent experiments and show that lock-in always occurs when the effect is large enough to offset the quality effect on choice, but rarely otherwise. Our results reconcile conflicting past empirical evidence and connect a behavioral phenomenon to the possibility of social lock-in.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale structural complexity as a quantitative measure of visual complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While intuitive for humans, the concept of visual complexity is hard to define and quantify formally. We suggest adopting the multi-scale structural complexity (MSSC) measure, an approach that defines structural complexity of an object as the amount of dissimilarities between distinct scales in its hierarchical organization. In this work, we apply MSSC to the case of visual stimuli, using an open dataset of images with subjective complexity scores obtained from human participants (SAVOIAS). We demonstrate that MSSC correlates with subjective complexity on par with other computational complexity measures, while being more intuitive by definition, consistent across categories of images, and easier to compute. We discuss objective and subjective elements inherently present in human perception of complexity and the domains where the two are more likely to diverge. We show how the multi-scale nature of MSSC allows further investigation of complexity as it is perceived by humans.</description>

      <title>The role of central places in exposure segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we show that "exposure segregation" - the degree to which individuals of one group are exposed to individuals of another in day-to-day mobility - is dependent on the structure of cities, and the importance of downtowns in particular. Recent work uses aggregated data to claim that the location of amenities can inhibit or facilitate interactions between groups: if a city is residentially segregated, as many American cities are, then amenities between segregated communities should encourage them to mix. We show that the relationship between "bridging" amenities and socio-economic mixing breaks down when we examine the amenities themselves, rather than the urban aggregates. For example, restaurants with locations that suggest low expected mixing do not, much of the time, have low mixing: there is only a weak correlation between bridging and mixing at the level of the restaurant, despite a strong correlation at the level of the supermarket. This is because downtowns - and the bundle of amenities that define them - tend not to be situated in bridge areas but play an important role in drawing diverse groups together.</description>

      <title>Modeling information spread across networks with communities using a multitype branching process framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of information diffusion in complex networks is widely studied in an attempt to understand how individuals communicate and how information travels and reaches individuals through interactions. However, complex networks often present community structure, and tools to analyse information diffusion on networks with communities are needed. In this paper, we develop theoretical tools using multi-type branching processes to model and analyse simple contagion information spread on a broad class of networks with community structure. We show how, by using limited information about the network -- the degree distribution within and between communities -- we can calculate standard statistical characteristics of the dynamics of information diffusion, such as the extinction probability, hazard function, and cascade size distribution. These properties can be estimated not only for the entire network but also for each community separately. Furthermore, we estimate the probability of information spreading from one community to another where it is not currently spreading. We demonstrate the accuracy of our framework by applying it to two specific examples: the Stochastic Block Model and a log-normal network with community structure. We show how the initial seeding location affects the observed cascade size distribution on a heavy-tailed network and that our framework accurately captures this effect.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Evolutionary Pressure and Diminishing Returns Might Explain the Fermi Paradox: On What Super-AIs Are Like</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03685v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With an evolutionary approach, the basis of morality can be explained as adaptations to problems of cooperation. With 'evolution' taken in a broad sense, evolving AIs that satisfy the conditions for evolution to apply will be subject to the same cooperative evolutionary pressure as biological entities. Here the adaptiveness of increased cooperation as material safety and wealth increase is discussed -- for humans, for other societies, and for AIs. Diminishing beneficial returns from increased access to material resources also suggests the possibility that, on the whole, there will be no incentive to for instance colonize entire galaxies, thus providing a possible explanation of the Fermi paradox, wondering where everybody is. It is further argued that old societies could engender, give way to, super-AIs, since it is likely that super-AIs are feasible, and fitter. Closing is an aside on effective ways for morals and goals to affect life and society, emphasizing environments, cultures, and laws, and exemplified by how to eat.
  Appended are an algorithm for colonizing for example a galaxy quickly, models of the evolution of cooperation and fairness under diminishing returns, and software for simulating signaling development. It is also noted that there can be no exponential colonization or reproduction, for mathematical reasons, as each entity takes up a certain amount of space.</description>
