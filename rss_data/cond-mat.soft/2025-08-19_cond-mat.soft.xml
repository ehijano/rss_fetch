      <title>PBPU Elastomer Network Architecture Determination via Corresponding States Analysis of Mechanical Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we examine the effect of R=[NCO]/[OH] in the R=&lt;1 regime, on the resultant structural topology of polybutadiene polyurethane (PBPU) elastomer networks based on hydroxy-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB). We employ stress-elongation behavior and its modeling, as a tool. We examine this property via a combination of our model for the finite chain phantom networks incorporating the HTPB structural information, with the slip-tube model from the literature, suitably modified phenomenologically. We implement a further normalized Mooney-Rivlin (MR) representation (corresponding deformation states plots), to remove any magnitude bias on the model parameters. The now revealed curvatures of all the MR plots, in turn, reveals the non-correlation between the chain size and crosslink density. This discrepancy occurs due to the R-dependent majority presence of network defects due to sol effects (as obtained from swelling experiments) and non-load bearing pendant branches on the load-bearing network chains.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Programmable Origami Metamaterials with Controlled Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Origami-inspired structures provide unprecedented opportunities for creating lightweight, deployable systems with programmable mechanical responses. However, their design remains challenging due to complex nonlinear mechanics, multistability, and the need for precise control of deployment forces. Here, we present a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework for both forward prediction and inverse design of conical Kresling origami (CKO) without requiring pre-collected training data. By embedding mechanical equilibrium equations directly into the learning process, the model predicts complete energy landscapes with high accuracy while minimizing non-physical artifacts. The inverse design routine specifies both target stable-state heights and separating energy barriers, enabling freeform programming of the entire energy curve. This capability is extended to hierarchical CKO assemblies, where sequential layer-by-layer deployment is achieved through programmed barrier magnitudes. Finite element simulations and experiments on physical prototypes validate the designed deployment sequences and barrier ratios, confirming the robustness of the approach. This work establishes a versatile, data-free route for programming complex mechanical energy landscapes in origami-inspired metamaterials, offering broad potential for deployable aerospace systems, morphing structures, and soft robotic actuators.</description>

      <title>Experimental Confirmation of Hyperuniformity of torque fluctuations in Frictional Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent purely theoretical prediction stated that in frictional granular packings, mechanical balance and material isotropy constrain the stress auto-correlation matrix to be fully determined by two spatially isotropic functions: the pressure and torque auto-correlations. Moreover, and unexpectedly, the torque fluctuations were predicted to be hyperuniform, a condition for the stress auto-correlation to decay as the elastic Green's function. In this Letter we present first experimental evidence for the hyperuniformity of the stress fluctuations. We propose that quite generally the variance of torque fluctuations in a d-dimensional ball of radius R will increase exactly like $R^{d-1}$, satisfying the definition of hyperuniformity.</description>

      <title>Phase Separation Kinetics in a Polar Active Field Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A milestone of phase separation kinetics is the emergence of universal power laws $\sim t^{1/z}$ governing the domain growth evolution. We investigate a phase-separating polar active model comprising a scalar density field with an advective coupling to a polarization field. Our analysis reveals a novel $\sim t^{0.6}$ regime, which agrees well with the accelerated growth recently observed in simulations of polar active particles. We provide analytical arguments to explain how advection facilitates the creation of topological defects and compresses the domains leading to faster growth. We also show that the $\sim t^{0.6}$ regime is robust to several model generalizations.</description>

      <title>Order-Disorder Transitions and Thermal Pathways in Frustrated 2D Colloidal Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ extensive NPT molecular dynamics simulations to explore the thermal transitions of two-dimensional colloidal crystals interacting via a core-softened potential with competing length scales. The system stabilizes three distinct solid phases, namely low-density triangular (LDT), stripe, and kagome, which exhibit markedly different responses to heating and cooling. Our simulations reveal that the LDT and kagome phases melt via first-order transitions, but only the former recrystallizes smoothly. The kagome phase displays strong hysteresis and metastability, while the stripe phase undergoes a continuous and nearly reversible transformation. These results highlight the role of lattice geometry and frustration in shaping non-universal melting and freezing pathways in 2D soft matter.</description>

      <title>Electrochemical response of biological membranes to localized currents and external electric fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical phenomena in biology often unfold in confined geometries where micrometer- to millimeter-scale domains coexist with nanometer-scale interfacial diffuse charge layers. We analyze a model lipid membrane-electrolyte system where an ion channel-like current flows across the membrane while parallel electrodes simultaneously apply a step voltage, emulating an extrinsic electric field. Matched asymptotic expansions of the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations show that, under physiological conditions, the diffuse charge layers rapidly reach a quasi-steady state, and the bulk electrolyte remains electroneutral. As a result, all free charge is confined to the nanometer-scale screening layers at the membrane and electrode interfaces. The bulk electric potential satisfies Laplace's equation, and is dynamically coupled to the interfacial layers through time-dependent boundary conditions. This multiscale coupling partitions the space-time response into distinct regimes. At sufficiently long times, we show that the system can be represented by an equivalent circuit analogous to those used in classical cable theory. We derive closed-form expressions of the transmembrane potential within each regime, and verify them against nonlinear numerical simulations. Our results show how electrode-induced screening and confinement effects influence the electrochemical response over multiple length and time scales in biological systems.</description>

      <title>Diffuse-Layer Capacitance at the Potential of Zero Charge in Binary Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The capacitance of the electric double layer has potential applications in supercapacitors, and theoretical investigations of the double-layer capacitance in binary mixtures are important. In this work, we develop the theory of the electric double layer in binary mixtures, and the diffuse-layer capacitance at the potential of zero charge is obtained analytically. Furthermore, we observe a divergence of the capacitance in the phase diagram, suggesting a surface instability. The obtained capacitance is different from that derived using single-liquid approximation unless the preferential solvation energies of cations and anions are the same. When the system is close to the surface instability line, the capacitance strongly deviates from the results of single-liquid approximation.</description>

      <title>Statistical-Mechanical Theory on the Probability Distribution Function for the Net Charge of an Electrolyte Droplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplets of electrolyte solutions in an insulating medium are ubiquitous in nature. The net charges of these droplets are normally nonzero, and they fluctuate. However, a theory on the probability distribution function for the net charge of droplets is lacking, so far. Thus, a statistical-mechanical theory of a charged droplet is developed with including the effect of the electrostatic energy of charging as well as the random distribution of ions. Then, the probability distribution function for the net charge of an electrolyte droplet is calculated assuming that it is generated from a macroscopic solution with the different cation and anion concentrations. Using the Gaussian approximation and Stirling's formula, the analytic results for the average and variance of the net charge of a droplet are obtained.</description>

      <title>Phantom Networks of Finite Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16188v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular chains of elastomer networks are modeled as ideal, finite, Freely Jointed Chains (FJCs). We first develop a compact, closed-form, mathematically accurate representation of this model. We begin with the closed form of the Pade-like approximations for the Inverse Langevin Function, modified by the method by Slater (2003), to map to the ideal FJC model. We fit the generalized form of this expression to exact the series expression by Treloar (1975) for the probability density function. The resulting fit yields the exact expression with respect to the Treloar expression. We verify this exact fit from the precise correlation of the moments from the fitted probability distribution with the analytical FJC distribution moments. These expressions are incorporated into the 8-chain geometry, to yield the affine network elasticity expression. We extend the exact and compact expression of an ideal FJC to determine the fluctuation distribution (about its mean position), of the junction between two ideal FJCs. The fluctuation is the conditional probability of the junction, given the separation of the distal points of the connected FJCs. The fluctuation distribution corresponds to an ideal FJC, whose effective number of segments, decreases linearly with the distal end separation. Finally, we develop the elasticity relationship for such an ideal network whose junctions can fluctuate to reduce the strain energy density. However, this reduction itself decreases with deformation, which is incorporated in developing the elasticity expression for a phantom network of finite chains.</description>

      <title>Ultra-stretchable and Self-Healable Vitrimers with Tuneable Damping and Mechanical Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03701v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vitrimers are a relatively new class of polymer materials with unique properties offered by cross-links that can undergo associative exchange dynamics. We here present a new class of vitrimers based on poly(methyl acrylate) with cross-links utilising dioxaboralane metathesis. These vitrimers demonstrate a combination of ultra-stretchability (up to $\sim$ 80 times their own length), mechanical toughness ($\sim$ 40 MJ/m$^3$), and thermal stability up to $T\sim$ 250 {\deg}C; moreover, the vitrimers demonstrate excellent mechanical damping characterised by a loss factor ($\tan(\delta)$) with a maximum of $\sim$ 2-3 and an effective value $&gt;$0.3 across five decades in frequency (0.001-100 Hz), or correspondingly across a $T$-range of $\sim$ 35 {\deg}C near room temperature (for a probe frequency of 1 Hz). The vitrimers can be successfully re-processed using both a thermo-mechanical and a chemical processing route, and can for low cross-link density self-heal at room temperature, making them suitable for sustainable applications. The material properties are directly tuneable by variation of both the amount of cross-linker and by the degree of curing. Thus, this class of vitrimers are promising for applications where stretchability combined with mechanical toughness and/or a high mechanical dissipation is required.</description>

      <title>Colloidal hydrodynamic interactions in viscoelastic fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motion of suspended colloidal particles generates fluid disturbances in the surrounding medium that create interparticle interactions. While such colloidal hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) have been extensively studied in viscous Newtonian media, comprehensive understanding of HIs in viscoelastic fluids is lacking. We develop a framework to quantify HIs in viscoelastic fluids with high spatiotemporal precision by trapping colloids and inducing translation-rotation hydrodynamic coupling. Using solutions of wormlike micelles (WLMs) as a case study, we discover that HIs are strongly time-dependent and depend on the structural memory generated in the viscoelastic fluid, in contrast to "instantaneous" HIs in viscous Newtonian fluids. We directly measure time-dependent HIs between a stationary probe and a driven particle during transient start-up, developing on the WLM relaxation timescale. Following the sudden cessation of the driven particle, we observe an intriguing flow reversal in the opposing direction, lasting for a time about ten times larger than the WLM relaxation time. We corroborate our observations with analytical microhydrodynamic theory, direct numerical solutions of a continuum model, and particle-based Stokesian dynamics simulations. We find that the structural recovery of the WLMs from a nonlinear strain can generate anisotropic and heterogeneous stresses that produce flow reversals and hydrodynamic attraction among colloids. Measured heterogeneities indicate a breakdown of standard continuum models for constitutive relations when the size of colloids is comparable to the length scales of the polymeric constituents and their entanglement lengths.</description>

      <title>Generalized invariants meet constitutive neural networks: A novel framework for hyperelastic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The major challenge in determining a hyperelastic model for a given material is the choice of invariants and the selection how the strain energy function depends functionally on these invariants. Here we introduce a new data-driven framework that simultaneously discovers appropriate invariants and constitutive models for isotropic incompressible hyperelastic materials. Our approach identifies both the most suitable invariants in a class of generalized invariants and the corresponding strain energy function directly from experimental observations. Unlike previous methods that rely on fixed invariant choices or sequential fitting procedures, our method integrates the discovery process into a single neural network architecture. By looking at a continuous family of possible invariants, the model can flexibly adapt to different material behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using popular benchmark datasets for rubber and brain tissue. For rubber, the method recovers a stretch-dominated formulation consistent with classical models. For brain tissue, it identifies a formulation sensitive to small stretches, capturing the nonlinear shear response characteristic of soft biological matter. Compared to traditional and neural-network-based models, our framework provides improved predictive accuracy and interpretability across a wide range of deformation states. This unified strategy offers a robust tool for automated and physically meaningful model discovery in hyperelasticity.</description>

      <title>Dynamic-Kinetic Duality of Particulate and Multiphase Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The evolution of particulate and multiphase systems can transition from dynamic regimes, governed by classical transport equations with well-defined damping coefficients, to anomalously slow relaxation described by rate equations when the system is critically close to equilibrium. This regime crossover has been both theoretically predicted and experimentally observed in diverse multiphase systems relevant to numerous technological applications, including nanoparticle adhesion at interfaces and liquid imbibition under microscale confinement, and it is attributed to the presence of small nanoscale features of physical or chemical nature at liquid-solid interfaces. This article presents a theoretical framework to more accurately predict and control, advancing or delaying, the dynamic-to-kinetic regime crossover, and highlights strategies for harnessing this phenomenon to enhance or suppress different transport processes in confined multiphase systems.</description>
