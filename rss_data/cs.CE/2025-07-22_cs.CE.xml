      <title>Self-Supervised Distillation of Legacy Rule-Based Methods for Enhanced EEG-Based Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) in intracranial Electroencephalography (iEEG) are critical biomarkers for localizing the epileptogenic zone in epilepsy treatment. However, traditional rule-based detectors for HFOs suffer from unsatisfactory precision, producing false positives that require time-consuming manual review. Supervised machine learning approaches have been used to classify the detection results, yet they typically depend on labeled datasets, which are difficult to acquire due to the need for specialized expertise. Moreover, accurate labeling of HFOs is challenging due to low inter-rater reliability and inconsistent annotation practices across institutions. The lack of a clear consensus on what constitutes a pathological HFO further challenges supervised refinement approaches. To address this, we leverage the insight that legacy detectors reliably capture clinically relevant signals despite their relatively high false positive rates. We thus propose the Self-Supervised to Label Discovery (SS2LD) framework to refine the large set of candidate events generated by legacy detectors into a precise set of pathological HFOs. SS2LD employs a variational autoencoder (VAE) for morphological pre-training to learn meaningful latent representation of the detected events. These representations are clustered to derive weak supervision for pathological events. A classifier then uses this supervision to refine detection boundaries, trained on real and VAE-augmented data. Evaluated on large multi-institutional interictal iEEG datasets, SS2LD outperforms state-of-the-art methods. SS2LD offers a scalable, label-efficient, and clinically effective strategy to identify pathological HFOs using legacy detectors.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Models in Condition and Structural Health Monitoring: Opportunities, Limitations and Future Outlook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Condition and structural health monitoring (CM/SHM) is a pivotal component of predictive maintenance (PdM) strategies across diverse industrial sectors, including mechanical rotating machinery, airplane composite wings, offshore wind turbines, and civil engineering structures. Conventional deep learning models, while effective in fault diagnosis and anomaly detection through supervised feature extraction and rule-based data augmentation, often struggle with operational variability, imbalanced or scarce fault datasets, and multimodal sensory data from complex systems. Deep generative models (DGMs) in this regard, including autoregressive models, variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, diffusion-based models, and emerging large language models, offer transformative capabilities by synthesizing high-fidelity data samples, reconstructing latent system states, and modeling complex multimodal data streams. This review systematically examines state-of-the-art DGM applications in CM/SHM systems, emphasizing their role in addressing key challenges: data imbalance and imputation, domain adaptation and generalization, multimodal data fusion, and downstream fault diagnosis and anomaly detection tasks, with rigorous comparison among signal processing, conventional machine learning or deep learning models, and DGMs. We also analyze current limitations of DGMs, including challenges of explainable and trustworthy models, computational inefficiencies for edge deployment, and the need for parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies. Future research directions can focus on zero-shot and few-shot learning, robust multimodal generalization, hybrid architectures integrating DGMs with physics knowledge, and reinforcement learning with DGMs to enhance robustness and accuracy in industrial scenarios.</description>

      <title>Configurational-force-driven adaptive refinement and coarsening in topology optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The iterative nature of topology optimization, especially in combination with nonlinear state problems, often requires the solution of thousands of linear equation systems. Furthermore, due to the pixelated design representation, the use of a fine mesh is essential to obtain geometrically well-defined structures and to accurately compute response quantities such as the von Mises stress. Therefore, the computational cost of solving a fine-mesh topology optimization problem quickly adds up. To address this challenge, we consider a multi-level adaptive refinement and coarsening strategy based on configurational forces. Configurational forces based on the Eshelby stress predict configurational changes such as crack propagation or dislocation motion. Due to a relaxation in the calculation of (Eshelby) stresses with respect to the design variables, discrete configurational forces increase not only in highly stressed regions, but also in grey transition regions (design boundaries). For this reason they are an ideal criterion for mesh adaptivity in topology optimization, especially when avoiding stress failure is a priority. By using configurational forces for refinement, we obtain a high-resolution structure where the refined mesh is present along the design boundaries as well as in stress-critical regions. At the same time, multilevel coarsening using the same criterion drastically minimizes the computational effort.</description>

      <title>DiffuMeta: Algebraic Language Models for Inverse Design of Metamaterials via Diffusion Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative machine learning models have revolutionized material discovery by capturing complex structure-property relationships, yet extending these approaches to the inverse design of three-dimensional metamaterials remains limited by computational complexity and underexplored design spaces due to the lack of expressive representations. Here, we present DiffuMeta, a generative framework integrating diffusion transformers with a novel algebraic language representation, encoding 3D geometries as mathematical sentences. This compact, unified parameterization spans diverse topologies while enabling direct application of transformers to structural design. DiffuMeta leverages diffusion models to generate novel shell structures with precisely targeted stress-strain responses under large deformations, accounting for buckling and contact while addressing the inherent one-to-many mapping by producing diverse solutions. Uniquely, our approach enables simultaneous control over multiple mechanical objectives, including linear and nonlinear responses beyond training domains. Experimental validation of fabricated structures further confirms the efficacy of our approach for accelerated design of metamaterials and structures with tailored properties.</description>

      <title>Missing Physics Discovery through Fully Differentiable Finite Element-Based Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although many problems in science and engineering are modelled by well-established PDEs, they often involve unknown or incomplete relationships, such as material constitutive laws or thermal response, that limit accuracy and generality. Existing surrogate-modelling approaches directly approximate PDE solutions but remain tied to a specific geometry, boundary conditions, and set of physical constraints. To address these limitations, we introduce a fully differentiable finite element-based machine learning (FEBML) framework that embeds trainable operators for unknown physics within a state-of-the-art, general FEM solver, enabling true end-to-end differentiation. At its core, FEBML represents each unknown operator as an encode-process-decode pipeline over finite-element degrees of freedom: field values are projected to nodal coefficients, transformed by a neural network, and then lifted back to a continuous FE function, ensuring the learned physics respects the variational structure. We demonstrate its versatility by recovering nonlinear stress-strain laws from laboratory tests, applying the learned model to a new mechanical scenario without retraining, and identifying temperature-dependent conductivity in transient heat flow.</description>

      <title>A million-scale dataset and generalizable foundation model for nanomaterial-protein interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unlocking the potential of nanomaterials in medicine and environmental science hinges on understanding their interactions with proteins, a complex decision space where AI is poised to make a transformative impact. However, progress has been hindered by limited datasets and the restricted generalizability of existing models. Here, we propose NanoPro-3M, the largest nanomaterial-protein interaction dataset to date, comprising over 3.2 million samples and 37,000 unique proteins. Leveraging this, we present NanoProFormer, a foundational model that predicts nanomaterial-protein affinities through multimodal representation learning, demonstrating strong generalization, handling missing features, and unseen nanomaterials or proteins. We show that multimodal modeling significantly outperforms single-modality approaches and identifies key determinants of corona formation. Furthermore, we demonstrate its applicability to a range of downstream tasks through zero-shot inference and fine-tuning. Together, this work establishes a solid foundation for high-performance and generalized prediction of nanomaterial-protein interaction endpoints, reducing experimental reliance and accelerating various in vitro applications.</description>

      <title>What do Large Language Models know about materials?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in the fields of mechanical engineering and materials science. As models that establish connections through the interface of language, LLMs can be applied for step-wise reasoning through the Processing-Structure-Property-Performance chain of material science and engineering. Current LLMs are built for adequately representing a dataset, which is the most part of the accessible internet. However, the internet mostly contains non-scientific content. If LLMs should be applied for engineering purposes, it is valuable to investigate models for their intrinsic knowledge -- here: the capacity to generate correct information about materials. In the current work, for the example of the Periodic Table of Elements, we highlight the role of vocabulary and tokenization for the uniqueness of material fingerprints, and the LLMs' capabilities of generating factually correct output of different state-of-the-art open models. This leads to a material knowledge benchmark for an informed choice, for which steps in the PSPP chain LLMs are applicable, and where specialized models are required.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for Bayesian Inference in Neural Networks and Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a powerful and accurate method to sample from the posterior distribution in Bayesian inference. However, HMC techniques are computationally demanding for Bayesian neural networks due to the high dimensionality of the network's parameter space and the non-convexity of their posterior distributions. Therefore, various approximation techniques, such as variational inference (VI) or stochastic gradient MCMC, are often employed to infer the posterior distribution of the network parameters. Such approximations introduce inaccuracies in the inferred distributions, resulting in unreliable uncertainty estimates. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that combines inexpensive VI and accurate HMC methods to efficiently and accurately quantify uncertainties in neural networks and neural operators. The proposed approach leverages an initial VI training on the full network. We examine the influence of individual parameters on the prediction uncertainty, which shows that a large proportion of the parameters do not contribute substantially to uncertainty in the network predictions. This information is then used to significantly reduce the dimension of the parameter space, and HMC is performed only for the subset of network parameters that strongly influence prediction uncertainties. This yields a framework for accelerating the full batch HMC for posterior inference in neural networks. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed framework on deep neural networks and operator networks, showing that inference can be performed for large networks with tens to hundreds of thousands of parameters. We show that this method can effectively learn surrogates for complex physical systems by modeling the operator that maps from upstream conditions to wall-pressure data on a cone in hypersonic flow.</description>

      <title>Transaction Profiling and Address Role Inference in Tokenized U.S. Treasuries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tokenized U.S. Treasuries have emerged as a prominent subclass of real-world assets (RWAs), offering cryptographically enforced, yield-bearing instruments collateralized by sovereign debt and deployed across multiple blockchain networks. While the market has expanded rapidly, empirical analyses of transaction-level behaviour remain limited. This paper conducts a quantitative, function-level dissection of U.S. Treasury-backed RWA tokens including BUIDL, BENJI, and USDY, across multi-chain: mostly Ethereum and Layer-2s. We analyze decoded contract calls to isolate core functional primitives such as issuance, redemption, transfer, and bridge activity, revealing segmentation in behaviour between institutional actors and retail users. To model address-level economic roles, we introduce a curvature-aware representation learning framework using Poincar\'e embeddings and liquidity-based graph features. Our method outperforms baseline models on our RWA Treasury dataset in role inference and generalizes to downstream tasks such as anomaly detection and wallet classification in broader blockchain transaction networks. These findings provide a structured understanding of functional heterogeneity and participant roles in tokenized Treasury in a transaction-level perspective, contributing new empirical evidence to the study of on-chain financialization.</description>

      <title>The Rise of AI Teammates in Software Engineering (SE) 3.0: How Autonomous Coding Agents Are Reshaping Software Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The future of software engineering--SE 3.0--is unfolding with the rise of AI teammates: autonomous, goal-driven systems collaborating with human developers. Among these, autonomous coding agents are especially transformative, now actively initiating, reviewing, and evolving code at scale. This paper introduces AIDev, the first large-scale dataset capturing how such agents operate in the wild. Spanning over 456,000 pull requests by five leading agents--OpenAI Codex, Devin, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code--across 61,000 repositories and 47,000 developers, AIDev provides an unprecedented empirical foundation for studying autonomous teammates in software development.
  Unlike prior work that has largely theorized the rise of AI-native software engineering, AIDev offers structured, open data to support research in benchmarking, agent readiness, optimization, collaboration modeling, and AI governance. The dataset includes rich metadata on PRs, authorship, review timelines, code changes, and integration outcomes--enabling exploration beyond synthetic benchmarks like SWE-bench. For instance, although agents often outperform humans in speed, their PRs are accepted less frequently, revealing a trust and utility gap. Furthermore, while agents accelerate code submission--one developer submitted as many PRs in three days as they had in three years--these are structurally simpler (via code complexity metrics).
  We envision AIDev as a living resource: extensible, analyzable, and ready for the SE and AI communities. Grounding SE 3.0 in real-world evidence, AIDev enables a new generation of research into AI-native workflows and supports building the next wave of symbiotic human-AI collaboration. The dataset is publicly available at https://github.com/SAILResearch/AI_Teammates_in_SE3.

      <title>Hyperelastic nature of the Hoek-Brown criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a nonlinear elasto-plastic model, for which a specific class of hyperbolic elasticity arises as a straight consequence of the yield criterion invariance on the plasticity level. We superimpose this nonlinear elastic (or hyperelastic) behavior with plasticity obeying the associated flow rule. Interestingly, we find that a linear yield criterion on the thermodynamical force associated with plasticity results in a quadratic yield criterion in the stress space. This suggests a specific hyperelastic connection between Mohr-Coulomb and Hoek-Brown (or alternatively between Drucker-Prager and Pan-Hudson) yield criteria. We compare the elasto-plastic responses of standard tests for the Drucker-Prager yield criterion using either linear or the suggested hyperbolic elasticity. Notably, the nonlinear case stands out due to dilatancy saturation observed during cyclic loading in the triaxial compression test. We conclude this study with structural finite element simulations that clearly demonstrate the numerical applicability of the proposed model.</description>
