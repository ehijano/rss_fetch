      <title>DISC: Dataset for Analyzing Driving Styles In Simulated Crashes for Mixed Autonomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Handling pre-crash scenarios is still a major challenge for self-driving cars due to limited practical data and human-driving behavior datasets. We introduce DISC (Driving Styles In Simulated Crashes), one of the first datasets designed to capture various driving styles and behaviors in pre-crash scenarios for mixed autonomy analysis. DISC includes over 8 classes of driving styles/behaviors from hundreds of drivers navigating a simulated vehicle through a virtual city, encountering rare-event traffic scenarios. This dataset enables the classification of pre-crash human driving behaviors in unsafe conditions, supporting individualized trajectory prediction based on observed driving patterns. By utilizing a custom-designed VR-based in-house driving simulator, TRAVERSE, data was collected through a driver-centric study involving human drivers encountering twelve simulated accident scenarios. This dataset fills a critical gap in human-centric driving data for rare events involving interactions with autonomous vehicles. It enables autonomous systems to better react to human drivers and optimize trajectory prediction in mixed autonomy environments involving both human-driven and self-driving cars. In addition, individual driving behaviors are classified through a set of standardized questionnaires, carefully designed to identify and categorize driving behavior traits. We correlate data features with driving behaviors, showing that the simulated environment reflects real-world driving styles. DISC is the first dataset to capture how various driving styles respond to accident scenarios, offering significant potential to enhance autonomous vehicle safety and driving behavior analysis in mixed autonomy environments.</description>

      <title>Robot localization aided by quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Localization is a critical aspect of mobile robotics, enabling robots to navigate their environment efficiently and avoid obstacles. Current probabilistic localization methods, such as the Adaptive-Monte Carlo localization (AMCL) algorithm, are computationally intensive and may struggle with large maps or high-resolution sensor data. This paper explores the application of quantum computing in robotics, focusing on the use of Grover's search algorithm to improve the efficiency of localization in mobile robots. We propose a novel approach to utilize Grover's algorithm in a 2D map, enabling faster and more efficient localization. Despite the limitations of current physical quantum computers, our experimental results demonstrate a significant speedup over classical methods, highlighting the potential of quantum computing to improve robotic localization. This work bridges the gap between quantum computing and robotics, providing a practical solution for robotic localization and paving the way for future research in quantum robotics.</description>

      <title>Mobile Robot Navigation Using Hand-Drawn Maps: A Vision Language Model Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hand-drawn maps can be used to convey navigation instructions between humans and robots in a natural and efficient manner. However, these maps can often contain inaccuracies such as scale distortions and missing landmarks which present challenges for mobile robot navigation. This paper introduces a novel Hand-drawn Map Navigation (HAM-Nav) architecture that leverages pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) for robot navigation across diverse environments, hand-drawing styles, and robot embodiments, even in the presence of map inaccuracies. HAM-Nav integrates a unique Selective Visual Association Prompting approach for topological map-based position estimation and navigation planning as well as a Predictive Navigation Plan Parser to infer missing landmarks. Extensive experiments were conducted in photorealistic simulated environments, using both wheeled and legged robots, demonstrating the effectiveness of HAM-Nav in terms of navigation success rates and Success weighted by Path Length. Furthermore, a user study in real-world environments highlighted the practical utility of hand-drawn maps for robot navigation as well as successful navigation outcomes.</description>

      <title>A Direct Semi-Exhaustive Search Method for Robust, Partial-to-Full Point Cloud Registration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point cloud registration refers to the problem of finding the rigid transformation that aligns two given point clouds, and is crucial for many applications in robotics and computer vision. The main insight of this paper is that we can directly optimize the point cloud registration problem without correspondences by utilizing an algorithmically simple, yet computationally complex, semi-exhaustive search approach that is very well-suited for parallelization on modern GPUs. Our proposed algorithm, Direct Semi-Exhaustive Search (DSES), iterates over potential rotation matrices and efficiently computes the inlier-maximizing translation associated with each rotation. It then computes the optimal rigid transformation based on any desired distance metric by directly computing the error associated with each transformation candidate $\{R, t\}$. By leveraging the parallelism of modern GPUs, DSES outperforms state-of-the-art methods for partial-to-full point cloud registration on the simulated ModelNet40 benchmark and demonstrates high performance and robustness for pose estimation on a real-world robotics problem (https://youtu.be/q0q2-s2KSuA).</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Split Koopman Operators for Data-efficient Soft Robotic Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopman operator theory provides a powerful data-driven technique for modeling nonlinear dynamical systems in a linear framework, in comparison to computationally expensive and highly nonlinear physics-based simulations. However, Koopman operator-based models for soft robots are very high dimensional and require considerable amounts of data to properly resolve. Inspired by physics-informed techniques from machine learning, we present a novel physics-informed Koopman operator identification method that improves simulation accuracy for small dataset sizes. Through Strang splitting, the method takes advantage of both continuous and discrete Koopman operator approximation to obtain information both from trajectory and phase space data. The method is validated on a tendon-driven soft robotic arm, showing orders of magnitude improvement over standard methods in terms of the shape error. We envision this method can significantly reduce the data requirement of Koopman operators for systems with partially known physical models, and thus reduce the cost of obtaining data.</description>

      <title>Vision-Based Fuzzy Control System for Smart Walkers: Enhancing Usability for Stroke Survivors with Unilateral Upper Limb Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobility impairments, particularly those caused by stroke-induced hemiparesis, significantly impact independence and quality of life. Current smart walker controllers operate by using input forces from the user to control linear motion and input torques to dictate rotational movement; however, because they predominantly rely on user-applied torque exerted on the device handle as an indicator of user intent to turn, they fail to adequately accommodate users with unilateral upper limb impairments. This leads to increased physical strain and cognitive load. This paper introduces a novel smart walker equipped with a fuzzy control algorithm that leverages shoulder abduction angles to intuitively interpret user intentions using just one functional hand. By integrating a force sensor and stereo camera, the system enhances walker responsiveness and usability. Experimental evaluations with five participants showed that the fuzzy controller outperformed the traditional admittance controller, reducing wrist torque while using the right hand to operate the walker by 12.65% for left turns, 80.36% for straight paths, and 81.16% for right turns. Additionally, average user comfort ratings on a Likert scale increased from 1 to 4. Results confirmed a strong correlation between shoulder abduction angles and directional intent, with users reporting decreased effort and enhanced ease of use. This study contributes to assistive robotics by providing an adaptable control mechanism for smart walkers, suggesting a pathway towards enhancing mobility and independence for individuals with mobility impairments.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Estimation of Manipulation Skill and Hand Grasp Force from Forearm Ultrasound Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of human hand configuration and the forces they exert is critical for effective teleoperation and skill transfer in robotic manipulation. A deeper understanding of human interactions with objects can further enhance teleoperation performance. To address this need, researchers have explored methods to capture and translate human manipulation skills and applied forces to robotic systems. Among these, biosignal-based approaches, particularly those using forearm ultrasound data, have shown significant potential for estimating hand movements and finger forces. In this study, we present a method for simultaneously estimating manipulation skills and applied hand force using forearm ultrasound data. Data collected from seven participants were used to train deep learning models for classifying manipulation skills and estimating grasp force. Our models achieved an average classification accuracy of 94.87 percent plus or minus 10.16 percent for manipulation skills and an average root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.51 plus or minus 0.19 Newtons for force estimation, as evaluated using five-fold cross-validation. These results highlight the effectiveness of forearm ultrasound in advancing human-machine interfacing and robotic teleoperation for complex manipulation tasks. This work enables new and effective possibilities for human-robot skill transfer and tele-manipulation, bridging the gap between human dexterity and robotic control.</description>

      <title>FlexCloud: Direct, Modular Georeferencing and Drift-Correction of Point Cloud Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current software stacks for real-world applications of autonomous driving leverage map information to ensure reliable localization, path planning, and motion prediction. An important field of research is the generation of point cloud maps, referring to the topic of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). As most recent developments do not include global position data, the resulting point cloud maps suffer from internal distortion and missing georeferencing, preventing their use for map-based localization approaches. Therefore, we propose FlexCloud for an automatic georeferencing of point cloud maps created from SLAM. Our approach is designed to work modularly with different SLAM methods, utilizing only the generated local point cloud map and its odometry. Using the corresponding GNSS positions enables direct georeferencing without additional control points. By leveraging a 3D rubber-sheet transformation, we can correct distortions within the map caused by long-term drift while maintaining its structure. Our approach enables the creation of consistent, globally referenced point cloud maps from data collected by a mobile mapping system (MMS). The source code of our work is available at https://github.com/TUMFTM/FlexCloud.</description>

      <title>Dexterous Cable Manipulation: Taxonomy, Multi-Fingered Hand Design, and Long-Horizon Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing research that addressed cable manipulation relied on two-fingered grippers, which make it difficult to perform similar cable manipulation tasks that humans perform. However, unlike dexterous manipulation of rigid objects, the development of dexterous cable manipulation skills in robotics remains underexplored due to the unique challenges posed by a cable's deformability and inherent uncertainty. In addition, using a dexterous hand introduces specific difficulties in tasks, such as cable grasping, pulling, and in-hand bending, for which no dedicated task definitions, benchmarks, or evaluation metrics exist. Furthermore, we observed that most existing dexterous hands are designed with structures identical to humans', typically featuring only one thumb, which often limits their effectiveness during dexterous cable manipulation. Lastly, existing non-task-specific methods did not have enough generalization ability to solve these cable manipulation tasks or are unsuitable due to the designed hardware. We have three contributions in real-world dexterous cable manipulation in the following steps: (1) We first defined and organized a set of dexterous cable manipulation tasks into a comprehensive taxonomy, covering most short-horizon action primitives and long-horizon tasks for one-handed cable manipulation. This taxonomy revealed that coordination between the thumb and the index finger is critical for cable manipulation, which decomposes long-horizon tasks into simpler primitives. (2) We designed a novel five-fingered hand with 25 degrees of freedom (DoF), featuring two symmetric thumb-index configurations and a rotatable joint on each fingertip, which enables dexterous cable manipulation. (3) We developed a demonstration collection pipeline for this non-anthropomorphic hand, which is difficult to operate by previous motion capture methods.</description>

Abstract: This article presents applied research on line balancing within the modern garment industry, focusing on the significant impact of intelligent hanger systems and hanger lines on the stitching process, by Lean Methodology for garment modernization. It explores the application of line balancing in the modern garment industry, focusing on the significant impact of intelligent hanger systems and hanger lines on the stitching process. It aligns with Lean Methodology principles for garment modernization. Without the implementation of line balancing technology, the garment manufacturing process using hanger systems cannot improve output rates. The case study demonstrates that implementing intelligent line balancing in a straightforward practical setup facilitates lean practices combined with a digitalization system and automaton. This approach illustrates how to enhance output and reduce accumulated work in progress.</description>

      <title>VertiFormer: A Data-Efficient Multi-Task Transformer for Off-Road Robot Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sophisticated learning architectures, e.g., Transformers, present a unique opportunity for robots to understand complex vehicle-terrain kinodynamic interactions for off-road mobility. While internet-scale data are available for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV) tasks to train Transformers, real-world mobility data are difficult to acquire with physical robots navigating off-road terrain. Furthermore, training techniques specifically designed to process text and image data in NLP and CV may not apply to robot mobility. In this paper, we propose VertiFormer, a novel data-efficient multi-task Transformer model trained with only one hour of data to address such challenges of applying Transformer architectures for robot mobility on extremely rugged, vertically challenging, off-road terrain. Specifically, VertiFormer employs a new learnable masked modeling and next token prediction paradigm to predict the next pose, action, and terrain patch to enable a variety of off-road mobility tasks simultaneously, e.g., forward and inverse kinodynamics modeling. The non-autoregressive design mitigates computational bottlenecks and error propagation associated with autoregressive models. VertiFormer's unified modality representation also enhances learning of diverse temporal mappings and state representations, which, combined with multiple objective functions, further improves model generalization. Our experiments offer insights into effectively utilizing Transformers for off-road robot mobility with limited data and demonstrate our efficiently trained Transformer can facilitate multiple off-road mobility tasks onboard a physical mobile robot.</description>

      <title>DeepUKF-VIN: Adaptively-tuned Deep Unscented Kalman Filter for 3D Visual-Inertial Navigation based on IMU-Vision-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of estimating the orientation, position, and velocity of a vehicle operating in three-dimensional (3D) space with six degrees of freedom (6-DoF). A Deep Learning-based Adaptation Mechanism (DLAM) is proposed to adaptively tune the noise covariance matrices of Kalman-type filters for the Visual-Inertial Navigation (VIN) problem, leveraging IMU-Vision-Net. Subsequently, an adaptively tuned Deep Learning Unscented Kalman Filter for 3D VIN (DeepUKF-VIN) is introduced to utilize the proposed DLAM, thereby robustly estimating key navigation components, including orientation, position, and linear velocity. The proposed DeepUKF-VIN integrates data from onboard sensors, specifically an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and visual feature points extracted from a camera, and is applicable for GPS-denied navigation. Its quaternion-based design effectively captures navigation nonlinearities and avoids the singularities commonly encountered with Euler-angle-based filters. Implemented in discrete space, the DeepUKF-VIN facilitates practical filter deployment. The filter's performance is evaluated using real-world data collected from an IMU and a stereo camera at low sampling rates. The results demonstrate filter stability and rapid attenuation of estimation errors, highlighting its high estimation accuracy. Furthermore, comparative testing against the standard Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) in two scenarios consistently shows superior performance across all navigation components, thereby validating the efficacy and robustness of the proposed DeepUKF-VIN.

      <title>Trajectory Planning and Control for Differentially Flat Fixed-Wing Aerial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient real-time trajectory planning and control for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles is challenging due to their non-holonomic nature, complex dynamics, and the additional uncertainties introduced by unknown aerodynamic effects. In this paper, we present a fast and efficient real-time trajectory planning and control approach for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles, leveraging the differential flatness property of fixed-wing aircraft in coordinated flight conditions to generate dynamically feasible trajectories. The approach provides the ability to continuously replan trajectories, which we show is useful to dynamically account for the curvature constraint as the aircraft advances along its path. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate our approach, showcasing its effectiveness in generating trajectories even in challenging conditions for small FW such as wind disturbances.</description>

      <title>Strengthening Generative Robot Policies through Predictive World Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present generative predictive control (GPC), a learning control framework that (i) clones a generative diffusion-based policy from expert demonstrations, (ii) trains a predictive action-conditioned world model from both expert demonstrations and random explorations, and (iii) synthesizes an online planner that ranks and optimizes the action proposals from (i) by looking ahead into the future using the world model from (ii). Crucially, we show that conditional video diffusion allows learning (near) physics-accurate visual world models and enable robust visual foresight. Focusing on planar pushing with rich contact and collision, we show GPC dominates behavior cloning across state-based and vision-based, simulated and real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>EKF-Based Radar-Inertial Odometry with Online Temporal Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate time synchronization between heterogeneous sensors is crucial for ensuring robust state estimation in multi-sensor fusion systems. Sensor delays often cause discrepancies between the actual time when the event was captured and the time of sensor measurement, leading to temporal misalignment (time offset) between sensor measurement streams. In this paper, we propose an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based radar-inertial odometry (RIO) framework that estimates the time offset online. The radar ego-velocity measurement model, estimated from a single radar scan, is formulated to include the time offset for the update. By leveraging temporal calibration, the proposed RIO enables accurate propagation and measurement updates based on a common time stream. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrated the accurate time offset estimation of the proposed method and its impact on RIO performance, validating the importance of sensor time synchronization. Our implementation of the EKF-RIO with online temporal calibration is available at https://github.com/spearwin/EKF-RIO-TC.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Discrete Differential Geometry: A Virtual Playground for the Bilayer Soft Robotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robots have garnered significant attention due to their promising applications across various domains. A hallmark of these systems is their bilayer structure, where strain mismatch caused by differential expansion between layers induces complex deformations. Despite progress in theoretical modeling and numerical simulation, accurately capturing their dynamic behavior, especially during environmental interactions, remains challenging. This study presents a novel simulation environment based on the Discrete Elastic Rod (DER) model to address the challenge. By leveraging discrete differential geometry (DDG), the DER approach offers superior convergence compared to conventional methods like Finite Element Method (FEM), particularly in handling contact interactions -- an essential aspect of soft robot dynamics in real-world scenarios. Our simulation framework incorporates key features of bilayer structures, including stretching, bending, twisting, and inter-layer coupling. This enables the exploration of a wide range of dynamic behaviors for bilayer soft robots, such as gripping, crawling, jumping, and swimming. The insights gained from this work provide a robust foundation for the design and control of advanced bilayer soft robotic systems.</description>

      <title>An Event-Based Perception Pipeline for a Table Tennis Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Table tennis robots gained traction over the last years and have become a popular research challenge for control and perception algorithms. Fast and accurate ball detection is crucial for enabling a robotic arm to rally the ball back successfully. So far, most table tennis robots use conventional, frame-based cameras for the perception pipeline. However, frame-based cameras suffer from motion blur if the frame rate is not high enough for fast-moving objects. Event-based cameras, on the other hand, do not have this drawback since pixels report changes in intensity asynchronously and independently, leading to an event stream with a temporal resolution on the order of us. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first real-time perception pipeline for a table tennis robot that uses only event-based cameras. We show that compared to a frame-based pipeline, event-based perception pipelines have an update rate which is an order of magnitude higher. This is beneficial for the estimation and prediction of the ball's position, velocity, and spin, resulting in lower mean errors and uncertainties. These improvements are an advantage for the robot control, which has to be fast, given the short time a table tennis ball is flying until the robot has to hit back.</description>

      <title>CAIMAN: Causal Action Influence Detection for Sample Efficient Loco-manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling legged robots to perform non-prehensile loco-manipulation with large and heavy objects is crucial for enhancing their versatility. However, this is a challenging task, often requiring sophisticated planning strategies or extensive task-specific reward shaping, especially in unstructured scenarios with obstacles. In this work, we present CAIMAN, a novel framework for learning loco-manipulation that relies solely on sparse task rewards. We leverage causal action influence to detect states where the robot is in control over other entities in the environment, and use this measure as an intrinsically motivated objective to enable sample-efficient learning. We employ a hierarchical control strategy, combining a low-level locomotion policy with a high-level policy that prioritizes task-relevant velocity commands. Through simulated and real-world experiments, including object manipulation with obstacles, we demonstrate the framework's superior sample efficiency, adaptability to diverse environments, and successful transfer to hardware without fine-tuning. The proposed approach paves the way for scalable, robust, and autonomous loco-manipulation in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>ToddlerBot: Open-Source ML-Compatible Humanoid Platform for Loco-Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning-based robotics research driven by data demands a new approach to robot hardware design-one that serves as both a platform for policy execution and a tool for embodied data collection to train policies. We introduce ToddlerBot, a low-cost, open-source humanoid robot platform designed for scalable policy learning and research in robotics and AI. ToddlerBot enables seamless acquisition of high-quality simulation and real-world data. The plug-and-play zero-point calibration and transferable motor system identification ensure a high-fidelity digital twin, enabling zero-shot policy transfer from simulation to the real world. A user-friendly teleoperation interface facilitates streamlined real-world data collection for learning motor skills from human demonstrations. Utilizing its data collection ability and anthropomorphic design, ToddlerBot is an ideal platform to perform whole-body loco-manipulation. Additionally, ToddlerBot's compact size (0.56m, 3.4kg) ensures safe operation in real-world environments. Reproducibility is achieved with an entirely 3D-printed, open-source design and commercially available components, keeping the total cost under 6,000 USD. Comprehensive documentation allows assembly and maintenance with basic technical expertise, as validated by a successful independent replication of the system. We demonstrate ToddlerBot's capabilities through arm span, payload, endurance tests, loco-manipulation tasks, and a collaborative long-horizon scenario where two robots tidy a toy session together. By advancing ML-compatibility, capability, and reproducibility, ToddlerBot provides a robust platform for scalable learning and dynamic policy execution in robotics research.</description>

      <title>Structured Pneumatic Fingerpads for Actively Tunable Grip Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grip surfaces with tunable friction can actively modify contact conditions, enabling transitions between higher- and lower-friction states for grasp adjustment. Friction can be increased to grip securely and then decreased to gently release (e.g., for handovers) or manipulate in-hand. Recent friction-tuning surface designs using soft pneumatic chambers show good control over grip friction; however, most require complex fabrication processes and/or custom gripper hardware. We present a practical structured fingerpad design for friction tuning that uses less than \$1 USD of materials, takes only seconds to repair, and is easily adapted to existing grippers. Our design uses surface morphology changes to tune friction. The fingerpad is actuated by pressurizing its internal chambers, thereby deflecting its flexible grip surface out from or into these chambers. We characterize the friction-tuning capabilities of our design by measuring the shear force required to pull an object from a gripper equipped with two independently actuated fingerpads. Our results show that varying actuation pressure and timing changes the magnitude of friction forces on a gripped object by up to a factor of 2.8. We demonstrate additional features including macro-scale interlocking behaviour and pressure-based object detection.</description>

      <title>VL-Nav: Real-time Vision-Language Navigation with Spatial Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language navigation in unknown environments is crucial for mobile robots. In scenarios such as household assistance and rescue, mobile robots need to understand a human command, such as "find a person wearing black". We present a novel vision-language navigation (VL-Nav) system that integrates efficient spatial reasoning on low-power robots. Unlike prior methods that rely on a single image-level feature similarity to guide a robot, we introduce the heuristic-vision-language (HVL) spatial reasoning for goal point selection. It combines pixel-wise vision-language features and heuristic exploration to enable efficient navigation to human-instructed instances in various environments robustly. We deploy VL-Nav on a four-wheel mobile robot and conduct comprehensive navigation tasks in various environments of different scales and semantic complexities, indoors and outdoors. Remarkably, VL-Nav operates at a real-time frequency of 30 Hz with a Jetson Orin NX, highlighting its ability to conduct efficient vision-language navigation. Experimental results show that VL-Nav achieves an overall success rate of 86.3%, outperforming previous methods by 44.15%.</description>

      <title>Generalizing Safety Beyond Collision-Avoidance via Latent-Space Reachability Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability is a rigorous mathematical framework that enables robots to simultaneously detect unsafe states and generate actions that prevent future failures. While in theory, HJ reachability can synthesize safe controllers for nonlinear systems and nonconvex constraints, in practice, it has been limited to hand-engineered collision-avoidance constraints modeled via low-dimensional state-space representations and first-principles dynamics. In this work, our goal is to generalize safe robot controllers to prevent failures that are hard -- if not impossible -- to write down by hand, but can be intuitively identified from high-dimensional observations: for example, spilling the contents of a bag. We propose Latent Safety Filters, a latent-space generalization of HJ reachability that tractably operates directly on raw observation data (e.g., RGB images) by performing safety analysis in the latent embedding space of a generative world model. This transforms nuanced constraint specification to a classification problem in latent space and enables reasoning about dynamical consequences that are hard to simulate. In simulation and hardware experiments, we use Latent Safety Filters to safeguard arbitrary policies (from generative policies to direct teleoperation) from complex safety hazards, like preventing a Franka Research 3 manipulator from spilling the contents of a bag or toppling cluttered objects.</description>

      <title>The Beatbots: A Musician-Informed Multi-Robot Percussion Quartet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artistic creation is often seen as a uniquely human endeavor, yet robots bring distinct advantages to music-making, such as precise tempo control, unpredictable rhythmic complexities, and the ability to coordinate intricate human and robot performances. While many robotic music systems aim to mimic human musicianship, our work emphasizes the unique strengths of robots, resulting in a novel multi-robot performance instrument called the Beatbots, capable of producing music that is challenging for humans to replicate using current methods. The Beatbots were designed using an ``informed prototyping'' process, incorporating feedback from three musicians throughout development. We evaluated the Beatbots through a live public performance, surveying participants (N=28) to understand how they perceived and interacted with the robotic performance. Results show that participants valued the playfulness of the experience, the aesthetics of the robot system, and the unconventional robot-generated music. Expert musicians and non-expert roboticists demonstrated especially positive mindset shifts during the performance, although participants across all demographics had favorable responses. We propose design principles to guide the development of future robotic music systems and identify key robotic music affordances that our musician consultants considered particularly important for robotic music performance.</description>

      <title>Robust Trajectory Generation and Control for Quadrotor Motion Planning with Field-of-View Control Barrier Certification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many approaches to multi-robot coordination are susceptible to failure due to communication loss and uncertainty in estimation. We present a real-time communication-free distributed algorithm for navigating robots to their desired goals certified by control barrier functions, that model and control the onboard sensing behavior to keep neighbors in the limited field of view for position estimation. The approach is robust to temporary tracking loss and directly synthesizes control in real time to stabilize visual contact through control Lyapunov-barrier functions. The main contributions of this paper are a continuous-time robust trajectory generation and control method certified by control barrier functions for distributed multi-robot systems and a discrete optimization procedure, namely, MPC-CBF, to approximate the certified controller. In addition, we propose a linear surrogate of high-order control barrier function constraints and use sequential quadratic programming to solve MPC-CBF efficiently. We demonstrate results in simulation with 10 robots and physical experiments with 2 custom-built UAVs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first of its kind to generate a robust continuous-time trajectory and controller concurrently, certified by control barrier functions utilizing piecewise splines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling spacecraft near asteroids in deep space comes with many challenges. The delays involved necessitate heavy usage of limited onboard computation resources while fuel efficiency remains a priority to support the long loiter times needed for gathering data. Additionally, the difficulty of state determination due to the lack of traditional reference systems requires a guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) pipeline that ideally is both computationally and fuel-efficient, and that incorporates a robust state determination system. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end algorithm utilizing neural networks to generate near-optimal control commands from raw sensor data, as well as a hybrid model predictive control (MPC) guided imitation learning controller delivering improvements in computational efficiency over a traditional MPC controller.</description>

      <title>UASTHN: Uncertainty-Aware Deep Homography Estimation for UAV Satellite-Thermal Geo-localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geo-localization is an essential component of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) navigation systems to ensure precise absolute self-localization in outdoor environments. To address the challenges of GPS signal interruptions or low illumination, Thermal Geo-localization (TG) employs aerial thermal imagery to align with reference satellite maps to accurately determine the UAV's location. However, existing TG methods lack uncertainty measurement in their outputs, compromising system robustness in the presence of textureless or corrupted thermal images, self-similar or outdated satellite maps, geometric noises, or thermal images exceeding satellite maps. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents \textit{UASTHN}, a novel approach for Uncertainty Estimation (UE) in Deep Homography Estimation (DHE) tasks for TG applications. Specifically, we introduce a novel Crop-based Test-Time Augmentation (CropTTA) strategy, which leverages the homography consensus of cropped image views to effectively measure data uncertainty. This approach is complemented by Deep Ensembles (DE) employed for model uncertainty, offering comparable performance with improved efficiency and seamless integration with any DHE model. Extensive experiments across multiple DHE models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of CropTTA in TG applications. Analysis of detected failure cases underscores the improved reliability of CropTTA under challenging conditions. Finally, we demonstrate the capability of combining CropTTA and DE for a comprehensive assessment of both data and model uncertainty. Our research provides profound insights into the broader intersection of localization and uncertainty estimation. The code and data is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Multi-Object Active Search and Tracking by Multiple Agents in Untrusted, Dynamically Changing Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of both actively searching and tracking multiple unknown dynamic objects in a known environment with multiple cooperative autonomous agents with partial observability. The tracking of a target ends when the uncertainty is below a threshold. Current methods typically assume homogeneous agents without access to external information and utilize short-horizon target predictive models. Such assumptions limit real-world applications. We propose a fully integrated pipeline where the main contributions are: (1) a time-varying weighted belief representation capable of handling knowledge that changes over time, which includes external reports of varying levels of trustworthiness in addition to the agents; (2) the integration of a Long Short Term Memory-based trajectory prediction within the optimization framework for long-horizon decision-making, which reasons in time-configuration space, thus increasing responsiveness; and (3) a comprehensive system that accounts for multiple agents and enables information-driven optimization. When communication is available, our strategy consolidates exploration results collected asynchronously by agents and external sources into a headquarters, who can allocate each agent to maximize the overall team's utility, using all available information. We tested our approach extensively in simulations against baselines, and in robustness and ablation studies. In addition, we performed experiments in a 3D physics based engine robot simulator to test the applicability in the real world, as well as with real-world trajectories obtained from an oceanography computational fluid dynamics simulator. Results show the effectiveness of our method, which achieves mission completion times 1.3 to 3.2 times faster in finding all targets, even under the most challenging scenarios where the number of targets is 5 times greater than that of the agents.</description>

      <title>Scalable, Training-Free Visual Language Robotics: A Modular Multi-Model Framework for Consumer-Grade GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of language instructions with robotic control, particularly through Vision Language Action (VLA) models, has shown significant potential. However, these systems are often hindered by high computational costs, the need for extensive retraining, and limited scalability, making them less accessible for widespread use.
  In this paper, we introduce SVLR (Scalable Visual Language Robotics), an open-source, modular framework that operates without the need for retraining, providing a scalable solution for robotic control. SVLR leverages a combination of lightweight, open-source AI models including the Vision-Language Model (VLM) Mini-InternVL, zero-shot image segmentation model CLIPSeg, Large Language Model Phi-3, and sentence similarity model all-MiniLM to process visual and language inputs. These models work together to identify objects in an unknown environment, use them as parameters for task execution, and generate a sequence of actions in response to natural language instructions. A key strength of SVLR is its scalability. The framework allows for easy integration of new robotic tasks and robots by simply adding text descriptions and task definitions, without the need for retraining. This modularity ensures that SVLR can continuously adapt to the latest advancements in AI technologies and support a wide range of robots and tasks.
  SVLR operates effectively on an NVIDIA RTX 2070 (mobile) GPU, demonstrating promising performance in executing pick-and-place tasks. While these initial results are encouraging, further evaluation across a broader set of tasks and comparisons with existing VLA models are needed to assess SVLR's generalization capabilities and performance in more complex scenarios.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision sensors are extensively used for localizing a robot's pose, particularly in environments where global localization tools such as GPS or motion capture systems are unavailable. In many visual navigation systems, localization is achieved by detecting and tracking visual features or landmarks, which provide information about the sensor's relative pose. For reliable feature tracking and accurate pose estimation, it is crucial to maintain visibility of a sufficient number of features. This requirement can sometimes conflict with the robot's overall task objective. In this paper, we approach it as a constrained control problem. By leveraging the invariance properties of visibility constraints within the robot's kinematic model, we propose a real-time safety filter based on quadratic programming. This filter takes a reference velocity command as input and produces a modified velocity that minimally deviates from the reference while ensuring the information score from the currently visible features remains above a user-specified threshold. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed safety filter preserves the invariance condition and ensures the visibility of more features than the required minimum. We also validated its real-world performance by integrating it into a visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm, where it maintained high estimation quality in challenging environments, outperforming a simple tracking controller.</description>

      <title>ASAP: Aligning Simulation and Real-World Physics for Learning Agile Humanoid Whole-Body Skills</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Humanoid robots hold the potential for unparalleled versatility in performing human-like, whole-body skills. However, achieving agile and coordinated whole-body motions remains a significant challenge due to the dynamics mismatch between simulation and the real world. Existing approaches, such as system identification (SysID) and domain randomization (DR) methods, often rely on labor-intensive parameter tuning or result in overly conservative policies that sacrifice agility. In this paper, we present ASAP (Aligning Simulation and Real-World Physics), a two-stage framework designed to tackle the dynamics mismatch and enable agile humanoid whole-body skills. In the first stage, we pre-train motion tracking policies in simulation using retargeted human motion data. In the second stage, we deploy the policies in the real world and collect real-world data to train a delta (residual) action model that compensates for the dynamics mismatch. Then, ASAP fine-tunes pre-trained policies with the delta action model integrated into the simulator to align effectively with real-world dynamics. We evaluate ASAP across three transfer scenarios: IsaacGym to IsaacSim, IsaacGym to Genesis, and IsaacGym to the real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Our approach significantly improves agility and whole-body coordination across various dynamic motions, reducing tracking error compared to SysID, DR, and delta dynamics learning baselines. ASAP enables highly agile motions that were previously difficult to achieve, demonstrating the potential of delta action learning in bridging simulation and real-world dynamics. These results suggest a promising sim-to-real direction for developing more expressive and agile humanoids.</description>

      <title>ConditionNET: Learning Preconditions and Effects for Execution Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of robots into everyday scenarios necessitates algorithms capable of monitoring the execution of tasks. In this paper, we propose ConditionNET, an approach for learning the preconditions and effects of actions in a fully data-driven manner. We develop an efficient vision-language model and introduce additional optimization objectives during training to optimize for consistent feature representations. ConditionNET explicitly models the dependencies between actions, preconditions, and effects, leading to improved performance. We evaluate our model on two robotic datasets, one of which we collected for this paper, containing 406 successful and 138 failed teleoperated demonstrations of a Franka Emika Panda robot performing tasks like pouring and cleaning the counter. We show in our experiments that ConditionNET outperforms all baselines on both anomaly detection and phase prediction tasks. Furthermore, we implement an action monitoring system on a real robot to demonstrate the practical applicability of the learned preconditions and effects. Our results highlight the potential of ConditionNET for enhancing the reliability and adaptability of robots in real-world environments. The data is available on the project website: https://dsliwowski1.github.io/ConditionNET_page.</description>

      <title>Towards Agile Swarming in Real World: Onboard Relative Localization with Fast Tracking of Active Blinking Markers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel onboard tracking approach enabling vision-based relative localization and communication using Active blinking Marker Tracking (AMT) is introduced in this article. Active blinking markers on multi-robot team members improve the robustness of relative localization for aerial vehicles in tightly coupled swarms during real-world deployments, while also serving as a resilient communication channel. Traditional tracking algorithms struggle to track fast moving blinking markers due to their intermittent appearance in the camera frames. AMT addresses this by using weighted polynomial regression to predict the future appearance of active blinking markers while accounting for uncertainty in the prediction. In outdoor experiments, the AMT approach outperformed state-of-the-art methods in tracking density, accuracy, and complexity. The experimental validation of this novel tracking approach for relative localization involved testing motion patterns motivated by our research on agile multi-robot deployment.</description>

      <title>Multi-objective Evolution of Drone Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of multicopter drones has remained almost the same since its inception. While conventional designs, such as the quadcopter, work well in many cases, they may not be optimal in specific environments or missions. This paper revisits rotary drone design by exploring which body morphologies are optimal for different objectives and constraints. Specifically, an evolutionary algorithm is used to produce optimal drone morphologies for three objectives: (1) high thrust-to-weight ratio, (2) high maneuverability, and (3) small size. To generate a range of optimal drones with performance trade-offs between them, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II, or NSGA-II is used. A randomly sampled population of 600 is evolved over 2000 generations. The NSGA-II algorithm evolved drone bodies that outperform a standard 5-inch 220 mm wheelbase quadcopter in at least one of the three objectives. The three extrema in the Pareto front show improvement of 487.8%, 23.5% and 4.8% in maneuverability, thrust-to-weight ratio and size, respectively. The improvement in maneuverability can be attributed to the tilt angles of the propellers, while the increase in thrust-to-weight ratio is primarily due to the higher number of propellers. The quadcopter is located on the Pareto front for the three objectives. However, our results also show that other designs can be better depending on the objectives.</description>

      <title>Solgenia -- A Test Vessel Toward Energy-Efficient Autonomous Water Taxi Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous surface vessels are a promising building block of the future's transport sector and are investigated by research groups worldwide. This paper presents a comprehensive and systematic overview of the autonomous research vessel Solgenia including the latest investigations and recently presented methods that contributed to the fields of autonomous systems, applied numerical optimization, nonlinear model predictive control, multi-extended-object-tracking, computer vision, and collision avoidance. These are considered to be the main components of autonomous water taxi applications. Autonomous water taxis have the potential to transform the traffic in cities close to the water into a more efficient, sustainable, and flexible future state. Regarding this transformation, the test platform Solgenia offers an opportunity to gain new insights by investigating novel methods in real-world experiments. An established test platform will strongly reduce the effort required for real-world experiments in the future.</description>

      <title>Provable Ordering and Continuity in Vision-Language Pretraining for Generalizable Embodied Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pre-training vision-language representations on human action videos has emerged as a promising approach to reduce reliance on large-scale expert demonstrations for training embodied agents. However, prior methods often employ time contrastive learning based on goal-reaching heuristics, progressively aligning language instructions from the initial to the final frame. This overemphasis on future frames can result in erroneous vision-language associations, as actions may terminate early or include irrelevant moments in the end. To address this issue, we propose Action Temporal Coherence Learning (AcTOL) to learn ordered and continuous vision-language representations without rigid goal-based constraint. AcTOL treats a video as a continuous trajectory where it (1) contrasts semantic differences between frames to reflect their natural ordering, and (2) imposes a local Brownian bridge constraint to ensure smooth transitions across intermediate frames. Extensive imitation learning experiments across varying numbers of demonstrations show that the pretrained features significantly enhance downstream manipulation tasks by up to 49% with high robustness to different linguistic styles of instructions, offering a viable pathway toward generalized embodied agents. The source code is included in the supplementary material for reference.</description>

      <title>Soft Robot Localization Using Distributed Miniaturized Time-of-Flight Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thanks to their compliance and adaptability, soft robots can be deployed to perform tasks in constrained or complex environments. In these scenarios, spatial awareness of the surroundings and the ability to localize the robot within the environment represent key aspects. While state-of-the-art localization techniques are well-explored in autonomous vehicles and walking robots, they rely on data retrieved with lidar or depth sensors which are bulky and thus difficult to integrate into small soft robots. Recent developments in miniaturized Time of Flight (ToF) sensors show promise as a small and lightweight alternative to bulky sensors. These sensors can be potentially distributed on the soft robot body, providing multi-point depth data of the surroundings. However, the small spatial resolution and the noisy measurements pose a challenge to the success of state-of-the-art localization algorithms, which are generally applied to much denser and more reliable measurements. In this paper, we enforce distributed VL53L5CX ToF sensors, mount them on the tip of a soft robot, and investigate their usage for self-localization tasks. Experimental results show that the soft robot can effectively be localized with respect to a known map, with an error comparable to the uncertainty on the measures provided by the miniaturized ToF sensors.</description>

      <title>Societal Attitudes Toward Service Robots: Adore, Abhor, Ignore, or Unsure?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Societal or population-level attitudes are aggregated patterns of different individual attitudes, representing collective general predispositions. As service robots become ubiquitous, understanding attitudes towards them at the population (vs. individual) level enables firms to expand robot services to a broad (vs. niche) market. Targeting population-level attitudes would benefit service firms because: (1) they are more persistent, thus, stronger predictors of behavioral patterns and (2) this approach is less reliant on personal data, whereas individualized services are vulnerable to AI-related privacy risks. As for service theory, ignoring broad unobserved differences in attitudes produces biased conclusions, and our systematic review of previous research highlights a poor understanding of potential heterogeneity in attitudes toward service robots. We present five diverse studies (S1-S5), utilizing multinational and "real world" data (Ntotal = 89,541; years: 2012-2024). Results reveal a stable structure comprising four distinct attitude profiles (S1-S5): positive ("adore"), negative ("abhor"), indifferent ("ignore"), and ambivalent ("unsure"). The psychological need for interacting with service staff, and for autonomy and relatedness in technology use, function as attitude profile antecedents (S2). Importantly, the attitude profiles predict differences in post-interaction discomfort and anxiety (S3), satisfaction ratings and service evaluations (S4), and perceived sociability and uncanniness based on a robot's humanlikeness (S5).</description>

      <title>Neural Cellular Automata for Decentralized Sensing using a Soft Inductive Sensor Array for Distributed Manipulator Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Distributed Manipulator Systems (DMS), decentralization is a highly desirable property as it promotes robustness and facilitates scalability by distributing computational burden and eliminating singular points of failure. However, current DMS typically utilize a centralized approach to sensing, such as single-camera computer vision systems. This centralization poses a risk to system reliability and offers a significant limiting factor to system size. In this work, we introduce a decentralized approach for sensing and in a Distributed Manipulator Systems using Neural Cellular Automata (NCA). Demonstrating a decentralized sensing in a hardware implementation, we present a novel inductive sensor board designed for distributed sensing and evaluate its ability to estimate global object properties, such as the geometric center, through local interactions and computations. Experiments demonstrate that NCA-based sensing networks accurately estimate object position at 0.24 times the inter sensor distance. They maintain resilience under sensor faults and noise, and scale seamlessly across varying network sizes. These findings underscore the potential of local, decentralized computations to enable scalable, fault-tolerant, and noise-resilient object property estimation in DMS</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the presence of robots increasing in the society, the need for interacting with robots is becoming necessary. The field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has emerged important since more repetitive and tiresome jobs are being done by robots. In the recent times, the field of soft robotics has seen a boom in the field of research and commercialization. The Industry 5.0 focuses on human robot collaboration which also spurs the field of soft robotics. However the HRI for soft robotics is still in the nascent stage. In this work we review and then discuss how HRI is done for soft robots. We first discuss the control, design, materials and manufacturing of soft robots. This will provide an understanding of what is being interacted with. Then we discuss about the various input and output modalities that are used in HRI. The applications where the HRI for soft robots are found in the literature are discussed in detail. Then the limitations of HRI for soft robots and various research opportunities that exist in this field are discussed in detail. It is concluded that there is a huge scope for development for HRI for soft robots.</description>

      <title>Resilient UAV Trajectory Planning via Few-Shot Meta-Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been a promising essence in future 5G-beyond and 6G systems. Its main advantage lies in its robust model-free decision-making in complex and large-dimension wireless environments. However, most existing RL frameworks rely on online interaction with the environment, which might not be feasible due to safety and cost concerns. Another problem with online RL is the lack of scalability of the designed algorithm with dynamic or new environments. This work proposes a novel, resilient, few-shot meta-offline RL algorithm combining offline RL using conservative Q-learning (CQL) and meta-learning using model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). The proposed algorithm can train RL models using static offline datasets without any online interaction with the environments. In addition, with the aid of MAML, the proposed model can be scaled up to new unseen environments. We showcase the proposed algorithm for optimizing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) 's trajectory and scheduling policy to minimize the age-of-information (AoI) and transmission power of limited-power devices. Numerical results show that the proposed few-shot meta-offline RL algorithm converges faster than baseline schemes, such as deep Q-networks and CQL. In addition, it is the only algorithm that can achieve optimal joint AoI and transmission power using an offline dataset with few shots of data points and is resilient to network failures due to unprecedented environmental changes.</description>

      <title>Towards Autonomous Wood-Log Grasping with a Forestry Crane: Simulator and Benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forestry machines operated in forest production environments face challenges when performing manipulation tasks, especially regarding the complicated dynamics of underactuated crane systems and the heavy weight of logs to be grasped. This study investigates the feasibility of using reinforcement learning for forestry crane manipulators in grasping and lifting heavy wood logs autonomously. We first build a simulator using Mujoco physics engine to create realistic scenarios, including modeling a forestry crane with 8 degrees of freedom from CAD data and wood logs of different sizes. We further implement a velocity controller for autonomous log grasping with deep reinforcement learning using a curriculum strategy. Utilizing our new simulator, the proposed control strategy exhibits a success rate of 96% when grasping logs of different diameters and under random initial configurations of the forestry crane. In addition, reward functions and reinforcement learning baselines are implemented to provide an open-source benchmark for the community in large-scale manipulation tasks.

      <title>Benchmarking Different QP Formulations and Solvers for Dynamic Quadrupedal Walking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic Programs (QPs) are widely used in the control of walking robots, especially in Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Whole-Body Control (WBC). In both cases, the controller design requires the formulation of a QP and the selection of a suitable QP solver, both requiring considerable time and expertise. While computational performance benchmarks exist for QP solvers, studies comparing optimal combinations of computational hardware (HW), QP formulation, and solver performance are lacking. In this work, we compare dense and sparse QP formulations, and multiple solving methods on different HW architectures, focusing on their computational efficiency in dynamic walking of four legged robots using MPC. We introduce the Solve Frequency per Watt (SFPW) as a performance measure to enable a cross hardware comparison of the efficiency of QP solvers. We also benchmark different QP solvers for WBC that we use for trajectory stabilization in quadrupedal walking. As a result, this paper provides recommendations for the selection of QP formulations and solvers for different HW architectures in walking robots and indicates which problems should be devoted the greater technical effort in this domain in future.</description>

      <title>Compliance while resisting: a shear-thickening fluid controller for physical human-robot interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) is widely needed in many fields, such as industrial manipulation, home services, and medical rehabilitation, and puts higher demands on the safety of robots. Due to the uncertainty of the working environment, the pHRI may receive unexpected impact interference, which affects the safety and smoothness of the task execution. The commonly used linear admittance control (L-AC) can cope well with high-frequency small-amplitude noise, but for medium-frequency high-intensity impact, the effect is not as good. Inspired by the solid-liquid phase change nature of shear-thickening fluid, we propose a Shear-thickening Fluid Control (SFC) that can achieve both an easy human-robot collaboration and resistance to impact interference. The SFC's stability, passivity, and phase trajectory are analyzed in detail, the frequency and time domain properties are quantified, and parameter constraints in discrete control and coupled stability conditions are provided. We conducted simulations to compare the frequency and time domain characteristics of L-AC, nonlinear admittance controller (N-AC), and SFC, and validated their dynamic properties. In real-world experiments, we compared the performance of L-AC, N-AC, and SFC in both fixed and mobile manipulators. L-AC exhibits weak resistance to impact. N-AC can resist moderate impacts but not high-intensity ones, and may exhibit self-excited oscillations. In contrast, SFC demonstrated superior impact resistance and maintained stable collaboration, enhancing comfort in cooperative water delivery tasks. Additionally, a case study was conducted in a factory setting, further affirming the SFC's capability in facilitating human-robot collaborative manipulation and underscoring its potential in industrial applications.</description>

      <title>What Can You Say to a Robot? Capability Communication Leads to More Natural Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When encountering a robot in the wild, it is not inherently clear to human users what the robot's capabilities are. When encountering misunderstandings or problems in spoken interaction, robots often just apologize and move on, without additional effort to make sure the user understands what happened. We set out to compare the effect of two speech based capability communication strategies (proactive, reactive) to a robot without such a strategy, in regard to the user's rating of and their behavior during the interaction. For this, we conducted an in-person user study with 120 participants who had three speech-based interactions with a social robot in a restaurant setting. Our results suggest that users preferred the robot communicating its capabilities proactively and adjusted their behavior in those interactions, using a more conversational interaction style while also enjoying the interaction more.</description>

      <title>Embrace Collisions: Humanoid Shadowing for Deployable Contact-Agnostics Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous humanoid robot research works treat the robot as a bipedal mobile manipulation platform, where only the feet and hands contact the environment. However, we humans use all body parts to interact with the world, e.g., we sit in chairs, get up from the ground, or roll on the floor. Contacting the environment using body parts other than feet and hands brings significant challenges in both model-predictive control and reinforcement learning-based methods. An unpredictable contact sequence makes it almost impossible for model-predictive control to plan ahead in real time. The success of the zero-shot sim-to-real reinforcement learning method for humanoids heavily depends on the acceleration of GPU-based rigid-body physical simulator and simplification of the collision detection. Lacking extreme torso movement of the humanoid research makes all other components non-trivial to design, such as termination conditions, motion commands and reward designs. To address these potential challenges, we propose a general humanoid motion framework that takes discrete motion commands and controls the robot's motor action in real time. Using a GPU-accelerated rigid-body simulator, we train a humanoid whole-body control policy that follows the high-level motion command in the real world in real time, even with stochastic contacts and extremely large robot base rotation and not-so-feasible motion command.

      <title>Robot Cell Modeling via Exploratory Robot Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating a collision-free robot motion is crucial for safe applications in real-world settings. This requires an accurate model of all obstacle shapes within the constrained robot cell, which is particularly challenging and time-consuming. The difficulty is heightened in flexible production lines, where the environment model must be updated each time the robot cell is modified. Furthermore, sensor-based methods often necessitate costly hardware and calibration procedures, and can be influenced by environmental factors (e.g., light conditions or reflections). To address these challenges, we present a novel data-driven approach to modeling a cluttered workspace, leveraging solely the robot internal joint encoders to capture exploratory motions. By computing the corresponding swept volume, we generate a (conservative) mesh of the environment that is subsequently used for collision checking within established path planning and control methods. Our method significantly reduces the complexity and cost of classical environment modeling by removing the need for CAD files and external sensors. We validate the approach with the KUKA LBR iisy collaborative robot in a pick-and-place scenario. In less than three minutes of exploratory robot motions and less than four additional minutes of computation time, we obtain an accurate model that enables collision-free motions. Our approach is intuitive, easy-to-use, making it accessible to users without specialized technical knowledge. It is applicable to all types of industrial robots or cobots.</description>

      <title>VR-Robo: A Real-to-Sim-to-Real Framework for Visual Robot Navigation and Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent success in legged robot locomotion is attributed to the integration of reinforcement learning and physical simulators. However, these policies often encounter challenges when deployed in real-world environments due to sim-to-real gaps, as simulators typically fail to replicate visual realism and complex real-world geometry. Moreover, the lack of realistic visual rendering limits the ability of these policies to support high-level tasks requiring RGB-based perception like ego-centric navigation. This paper presents a Real-to-Sim-to-Real framework that generates photorealistic and physically interactive "digital twin" simulation environments for visual navigation and locomotion learning. Our approach leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) based scene reconstruction from multi-view images and integrates these environments into simulations that support ego-centric visual perception and mesh-based physical interactions. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we train a reinforcement learning policy within the simulator to perform a visual goal-tracking task. Extensive experiments show that our framework achieves RGB-only sim-to-real policy transfer. Additionally, our framework facilitates the rapid adaptation of robot policies with effective exploration capability in complex new environments, highlighting its potential for applications in households and factories.</description>

      <title>Dynamic object goal pushing with mobile manipulators through model-free constrained reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-prehensile pushing to move and reorient objects to a goal is a versatile loco-manipulation skill. In the real world, the object's physical properties and friction with the floor contain significant uncertainties, which makes the task challenging for a mobile manipulator. In this paper, we develop a learning-based controller for a mobile manipulator to move an unknown object to a desired position and yaw orientation through a sequence of pushing actions. The proposed controller for the robotic arm and the mobile base motion is trained using a constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) formulation. We demonstrate its capability in experiments with a quadrupedal robot equipped with an arm. The learned policy achieves a success rate of 91.35% in simulation and at least 80% on hardware in challenging scenarios. Through our extensive hardware experiments, we show that the approach demonstrates high robustness against unknown objects of different masses, materials, sizes, and shapes. It reactively discovers the pushing location and direction, thus achieving contact-rich behavior while observing only the pose of the object. Additionally, we demonstrate the adaptive behavior of the learned policy towards preventing the object from toppling.</description>

      <title>Social Robots as Social Proxies for Fostering Connection and Empathy Towards Humanity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite living in an increasingly connected world, social isolation is a prevalent issue today. While social robots have been explored as tools to enhance social connection through companionship, their potential as asynchronous social platforms for fostering connection towards humanity has received less attention. In this work, we introduce the design of a social support companion that facilitates the exchange of emotionally relevant stories and scaffolds reflection to enhance feelings of connection via five design dimensions. We investigate how social robots can serve as "social proxies" facilitating human stories, passing stories from other human narrators to the user. To this end, we conduct a real-world deployment of 40 robot stations in users' homes over the course of two weeks. Through thematic analysis of user interviews, we find that social proxy robots can foster connection towards other people's experiences via mechanisms such as identifying connections across stories or offering diverse perspectives. We present design guidelines from our study insights on the use of social robot systems that serve as social platforms to enhance human empathy and connection.</description>

      <title>Learning from Suboptimal Data in Continuous Control via Auto-Regressive Soft Q-Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) for continuous control often requires large amounts of online interaction data. Value-based RL methods can mitigate this burden by offering relatively high sample efficiency. Some studies further enhance sample efficiency by incorporating offline demonstration data to "kick-start" training, achieving promising results in continuous control. However, they typically compute the Q-function independently for each action dimension, neglecting interdependencies and making it harder to identify optimal actions when learning from suboptimal data, such as non-expert demonstration and online-collected data during the training process. To address these issues, we propose Auto-Regressive Soft Q-learning (ARSQ), a value-based RL algorithm that models Q-values in a coarse-to-fine, auto-regressive manner. First, ARSQ decomposes the continuous action space into discrete spaces in a coarse-to-fine hierarchy, enhancing sample efficiency for fine-grained continuous control tasks. Next, it auto-regressively predicts dimensional action advantages within each decision step, enabling more effective decision-making in continuous control tasks. We evaluate ARSQ on two continuous control benchmarks, RLBench and D4RL, integrating demonstration data into online training. On D4RL, which includes non-expert demonstrations, ARSQ achieves an average $1.62\times$ performance improvement over SOTA value-based baseline. On RLBench, which incorporates expert demonstrations, ARSQ surpasses various baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness in learning from suboptimal online-collected data.</description>

      <title>A Differentiated Reward Method for Reinforcement Learning based Multi-Vehicle Cooperative Decision-Making Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) shows great potential for optimizing multi-vehicle cooperative driving strategies through the state-action-reward feedback loop, but it still faces challenges such as low sample efficiency. This paper proposes a differentiated reward method based on steady-state transition systems, which incorporates state transition gradient information into the reward design by analyzing traffic flow characteristics, aiming to optimize action selection and policy learning in multi-vehicle cooperative decision-making. The performance of the proposed method is validated in RL algorithms such as MAPPO, MADQN, and QMIX under varying autonomous vehicle penetration. The results show that the differentiated reward method significantly accelerates training convergence and outperforms centering reward and others in terms of traffic efficiency, safety, and action rationality. Additionally, the method demonstrates strong scalability and environmental adaptability, providing a novel approach for multi-agent cooperative decision-making in complex traffic scenarios.</description>

      <title>MambaGlue: Fast and Robust Local Feature Matching With Mamba</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, robust matching methods using deep learning-based approaches have been actively studied and improved in computer vision tasks. However, there remains a persistent demand for both robust and fast matching techniques. To address this, we propose a novel Mamba-based local feature matching approach, called MambaGlue, where Mamba is an emerging state-of-the-art architecture rapidly gaining recognition for its superior speed in both training and inference, and promising performance compared with Transformer architectures. In particular, we propose two modules: a) MambaAttention mixer to simultaneously and selectively understand the local and global context through the Mamba-based self-attention structure and b) deep confidence score regressor, which is a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based architecture that evaluates a score indicating how confidently matching predictions correspond to the ground-truth correspondences. Consequently, our MambaGlue achieves a balance between robustness and efficiency in real-world applications. As verified on various public datasets, we demonstrate that our MambaGlue yields a substantial performance improvement over baseline approaches while maintaining fast inference speed. Our code will be available on https://github.com/url-kaist/MambaGlue</description>

      <title>Environment-Driven Online LiDAR-Camera Extrinsic Calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration (LCEC) is the core for data fusion in computer vision. Existing methods typically rely on customized calibration targets or fixed scene types, lacking the flexibility to handle variations in sensor data and environmental contexts. This paper introduces EdO-LCEC, the first environment-driven, online calibration approach that achieves human-like adaptability. Inspired by the human perceptual system, EdO-LCEC incorporates a generalizable scene discriminator to actively interpret environmental conditions, creating multiple virtual cameras that capture detailed spatial and textural information. To overcome cross-modal feature matching challenges between LiDAR and camera, we propose dual-path correspondence matching (DPCM), which leverages both structural and textural consistency to achieve reliable 3D-2D correspondences. Our approach formulates the calibration process as a spatial-temporal joint optimization problem, utilizing global constraints from multiple views and scenes to improve accuracy, particularly in sparse or partially overlapping sensor views. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that EdO-LCEC achieves state-of-the-art performance, providing reliable and precise calibration across diverse, challenging environments.</description>

      <title>On the Surprising Robustness of Sequential Convex Optimization for Contact-Implicit Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contact-implicit motion planning-embedding contact sequencing as implicit complementarity constraints-holds the promise of leveraging continuous optimization to discover new contact patterns online. Nevertheless, the resulting optimization, being an instance of Mathematical Programming with Complementary Constraints, fails the classical constraint qualifications that are crucial for the convergence of popular numerical solvers. We present robust contact-implicit motion planning with sequential convex programming (CRISP), a solver that departs from the usual primal-dual algorithmic framework but instead only focuses on the primal problem. CRISP solves a convex quadratic program with an adaptive trust region radius at each iteration, and its convergence is evaluated by a merit function using weighted penalty. We (i) provide sufficient conditions on CRISP's convergence to first-order stationary points of the merit function; (ii) release a high-performance C++ implementation of CRISP with a generic nonlinear programming interface; and (iii) demonstrate CRISP's surprising robustness in solving contact-implicit planning with naive initialization. In fact, CRISP solves several contact-implicit problems with all-zero initialization.</description>

      <title>TeLL-Drive: Enhancing Autonomous Driving with Teacher LLM-Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01387v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Large Language Models (LLMs) each show promise in addressing decision-making challenges in autonomous driving, DRL often suffers from high sample complexity, while LLMs have difficulty ensuring real-time decision making. To address these limitations, we propose TeLL-Drive, a hybrid framework that integrates an Teacher LLM to guide an attention-based Student DRL policy. By incorporating risk metrics, historical scenario retrieval, and domain heuristics into context-rich prompts, the LLM produces high-level driving strategies through chain-of-thought reasoning. A self-attention mechanism then fuses these strategies with the DRL agent's exploration, accelerating policy convergence and boosting robustness across diverse driving conditions. Our experimental results, evaluated across multiple traffic scenarios, show that TeLL-Drive outperforms existing baseline methods, including other LLM-based approaches, in terms of success rates, average returns, and real-time feasibility. Ablation studies underscore the importance of each model component, especially the synergy between the attention mechanism and LLM-driven guidance. These findings suggest that TeLL-Drive significantly enhances both the adaptability and safety of autonomous driving systems, while offering a more efficient and scalable approach for policy learning. Full validation results are available on our website.</description>

      <title>BYON: Bring Your Own Networks for Digital Agriculture Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital agriculture technologies rely on sensors, drones, robots, and autonomous farm equipment to improve farm yields and incorporate sustainability practices. However, the adoption of such technologies is severely limited by the lack of broadband connectivity in rural areas. We argue that farming applications do not require permanent always-on connectivity. Instead, farming activity and digital agriculture applications follow seasonal rhythms of agriculture. Therefore, the need for connectivity is highly localized in time and space. We introduce BYON, a new connectivity model for high bandwidth agricultural applications that relies on emerging connectivity solutions like citizens broadband radio service (CBRS) and satellite networks. BYON creates an agile connectivity solution that can be moved along a farm to create spatio-temporal connectivity bubbles.

      <title>Toward Task Generalization via Memory Augmentation in Meta-Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), agents often struggle to perform well on tasks that differ from those encountered during training. This limitation presents a challenge to the broader deployment of RL in diverse and dynamic task settings. In this work, we introduce memory augmentation, a memory-based RL approach to improve task generalization. Our approach leverages task-structured augmentations to simulate plausible out-of-distribution scenarios and incorporates memory mechanisms to enable context-aware policy adaptation. Trained on a predefined set of tasks, our policy demonstrates the ability to generalize to unseen tasks through memory augmentation without requiring additional interactions with the environment. Through extensive simulation experiments and real-world hardware evaluations on legged locomotion tasks, we demonstrate that our approach achieves zero-shot generalization to unseen tasks while maintaining robust in-distribution performance and high sample efficiency.</description>

      <title>Eigen-Factors a Bilevel Optimization for Plane SLAM of 3D Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01055v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern depth sensors can generate a huge number of 3D points in few seconds to be latter processed by Localization and Mapping algorithms. Ideally, these algorithms should handle efficiently large sizes of Point Clouds under the assumption that using more points implies more information available. The Eigen Factors (EF) is a new algorithm that solves SLAM by using planes as the main geometric primitive. To do so, EF exhaustively calculates the error of all points at complexity $O(1)$, thanks to the {\em Summation matrix} $S$ of homogeneous points.
  The solution of EF is highly efficient: i) the state variables are only the sensor poses -- trajectory, while the plane parameters are estimated previously in closed from and ii) EF alternating optimization uses a Newton-Raphson method by a direct analytical calculation of the gradient and the Hessian, which turns out to be a block diagonal matrix. Since we require to differentiate over eigenvalues and matrix elements, we have developed an intuitive methodology to calculate partial derivatives in the manifold of rigid body transformations $SE(3)$, which could be applied to unrelated problems that require analytical derivatives of certain complexity.
  We evaluate the optimization processes (back-end) of EF and other state-of-the-art plane SLAM back-end algorithms in a synthetic environment. The evaluation is extended to ICL dataset (RGBD) and LiDAR KITTI dataset. Code is publicly available at https://github.com/prime-slam/EF-plane-SLAM.</description>

      <title>Make a Donut: Hierarchical EMD-Space Planning for Zero-Shot Deformable Manipulation with Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02787v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deformable object manipulation stands as one of the most captivating yet formidable challenges in robotics. While previous techniques have predominantly relied on learning latent dynamics through demonstrations, typically represented as either particles or images, there exists a pertinent limitation: acquiring suitable demonstrations, especially for long-horizon tasks, can be elusive. Moreover, basing learning entirely on demonstrations can hamper the model's ability to generalize beyond the demonstrated tasks. In this work, we introduce a demonstration-free hierarchical planning approach capable of tackling intricate long-horizon tasks without necessitating any training. We employ large language models (LLMs) to articulate a high-level, stage-by-stage plan corresponding to a specified task. For every individual stage, the LLM provides both the tool's name and the Python code to craft intermediate subgoal point clouds. With the tool and subgoal for a particular stage at our disposal, we present a granular closed-loop model predictive control strategy. This leverages Differentiable Physics with Point-to-Point correspondence (DiffPhysics-P2P) loss in the earth mover distance (EMD) space, applied iteratively. Experimental findings affirm that our technique surpasses multiple benchmarks in dough manipulation, spanning both short and long horizons. Remarkably, our model demonstrates robust generalization capabilities to novel and previously unencountered complex tasks without any preliminary demonstrations. We further substantiate our approach with experimental trials on real-world robotic platforms. Our project page: https://qq456cvb.github.io/projects/donut.</description>

      <title>RH20T-P: A Primitive-Level Robotic Dataset Towards Composable Generalization Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19622v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving generalizability in solving out-of-distribution tasks is one of the ultimate goals of learning robotic manipulation. Recent progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has shown that VLM-based task planners can alleviate the difficulty of solving novel tasks, by decomposing the compounded tasks as a plan of sequentially executing primitive-level skills that have been already mastered. It is also promising for robotic manipulation to adapt such composable generalization ability, in the form of composable generalization agents (CGAs). However, the community lacks of reliable design of primitive skills and a sufficient amount of primitive-level data annotations. Therefore, we propose RH20T-P, a primitive-level robotic manipulation dataset, which contains about 38k video clips covering 67 diverse manipulation tasks in real-world scenarios. Each clip is manually annotated according to a set of meticulously designed primitive skills that are common in robotic manipulation. Furthermore, we standardize a plan-execute CGA paradigm and implement an exemplar baseline called RA-P on our RH20T-P, whose positive performance on solving unseen tasks validates that the proposed dataset can offer composable generalization ability to robotic manipulation agents.</description>

      <title>Interactive Learning of Physical Object Properties Through Robot Manipulation and Database of Object Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a framework for automatically extracting physical object properties, such as material composition, mass, volume, and stiffness, through robot manipulation and a database of object measurements. The framework involves exploratory action selection to maximize learning about objects on a table. A Bayesian network models conditional dependencies between object properties, incorporating prior probability distributions and uncertainty associated with measurement actions. The algorithm selects optimal exploratory actions based on expected information gain and updates object properties through Bayesian inference. Experimental evaluation demonstrates effective action selection compared to a baseline and correct termination of the experiments if there is nothing more to be learned. The algorithm proved to behave intelligently when presented with trick objects with material properties in conflict with their appearance. The robot pipeline integrates with a logging module and an online database of objects, containing over 24,000 measurements of 63 objects with different grippers. All code and data are publicly available, facilitating automatic digitization of objects and their physical properties through exploratory manipulations.</description>

      <title>Learning Cross-hand Policies for High-DOF Reaching and Grasping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reaching-and-grasping is a fundamental skill for robotic manipulation, but existing methods usually train models on a specific gripper and cannot be reused on another gripper. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can learn a unified policy model that can be easily transferred to different dexterous grippers. Our method consists of two stages: a gripper-agnostic policy model that predicts the displacements of pre-defined key points on the gripper, and a gripper-specific adaptation model that translates these displacements into adjustments for controlling the grippers' joints. The gripper state and interactions with objects are captured at the finger level using robust geometric representations, integrated with a transformer-based network to address variations in gripper morphology and geometry. In the experiments, we evaluate our method on several dexterous grippers and diverse objects, and the result shows that our method significantly outperforms the baseline methods. Pioneering the transfer of grasp policies across dexterous grippers, our method effectively demonstrates its potential for learning generalizable and transferable manipulation skills for various robotic hands.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces the first publicly accessible labeled multi-modal perception dataset for autonomous maritime navigation, focusing on in-water obstacles within the aquatic environment to enhance situational awareness for Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs). This dataset, collected over 4 years and consisting of diverse objects encountered under varying environmental conditions, aims to bridge the research gap in autonomous surface vehicles by providing a multi-modal, annotated, and ego-centric perception dataset, for object detection and classification. We also show the applicability of the proposed dataset by training deep learning-based open-source perception algorithms that have shown success. We expect that our dataset will contribute to development of the marine autonomy pipelines and marine (field) robotics. This dataset is opensource and can be found at https://seepersea.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Tightly-Coupled LiDAR-IMU-Wheel Odometry with an Online Neural Kinematic Model Learning via Factor Graph Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08907v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environments lacking geometric features (e.g., tunnels and long straight corridors) are challenging for LiDAR-based odometry algorithms because LiDAR point clouds degenerate in such environments. For wheeled robots, a wheel kinematic model (i.e., wheel odometry) can improve the reliability of the odometry estimation. However, the kinematic model suffers from complex motions (e.g., wheel slippage, lateral movement) in the case of skid-steering robots particularly because this robot model rotates by skidding its wheels. Furthermore, these errors change nonlinearly when the wheel slippage is large (e.g., drifting) and are subject to terrain-dependent parameters. To simultaneously tackle point cloud degeneration and the kinematic model errors, we developed a LiDAR-IMU-wheel odometry algorithm incorporating online training of a neural network that learns the kinematic model of wheeled robots with nonlinearity. We propose to train the neural network online on a factor graph along with robot states, allowing the learning-based kinematic model to adapt to the current terrain condition. The proposed method jointly solves online training of the neural network and LiDAR-IMU-wheel odometry on a unified factor graph to retain the consistency of all those constraints. Through experiments, we first verified that the proposed network adapted to a changing environment, resulting in an accurate odometry estimation across different environments. We then confirmed that the proposed odometry estimation algorithm was robust against point cloud degeneration and nonlinearity (e.g., large wheel slippage by drifting) of the kinematic model.

      <title>Exoskeleton-Assisted Balance and Task Evaluation During Quiet Stance and Kneeling in Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Construction workers exert intense physical effort and experience serious safety and health risks in hazardous working environments. Quiet stance and kneeling are among the most common postures performed by construction workers during their daily work. This paper analyzes lower-limb joint influence on neural balance control strategies using the frequency behavior of the intersection point of ground reaction forces. To evaluate the impact of elevation and wearable knee exoskeletons on postural balance and welding task performance, we design and integrate virtual- and mixed-reality (VR/MR) to simulate elevated environments and welding tasks. A linear quadratic regulator-controlled triple- and double-link inverted pendulum model is used for balance strategy quantification in quiet stance and kneeling, respectively. Extensive multi-subject experiments are conducted to evaluate the usability of occupational exoskeletons in destabilizing construction environments. The quantified balance strategies capture the significance of knee joint during balance control of quiet stance and kneeling gaits. Results show that center of pressure sway area reduced up to 62% in quiet stance and 39% in kneeling for subjects tested in high-elevation VR/MR worksites when provided knee exoskeleton assistance. The comprehensive balance and multitask evaluation methodology developed aims to reveal exoskeleton design considerations to mitigate the fall risk in construction.</description>

      <title>Affordance-based Robot Manipulation with Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01083v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for assistive robot manipulation, which focuses on two fundamental challenges: first, efficiently adapting large-scale models to downstream scene affordance understanding tasks, especially in daily living scenarios where gathering multi-task data involving humans requires strenuous effort; second, effectively learning robot action trajectories by grounding the visual affordance model. We tackle the first challenge by employing a parameter-efficient prompt tuning method that prepends learnable text prompts to the frozen vision model to predict manipulation affordances in multi-task scenarios. Then we propose to learn robot action trajectories guided by affordances in a supervised flow matching method. Flow matching represents a robot visuomotor policy as a conditional process of flowing random waypoints to desired robot action trajectories. Finally, we introduce a real-world dataset with 10 tasks across Activities of Daily Living to test our framework. Our extensive evaluation highlights that the proposed prompt tuning method for learning manipulation affordance achieves competitive performance and even outperforms some other finetuning protocols across data scales, while satisfying parameter efficiency. Learning multi-task robot action trajectories with flow matching leads to consistently favorable results in several robot manipulation benchmarks than some alternative behavior cloning methods. This includes more stable training and evaluation, and noticeably faster inference, while maintaining comparable generalization performance to diffusion policy, where flow matching performs marginally better in most cases. Our framework seamlessly unifies affordance learning and action generation with flow matching for robot manipulation.</description>

      <title>xTED: Cross-Domain Adaptation via Diffusion-Based Trajectory Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08687v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reusing pre-collected data from different domains is an appealing solution for decision-making tasks, especially when data in the target domain are limited. Existing cross-domain policy transfer methods mostly aim at learning domain correspondences or corrections to facilitate policy learning, such as learning task/domain-specific discriminators, representations, or policies. This design philosophy often results in heavy model architectures or task/domain-specific modeling, lacking flexibility. This reality makes us wonder: can we directly bridge the domain gaps universally at the data level, instead of relying on complex downstream cross-domain policy transfer procedures? In this study, we propose the Cross-Domain Trajectory EDiting (xTED) framework that employs a specially designed diffusion model for cross-domain trajectory adaptation. Our proposed model architecture effectively captures the intricate dependencies among states, actions, and rewards, as well as the dynamics patterns within target data. Edited by adding noises and denoising with the pre-trained diffusion model, source domain trajectories can be transformed to align with target domain properties while preserving original semantic information. This process effectively corrects underlying domain gaps, enhancing state realism and dynamics reliability in source data, and allowing flexible integration with various single-domain and cross-domain downstream policy learning methods. Despite its simplicity, xTED demonstrates superior performance in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10027v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in guiding embodied agents to execute language instructions across a range of tasks, including robotic manipulation and navigation. However, existing methods are primarily designed for static environments and do not leverage the agent's own experiences to refine its initial plans. Given that real-world environments are inherently stochastic, initial plans based solely on LLMs' general knowledge may fail to achieve their objectives, unlike in static scenarios. To address this limitation, this study introduces the Experience-and-Emotion Map (E2Map), which integrates not only LLM knowledge but also the agent's real-world experiences, drawing inspiration from human emotional responses. The proposed methodology enables one-shot behavior adjustments by updating the E2Map based on the agent's experiences. Our evaluation in stochastic navigation environments, including both simulations and real-world scenarios, demonstrates that the proposed method significantly enhances performance in stochastic environments compared to existing LLM-based approaches.

      <description>arXiv:2409.11709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Environments with large terrain height variations present great challenges for legged robot locomotion. Drawing inspiration from fire ants' collective assembly behavior, we study strategies that can enable two ``connectable'' robots to collectively navigate over bumpy terrains with height variations larger than robot leg length. Each robot was designed to be extremely simple, with a cubical body and one rotary motor actuating four vertical peg legs that move in pairs. Two or more robots could physically connect to one another to enhance collective mobility. We performed locomotion experiments with a two-robot group, across an obstacle field filled with uniformly-distributed semi-spherical ``boulders''. Experimentally-measured robot speed suggested that the connection length between the robots has a significant effect on collective mobility: connection length C in [0.86, 0.9] robot unit body length (UBL) were able to produce sustainable movements across the obstacle field, whereas connection length C in [0.63, 0.84] and [0.92, 1.1] UBL resulted in low traversability. An energy landscape based model revealed the underlying mechanism of how connection length modulated collective mobility through the system's potential energy landscape, and informed adaptation strategies for the two-robot system to adapt their connection length for traversing obstacle fields with varying spatial frequencies. Our results demonstrated that by varying the connection configuration between the robots, the two-robot system could leverage mechanical intelligence to better utilize obstacle interaction forces and produce improved locomotion. Going forward, we envision that generalized principles of robot-environment coupling can inform design and control strategies for a large group of small robots to achieve ant-like collective environment negotiation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world manipulation data involving robotic arms is crucial for developing generalist action policies, yet such data remains scarce since existing data collection methods are hindered by high costs, hardware dependencies, and complex setup requirements. In this work, we introduce FastUMI, a substantial redesign of the Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) system that addresses these challenges by enabling rapid deployment, simplifying hardware-software integration, and delivering robust performance in real-world data acquisition. Compared with UMI, FastUMI has several advantages: 1) It adopts a decoupled hardware design and incorporates extensive mechanical modifications, removing dependencies on specialized robotic components while preserving consistent observation perspectives. 2) It also refines the algorithmic pipeline by replacing complex Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) implementations with an off-the-shelf tracking module, significantly reducing deployment complexity while maintaining accuracy. 3) FastUMI includes an ecosystem for data collection, verification, and integration with both established and newly developed imitation learning algorithms, accelerating policy learning advancement. Additionally, we have open-sourced a high-quality dataset of over 10,000 real-world demonstration trajectories spanning 22 everyday tasks, forming one of the most diverse UMI-like datasets to date. Experimental results confirm that FastUMI facilitates rapid deployment, reduces operational costs and labor demands, and maintains robust performance across diverse manipulation scenarios, thereby advancing scalable data-driven robotic learning.</description>

      <title>RoTip: A Finger-Shaped Tactile Sensor with Active Rotation Capability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, advancements in optical tactile sensor technology have primarily centred on enhancing sensing precision and expanding the range of sensing modalities. To meet the requirements for more skilful manipulation, there should be a movement towards making tactile sensors more dynamic. In this paper, we introduce RoTip, a novel vision-based tactile sensor that is uniquely designed with an independently controlled joint and the capability to sense contact over its entire surface. The rotational capability of the sensor is particularly crucial for manipulating everyday objects, especially thin and flexible ones, as it enables the sensor to mobilize while in contact with the object's surface. The manipulation experiments demonstrate the ability of our proposed RoTip to manipulate rigid and flexible objects, and the full-finger tactile feedback and active rotation capabilities have the potential to explore more complex and precise manipulation tasks.</description>

      <title>Task-free Lifelong Robot Learning with Retrieval-based Weighted Local Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02995v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental objective in intelligent robotics is to move towards lifelong learning robot that can learn and adapt to unseen scenarios over time. However, continually learning new tasks would introduce catastrophic forgetting problems due to data distribution shifts. To mitigate this, we store a subset of data from previous tasks and utilize it in two manners: leveraging experience replay to retain learned skills and applying a novel Retrieval-based Local Adaptation technique to restore relevant knowledge. Since a lifelong learning robot must operate in task-free scenarios, where task IDs and even boundaries are not available, our method performs effectively without relying on such information. We also incorporate a selective weighting mechanism to focus on the most "forgotten" skill segment, ensuring effective knowledge restoration. Experimental results across diverse manipulation tasks demonstrate that our framework provides a scalable paradigm for lifelong learning, enhancing robot performance in open-ended, task-free scenarios.</description>

      <title>Gaussian Splatting Visual MPC for Granular Media Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in learned 3D representations have enabled significant progress in solving complex robotic manipulation tasks, particularly for rigid-body objects. However, manipulating granular materials such as beans, nuts, and rice, remains challenging due to the intricate physics of particle interactions, high-dimensional and partially observable state, inability to visually track individual particles in a pile, and the computational demands of accurate dynamics prediction. Current deep latent dynamics models often struggle to generalize in granular material manipulation due to a lack of inductive biases. In this work, we propose a novel approach that learns a visual dynamics model over Gaussian splatting representations of scenes and leverages this model for manipulating granular media via Model-Predictive Control. Our method enables efficient optimization for complex manipulation tasks on piles of granular media. We evaluate our approach in both simulated and real-world settings, demonstrating its ability to solve unseen planning tasks and generalize to new environments in a zero-shot transfer. We also show significant prediction and manipulation performance improvements compared to existing granular media manipulation methods.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Degeneracy Detection for Point-to-Plane Error Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Degeneracies arising from uninformative geometry are known to deteriorate LiDAR-based localization and mapping. This work introduces a new probabilistic method to detect and mitigate the effect of degeneracies in point-to-plane error minimization. The noise on the Hessian of the point-to-plane optimization problem is characterized by the noise on points and surface normals used in its construction. We exploit this characterization to quantify the probability of a direction being degenerate. The degeneracy-detection procedure is used in a new real-time degeneracy-aware iterative closest point algorithm for LiDAR registration, in which we smoothly attenuate updates in degenerate directions. The method's parameters are selected based on the noise characteristics provided in the LiDAR's datasheet. We validate the approach in four real-world experiments, demonstrating that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods at detecting and mitigating the adverse effects of degeneracies. For the benefit of the community, we release the code for the method at: github.com/ntnu-arl/drpm.</description>

      <title>V2I-Calib++: A Multi-terminal Spatial Calibration Approach in Urban Intersections for Collaborative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban intersections, dense with pedestrian and vehicular traffic and compounded by GPS signal obstructions from high-rise buildings, are among the most challenging areas in urban traffic systems. Traditional single-vehicle intelligence systems often perform poorly in such environments due to a lack of global traffic flow information and the ability to respond to unexpected events. Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology, through real-time communication between vehicles (V2V) and vehicles to infrastructure (V2I), offers a robust solution. However, practical applications still face numerous challenges. Calibration among heterogeneous vehicle and infrastructure endpoints in multi-end LiDAR systems is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and consistency of perception system data. Most existing multi-end calibration methods rely on initial calibration values provided by positioning systems, but the instability of GPS signals due to high buildings in urban canyons poses severe challenges to these methods. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel multi-end LiDAR system calibration method that does not require positioning priors to determine initial external parameters and meets real-time requirements. Our method introduces an innovative multi-end perception object association technique, utilizing a new Overall Distance metric (oDist) to measure the spatial association between perception objects, and effectively combines global consistency search algorithms with optimal transport theory. By this means, we can extract co-observed targets from object association results for further external parameter computation and optimization. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments conducted on the simulated dataset V2X-Sim and the real dataset DAIR-V2X confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. The code for this method can be accessed at: https://github.com/MassimoQu/v2i-calib.</description>

      <title>GUIDEd Agents: Enhancing Navigation Policies through Task-Specific Uncertainty Abstraction in Localization-Limited Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles performing navigation tasks in complex environments face significant challenges due to uncertainty in state estimation. In many scenarios, such as stealth operations or resource-constrained settings, accessing high-precision localization comes at a significant cost, forcing robots to rely primarily on less precise state estimates. Our key observation is that different tasks require varying levels of precision in different regions: a robot navigating a crowded space might need precise localization near obstacles but can operate effectively with less precision elsewhere. In this paper, we present a planning method for integrating task-specific uncertainty requirements directly into navigation policies. We introduce Task-Specific Uncertainty Maps (TSUMs), which abstract the acceptable levels of state estimation uncertainty across different regions. TSUMs align task requirements and environmental features using a shared representation space, generated via a domain-adapted encoder. Using TSUMs, we propose Generalized Uncertainty Integration for Decision-Making and Execution (GUIDE), a policy conditioning framework that incorporates these uncertainty requirements into robot decision-making. We find that TSUMs provide an effective way to abstract task-specific uncertainty requirements, and conditioning policies on TSUMs enables the robot to reason about the context-dependent value of certainty and adapt its behavior accordingly. We show how integrating GUIDE into reinforcement learning frameworks allows the agent to learn navigation policies that effectively balance task completion and uncertainty management without explicit reward engineering. We evaluate GUIDE on various real-world robotic navigation tasks and find that it demonstrates significant improvement in task completion rates compared to baseline methods that do not explicitly consider task-specific uncertainty.</description>

      <title>DINO-WM: World Models on Pre-trained Visual Features enable Zero-shot Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to predict future outcomes given control actions is fundamental for physical reasoning. However, such predictive models, often called world models, remains challenging to learn and are typically developed for task-specific solutions with online policy learning. To unlock world models' true potential, we argue that they should 1) be trainable on offline, pre-collected trajectories, 2) support test-time behavior optimization, and 3) facilitate task-agnostic reasoning. To this end, we present DINO World Model (DINO-WM), a new method to model visual dynamics without reconstructing the visual world. DINO-WM leverages spatial patch features pre-trained with DINOv2, enabling it to learn from offline behavioral trajectories by predicting future patch features. This allows DINO-WM to achieve observational goals through action sequence optimization, facilitating task-agnostic planning by treating goal features as prediction targets. We demonstrate that DINO-WM achieves zero-shot behavioral solutions at test time on six environments without expert demonstrations, reward modeling, or pre-learned inverse models, outperforming prior state-of-the-art work across diverse task families such as arbitrarily configured mazes, push manipulation with varied object shapes, and multi-particle scenarios.</description>

      <title>DextrAH-RGB: Visuomotor Policies to Grasp Anything with Dexterous Hands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01791v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the most important, yet challenging, skills for a dexterous robot is grasping a diverse range of objects. Much of the prior work has been limited by speed, generality, or reliance on depth maps and object poses. In this paper, we introduce DextrAH-RGB, a system that can perform dexterous arm-hand grasping end-to-end from RGB image input. We train a privileged fabric-guided policy (FGP) in simulation through reinforcement learning that acts on a geometric fabric controller to dexterously grasp a wide variety of objects. We then distill this privileged FGP into a RGB-based FGP strictly in simulation using photorealistic tiled rendering. To our knowledge, this is the first work that is able to demonstrate robust sim2real transfer of an end2end RGB-based policy for complex, dynamic, contact-rich tasks such as dexterous grasping. DextrAH-RGB is competitive with depth-based dexterous grasping policies, and generalizes to novel objects with unseen geometry, texture, and lighting conditions in the real world. Videos of our system grasping a diverse range of unseen objects are available at \url{https://dextrah-rgb.github.io/}.</description>

      <title>{\lambda}: A Benchmark for Data-Efficiency in Long-Horizon Indoor Mobile Manipulation Robotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05313v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiently learning and executing long-horizon mobile manipulation (MoMa) tasks is crucial for advancing robotics in household and workplace settings. However, current MoMa models are data-inefficient, underscoring the need for improved models that require realistic-sized benchmarks to evaluate their efficiency, which do not exist. To address this, we introduce the LAMBDA ({\lambda}) benchmark (Long-horizon Actions for Mobile-manipulation Benchmarking of Directed Activities), which evaluates the data efficiency of models on language-conditioned, long-horizon, multi-room, multi-floor, pick-and-place tasks using a dataset of manageable size, more feasible for collection. The benchmark includes 571 human-collected demonstrations that provide realism and diversity in simulated and real-world settings. Unlike planner-generated data, these trajectories offer natural variability and replay-verifiability, ensuring robust learning and evaluation. We benchmark several models, including learning-based models and a neuro-symbolic modular approach combining foundation models with task and motion planning. Learning-based models show suboptimal success rates, even when leveraging pretrained weights, underscoring significant data inefficiencies. However, the neuro-symbolic approach performs significantly better while being more data efficient. Findings highlight the need for more data-efficient learning-based MoMa approaches. {\lambda} addresses this gap by serving as a key benchmark for evaluating the data efficiency of those future models in handling household robotics tasks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Multi-robot system (MRS) provides significant advantages for intricate tasks such as environmental monitoring, underwater inspections, and space missions. However, addressing potential communication failures or the lack of communication infrastructure in these fields remains a challenge. A significant portion of MRS research presumes that the system can maintain communication with proximity constraints, but this approach does not solve situations where communication is either non-existent, unreliable, or poses a security risk. Some approaches tackle this issue using predictions about other robots while not communicating, but these methods generally only permit agents to utilize first-order reasoning, which involves reasoning based purely on their own observations. In contrast, to deal with this problem, our proposed framework utilizes Theory of Mind (ToM), employing higher-order reasoning by shifting a robot's perspective to reason about a belief of others observations. Our approach has two main phases: i) an efficient runtime plan adaptation using active inference to signal intentions and reason about a robot's own belief and the beliefs of others in the system, and ii) a hierarchical epistemic planning framework to iteratively reason about the current MRS mission state. The proposed framework outperforms greedy and first-order reasoning approaches and is validated using simulations and experiments with heterogeneous robotic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate localization is a critical component of mobile autonomous systems, especially in Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)-denied environments where traditional methods fail. In such scenarios, environmental sensing is essential for reliable operation. However, approaches such as LiDAR odometry and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) suffer from drift over long distances, especially in the absence of loop closures. Map-based localization offers a robust alternative, but the challenge lies in creating and georeferencing maps without GNSS support. To address this issue, we propose a method for creating georeferenced maps without GNSS by using publicly available data, such as building footprints and surface models derived from sparse aerial scans. Our approach integrates these data with onboard LiDAR scans to produce dense, accurate, georeferenced 3D point cloud maps. By combining an Iterative Closest Point (ICP) scan-to-scan and scan-to-map matching strategy, we achieve high local consistency without suffering from long-term drift. Thus, we eliminate the reliance on GNSS for the creation of georeferenced maps. The results demonstrate that LiDAR-only mapping can produce accurate georeferenced point cloud maps when augmented with existing map priors.</description>

      <title>An Atomic Skill Library Construction Method for Data-Efficient Embodied Manipulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embodied manipulation is a fundamental ability in the realm of embodied artificial intelligence. Although current embodied manipulation models show certain generalizations in specific settings, they struggle in new environments and tasks due to the complexity and diversity of real-world scenarios. The traditional end-to-end data collection and training manner leads to significant data demands. Decomposing end-to-end tasks into reusable atomic skills helps reduce data requirements and improve task execution success rate. However, existing methods are limited by predefined skill sets that cannot be dynamically updated. To address the issue, we introduce a three-wheeled data-driven method to build an atomic skill library, which contains general skills enabling the execution of complex tasks. We divide tasks into subtasks using the Vision-Language Planning (VLP). Then, atomic skill definitions are formed by abstracting the subtasks. Finally, an atomic skill library is constructed via data collection and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) fine-tuning. As the atomic skill library expands dynamically with the three-wheel update strategy, the range of tasks it can cover grows naturally. In this way, our method shifts focus from end-to-end tasks to atomic skills, significantly reducing data costs while maintaining high performance and enabling efficient adaptation to new tasks. Extensive experiments in real-world settings demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</description>

      <title>Gaze-based Task Decomposition for Robot Manipulation in Imitation Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In imitation learning for robotic manipulation, decomposing object manipulation tasks into multiple sub-tasks is essential. This decomposition enables the reuse of learned skills in varying contexts and the combination of acquired skills to perform novel tasks, rather than merely replicating demonstrated motions. Gaze plays a critical role in human object manipulation, where it is strongly correlated with hand movements. We hypothesize that an imitating agent's gaze control, fixating on specific landmarks and transitioning between them, simultaneously segments demonstrated manipulations into sub-tasks. In this study, we propose a simple yet robust task decomposition method based on gaze transitions. The method leverages teleoperation, a common modality in robotic manipulation for collecting demonstrations, in which a human operator's gaze is measured and used for task decomposition as a substitute for an imitating agent's gaze. Notably, our method achieves consistent task decomposition across all demonstrations for each task, which is desirable in contexts such as machine learning. We applied this method to demonstrations of various tasks and evaluated the characteristics and consistency of the resulting sub-tasks. Furthermore, through extensive testing across a wide range of hyperparameter variations, we demonstrated that the proposed method possesses the robustness necessary for application to different robotic systems.</description>

Abstract: Efficient data utilization is crucial for advancing 3D scene understanding in autonomous driving, where reliance on heavily human-annotated LiDAR point clouds challenges fully supervised methods. Addressing this, our study extends into semi-supervised learning for LiDAR semantic segmentation, leveraging the intrinsic spatial priors of driving scenes and multi-sensor complements to augment the efficacy of unlabeled datasets. We introduce LaserMix++, an evolved framework that integrates laser beam manipulations from disparate LiDAR scans and incorporates LiDAR-camera correspondences to further assist data-efficient learning. Our framework is tailored to enhance 3D scene consistency regularization by incorporating multi-modality, including 1) multi-modal LaserMix operation for fine-grained cross-sensor interactions; 2) camera-to-LiDAR feature distillation that enhances LiDAR feature learning; and 3) language-driven knowledge guidance generating auxiliary supervisions using open-vocabulary models. The versatility of LaserMix++ enables applications across LiDAR representations, establishing it as a universally applicable solution. Our framework is rigorously validated through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on popular driving perception datasets. Results demonstrate that LaserMix++ markedly outperforms fully supervised alternatives, achieving comparable accuracy with five times fewer annotations and significantly improving the supervised-only baselines. This substantial advancement underscores the potential of semi-supervised approaches in reducing the reliance on extensive labeled data in LiDAR-based 3D scene understanding systems.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking and Improving Bird's Eye View Perception Robustness in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in bird's eye view (BEV) representations have shown remarkable promise for in-vehicle 3D perception. However, while these methods have achieved impressive results on standard benchmarks, their robustness in varied conditions remains insufficiently assessed. In this study, we present RoboBEV, an extensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate the resilience of BEV algorithms. This suite incorporates a diverse set of camera corruption types, each examined over three severity levels. Our benchmarks also consider the impact of complete sensor failures that occur when using multi-modal models. Through RoboBEV, we assess 33 state-of-the-art BEV-based perception models spanning tasks like detection, map segmentation, depth estimation, and occupancy prediction. Our analyses reveal a noticeable correlation between the model's performance on in-distribution datasets and its resilience to out-of-distribution challenges. Our experimental results also underline the efficacy of strategies like pre-training and depth-free BEV transformations in enhancing robustness against out-of-distribution data. Furthermore, we observe that leveraging extensive temporal information significantly improves the model's robustness. Based on our observations, we design an effective robustness enhancement strategy based on the CLIP model. The insights from this study pave the way for the development of future BEV models that seamlessly combine accuracy with real-world robustness.</description>

      <title>DecTrain: Deciding When to Train a Monocular Depth DNN Online</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02980v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) can deteriorate in accuracy when deployment data differs from training data. While performing online training at all timesteps can improve accuracy, it is computationally expensive. We propose DecTrain, a new algorithm that decides when to train a monocular depth DNN online using self-supervision with low overhead. To make the decision at each timestep, DecTrain compares the cost of training with the predicted accuracy gain. We evaluate DecTrain on out-of-distribution data, and find DecTrain maintains accuracy compared to online training at all timesteps, while training only 44% of the time on average. We also compare the recovery of a low inference cost DNN using DecTrain and a more generalizable high inference cost DNN on various sequences. DecTrain recovers the majority (97%) of the accuracy gain of online training at all timesteps while reducing computation compared to the high inference cost DNN which recovers only 66%. With an even smaller DNN, we achieve 89% recovery while reducing computation by 56%. DecTrain enables low-cost online training for a smaller DNN to have competitive accuracy with a larger, more generalizable DNN at a lower overall computational cost.</description>

      <title>HiRT: Enhancing Robotic Control with Hierarchical Robot Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, leveraging powerful pre trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) backends, have shown promise in robotic control due to their impressive generalization ability. However, the success comes at a cost. Their reliance on VLM backends with billions of parameters leads to high computational costs and inference latency, limiting the testing scenarios to mainly quasi-static tasks and hindering performance in dynamic tasks requiring rapid interactions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes HiRT, a Hierarchical Robot Transformer framework that enables flexible frequency and performance trade-off. HiRT keeps VLMs running at low frequencies to capture temporarily invariant features while enabling real-time interaction through a high-frequency vision-based policy guided by the slowly updated features. Experiment results in both simulation and real-world settings demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods. Empirically, in static tasks, we double the control frequency and achieve comparable success rates. Additionally, on novel real-world dynamic ma nipulation tasks which are challenging for previous VLA models, HiRT improves the success rate from 48% to 75%.</description>

      <title>Learning Multiple Initial Solutions to Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sequentially solving similar optimization problems under strict runtime constraints is essential for many applications, such as robot control, autonomous driving, and portfolio management. The performance of local optimization methods in these settings is sensitive to the initial solution: poor initialization can lead to slow convergence or suboptimal solutions. To address this challenge, we propose learning to predict \emph{multiple} diverse initial solutions given parameters that define the problem instance. We introduce two strategies for utilizing multiple initial solutions: (i) a single-optimizer approach, where the most promising initial solution is chosen using a selection function, and (ii) a multiple-optimizers approach, where several optimizers, potentially run in parallel, are each initialized with a different solution, with the best solution chosen afterward. Notably, by including a default initialization among predicted ones, the cost of the final output is guaranteed to be equal or lower than with the default initialization. We validate our method on three optimal control benchmark tasks: cart-pole, reacher, and autonomous driving, using different optimizers: DDP, MPPI, and iLQR. We find significant and consistent improvement with our method across all evaluation settings and demonstrate that it efficiently scales with the number of initial solutions required. The code is available at MISO (https://github.com/EladSharony/miso).</description>

      <title>Coarse-to-fine Q-Network with Action Sequence for Data-Efficient Robot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12155v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In reinforcement learning (RL), we train a value function to understand the long-term consequence of executing a single action. However, the value of taking each action can be ambiguous in robotics as robot movements are typically the aggregate result of executing multiple small actions. Moreover, robotic training data often consists of noisy trajectories, in which each action is noisy but executing a series of actions results in a meaningful robot movement. This further makes it difficult for the value function to understand the effect of individual actions. To address this, we introduce Coarse-to-fine Q-Network with Action Sequence (CQN-AS), a novel value-based RL algorithm that learns a critic network that outputs Q-values over a sequence of actions, i.e., explicitly training the value function to learn the consequence of executing action sequences. We study our algorithm on 53 robotic tasks with sparse and dense rewards, as well as with and without demonstrations, from BiGym, HumanoidBench, and RLBench. We find that CQN-AS outperforms various baselines, in particular on humanoid control tasks.</description>

      <title>M3PT: A Transformer for Multimodal, Multi-Party Social Signal Prediction with Person-aware Blockwise Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13416v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding social signals in multi-party conversations is important for human-robot interaction and artificial social intelligence. Social signals include body pose, head pose, speech, and context-specific activities like acquiring and taking bites of food when dining. Past work in multi-party interaction tends to build task-specific models for predicting social signals. In this work, we address the challenge of predicting multimodal social signals in multi-party settings in a single model. We introduce M3PT, a causal transformer architecture with modality and temporal blockwise attention masking to simultaneously process multiple social cues across multiple participants and their temporal interactions. We train and evaluate M3PT on the Human-Human Commensality Dataset (HHCD), and demonstrate that using multiple modalities improves bite timing and speaking status prediction.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Point-LN, a novel lightweight framework engineered for efficient 3D point cloud classification. Point-LN integrates essential non-parametric components-such as Farthest Point Sampling (FPS), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), and non-learnable positional encoding-with a streamlined learnable classifier that significantly enhances classification accuracy while maintaining a minimal parameter footprint. This hybrid architecture ensures low computational costs and rapid inference speeds, making Point-LN ideal for real-time and resource-constrained applications. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets, including ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN, demonstrate that Point-LN achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, all while offering exceptional efficiency. These results establish Point-LN as a robust and scalable solution for diverse point cloud classification tasks, highlighting its potential for widespread adoption in various computer vision applications.</description>

      <title>Advances in Multimodal Adaptation and Generalization: From Traditional Approaches to Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18592v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In real-world scenarios, achieving domain adaptation and generalization poses significant challenges, as models must adapt to or generalize across unknown target distributions. Extending these capabilities to unseen multimodal distributions, i.e., multimodal domain adaptation and generalization, is even more challenging due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities. Significant progress has been made over the years, with applications ranging from action recognition to semantic segmentation. Besides, the recent advent of large-scale pre-trained multimodal foundation models, such as CLIP, has inspired works leveraging these models to enhance adaptation and generalization performances or adapting them to downstream tasks. This survey provides the first comprehensive review of recent advances from traditional approaches to foundation models, covering: (1) Multimodal domain adaptation; (2) Multimodal test-time adaptation; (3) Multimodal domain generalization; (4) Domain adaptation and generalization with the help of multimodal foundation models; and (5) Adaptation of multimodal foundation models. For each topic, we formally define the problem and thoroughly review existing methods. Additionally, we analyze relevant datasets and applications, highlighting open challenges and potential future research directions. We maintain an active repository that contains up-to-date literature at https://github.com/donghao51/Awesome-Multimodal-Adaptation.</description>
