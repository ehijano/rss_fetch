      <title>Nonlinear two-component system of time-fractional PDEs in (2+1)-dimensions: Invariant subspace method combined with variable transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we develop a systematic approach of the invariant subspace method combined with variable transformation to find the generalized separable exact solutions of the nonlinear two-component system of time-fractional PDEs (TFPDEs) in (2+1)-dimensions for the first time. Also, we explicitly explain how to construct various kinds of finite-dimensional invariant linear product spaces for the given system using the invariant subspace method combined with variable transformation. Additionally, we present how to use the obtained invariant linear product spaces to derive the generalized separable exact solutions of the discussed system. We also note that the discussed method will help to reduce the nonlinear two-component system of TFPDEs in (2+1)-dimensions into the nonlinear two-component system of TFPDEs in (1+1)-dimensions, which again reduces to a system of time-fractional ODEs through the obtained invariant linear product spaces. More specifically, the significance and efficacy of the systematic investigation of the discussed method have been investigated through the initial and boundary value problems of the generalized nonlinear two-component system of time-fractional reaction-diffusion equations (TFRDEs) in (2+1)-dimensions for finding the generalized separable exact solutions, which can be expressed in terms of the exponential, trigonometric, polynomial, Euler-Gamma and Mittag-Leffler functions. Also, 2D and 3D graphical representations of some of the obtained solutions are presented for different values of fractional orders.</description>

      <title>Stability of the Toda equations related to a perturbed $R_i$ type recurrence relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, a modified $R_I$ type recurrence relation is considered whose recurrence coefficients are perturbed by addition or multiplication of a constant. The perturbed system of recurrence coefficients is represented by Toda lattice equations, which are derived. These equations are then represented in a matrix form. With the help of this matrix representation, a known Lax pair is recovered. Inferences about the stability of resulting perturbed system of Toda equations are drawn based on numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Envelope vector solitons in nonlinear flexible mechanical metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ a combination of analytical and numerical techniques to investigate the dynamics of lattice envelope vector soliton solutions propagating within a one-dimensional chain of flexible mechanical metamaterial. To model the system, we formulate discrete equations that describe the longitudinal and rotational displacements of each individual rigid unit mass using a lump element approach. By applying the multiple-scales method in the context of a semi-discrete approximation, we derive an effective nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation that characterizes the evolution of rotational and slowly varying envelope waves from the aforementioned discrete motion equations. We thus show that this flexible mechanical metamaterial chain supports envelope vector solitons where the rotational component has the form of either a bright or a dark soliton. In addition, due to nonlinear coupling, the longitudinal displacement displays kink-like profiles thus forming the 2-components vector soliton. These findings, which include specific vector envelope solutions, enrich our knowledge on the nonlinear wave solutions supported by flexible mechanical metamaterials and open new possibilities for the control of nonlinear waves and vibrations.</description>

      <title>On the solutions of coupled nonlinear time-fractional diffusion-reaction system with time delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we systematically explain how to apply the analytical technique called the invariant subspace method to find various types of analytical solutions for a coupled nonlinear time-fractional system of partial differential equations with time delays. Also, the present work explicitly studies a systematic way to obtain various kinds of finite-dimensional invariant vector spaces for the coupled nonlinear time-fractional diffusion-reaction (DR) system with time delays under the two distinct fractional derivatives, namely (a) the Riemann-Liouville fractional partial time derivative and (b) the Caputo fractional partial time derivative. Additionally, we provide details of deriving analytical solutions in the generalized separable form for the initial and boundary value problems (IBVPs) of the coupled nonlinear time-fractional DR system with multiple time delays through the obtained invariant vector spaces under the considered two time-fractional derivatives.</description>

Abstract: Recently, a birational representation of an extended affine Weyl group of $(A_{2N}\rtimes A_1)^{(1)}$-type, which gives a higher-order generalization of an $A_4^{(1)}$-surface type $q$-Painlev\'e equation, was obtained. In this paper, we extend it to a birational representation of an extended affine Weyl group of $(A_{2N}\rtimes A_1)^{(1)}\times A_1^{(1)}$-type. Moreover, we provide conjectures on periodic reductions from systems of P$\Delta$Es with the CAC property to Painlev\'e type $q$-O$\Delta$Es.</description>

      <title>Higher Gauge Theory and Integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, significant progress has been made in the study of integrable systems from a gauge theoretic perspective. This development originated with the introduction of $4$d Chern-Simons theory with defects, which provided a systematic framework for constructing two-dimensional integrable systems. In this article, we propose a novel approach to studying higher-dimensional integrable models employing techniques from higher category theory. Starting with higher Chern-Simons theory on the $4$-manifold $\mathbb{R}\times Y$, we complexify and compactify the real line to $\mathbb{C}P^1$ and introduce the disorder defect $\omega=z^{-1}\mathrm{d} z $. This procedure defines a holomorphic five-dimensional variant of higher Chern-Simons theory, which, when endowed with suitable boundary conditions, allows for the localisation to a three-dimensional theory on $Y$. The equations of motion of the resulting model are equivalent to the flatness of a $2$-connection $(L,H)$, that we then use to construct the corresponding higher holonomies. We prove that these are invariants of homotopies relative boundary, which enables the construction of conserved quantities. The latter are labelled by both the categorical characters of a Lie crossed-module and the infinite number of homotopy classes of surfaces relative boundary in $Y$. Moreover, we also demonstrate that the $3$d theory has left and right acting symmetries whose current algebra is given by an infinite dimensional centrally extended affine Lie 2-algebra. Both of these conditions are direct higher homotopy analogues of the properties satisfied by the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten CFT, which we therefore interpret as facets of integrable structures.</description>
