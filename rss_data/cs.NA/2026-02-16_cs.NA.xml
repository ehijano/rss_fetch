      <title>Temporal-Stability-Enhanced and Energy-Stable Dynamical Low-Rank Approximation for Multiscale Linear Kinetic Transport Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an asymptotic-preserving dynamical low-rank method for the multiscale linear kinetic transport equation. The proposed scheme is unconditionally stable in the diffusive regime while preserving the correct asymptotic behavior, and can achieve significant reductions in computational cost through a low-rank representation and large time step stability. A low-rank formulation consistent with the discrete energy is introduced under the discrete ordinates discretization, and energy stability of the resulting scheme is established. Numerical experiments confirm the energy stability and demonstrate that the method is efficient while maintaining accuracy across different regimes and capturing the correct asymptotic limits.</description>

      <title>A versatile FEM framework with native GPU scalability via globally-applied AD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy-based finite-element formulations provide a unified framework for describing complex physical systems in computational mechanics. In these energy-based methods, the governing equations can be obtained directly by considering the derivatives of a single global energy functional. While Automatic Differentiation (AD) can be used to automate the generation of these derivatives, current frameworks face a clear trade-off based primarily on the scale upon which the AD method is applied. Globally applied AD offers high expressivity but cannot currently be scaled to large problems. Locally applied AD scales well through traditional assembly methods, but the variety of physics and couplings that the framework can easily represent is more limited than the global approach. Here, we introduce an energy-centric framework tatva (https://github.com/smec-ethz/tatva) that defines the physics of a problem as a single global functional and applies AD globally to generate residual and tangent operators. By leveraging Jacobian-vector products for matrix-free solvers and coloring-based sparse differentiation for materializing sparse tangent stiffness matrices when needed, our flexible design scales linearly with the problem size on GPUs. We demonstrate that our framework can handle large problems (with millions of degrees of freedom) without memory exhaustion. Additionally, it offers a unified, fully differentiable methodology that can address a wide range of problems, including multi-point constraints, mixed-dimensional coupling, and the incorporation of neural networks, while maintaining high performance and scalability on modern GPU architectures.</description>

      <title>Quantile Randomized Kaczmarz Algorithm with Whitelist Trust Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomized Kaczmarz (RK) is a simple and fast solver for consistent overdetermined systems, but it is known to be fragile under noise. We study overdetermined $m\times n$ linear systems with a sparse set of corrupted equations, $ {\bf A}{\bf x}^\star = {\bf b}, $where only $\tilde{\bf b} = {\bf b} + \boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ is observed with $\|\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}\|_0 \le \beta m$. The recently introduced QuantileRK (QRK) algorithm addresses this issue by testing residuals against a quantile threshold, but computing a per-iteration quantile across many rows is costly. In this work we (i) reanalyze QRK and show that its convergence rate improves monotonically as the corruption fraction $\beta$ decreases; (ii) propose a simple online detector that flags and removes unreliable rows, which reduces the effective $\beta$ and speeds up convergence; and (iii) make the method practical by estimating quantiles from a small random subsample of rows, preserving robustness while lowering the per-iteration cost. Simulations on imaging and synthetic data demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Proving periodic solutions and branches in the 2D Swift Hohenberg PDE with hexagonal and triangular symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we enforce space group symmetries in Fourier series to rigorously prove the existence of smooth, periodic solutions in partial differential equations (PDEs) with hexagonal and triangular symmetries. In particular, we provide the necessary analytical and numerical tools to construct Fourier series of functions on the hexagonal lattice. This allows one to build approximate solutions that are periodic. Moreover, to generate the periodic tiling, we can use one symmetric hexagon for $D_6$ symmetry and two symmetric triangles for $D_3$ symmetry. We derive a Newton-Kantorovich approach based on the construction of an approximate inverse around an approximate solution, $\overline{u}$. More specifically, we verify a condition based on the computation of explicit bounds. The strategy for constructing $\overline{u}$, the approximate inverse, and the computation of these bounds will be presented. We demonstrate our approach on the 2D Swift-Hohenberg PDE by proving the existence of $D_3$ and $D_6$ periodic solutions. We then perform proofs of branches of solutions by using Chebyshev series. The algorithmic details to perform the proof can be found on Github.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of Block Newton Methods for 1D Shallow Neural Network Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes local convergence of the block Newton (BN) method introduced in [5, 6] for one-dimensional shallow neural network approximation to functions and diffusion-reaction problems. The BN method consists of the 2x2 block nonlinear Gauss-Seidel, linear Gauss-Seidel, or Jacobi method for outer iteration and the Newton method for inner iteration. The blocks are corresponding to the linear and the nonlinear parameters. Under some reasonable assumptions, we establish local convergence of the BN methods as well as the reduced BN (rBN) method for one-dimensional diffusion-reaction problems and least-squares function approximation. Unlike common optimization methods, the rBN allows for the reduction of the number of parameters during the optimization process when some neurons contribute little to the approximation or are at nearly optimal locations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive mesh methods for hyperbolic conservation laws with bound-preserving flux limiters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop bound-preserving (BP) finite-volume schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws on adaptive moving meshes. For scalar conservative laws, we rewrite the conventional high-order discretization as a convex combination of first-order counterparts on each sub-cell, which is mathematically equivalent to introducing a bound-preserving flux limiter. Such a limiter is inexpensive to evaluate, with a feature that the corresponding BP CFL conditions depend solely on the first-order sub-cell schemes. A mild CFL restriction is derived under which high-order spatial accuracy is retained. The proposed BP schemes are extend to two nonlinear systems, namely, the Euler equations and the five-equation transport model of two-medium flows. Numerical results demonstrate that the present schemes possess high resolution and strong robustness properties.</description>

      <title>Semi-implicit Structure Preserving Method for The Landau-Lifshitz Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A critical challenge inherent to the projection method applied to the Landau-Lifshitz equation is the deficiency of rigorous theoretical justifications for the stability of its projection step. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a semi-implicit numerical scheme, which is formulated on the basis of the first-order Backward Differentiation Formula (BDF) incorporated with one-sided extrapolation and a Crank-Nicolson-type norm-preserving procedure. This proposed scheme exhibits three fundamental characteristics: structure preservation, numerical stability, and first-order accuracy in time. In practical implementations, the scheme not only ensures stable computation and adheres to the norm constraint but also guarantees the uniqueness of the numerical solution, thereby providing substantial facilitation for the theoretical analysis of the normalizing step.</description>

      <title>A parallel space-time $p$-adaptive discontinuous Galerkin method for nonlinear acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and analyze a space-time $p$-adaptive discontinuous Galerkin method for nonlinear acoustics. We first present the underlying mathematical model, which is based on a recently derived formulation involving, in particular, only first order in time derivatives. We then propose a spacetime discontinuous Galerkin discretization of this model, combining a symmetric Friedrichs systems discretization for symmetric hyperbolic systems with an interior penalty discretization for damping terms. The resulting nonlinear system is solved using Newton's method. Next, we present a well-posedness analysis of the discrete problem. The analysis begins with a linearized system, for which stability is shown. Using a fixed point argument, these results are extended to the fully discrete nonlinear system, yielding a priori error estimates in a natural discontinuous Galerkin norm. Finally, we present numerical experiments demonstrating the parallel solvability of the spacetime formulation and the effectiveness of p-adaptivity. The results confirm the theoretical convergence rates and show that adaptive refinement can reduce the number of degrees of freedom required to accurately approximate selected goal functionals. Moreover, the experiments demonstrate that the model reproduces characteristic phenomena of nonlinear acoustics, such as harmonic generation, thereby validating the proposed model.</description>

      <title>A Stabilized Numerical Framework for Necrotic Tumor Growth via Coupled Boundary Integral and Obstacle Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a robust computational framework for Hele-Shaw tumor growth with necrotic cores, a problem identified as the incompressible limit of the Porous Media Equation. Simulating this system presents a fundamental challenge: while the outer boundary evolves via advection, the inner necrotic interface is defined by an obstacle problem and lacks an explicit advection structure, causing standard schemes to fail. To address this, we introduce a stabilized predictor-corrector strategy that iteratively resolves the bidirectional coupling between the nutrient-pressure fields and the domain geometry, ensuring robust time-stepping for both the advection-driven outer surface and the obstacle-defined necrotic core. We establish rigorous convergence theory for the single-interface case and demonstrate the method's robustness in capturing the topological transition of necrotic core nucleation and complex geometric evolution.</description>

      <title>Finite Difference Method for Stochastic Cahn-Hilliard Equation Driven by A Fractional Brownian Sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stochastic Cahn-Hilliard equation driven by a fractional Brownian sheet provides a more accurate model for correlated space-time random perturbations. This study delves into two key aspects: first, it rigorously examines the regularity of the mild solution to the stochastic Cahn-Hilliard equation, shedding light on the intricate behavior of solutions under such complex perturbations. Second, it introduces a fully discrete numerical scheme designed to solve the equation effectively. This scheme integrates the finite difference method for spatial discretization with the tamed exponential Euler method for temporal discretization. The analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme achieves a strong convergence rate of $O\big(h^{1-\epsilon}+\tau^{H_1-\frac{1}{8}-\frac{\epsilon}{2}}\big)$, where $\epsilon$ is an arbitrarily small positive constant, providing a solid foundation for the numerical treatment of such equations.</description>

      <title>Fast convolution solvers using moment-matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose two easy-to-implement fast algorithms based on moment-matching to compute the nonlocal potential $\varphi(\textbf{x})=(U\ast \rho)(\textbf{x})$ on bounded domain, where the kernel $U$ is singular at the origin and the density $\rho$ is a fast-decaying smooth function. Each method requires merely minor modifications to commonly-used existing methods, i.e., the sine spectral/Fourier quadrature method, and achieves a much better convergence rate. The key lies in the introduction of a smooth auxiliary function $\rho_1$ whose moments match those of the density up to an integer order $m$. Specifically, $\rho_1$ is constructed using Gaussian function in an explicit way and the associated potential can be calculated analytically. The moments of residual density vanish up to order $m$, and the corresponding residual potential $U \ast (\rho-\rho_1)$ decays much faster than the original potential $\varphi$ at the far field. As for the residual potential evaluation, for classical kernels (e.g., the Coulomb kernel), we solve a differential/pseudo-differential equation on a rectangular domain with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions via sine pseudospectral method, and achieve an arbitrary high convergence rate. While, for general kernels, the regularity of Fourier integrand increase by $m$ thanks to the moments-vanishing property, therefore, the standard trapezoidal rule/midpoint quadrature also converges much faster. To gain a better numerical performance, we utilize the domain expansion technique to obtain better accuracy, and improve the efficiency by simplifying the quadrature into one discrete convolution and applying Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to a double-sized vector. Rigorous error estimates and extensive numerical investigations showcase the accuracy and efficiency for different nonlocal potentials.</description>

      <title>Neural Evolutionary Kernel Method: A Knowledge-Guided Framework for Solving Evolutionary PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) plays a vital role in various fields of science and engineering. In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for solving PDEs, leveraging their approximation capabilities to handle complex domains and high-dimensional problems. Among these, operator learning has gained increasing attention by learning mappings between function spaces using DNNs. This paper proposes a novel approach, termed the Neural Evolutionary Kernel Method (NEKM), for solving a class of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) via deep neural network (DNN)-based kernel representations. By integrating boundary integral techniques with operator learning, prior mathematical information of time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is embedded into the design of neural network architectures for predicting their solutions, enhancing both computational efficiency and solution accuracy. Numerical experiments on the heat, wave, and Schr\"{o}dinger equations demonstrate that the Neural Evolutionary Kernel Method (NEKM) achieves high accuracy and favorable computational efficiency. Furthermore, the operator learning framework inherently supports the simultaneous prediction of solutions to multiple PDEs with different coefficients, rendering its capability for solving random PDEs.</description>

      <title>Bifurcation curve detection with deflation for multiparametric PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive framework for capturing bifurcating phenomena and detecting bifurcation curves in nonlinear multiparametric partial differential equations, where the system exhibits multiple coexisting solutions for given values of the parameters. Traditional continuation methods for one-dimensional parameterizations employ the previously computed solution as the initial guess for the next parameter value. These are usually very inefficient, since small step sizes increase computational cost, while larger steps could jeopardize the method convergence jumping to a different solution branch or missing the bifurcation point. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines: (i) arclength continuation, adaptively selecting new parameter values in higher dimension, and (ii) the deflation technique, discovering multiple branches to construct complete bifurcation diagrams. In particular, the arclength continuation method is designed to handle multiparametric scenarios, where the parameter vector $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}^p$ traces a curve $g(\lambda)$ within a $p$-dimensional parameter space. In addition, we introduce a zigzag path-following strategy to robustly track the bifurcation curves and surfaces, respectively, for two- and three-dimensional parametric spaces. Finally, we demonstrate its performance on two benchmark problems: the Bratu equation and the Allen-Cahn equation.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Filter Design for Flexible and Noise-Robust Tomographic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While filtered back projection (FBP) is still the method of choice for fast tomographic reconstruction, its performance degrades noticeably in the presence of noise, incomplete sampling, or non-standard scan geometries. We propose a data-driven approach for learning FBP filters and projection weights directly from training data, with the goal of improving robustness without sacrificing computational efficiency. The resulting reconstructions adapt naturally to the noise level and acquisition geometry, while retaining the speed and simplicity of classical back-projection. The proposed method can be formulated as a regularized optimization problem for a linear inverse operator, which allows us to establish existence, uniqueness, and stability of the learned solution. From a spectral viewpoint, the learned filters act as data-adaptive gain functions that explicitly balance noise amplification and bias, in close analogy to a regularized pseudo-inverse. Experiments in both 2D and 3D show consistent improvements over conventional FBP and FDK in different case studies. Finally, we show that filters trained on synthetic laminography data generalize well to real-world measurements, delivering image quality comparable to advanced iterative methods without the high computational cost.</description>

      <title>Multi-physics Preconditioning for Thermally Activated Batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal batteries, also known as molten-salt batteries, are single-use reserve power systems activated by pyrotechnic heat generation, which transitions the solid electrolyte into a molten state. The simulation of these batteries relies on multiphysics modeling to evaluate performance and behavior under various conditions. This paper presents advancements in scalable preconditioning strategies for the Thermally Activated Battery Simulator (TABS) tool, enabling efficient solutions to the coupled electrochemical systems that dominate computational costs in thermal battery simulations. We propose a hierarchical block Gauss-Seidel preconditioner implemented through the Teko package in Trilinos, which effectively addresses the challenges posed by tightly coupled physics, including charge transport, porous flow, and species diffusion. The preconditioner leverages scalable subblock solvers, including smoothed aggregation algebraic multigrid (SA-AMG) methods and domain-decomposition techniques, to achieve robust convergence and parallel scalability. Strong and weak scaling studies demonstrate the solver's ability to handle problem sizes up to 51.3 million degrees of freedom on 2048 processors, achieving near sub-second setup and solve times for the end-to-end electrochemical solve. These advancements significantly improve the computational efficiency and turnaround time of thermal battery simulations, paving the way for higher-resolution models and enabling the transition from 2D axisymmetric to full 3D simulations.</description>

      <title>A new model for two-layer liquid-gas stratified flows in pipes with general cross sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we derive a new model for immiscible two-layer gas-liquid stratified flows in pipes with general cross sections. The bottom layer is occupied by an incompressible fluid in liquid phase with hydrodynamics based on a hydrostatic pressure, following a shallow water approximation. The top layer is occupied by a compressible gas, following an ideal gas law leading to conservation of mass, momentum and energy. The two subsystems are linked through non-conservative products, representing momentum and energy exchanges between layers. The hyperbolic properties of the resulting model are analyzed, including the derivation of entropy inequalities, and the approximations of eigenvalues of the corresponding coefficient matrix. Numerical tests are included to demonstrate the merits of the model and the numerical approximations, including well-balancedness, Riemann problems, and perturbations and convergence toward steady states at rest. Besides simulations of water and air where the density difference between layers is significant, a case where such difference is not so pronounced (like gas and liquid hydrogen) is also shown.</description>

      <title>Rational Neural Networks have Expressivity Advantages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study neural networks with trainable low-degree rational activation functions and show that they are more expressive and parameter-efficient than modern piecewise-linear and smooth activations such as ELU, LeakyReLU, LogSigmoid, PReLU, ReLU, SELU, CELU, Sigmoid, SiLU, Mish, Softplus, Tanh, Softmin, Softmax, and LogSoftmax. For an error target of $\varepsilon&gt;0$, we establish approximation-theoretic separations: Any network built from standard fixed activations can be uniformly approximated on compact domains by a rational-activation network with only $\mathrm{poly}(\log\log(1/\varepsilon))$ overhead in size, while the converse provably requires $\Omega(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ parameters in the worst case. This exponential gap persists at the level of full networks and extends to gated activations and transformer-style nonlinearities. In practice, rational activations integrate seamlessly into standard architectures and training pipelines, allowing rationals to match or outperform fixed activations under identical architectures and optimizers.</description>

      <title>The condition number of a random banded Toeplitz matrix is typically large</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that square matrices with independent and identically distributed (iid) random entries are typically well conditioned. A natural question is whether this favorable behavior persists for random matrices whose entries obey additional structure, i.e., their position inside of the matrix. A prominent class of structured matrices is given by {\it Toeplitz matrices}, characterized by constant diagonals. A particular tractable subclass is that of circulant matrices, whose additional characteristic (its entries {\it circulate} row by row) allows one to express their conditioning in terms of the localization of the zeros of a associated polynomial. When the entries of a circulant matrix are iid, the matrix is well conditioned precisely when the corresponding random polynomial has no zeros on the unit circle. This connection is especially relevant because, as the degree of a random polynomial increases, its zeros tend to concentrate near the unit circle, making it a delicate problem to quantify how close the closest zeros lie to the unit circle. Another notable family within the Toeplitz class is that of {\it banded Toeplitz matrices}, namely matrices for which only finitely many diagonals around the main diagonal may be nonzero. These matrices have been extensively studied in Operator Theory, nevertheless, despite their apparent simplicity, they raise subtle questions regarding the behavior of their condition numbers. In present work we show that the bandwidth asymmetry plays a decisive role: if the band contains $r$ diagonals below and $s$ diagonal above the main diagonal, then if $r=s$ the banded Toeplitz matriz is well conditioned with high probability, whereas if $r\neq s$ it is typically ill conditioned. This highlights that structural constraints can have a impact on the numerical behavior of random matrices.</description>

      <title>Hyb-Adam-UM: hybrid ultrametric-aware mtDNA phylogeny reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation: mtDNA distance matrices are standard inputs for distance-based phylogeny, but computing all pairwise alignments is costly. Missing entries can degrade inferred topology and branch lengths, and generic matrix-completion methods may disrupt tree-like (ultrametric) structure.
  Results: We propose Hyb-Adam-UM, which starts from an alignment-limited Needleman-Wunsch distance backbone and completes the matrix by minimizing a robust triplet ultrametric-violation functional. An Adam-style finite-difference optimizer updates only missing entries while enforcing symmetry, non-negativity, and a zero diagonal. From one complete reference matrix, we generate 20 masked instances at 30%, 50%, 65%, and 85% missingness. Hyb-Adam-UM consistently reduces ultrametric violations and achieves competitive reconstruction error, with improved topological accuracy and branch-length agreement relative to MW*/NJ* projection baselines (which exactly preserve observed distances) and Soft-Impute; gains are most pronounced at 85% missingness.

      <title>Projection-free approximation of flows of harmonic maps with quadratic constraint accuracy and variable step sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct and analyze a projection-free linearly implicit method for the approximation of flows of harmonic maps into spheres. The proposed method is unconditionally energy stable and, under a sharp discrete regularity condition, achieves second-order accuracy with respect to the constraint violation. Furthermore, the method accommodates variable step sizes to speed up the convergence to stationary points and to improve the accuracy of the numerical solutions near singularities, without affecting the unconditional energy stability and the constraint violation property. We illustrate the accuracy in approximating the unit-length constraint and the performance of the method through a series of numerical experiments, and compare it with the linearly implicit Euler and two-step BDF methods.</description>

      <title>Uniform semiclassical observable error bound of Trotter-Suzuki splitting: a simple algebraic proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient simulation of the semiclassical Schr\"odinger equation has garnered significant attention in the numerical analysis community. While controlling the error in the unitary evolution or the wavefunction typically requires the time step size to shrink as the semiclassical parameter $h$ decreases, it has been observed -- and proved for first- and second-order Trotterization schemes -- that the error in certain classes of observables admits a time step size independent of $h$. In this work, we explicitly characterize this class of observables and present a new, simple algebraic proof of uniform-in-$h$ error bounds for arbitrarily high-order Trotterization schemes. Our proof relies solely on the algebraic structure of the underlying operators in both the continuous and discrete settings. Unlike previous analyses, it avoids Egorov-type theorems and bypasses heavy semiclassical machinery. To our knowledge, this is the first proof of uniform-in-$h$ observable error bounds for Trotterization in the semiclassical regime that relies only on algebraic structure, without invoking the semiclassical limit.</description>

      <title>Learned Finite Element-based Regularization of the Inverse Problem in Electrocardiographic Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) seeks to reconstruct cardiac electrical activity from body-surface potentials noninvasively. However, the associated inverse problem is severely ill-posed and requires robust regularization. While classical approaches primarily employ spatial smoothing, the temporal structure of cardiac dynamics remains underexploited despite its physiological relevance. We introduce a space-time regularization framework that couples spatial regularization with a learned temporal Fields-of-Experts (FoE) prior to capture complex spatiotemporal activation patterns. We derive a finite element discretization on unstructured cardiac surface meshes, prove Mosco-convergence, and develop a scalable optimization algorithm capable of handling the FoE term. Numerical experiments on synthetic epicardial data demonstrate improved denoising and inverse reconstructions compared to handcrafted spatiotemporal methods, yielding solutions that are both robust to noise and physiologically plausible.</description>

      <title>Bound-Preserving Adaptive Time-Stepping Method with Energy Stability for Simulating Compressible Gas Flow in Poroelastic Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an efficient numerical method to address a thermodynamically consistent gas flow model in porous media involving compressible gas and deformable rock. The accurate modeling of gas flow in porous media often poses significant challenges due to their inherent nonlinearity, the coupling between gas and rock dynamics, and the need to preserve physical principles such as mass conservation, energy dissipation and molar density boundedness. The system is further complicated by the need to balance computational efficiency with the accuracy and stability of the numerical scheme. To tackle these challenges, we adopt a stabilization approach that is able to preserve the original energy dissipation while achieving linear energy-stable numerical schemes. We also prove the convergence of the adopted linear iterative method. At each time step, the stabilization parameter is adaptively updated using a simple and explicit formula to ensure compliance with the original energy dissipation law. The proposed method uses adaptive time stepping to improve computational efficiency while maintaining solution accuracy and boundedness. The adaptive time step size is calculated explicitly at each iteration, ensuring stability and allowing for efficient handling of highly dynamic scenarios. A mixed finite element method combined with an upwind scheme is employed as spatial discretization to ensure mass conservation and stability. Finally, we conduct a series of numerical experiments to validate the performance and robustness of the proposed numerical method.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Temporal Super-Resolution of Energy Data using Generative Adversarial Transformer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10587v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To bridge the temporal granularity gap in energy network design and operation based on Energy System Models, resampling of time series is required. While conventional upsampling methods are computationally efficient, they often result in significant information loss or increased noise. Advanced models such as time series generation models, Super-Resolution models and imputation models show potential, but also face fundamental challenges. The goal of time series generative models is to learn the distribution of the original data to generate high-resolution series with similar statistical characteristics. This is not entirely consistent with the definition of upsampling. Time series Super-Resolution models or imputation models can degrade the accuracy of upsampling because the input low-resolution time series are sparse and may have insufficient context. Moreover, such models usually rely on supervised learning paradigms. This presents a fundamental application paradox: their training requires the high-resolution time series that is intrinsically absent in upsampling application scenarios. To address the mentioned upsampling issue, this paper introduces a new method utilizing Generative Adversarial Transformers (GATs), which can be trained without access to any ground-truth high-resolution data. Compared with conventional interpolation methods, the introduced method can reduce the root mean square error (RMSE) of upsampling tasks by 10%, and the accuracy of a model predictive control (MPC) application scenario is improved by 13%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The curse of dimensionality is ubiquitous in both numerical and data-driven methods. This is particularly severe for space-time methods, which treat the combined space-time domain simultaneously. We investigate the effectiveness of a quantum-inspired approach in alleviating this curse, both for solving PDEs and making data-driven predictions. We achieve this goal by treating both spatial and temporal dimensions within a single matrix product state (MPS) encoding. First, we benchmark our MPS space-time solver for both linear and nonlinear PDEs, observing that the MPS ansatz accurately captures the underlying spatio-temporal correlations while having significantly fewer degrees of freedom. Second, we develop an MPS-DMD algorithm for accurate long-term predictions of nonlinear systems, with runtime scaling logarithmically with both spatial and temporal resolution. We also demonstrate an application where both methods can be combined for cheap and accurate prediction of long-term dynamics. This research highlights the role of tensor networks in developing effective, interpretable models that bridge the gap between numerical methods and data-driven approaches.</description>
