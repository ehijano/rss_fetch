      <title>Mass media competition and alternative ordering in social dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collective behavior of a system of social agents subject to the competition between two mass media influences considered as external fields. We study under what conditions either of two mass media with different intensities can impose its message to the majority. In addition to a collective state dominated by the stronger mass media and a disordered phase, we characterize two nontrivial effects as the parameters of the system are varied: (i) the appearance of a majority sharing the state of the weaker mass media, and (ii) the emergence of an alternative ordering in a state different from those of either media. We explore the dependence of both phenomena on the topology of the network of interactions. We show that the presence of long-range interactions rather than random connections is essential for the occurrence of both effects. The model can be extended to include multiple mass media and we illustrate it by considering three mass media fields acting on the system. Nontrivial collective behaviors persist for some ranges of parameters: the weakest mass media can convince the majority, and the system can spontaneously order against all applied fields.</description>

      <title>Control of seizure-like dynamics in neuronal populations with excitability adaptation related to ketogenic diet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a heterogeneous, globally coupled population of excitatory quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons with excitability adaptation due to a metabolic feedback associated with ketogenic diet, a form of therapy for epilepsy. Bifurcation analysis of a three-dimensional mean-field system derived in the framework of next-generation neural mass models allows us to explain the scenarios and suggest control strategies for the transitions between the neurophysiologically desired asynchronous states and the synchronous, seizure-like states featuring collective oscillations. We reveal two qualitatively different scenarios for the onset of synchrony. For weaker couplings, a bistability region between the lower- and the higher-activity asynchronous states unfolds from the cusp point, and the collective oscillations emerge via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. For stronger couplings, one finds seven co-dimension two bifurcation points, including pairs of Bogdanov-Takens and generalized Hopf points, such that both lower- and higher-activity asynchronous states undergo transitions to collective oscillations, with hysteresis and jump-like behavior observed in vicinity of subcritical Hopf bifurcations. We demonstrate three control mechanisms for switching between asynchronous and synchronous states, involving parametric perturbation of the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production rate, external stimulation currents, or pulse-like ATP shocks, and indicate a potential therapeutic advantage of hysteretic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Complexified Synchrony</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model and its generalizations have been broadly employed to characterize and mechanistically understand various collective dynamical phenomena, especially the emergence of synchrony among coupled oscillators. Despite almost five decades of research, many questions remain open, in particular for finite-size systems. Here, we generalize recent work [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 187201 (2023)] on the finite-size Kuramoto model with its state variables analytically continued to the complex domain and also complexify its system parameters. Intriguingly, systems of two units with purely imaginary coupling do not actively synchronize even for arbitrarily large magnitudes of the coupling strengths, $|K| \rightarrow \infty$, but exhibit conservative dynamics with asynchronous rotations or librations for all $|K|$. For generic complex coupling, both, traditional phase-locked states and asynchronous states generalize to complex locked states, fixed points off the real subspace that exist even for arbitrarily weak coupling. We analyze a new collective mode of rotations exhibiting finite, yet arbitrarily large rotation numbers. Numerical simulations for large networks indicate a novel form of discontinuous phase transition. We close by pointing to a range of exciting questions for future research.</description>

      <title>Extremum Seeking Nonlinear Regulator with Concurrent Uncertainties in Exosystems and Control Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07106v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a non-adaptive control solution framework to the practical output regulation problem (PORP) for a class of nonlinear systems with uncertain parameters, unknown control directions and uncertain exosystem dynamics. The concurrence of the unknown control directions and uncertainties in both the system dynamics and the exosystem pose a significant challenge to the problem. In light of a nonlinear internal model approach, we first convert the robust PORP into a robust non-adaptive stabilization problem for the augmented system with integral Input-to-State Stable (iISS) inverse dynamics. By employing an extremum-seeking control (ESC) approach, the construction of our solution method avoids the use of Nussbaum-type gain techniques to address the robust PORP subject to unknown control directions with time-varying coefficients. The stability of the non-adaptive output regulation design is proven via a Lie bracket averaging technique where uniform ultimate boundedness of the closed-loop signals is guaranteed. As a result, both the estimation and tracking errors converge to zero exponentially, provided that the frequency of the dither signal goes to infinity. Finally, a simulation example with unknown coefficients is provided to exemplify the validity of the proposed control solution frameworks.</description>
