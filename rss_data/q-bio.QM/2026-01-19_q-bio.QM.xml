      <title>Depression Detection Based on Electroencephalography Using a Hybrid Deep Neural Network CNN-GRU and MRMR Feature Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the detection and classification of depressive and non-depressive states using deep learning approaches. Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that substantially affects quality of life, and early diagnosis can greatly enhance treatment effectiveness and patient care. However, conventional diagnostic methods rely heavily on self-reported assessments, which are often subjective and may lack reliability. Consequently, there is a strong need for objective and accurate techniques to identify depressive states. In this work, a deep learning based framework is proposed for the early detection of depression using EEG signals. EEG data, which capture underlying brain activity and are not influenced by external behavioral factors, can reveal subtle neural changes associated with depression. The proposed approach combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and gated recurrent units (GRUs) to jointly extract spatial and temporal features from EEG recordings. The minimum redundancy maximum relevance (MRMR) algorithm is then applied to select the most informative features, followed by classification using a fully connected neural network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves high performance in accurately identifying depressive states, with an overall accuracy of 98.74%. By effectively integrating temporal and spatial information and employing optimized feature selection, this method shows strong potential as a reliable tool for clinical applications. Overall, the proposed framework not only enables accurate early detection of depression but also has the potential to support improved treatment strategies and patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Learning for Survival Prediction in NSCLC Using Routine Blood Biomarkers and Tumor Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background Predicting overall survival (OS) in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is essential for clinical decision-making and drug development. While tumor and blood test markers kinetics are intrinsically linked, their joint dynamics and relationship to OS remain unknown. Methods We developed a mechanistic model capturing the interplay between tumor (T) burden and three key blood markers kinetics: albumin (A), lactate dehydrogenase (L), and neutrophils (N), through coupled differential equations (termed TALN-k). This model was enhanced with a machine learning framework (TALN-kML) for OS prediction. The model was trained and validated on clinical trial data from NSCLC patients treated with atezolizumab in monotherapy (N = 862 patients) or combination therapy (N = 1,115). Model parameters were estimated using nonlinear mixed-effects modelling, and survival predictions were assessed using individual and trial level metrics. Results TALN-k successfully described individual and population-level marker kinetics, revealing complex interactions between tumor and blood markers, and improving corrected BIC and log-likelihood metrics by a significant margin of previous empirical state-of-the-art models. Feature selection methods also highlighted valuable predictive parameters, indicatives of good or poor prognosis. The TALN-kML model outperformed empirical, uncoupled models, achieving improved C-index (0.74 $\pm$ 0.02 vs 0.72 $\pm$ 0.03), 12-months AUC (0.83 $\pm$ 0.004 vs 0.79 $\pm$ 0.05), and accuracy (0.77 $\pm$ 0.03 vs 0.76 $\pm$ 0.05) in OS prediction. Conclusion Our mechanistic learning approach allows for an interpretable model, which improves on longitudinal data description and on survival prediction in NSCLC by jointly integrating tumor and blood markers kinetics. This methodology offers a promising avenue for both personalized treatment strategies and drug development optimization.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network Reveals the Local Cortical Morphology of Brain Aging in Normal Cognition and Alzheimers Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating brain age (BA) from T1-weighted magnetic resonance images (MRIs) provides a useful approach to map the anatomic features of brain senescence. Whereas global BA (GBA) summarizes overall brain health, local BA (LBA) can reveal spatially localized patterns of aging. Although previous studies have examined anatomical contributors to GBA, no framework has been established to compute LBA using cortical morphology. To address this gap, we introduce a novel graph neural network (GNN) that uses morphometric features (cortical thickness, curvature, surface area, gray/white matter intensity ratio and sulcal depth) to estimate LBA across the cortical surface at high spatial resolution (mean inter-vertex distance = 1.37 mm). Trained on cortical surface meshes extracted from the MRIs of cognitively normal adults (N = 14,250), our GNN identifies prefrontal and parietal association cortices as early sites of morphometric aging, in concordance with biological theories of brain aging. Feature comparison using integrated gradients reveals that morphological aging is driven primarily by changes in surface area (gyral crowns and highly folded regions) and cortical thickness (occipital lobes), with additional contributions from gray/white matter intensity ratio (frontal lobes and sulcal troughs) and curvature (sulcal troughs). In Alzheimers disease (AD), as expected, the model identifies widespread, excessive morphological aging in parahippocampal gyri and related temporal structures. Significant associations are found between regional LBA gaps and neuropsychological measures descriptive of AD-related cognitive impairment, suggesting an intimate relationship between morphological cortical aging and cognitive decline. These results highlight the ability of GNN-derived gero-morphometry to provide insights into local brain aging.</description>

      <title>MetaboNet: The Largest Publicly Available Consolidated Dataset for Type 1 Diabetes Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Progress in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) algorithm development is limited by the fragmentation and lack of standardization across existing T1D management datasets. Current datasets differ substantially in structure and are time-consuming to access and process, which impedes data integration and reduces the comparability and generalizability of algorithmic developments. This work aims to establish a unified and accessible data resource for T1D algorithm development. Multiple publicly available T1D datasets were consolidated into a unified resource, termed the MetaboNet dataset. Inclusion required the availability of both continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data and corresponding insulin pump dosing records. Additionally, auxiliary information such as reported carbohydrate intake and physical activity was retained when present. The MetaboNet dataset comprises 3135 subjects and 1228 patient-years of overlapping CGM and insulin data, making it substantially larger than existing standalone benchmark datasets. The resource is distributed as a fully public subset available for immediate download at https://metabo-net.org/ , and with a Data Use Agreement (DUA)-restricted subset accessible through their respective application processes. For the datasets in the latter subset, processing pipelines are provided to automatically convert the data into the standardized MetaboNet format. A consolidated public dataset for T1D research is presented, and the access pathways for both its unrestricted and DUA-governed components are described. The resulting dataset covers a broad range of glycemic profiles and demographics and thus can yield more generalizable algorithmic performance than individual datasets.</description>
