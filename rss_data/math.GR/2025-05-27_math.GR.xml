      <title>Cayley graphs and their growth functions for multivalued groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the Cayley graph and its growth function for multivalued groups. We prove that if we change a finite set of generators of multivalued group, or change the starting point, we get an equivalent growth function. We prove that if we take a virtually nilpotent group and construct a coset group with respect a finite group of authomorphisms, then this multivalued group has a polynomial growth. Also, we find a connection between this growth function and growth function of multivalued dynamics. It particular, it is obtained upper and lower bounds on growth functions of multivalued dynamics. We give a particular answer to a question of Buchstaber on polynomial growth of dynamics and a question of Buchstaber and Vesnin on growth functions of cyclically presented multivalued groups.</description>

      <title>Dense and empty BNSR-invariants of the McCool groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An automorphism of the free group $F_n$ is called pure symmetric if it sends each generator to a conjugate of itself. The group $\mathrm{PSAut}_n$ of all pure symmetric automorphisms, and its quotient $\mathrm{PSOut}_n$ by the group of inner automorphisms, are called the McCool groups. In this paper we prove that every BNSR-invariant $\Sigma^m$ of a McCool group is either dense or empty in the character sphere, and we characterize precisely when each situation occurs. Our techniques involve understanding higher generation properties of abelian subgroups of McCool groups, coming from the McCullough-Miller space. We also investigate further properties of the second invariant $\Sigma^2$ for McCool groups, using a general criterion due to Meinert for a character to lie in $\Sigma^2$.</description>

      <title>A just-infinite iterated monodromy group without the congruence subgroup property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the iterated monodromy group of the polynomial $z^2+i$ is just-infinite, regular branch and does not have the congruence subgroup property. This yields the first example of an iterated monodromy group of a polynomial with these properties. Additional information is provided about the congruence kernel, rigid kernel and branch kernel of this group.</description>

      <title>On groups with EDT0L word problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the word problem for the infinite cyclic group is not EDT0L, and obtain as a corollary that a finitely generated group with EDT0L word problem must be torsion. In addition, we show that the property of having an EDT0L word problem is invariant under change of generating set and passing to finitely generated subgroups. This represents significant progress towards the conjecture that all groups with EDT0L word problem are finite (i.e. precisely the groups with regular word problem).</description>

      <title>Triangular and Unitriangular Factorization of Twisted Chevalley Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of triangular and unitriangular factorizations has been extensively studied for untwisted Chevalley groups, as well as for twisted Chevalley groups of types other than ${}^2A_{2n} \ (n \geq 1)$. However, the case of twisted Chevalley groups of type ${}^2A_{2n} \ (n \geq 1)$, has remained unresolved in the general setting of commutative rings. Prior work by A. Smolensky addressed this case only over certain fields, including finite fields and the field of complex numbers. These results indicate that, even over fields, the ${}^2A_{2n}$ case demands more refined techniques, reflecting the difficulty of extending such factorizations to the broader class of commutative rings.
  In this paper, we introduce two new classes of commutative rings: those satisfying the \emph{special stable range one condition} and those that are \emph{$\theta$-complete}. We discuss their basic properties and provide illustrative examples. Our main result establishes the existence of triangular and unitriangular factorizations for twisted Chevalley groups of type ${}^2A_{2n}$ over a certain class of commutative rings, which includes all fields, all local rings (with mild restrictions), and several other important classes of rings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that any reduced twisted group C*-algebra of a selfless group with the rapid decay property is selfless. As an application, we show that twisted group C*-algebras of acylindrically hyperbolic groups (possibly with nontrivial finite radical) and rapid decay are pure, and hence have strict comparison.</description>

      <title>Spectral selections, commutativity preservation and Coxeter-Lipschitz maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(W,S)$ be a Coxeter system whose graph is connected, with no infinite edges. A self-map $\tau$ of $W$ such that $\tau_{\sigma\theta}\in \{\tau_{\theta},\ \sigma\tau_{\theta}\}$ for all $\theta\in W$ and all reflections $\sigma$ (analogous to being 1-Lipschitz with respect to the Bruhat order on $W$) is either constant or a right translation. A somewhat stronger version holds for $S_n$, where it suffices that $\sigma$ range over smaller, $\theta$-dependent sets of reflections.
  These combinatorial results have a number of consequences concerning continuous spectrum- and commutativity-preserving maps $\mathrm{SU}(n)\to M_n$ defined on special unitary groups: every such map is a conjugation composed with (a) the identity; (b) transposition, or (c) a continuous diagonal spectrum selection. This parallels and recovers Petek's analogous statement for self-maps of the space $H_n\le M_n$ of self-adjoint matrices, strengthening it slightly by expanding the codomain to $M_n$.</description>

      <title>On Certain Problems in the Theory of Root Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry forward the work started by the author and Bhagwat in [1] and develop the Theory of root clusters further in this article. We establish the Inverse root capacity problem for number fields which is a generalization of Inverse cluster size problem for number fields proved in [1]. We give a field theoretic formulation for the concept of minimal generating sets of splitting fields which was introduced by the author and Vanchinathan in [4] and establish the existence of field extensions over number fields for given degree and given cardinality of minimal generating set of Galois closure dividing the degree. We improve on the inverse problems proved in [1] and this article by proving that there exist arbitrarily large finite families of pairwise non-isomorphic extensions having additional properties that satisfy the given conditions.</description>

      <title>Generic stabilizers in actions of simple algebraic groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:1904.13375v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we treat faithful actions of simple algebraic groups on irreducible modules and on the associated Grassmannian varieties. By explicit calculation, we show that in each case, with essentially one exception (only in characteristic 2), there is a dense open subset any point of which has stabilizer conjugate to a fixed subgroup, called the generic stabilizer. We provide tables listing generic stabilizers in the cases where they are non-trivial; in addition we decide whether or not there is a dense orbit, or a regular orbit for the action on the module.</description>

      <title>Determining skew left braces of size np</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the twofold semidirect product of two skew left braces, in which both the additive and multiplicative groups are semidirect products of the corresponding groups of the given skew left braces. We consider an odd prime $p$ and an integer $n$ satisfying $p\nmid n$, $p\nmid|\mathrm{Aut}(E)|$ for every group $E$ of order $n$ and such that each group of order $np$ has a unique $p$-Sylow subgroup. Under these conditions, we prove that any skew left brace of size $np$ is either a twofold semidirect product of the trivial brace of size $p$ and a skew left brace of size $n$ or a companion skew left brace of that one. We develop an algorithm to obtain all skew left braces of size $np$ from the skew left braces of size $n$ and provide a formula to count them. We use this result to describe all skew left braces of size $12p$ for $p\geq 7$, which proves a conjecture of V.G. Bardakov, M.V. Neshchadim and M.K. Yadav.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.10964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify natural conditions for a countable group acting on a countable tree which imply that the orbit equivalence relation of the induced action on the Gromov boundary is Borel hyperfinite. Examples of this condition include acylindrical actions. We also identify a natural weakening of the aforementioned conditions that implies measure hyperfinitenss of the boundary action. We then document examples of group actions on trees whose boundary action is not hyperfinite.</description>

      <title>Spherical growth of reciprocal classes in the Hecke Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma_p$ denote the Hecke group where $p=2r$, $r&gt;0$. Let $\mathcal{N}_l$ denote the set of conjugacy classes of reciprocal elements of word length $l$ in $\Gamma_p$. We prove that for $l \to \infty$,
  $$|\mathcal{N}_l| = \mathcal{O}\left(\left\lfloor \tfrac{l+1}{2} \right\rfloor^{s-1} \rho^{\left\lfloor \tfrac{l+1}{2} \right\rfloor} \right),
  $$
  where $\mathcal O$ is the `big O', $\rho \in [\sqrt{2}, 2]$ is the unique positive real root of
  $$
  p(x) = x^{r+1} - 2\sum_{j=1}^{r-1} x^{r-j} - 1,
  $$
  and $s$ is the maximal multiplicity among the roots of $p(x)$.
  Our method relies on the free product structure of the Hecke group $\Gamma_p$, a combinatorial counting function, and recurrence relations derived from cyclically reduced representatives. We also derive that the growth rate of the primitive reciprocal classes of word length $l$ is in agreement with that of $\mathcal{N}_l$. This work generalizes previous results for odd $p$ and provides an explicit asymptotic bound for all Hecke groups.</description>

      <title>On the stability of hyperbolicity under quantitative measure equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known result of Shalom says that lattices in SO$(n,1)$ are $\mathrm{L}^p$ measure equivalent for all $p&lt;n-1$. His proof actually yields the following stronger statement: the natural coupling resulting from a suitable choice of fundamental domains from a uniform lattice to a non-uniform one is $(\mathrm{L}^p,\mathrm{L}^{\infty})$. Moreover, it is easy to see that the coupling is cobounded: the fundamental domain of the uniform lattice is contained in a union of finitely many translates of the fundamental domain of the non-uniform one. The purpose of this note is to prove that this statement is sharp in the following sense: if a ME-coupling from a hyperbolic group to a non-hyperbolic group is cobounded and $(\mathrm{L}^p,\mathrm{L}^{\infty})$, then $p$ must be less than some $p_0$ only depending on the hyperbolic group.</description>

Abstract: We study the bounded cohomology and the stable commutator length of verbal wreath products \(\Gamma \wr^{_W}A\), where \(A\) has trivial bounded cohomology for a sufficiently large class of coefficients. We prove that the stable commutator length always vanishes, and that the bounded cohomology vanishes in positive degrees for some such verbal wreath products; including the standard restricted wreath products (extending a recent result by Monod for lamplighters groups), as well as verbal wreath products arising from n-solvable, \(n\)-nilpotent, and \(k\)-Burnside \((k = 2, 3, 4, 6)\) verbal products. As an application, we show that every group of type \(F_p\) isometrically embeds into a group of type \(F_p\) with vanishing bounded cohomology in positive degrees for a large class of coefficients.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the geometric property (T) for discretized warped cones of an action of finitely generated group $G$ on a compact metric space $M$. We show that if $M$ is a compact Riemannian manifold and the action is free, measure preserving, ergodic and isometric, then the associated discretized warped cone $\bigsqcup_n M\times \{t(n)\}$ does not have geometric property (T) for any sequence of positive numbers $\{t(n)\}_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ converging to $\infty$.
  As an application, we obtain new examples of expanders without geometric property (T).</description>

Abstract: We show that infinite cyclic subgroups of groups acting uniformly properly on injective metric spaces are uniformly undistorted. In the special case of hierarchically hyperbolic groups, we use this to study translation lengths for actions on the associated hyperbolic spaces. We then use quasimorphisms to produce examples where these latter results are sharp.</description>

      <title>On ordered groups of regular growth rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00549v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an elementary class of linearly ordered groups, called growth order groups, encompassing certain groups under composition of formal series (e.g. transseries) as well as certain groups $\mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{M}}$ of infinitely large germs at infinity of unary functions definable in an o-minimal structure $\mathcal{M}$. We study the algebraic structure of growth order groups and give methods for constructing examples. We show that if $\mathcal{M}$ expands the real ordered field and germs in $\mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{M}}$ are levelled in the sense of Marker &amp; Miller, then $\mathcal{G}_{\mathcal{M}}$ is a growth order group.</description>

      <title>Relatively Anosov groups: finiteness, measure of maximal entropy, and reparameterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a geometrically finite Kleinian group $\Gamma$, the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure is finite and is the unique measure of maximal entropy for the geodesic flow, as shown by Sullivan and Otal-Peign\'e respectively. Moreover, it is strongly mixing by a result of Babillot. We obtain a higher-rank analogue of this theorem. Given a relatively Anosov subgroup $\Gamma$ of a semisimple real algebraic group, there is a family of flow spaces parameterized by linear forms tangent to the growth indicator. We construct a reparameterization of each flow space by the geodesic flow on the Groves-Manning space of $\Gamma$ which exhibits exponential expansion along unstable foliations. Using this reparameterization, we prove that the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure of each flow space is finite and is the unique measure of maximal entropy. Moreover, it is strongly mixing.</description>
