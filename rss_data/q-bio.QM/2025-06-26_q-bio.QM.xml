      <title>Tube into pearls: A membrane-driven pearling instability shapes platelet biogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the end of the 19th century, Rayleigh and Plateau explained the physical principle behind the fragmentation of a liquid jet into regular droplets commonly observed in everyday life from a faucet. The classical Rayleigh-Plateau instability concerns liquid jets governed by inertia and surface tension, whereas biological tubes are membrane-bounded and inertia-free. We therefore refer to the process observed here as a pearling instability, formally analogous to Rayleigh-Plateau but dominated by membrane mechanics. Although pearling-type instabilities have long been recognised in lipid tubes and some biological systems, a clear physiological example remained elusive. Here, we present results showing that pearling instability occurs during the physiological process of platelet formation. Platelets are formed from megakaryocytes in the bone marrow by the extension of long protrusions, called proplatelets, that traverse the blood vessels. As they extend in the bloodstream, proplatelets become pearled and detach. Long and pearled proplatelets then circulate in the peripheral blood before their fragmentation into calibrated platelets. We propose that this pearling, by creating regular constrictions along the proplatelet, is key to the process of proplatelet fragmentation into individual platelets of calibrated size. Pearling instability thus acts as a mechanobiological regulator allowing local delivery of the right size platelets to the right place at the right time. Our observations quantitatively match parameter-free theoretical predictions for membrane pearling, supporting a unified physical picture.</description>

      <title>PocketVina Enables Scalable and Highly Accurate Physically Valid Docking through Multi-Pocket Conditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling physically valid ligand-binding poses remains a major challenge in molecular docking, particularly for unseen or structurally diverse targets. We introduce PocketVina, a fast and memory-efficient, search-based docking framework that combines pocket prediction with systematic multi-pocket exploration. We evaluate PocketVina across four established benchmarks--PDBbind2020 (timesplit and unseen), DockGen, Astex, and PoseBusters--and observe consistently strong performance in sampling physically valid docking poses. PocketVina achieves state-of-the-art performance when jointly considering ligand RMSD and physical validity (PB-valid), while remaining competitive with deep learning-based approaches in terms of RMSD alone, particularly on structurally diverse and previously unseen targets. PocketVina also maintains state-of-the-art physically valid docking accuracy across ligands with varying degrees of flexibility. We further introduce TargetDock-AI, a benchmarking dataset we curated, consisting of over 500000 protein-ligand pairs, and a partition of the dataset labeled with PubChem activity annotations. On this large-scale dataset, PocketVina successfully discriminates active from inactive targets, outperforming a deep learning baseline while requiring significantly less GPU memory and runtime. PocketVina offers a robust and scalable docking strategy that requires no task-specific training and runs efficiently on standard GPUs, making it well-suited for high-throughput virtual screening and structure-based drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Integrating Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics Modeling with Quantum Regression for Predicting Herbal Compound Toxicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Herbal compounds present complex toxicity profiles that are often influenced by both intrinsic chemical properties and pharmacokinetics (PK) governing absorption and clearance. In this study, we develop a quantum regression model to predict acute toxicity severity for herbal-derived compounds by integrating toxicity data from NICEATM with pharmacological features from TCMSP.</description>

      <title>Behavioral Traits as Dynamical Systems: Utilizing Entropy to Analyze Longitudinal Psychometric Data in Coupled Ordinary Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traits such as neuroticism persist across species despite exhibiting characteristics typically regarded as maladaptive. This project presents an alternative model for understanding the stability of such traits by integrating findings from the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study on Aging (Pedersen, 2015) (SATSA) with a system of recursive, biologically inspired ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To utilize the ODEs analytically, Shannon entropy is extracted from longitudinal Likert-scale psychometric data, enabling the translation of high-dimensional behavioral responses into continuous-time dynamical systems. The model incorporates principles from evolutionary biology, including mutation-selection balance, genetic pleiotropy and metabolic constraints, and embeds environmental feedback as a recursive driver of phenotypic expression. The argument is presented that traits such as neuroticism exist not stochastically, but as emergent multistable attractors within a biologically-constrained system. This paper shows that entropy extracted from longitudinal psychometric data can be meaningfully modeled using recursive ordinary differential equations, revealing stable dynamical attractors and biologically and environmentally grounded constraints in traits often deemed maladaptive. This framework offers a scalable, mathematically grounded foundation for analyzing phenotypic expression, with the ultimate goal of biological extension for eventual multi-omic modeling of behavioral traits.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated Modeling of Biological Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The complex regulatory dynamics of a biological network can be succinctly captured using discrete logic models. Given even sparse time-course data from the system of interest, previous work has shown that global optimization schemes are suitable for proposing logic models that explain the data and make predictions about how the system will behave under varying conditions. Considering the large scale of the parameter search spaces associated with these regulatory systems, performance optimizations on the level of both hardware and software are necessary for making this a practical tool for in silico pharmaceutical research. We show here how the implementation of these global optimization algorithms in a GPU-computing environment can accelerate the solution of these parameter search problems considerably. We carry out parameter searches on two model biological regulatory systems that represent almost an order of magnitude scale-up in complexity, and we find the gains in efficiency from GPU to be a 33%-43% improvement compared to multi-thread CPU implementations and a 33%-1866% increase compared to CPU in serial. These improvements make global optimization of logic model identification a far more attractive and feasible method for in silico hypothesis generation and design of experiments.</description>

      <title>Papanicolaou Stain Unmixing for RGB Image Using Weighted Nucleus Sparsity and Total Variation Regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Papanicolaou stain, consisting of eosin Y, hematoxylin, light Green SF yellowish, orange G, and Bismarck brown Y, provides extensive color information essential for cervical cancer screening in cytopathology. However, the visual observation of these colors is subjective and difficult to characterize. In digital image analysis, the RGB intensities are affected by staining and imaging variations, hindering direct quantification of color in Papanicolaou-stained samples. Stain unmixing is a promising alternative that quantifies the amounts of dyes. In previous work, multispectral imaging was utilized to estimate the dye amounts of Papanicolaou stain for quantitative diagnosis. Still, its application to RGB images presents a challenge since the number of dyes exceeds the three RGB channels. This paper proposes a novel Papanicolaou stain unmixing method for RGB images that incorporates three key assumptions: nonnegative stain abundances; a sparse spatial distribution of hematoxylin, which binds to nuclei; and piecewise smoothness of stain abundances. By formulating this as an optimization problem with nonnegativity, weighted nucleus sparsity, and total variation regularizations, our method achieved excellent performance in stain quantification when validated against the results of multispectral imaging. We also adopted the proposed method for discriminating lobular endocervical glandular hyperplasia (LEGH), a precancerous lesion of gastric-type adenocarcinoma of the cervix. The resulting quantification distinctly characterized differences between LEGH and normal endocervical cells with stain abundance, and a classifier based on the quantification results achieved 98.0% accuracy. This demonstrates the significant potential of RGB-based stain unmixing for quantitative diagnosis.</description>

      <title>Screen Them All: High-Throughput Pan-Cancer Genetic and Phenotypic Biomarker Screening from H&amp;E Whole Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular assays are standard of care for detecting genomic alterations in cancer prognosis and therapy selection but are costly, tissue-destructive and time-consuming. Artificial intelligence (AI) applied to routine hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E)-stained whole slide images (WSIs) offers a fast and economical alternative for screening molecular biomarkers. We introduce OmniScreen, a high-throughput AI-based system leveraging Virchow2 embeddings extracted from 60,529 cancer patients with paired 489-gene MSK-IMPACT targeted biomarker panel and WSIs. Unlike conventional approaches that train separate models for each biomarker, OmniScreen employs a unified model to predict a broad range of clinically relevant biomarkers across cancers, including low-prevalence targets impractical to model individually. OmniScreen reliably identifies therapeutic targets and shared phenotypic features across common and rare tumors. We investigate the biomarker prediction probabilities and accuracies of OmniScreen in relation to tumor area, cohort size, histologic subtype alignment, and pathway-level morphological patterns. These findings underscore the potential of OmniScreen for routine clinical screening.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01561v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial omics assays allow for the molecular characterisation of cells in their spatial context. Notably, the two main technological streams, imaging-based and high-throughput sequencing-based, can give rise to very different data modalities. The characteristics of the two data types are well known in adjacent fields such as spatial statistics as point patterns and lattice data, and there is a wide range of tools available. This paper discusses the application of spatial statistics to spatially-resolved omics data and in particular, discusses various advantages, challenges, and nuances. This work is accompanied by a vignette, pasta, that showcases the usefulness of spatial statistics in biology using several R packages.</description>

      <title>Predictive Modeling, Pattern Recognition, and Spatiotemporal Representations of Plant Growth in Simulated and Controlled Environments: A Comprehensive Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10538v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate predictions and representations of plant growth patterns in simulated and controlled environments are important for addressing various challenges in plant phenomics research. This review explores various works on state-of-the-art predictive pattern recognition techniques, focusing on the spatiotemporal modeling of plant traits and the integration of dynamic environmental interactions. We provide a comprehensive examination of deterministic, probabilistic, and generative modeling approaches, emphasizing their applications in high-throughput phenotyping and simulation-based plant growth forecasting. Key topics include regressions and neural network-based representation models for the task of forecasting, limitations of existing experiment-based deterministic approaches, and the need for dynamic frameworks that incorporate uncertainty and evolving environmental feedback. This review surveys advances in 2D and 3D structured data representations through functional-structural plant models and conditional generative models. We offer a perspective on opportunities for future works, emphasizing the integration of domain-specific knowledge to data-driven methods, improvements to available datasets, and the implementation of these techniques toward real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Protein Structure Tokenization: Benchmarking and New Recipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the development of protein structural tokenization methods, which chunk protein 3D structures into discrete or continuous representations. Structure tokenization enables the direct application of powerful techniques like language modeling for protein structures, and large multimodal models to integrate structures with protein sequences and functional texts. Despite the progress, the capabilities and limitations of these methods remain poorly understood due to the lack of a unified evaluation framework. We first introduce StructTokenBench, a framework that comprehensively evaluates the quality and efficiency of structure tokenizers, focusing on fine-grained local substructures rather than global structures, as typical in existing benchmarks. Our evaluations reveal that no single model dominates all benchmarking perspectives. Observations of codebook under-utilization led us to develop AminoAseed, a simple yet effective strategy that enhances codebook gradient updates and optimally balances codebook size and dimension for improved tokenizer utilization and quality. Compared to the leading model ESM3, our method achieves an average of 6.31% performance improvement across 24 supervised tasks, with sensitivity and utilization rates increased by 12.83% and 124.03%, respectively.

      <title>Effective Stimulus Propagation in Neural Circuits: Driver Node Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precise control of signal propagation in modular neural networks represents a fundamental challenge in computational neuroscience. We establish a framework for identifying optimal control nodes that maximize stimulus transmission between weakly coupled neural populations. Using spiking stochastic block model networks, we systematically compare driver node selection strategies - including random sampling and topology-based centrality measures (degree, betweenness, closeness, eigenvector, harmonic, and percolation centrality) - to determine minimal control inputs for achieving inter-population synchronization. Targeted stimulation of just 10-20% of the most central neurons in the source population significantly enhances spiking propagation fidelity compared to random selection. This approach yields a 64-fold increase in signal transfer efficiency at critical inter-module connection densities. These findings establish a theoretical foundation for precision neuromodulation in biological neural systems and neurotechnology applications.</description>
