      <title>A Rydberg atom based system for benchmarking mmWave automotive radar chips</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic sensors and receivers have enabled sensitive and traceable measurements of RF fields at a wide range of frequencies. Here we demonstrate the detection of electric field amplitude in the extremely high frequency (EHF) band, at $131\ \mathrm{GHz}$. In our approach we propagate the EHF field in a beam, with control over its direction and polarization at the detector using photonic waveplates. This way, we take advantage of the highest detection sensitivity, registered for collinear propagation and circular polarization. To exhibit the potential for applications in this kind of Rydberg-atom based detection, we perform test measurements on the EHF field emitted from an on-chip radar, planned to be used in automotive industry as a vital sign detector. Our work elucidates practical applications of Rydberg-atom media as well as photonic metamaterial elements.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Nanomechanical Resonators: Sensitivity, Response Time, and Practical Considerations in Photothermal Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanomechanical photothermal sensing has significantly advanced single-molecule/particle microscopy and spectroscopy, and infrared detection through the use of nanomechanical resonators that detect shifts in resonant frequency due to photothermal heating. However, the relationship between resonator design, photothermal sensitivity, and response time remains unclear. This paper compares three resonator types - strings, drumheads, and trampolines - to explore this relationship. Through theoretical modeling, experimental validation, and finite element method simulations, we find that strings offer the highest sensitivity (with a noise equivalent power of 280 fW/Hz$^{1/2}$ for strings made of silicon nitride), while drumheads exhibit the fastest thermal response. The study reveals that photothermal sensitivity correlates with the average temperature rise and not the peak temperature. Finally, the impact of photothermal back-action is discussed, which can be a major source of frequency instability. This work clarifies the performance differences and limits among resonator designs and guides the development of advanced nanomechanical photothermal sensors, benefiting a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Two-photon polymerization of optical microresonators for precise pH sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In water monitoring, environmental analysis, cell culture stability, and biomedical applications, precise pH control is demanded. Traditional methods like pH strips and meters have limitations: pH strips lack precision, while electrochemical meters, though more accurate, are fragile, prone to drift, and unsuitable for small volumes. In this paper, we propose a method for optical detection of the pH value based on the multiplexed sensor with 4D microcavities fabricated with two-photon polymerization. This approach employs pH-triggered reversible variations in microresonator geometry and integrates hundreds of dual optically coupled 4D microcavities to achieve the detection limit of 0.003 pH units. The proposed solution is a clear instance for the use-case oriented application of the two-photon polymerized structures of high optical quality. With benefits of the multiplexed imaging platform, dual 4D microresonators can be integrated alongside other microresonator types for pH-corrected biochemical studies.</description>

      <title>Cavity engineered phonon-mediated superconductivity in MgB$_2$ from first principles quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong laser pulses can control superconductivity, inducing non-equilibrium transient pairing by leveraging strong-light matter interaction. Here we demonstrate theoretically that equilibrium ground-state phonon-mediated superconductive pairing can be affected through the vacuum fluctuating electromagnetic field in a cavity. Using the recently developed $\textit{ab initio}$ quantum electrodynamical density-functional theory approximation, we specifically investigate the phonon-mediated superconductive behavior of MgB$_2$ under different cavity setups and find that in the strong-light matter coupling regime its superconducting transition temperature can be enhanced by $\approx 73\%$ ($\approx 40\%$) in an in-plane (out-of-plane) polarized cavity. The results highlight that strong-light matter coupling in extended systems can profoundly alter material properties in a non-perturbative way by modifying their electronic structure and phononic dispersion at the same time. Our findings indicate a pathway to the experimental realization of light-controlled superconductivity in solid-state materials at equilibrium via cavity-material engineering.</description>

      <title>Leveraging KANs For Enhanced Deep Koopman Operator Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLP's) have been extensively utilized in discovering Deep Koopman operators for linearizing nonlinear dynamics. With the emergence of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as a more efficient and accurate alternative to the MLP Neural Network, we propose a comparison of the performance of each network type in the context of learning Koopman operators with control. In this work, we propose a KANs-based deep Koopman framework with applications to an orbital Two-Body Problem (2BP) and the pendulum for data-driven discovery of linear system dynamics. KANs were found to be superior in nearly all aspects of training; learning 31 times faster, being 15 times more parameter efficiency, and predicting 1.25 times more accurately as compared to the MLP Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the case of the 2BP. Thus, KANs shows potential for being an efficient tool in the development of Deep Koopman Theory.</description>
