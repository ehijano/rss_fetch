      <title>Smoothly vanishing density in the contact process by an interplay of disorder and long-distance dispersal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realistic modeling of ecological population dynamics requires spatially explicit descriptions that can take into account spatial heterogeneity as well as long-distance dispersal. Here, we present Monte Carlo simulations and numerical renormalization group results for the paradigmatic model, the contact process, in the combined presence of these factors in both one and two-dimensional systems. Our results confirm our analytic arguments stating that the density vanishes smoothly at the extinction threshold, in a way characteristic of infinite-order transitions. This extremely smooth vanishing of the global density entails an enhanced exposure of the population to extinction events. At the same time, a reverse order parameter, the local persistence displays a discontinuity characteristic of mixed-order transitions, as it approaches a non-universal critical value algebraically with an exponent $\beta_p'&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Biparental Reproduction may Enhance Species Sustainability by Conserving Shared Parental Traits more Faithfully than Monoparental Reproduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recognized effects of sexual reproduction and other forms of biparental reproduction in species sustainment and evolution include the increasing of diversity, accelerating adaptation, constraining the accumulation of deleterious mutations, and the homogenization of species genotype. Nevertheless, many questions remain open with regard to the evolution of biparental reproduction. In this paper we contribute an initial exploration of finer details of the homogenization effect that we believe deserve focused analysis and discussion. Specifically, rudimentary mathematical analyses suggest the perspective that biparental reproduction enhances the retention in the offspring of shared, i.e., common, properties of the parent generation, as compared with monoparental, clonal reproduction. We argue that this is an intrinsic effect of merging the encodings of parents' traits, regardless of physical, chemical, biological and social aspects of the reproduction process and of the trait at hand. As the survival of offspring often depends on their ability to step in and actively fill the voids left by failing, dying or absent members of the species in interaction networks that sustain the species, cross-generation retention of common species properties helps sustain the species. This side-effect of sexual reproduction may have also contributed to the very evolution and pervasiveness of sexual reproduction in nature.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning of Phylogenetic Trees via Split-Weight Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unsupervised learning has become a staple in classical machine learning, successfully identifying clustering patterns in data across a broad range of domain applications. Surprisingly, despite its accuracy and elegant simplicity, unsupervised learning has not been sufficiently exploited in the realm of phylogenetic tree inference. The main reason for the delay in adoption of unsupervised learning in phylogenetics is the lack of a meaningful, yet simple, way of embedding phylogenetic trees into a vector space. Here, we propose the simple yet powerful split-weight embedding which allows us to fit standard clustering algorithms to the space of phylogenetic trees. We show that our split-weight embedded clustering is able to recover meaningful evolutionary relationships in simulated and real (Adansonia baobabs) data.</description>

      <title>New Trends on the Systems Approach to Modeling SARS-CoV-2 Pandemics in a Globally Connected Planet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a critical analysis of the literature and perspective research ideas for modeling the epidemics caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It goes beyond deterministic population dynamics to consider several key complexity features of the system under consideration. In particular, the multiscale features of the dynamics from contagion to the subsequent dynamics of competition between the immune system and the proliferating virus. Other topics addressed in this work include the propagation of epidemics in a territory, taking into account local transportation networks, the heterogeneity of the population, and the study of social and economic problems in populations involved in the spread of epidemics. The overall content aims to show how new mathematical tools can be developed to address the above topics and how mathematical models and simulations can contribute to the decision making of crisis managers.</description>
