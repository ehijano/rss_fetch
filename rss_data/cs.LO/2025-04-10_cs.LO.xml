      <title>On Coalgebraic Product Constructions for Markov Chains and Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Verifying traces of systems is a central topic in formal verification. We study model checking of Markov chains (MCs) against temporal properties represented as (finite) automata. For instance, given an MC and a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), a simple but practically useful model checking problem asks for the probability of traces on the MC that are accepted by the DFA. A standard approach to solving this problem constructs a product MC of the given MC and DFA, reducing the task to a simple reachability probability problem on the resulting product MC.
  In this paper, on top of our recent development of coalgebraic framework, we first present a no-go theorem for product constructions, showing a case when we cannot do product constructions for model checking. Specifically, we show that there are no coalgebraic product MCs of MCs and nondeterministic finite automata for computing the probability of the accepting traces. This no-go theorem is established via a characterisation of natural transformations between certain functors that determine the type of branching, including nondeterministic or probabilistic branching.
  Second, we present a coalgebraic product construction of MCs and multiset finite automata (MFAs) as a new instance within our framework. This construction addresses a model checking problem that asks for the expected number of accepting runs on MFAs over traces of MCs. The problem is reduced to solving linear equations, which is solvable in polynomial-time under a reasonable assumption that ensures the finiteness of the solution.</description>

      <title>When is the partial map classifier a Sierpi\'nski cone?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relationship between partial map classifiers, Sierpi\'nski cones, and axioms for synthetic higher categories and domains within univalent foundations. In particular, we show that synthetic $\infty$-categories are closed under partial map classifiers assuming Phoa's principle, and we isolate a new reflective subuniverse of types within which the Sierpi\'nski cone (a lax colimit) can be computed as a partial map classifier by strengthening the Segal condition.</description>

      <title>A Uniform Framework for Handling Position Constraints in String Solving (Technical Report)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel decision procedure for solving the class of position string constraints, which includes string disequalities, not-prefixof, not-suffixof, str.at, and not-str.at. These constraints are generated frequently in almost any application of string constraint solving. Our procedure avoids expensive encoding of the constraints to word equations and, instead, reduces the problem to checking conflicts on positions satisfying an integer constraint obtained from the Parikh image of a polynomial-sized finite automaton with a special structure. By the reduction to counting, solving position constraints becomes NP-complete and for some cases even falls into PTime. This is much cheaper than the previously used techniques, which either used reductions generating word equations and length constraints (for which modern string solvers use exponential-space algorithms) or incomplete techniques. Our method is relevant especially for automata-based string solvers, which have recently achieved the best results in terms of practical efficiency, generality, and completeness guarantees. This work allows them to excel also on position constraints, which used to be their weakness. Besides the efficiency gains, we show that our framework may be extended to solve a large fragment of not-contains (in NExpTime), for which decidability has been long open, and gives a hope to solve the general problem. Our implementation of the technique within the Z3-Noodler solver significantly improves its performance on position constraints.</description>

      <title>Recasting Arrow's Impossibility Theorem as G\"odelian Incomputability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Incomputability results in formal logic and the Theory of Computation (i.e., incompleteness and undecidability) have deep implications for the foundations of mathematics and computer science. Likewise, Social Choice Theory, a branch of Welfare Economics, contains several impossibility results that place limits on the potential fairness, rationality and consistency of social decision-making processes. A formal relationship between G\"odel's Incompleteness Theorems in formal logic, and Arrow's Impossibility Theorem in Social Choice Theory has long been conjectured. In this paper, we address this gap by bringing these two theories closer by introducing a general mathematical object called a Self-Reference System. Impossibility in Social Choice Theory is demonstrated to correspond to the impossibility of a Self-Reference System to interpret its own internal consistency. We also provide a proof of G\"odel's First Incompleteness Theorem in the same terms. Together, this recasts Arrow's Impossibility Theorem as incomputability in the G\"odelian sense. The incomputability results in both fields are shown to arise out of self-referential paradoxes. This is exemplified by a new proof of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem centred around Condorcet Paradoxes.</description>

      <title>Computably discrete represented spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In computable topology, a represented space is called computably discrete if its equality predicate is semidecidable. While any such space is classically isomorphic to an initial segment of the natural numbers, the computable-isomorphism types of computably discrete represented spaces exhibit a rich structure. We show that the widely studied class of computably enumerable equivalence relations (ceers) corresponds precisely to the computably Quasi-Polish computably discrete spaces. We employ computably discrete spaces to exhibit several separating examples in computable topology. We construct a computably discrete computably Quasi-Polish space admitting no decidable properties, a computably discrete and computably Hausdorff precomputably Quasi-Polish space admitting no computable injection into the natural numbers, a two-point space which is computably Hausdorff but not computably discrete, and a two-point space which is computably discrete but not computably Hausdorff. We further expand an example due to Weihrauch that separates computably regular spaces from computably normal spaces.</description>

      <title>$\Pi$-NeSy: A Possibilistic Neuro-Symbolic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a neuro-symbolic approach that combines a low-level perception task performed by a neural network with a high-level reasoning task performed by a possibilistic rule-based system. The goal is to be able to derive for each input instance the degree of possibility that it belongs to a target (meta-)concept. This (meta-)concept is connected to intermediate concepts by a possibilistic rule-based system. The probability of each intermediate concept for the input instance is inferred using a neural network. The connection between the low-level perception task and the high-level reasoning task lies in the transformation of neural network outputs modeled by probability distributions (through softmax activation) into possibility distributions. The use of intermediate concepts is valuable for the explanation purpose: using the rule-based system, the classification of an input instance as an element of the (meta-)concept can be justified by the fact that intermediate concepts have been recognized.
  From the technical side, our contribution consists of the design of efficient methods for defining the matrix relation and the equation system associated with a possibilistic rule-based system. The corresponding matrix and equation are key data structures used to perform inferences from a possibilistic rule-based system and to learn the values of the rule parameters in such a system according to a training data sample. Furthermore, leveraging recent results on the handling of inconsistent systems of fuzzy relational equations, an approach for learning rule parameters according to multiple training data samples is presented. Experiments carried out on the MNIST addition problems and the MNIST Sudoku puzzles problems highlight the effectiveness of our approach compared with state-of-the-art neuro-symbolic ones.</description>

      <title>Efficient Ranking Function-Based Termination Analysis with Bi-Directional Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05951v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synthesizing ranking functions is a common technique for proving the termination of loops. A ranking function must be bounded and decrease by a specified amount with each iteration for all reachable program states. However, the set of reachable program states is often unknown, and loop invariants are typically used to overapproximate it. So, proving the termination of a loop requires searching for both a ranking function and a loop invariant. Existing ranking function-based termination analysis techniques can be broadly categorized as (i) those that synthesize the ranking function and invariants independently, (ii) those that combine invariant synthesis with ranking function synthesis into a single query, and (iii) those that offer limited feedback from ranking function synthesis to guide invariant synthesis. These approaches either suffer from having too large a search space or inefficiently exploring the smaller, individual search spaces. In this work, we present a novel termination analysis framework Syndicate, which exploits bi-directional feedback to guide the searches for both ranking functions and invariants, increasing the number of programs that can be proven to terminate and reduces the average time needed to prove termination compared to baselines. Syndicate is general and allows different instantiations of templates, subprocedures, and parameters, offering users the flexibility to optimize the ranking function synthesis. Depending on the templates used, Syndicate is relatively complete and efficient, outperforming existing techniques that achieve at most one of these guarantees. Notably, despite a simpler approach compared to the baselines, Syndicate's performance is either comparable to or better than existing tools in terms of the number of benchmarks proved and average runtime.</description>

      <title>Verifying Equilibria in Finite-Horizon Probabilistic Concurrent Game Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14690v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-horizon probabilistic multiagent concurrent game systems, also known as finite multiplayer stochastic games, are a well-studied model in computer science due to their ability to represent a wide range of real-world scenarios involving strategic interactions among agents over a finite amount of iterations (given by the finite-horizon). The analysis of these games typically focuses on evaluating (verifying) and computing (synthesizing/realizing) which strategy profiles (functions that represent the behavior of each agent) qualify as equilibria. The two most prominent equilibrium concepts are the Nash equilibrium and the subgame perfect equilibrium, with the latter considered a conceptual refinement of the former. However, computing these equilibria from scratch is often computationally infeasible. Therefore, recent attention has shifted to the verification problem, where a given strategy profile must be evaluated to determine whether it satisfies equilibrium conditions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the verification problem for subgame perfect equilibria lies in PSPACE, while for Nash equilibria, it is EXPTIME-complete. This is a highly counterintuitive result since subgame perfect equilibria are often seen as a strict strengthening of Nash equilibria and are intuitively seen as more complicated.</description>

      <title>On the Nature of Fractal Numbers and the Classical Continuum Hypothesis (CH)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a reinterpretation of the continuum grounded in the stratified structure of definability rather than classical cardinality. In this framework, a real number is not an abstract point on the number line, but an object expressible at some level Fn of a formal hierarchy. We introduce the notion of "fractal numbers" -- entities defined not within a fixed set-theoretic universe, but through layered expressibility across constructive systems. This reconceptualizes irrationality as a relative property, depending on definability depth, and replaces the binary dichotomy between countable and uncountable sets with a gradated spectrum of definability classes. We show that the classical Continuum Hypothesis loses its force in this context: between aleph_0 and c lies not a single cardinal jump, but a stratified sequence of definitional stages, each forming a countable yet irreducible approximation to the continuum. We argue that the real line should not be seen as a completed totality but as an evolving architecture of formal expressibility. We conclude with a discussion of rational invariants, the relativity of irrationality, and the emergence of a fractal metric for definitional density.</description>
