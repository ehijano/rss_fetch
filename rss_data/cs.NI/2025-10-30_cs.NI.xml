      <title>A Zero Added Loss Multiplexing (ZALM) Source Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero Added Loss Multiplexing (ZALM) offers broadband, per channel heralded EPR pairs, with a rich parameter space that allows its performance to be tailored for specific applications. We present a modular ZALM simulator that demonstrates how design choices affect output rate and fidelity. Built in NetSquid with QSI controllers, it exposes 20+ tunable parameters, supports IDEAL and REALISTIC modes, and provides reusable components for Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) sources, interference, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) filtering, fiber delay, active polarization gates, detectors, and lossy fiber. Physics based models capture Hong Ou Mandel (HOM) visibility, insertion loss, detector efficiency, gate errors, and attenuation. Using this tool, we map trade offs among fidelity, link distance, and entangled pairs per use, and show how SPDC bandwidth and DWDM grid spacing steer performance. Using the default configuration settings, average fidelity emains constant at 0.8 but the ebit rate decreases from 0.0175 at the source to 0.0 at 50 km; narrowing the SPDC degeneracy bandwidth increases the ebit rate significantly without affecting fidelity. The simulator enables codesign of source, filtering, and feedforward settings for specific quantum memories and integrates as a building block for end to end quantum network studies.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Dynamic Equilibria in Joint Path Selection and Congestion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Path-aware networking, a cornerstone of next-generation architectures like SCION and Multipath QUIC, empowers end-hosts with fine-grained control over traffic forwarding. This capability, however, introduces a critical stability risk: uncoordinated, greedy path selection by a multitude of agents can induce persistent, high-amplitude network oscillations. While this phenomenon is well-known, its quantitative performance impact across key metrics has remained poorly understood. In this paper, we address this gap by developing the first axiomatic framework for analyzing the joint dynamics of path selection and congestion control. Our model enables the formal characterization of the system's dynamic equilibria-the stable, periodic patterns of oscillation-and provides a suite of axioms to rate their performance in terms of efficiency, loss avoidance, convergence, fairness, and responsiveness. Our analysis reveals a fundamental trade-off in protocol design between predictable performance (efficiency, convergence) and user-centric goals (fairness, responsiveness). We prove, however, that no such trade-off exists among efficiency, convergence, and loss avoidance, which can be simultaneously optimized through careful parameter tuning. Furthermore, we find that agent migration can, counter-intuitively, enhance stability by de-synchronizing traffic, a theoretical result validated by our simulations. These findings provide a principled design map for engineering robust, high-performance protocols for the future path-aware Internet.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Driven Asynchronous Forwarding for Reliable Distributed Coordination in Toroidal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of large-scale distributed systems, such as satellite constellations and high-performance computing clusters, demands robust communication primitives that maintain coordination under unreliable links. The torus topology, with its inherent rotational and reflection symmetries, is a prevalent architecture in these domains. However, conventional routing schemes suffer from substantial packet loss during control-plane synchronization after link failures. This paper introduces a symmetry-driven asynchronous forwarding mechanism that leverages the torus's geometric properties to achieve reliable packet delivery without control-plane coordination. We model packet flow using a topological potential gradient and demonstrate that symmetry-breaking failures naturally induce a reverse flow, which we harness for fault circumvention. We propose two local forwarding strategies, Reverse Flow with Counter-facing Priority (RF-CF) and Lateral-facing Priority (RF-LF), that guarantee reachability to the destination via forward-flow phase transition points, without protocol modifications or additional in-packet overhead. Through percolation analysis and packet-level simulations on a 16 x 16 torus, we show that our mechanism reduces packet loss by up to 17.5% under a 1% link failure rate, with the RF-LF strategy contributing to 28% of successfully delivered packets. This work establishes a foundational link between topological symmetry and communication resilience, providing a lightweight, protocol-agnostic substrate for enhancing distributed systems.</description>

      <title>FGGM: Formal Grey-box Gradient Method for Attacking DRL-based MU-MIMO Scheduler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 5G mobile communication systems, MU-MIMO has been applied to enhance spectral efficiency and support high data rates. To maximize spectral efficiency while providing fairness among users, the base station (BS) needs to selects a subset of users for data transmission. Given that this problem is NP-hard, DRL-based methods have been proposed to infer the near-optimal solutions in real-time, yet this approach has an intrinsic security problem. This paper investigates how a group of adversarial users can exploit unsanitized raw CSIs to launch a throughput degradation attack. Most existing studies only focused on systems in which adversarial users can obtain the exact values of victims' CSIs, but this is impractical in the case of uplink transmission in LTE/5G mobile systems. We note that the DRL policy contains an observation normalizer which has the mean and variance of the observation to improve training convergence. Adversarial users can then estimate the upper and lower bounds of the local observations including the CSIs of victims based solely on that observation normalizer. We develop an attacking scheme FGGM by leveraging polytope abstract domains, a technique used to bound the outputs of a neural network given the input ranges. Our goal is to find one set of intentionally manipulated CSIs which can achieve the attacking goals for the whole range of local observations of victims. Experimental results demonstrate that FGGM can determine a set of adversarial CSI vector controlled by adversarial users, then reuse those CSIs throughout the simulation to reduce the network throughput of a victim up to 70\% without knowing the exact value of victims' local observations. This study serves as a case study and can be applied to many other DRL-based problems, such as a knapsack-oriented resource allocation problems.</description>

      <title>From req/res to pub/sub: Exploring Media over QUIC Transport for DNS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The DNS is a key component of the Internet. Originally designed to facilitate the resolution of host names to IP addresses, its scope has continuously expanded over the years, today covering use cases such as load balancing or service discovery. While DNS was initially conceived as a rather static directory service in which resource records (RR) only change rarely, we have seen a number of use cases over the years where a DNS flavor that isn't purely based upon requesting and caching RRs, but rather on an active distribution of updates for all resolvers that showed interest in the respective records in the past, would be preferable. In this paper, we thus explore a publish-subscribe variant of DNS based on the Media-over-QUIC architecture, where we devise a strawman system and protocol proposal to enable pushing RR updates. We provide a prototype implementation, finding that DNS can benefit from a publish-subscribe variant: next to limiting update traffic, it can considerably reduce the time it takes for a resolver to receive the latest version of a record, thereby supporting use cases such as load balancing in content distribution networks. The publish-subscribe architecture also brings new challenges to the DNS, including a higher overhead for endpoints due to additional state management, and increased query latencies on first lookup, due to session establishment latencies.</description>

      <title>Joint Computing Resource Allocation and Task Offloading in Vehicular Fog Computing Systems Under Asymmetric Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicular fog computing (VFC) has emerged as a promising paradigm, which leverages the idle computational resources of nearby fog vehicles (FVs) to complement the computing capabilities of conventional vehicular edge computing. However, utilizing VFC to meet the delay-sensitive and computation-intensive requirements of the FVs poses several challenges. First, the limited resources of road side units (RSUs) struggle to accommodate the growing and diverse demands of vehicles. This limitation is further exacerbated by the information asymmetry between the controller and FVs due to the reluctance of FVs to disclose private information and to share resources voluntarily. This information asymmetry hinders the efficient resource allocation and coordination. Second, the heterogeneity in task requirements and the varying capabilities of RSUs and FVs complicate efficient task offloading, thereby resulting in inefficient resource utilization and potential performance degradation. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical VFC architecture that incorporates the computing capabilities of both RSUs and FVs. Then, we formulate a delay minimization optimization problem (DMOP), which is an NP-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. To solve the DMOP, we propose a joint computing resource allocation and task offloading approach (JCRATOA). Specifically, we propose a convex optimization-based method for RSU resource allocation and a contract theory-based incentive mechanism for FV resource allocation. Moreover, we present a two-sided matching method for task offloading by employing the matching game. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed JCRATOA is able to achieve superior performances in task completion delay, task completion ratio, system throughput, and resource utilization fairness, while effectively meeting the satisfying constraints.</description>

      <title>Wireless Memory Approximation for Energy-efficient Task-specific IoT Data Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) for storing Machine Learning (ML) models plays a critical role in accelerating ML inference tasks in the next generation of communication systems. However, periodic refreshment of DRAM results in wasteful energy consumption during standby periods, which is significant for resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices. To solve this problem, this work advocates two novel approaches: 1) wireless memory activation and 2) wireless memory approximation. These enable the wireless devices to efficiently manage the available memory by considering the timing aspects and relevance of ML model usage; hence, reducing the overall energy consumption. Numerical results show that our proposed scheme can realize smaller energy consumption than the always-on approach while satisfying the retrieval accuracy constraint.</description>

      <title>Low-Altitude UAV-Carried Movable Antenna for Joint Wireless Power Transfer and Covert Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) networks has created an urgent need for sustainable energy solutions, particularly for the battery-constrained spatially distributed IoT nodes. While low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) employed with wireless power transfer (WPT) capabilities offer a promising solution, the line-of-sight channels that facilitate efficient energy delivery also expose sensitive operational data to adversaries. This paper proposes a novel low-altitude UAV-carried movable antenna-enhanced transmission system joint WPT and covert communications, which simultaneously performs energy supplements to IoT nodes and establishes transmission links with a covert user by leveraging wireless energy signals as a natural cover. Then, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that jointly maximizes the total harvested energy of IoT nodes and sum achievable rate of the covert user, while minimizing the propulsion energy consumption of the low-altitude UAV. To address the non-convex and temporally coupled optimization problem, we propose a mixture-of-experts-augmented soft actor-critic (MoE-SAC) algorithm that employs a sparse Top-K gated mixture-of-shallow-experts architecture to represent multimodal policy distributions arising from the conflicting optimization objectives. We also incorporate an action projection module that explicitly enforces per-time-slot power budget constraints and antenna position constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms some baseline approaches and other state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Pre-Padding: Generating Evasive Network Traffic Against Transformer-Based Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To date, traffic obfuscation techniques have been widely adopted to protect network data privacy and security by obscuring the true patterns of traffic. Nevertheless, as the pre-trained models emerge, especially transformer-based classifiers, existing traffic obfuscation methods become increasingly vulnerable, as witnessed by current studies reporting the traffic classification accuracy up to 99\% or higher. To counter such high-performance transformer-based classification models, we in this paper propose a novel and effective \underline{adv}ersarial \underline{traffic}-generating approach (AdvTraffic\footnote{The code and data are available at: http://xxx}). Our approach has two key innovations: (i) a pre-padding strategy is proposed to modify packets, which effectively overcomes the limitations of existing research against transformer-based models for network traffic classification; and (ii) a reinforcement learning model is employed to optimize network traffic perturbations, aiming to maximize adversarial effectiveness against transformer-based classification models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply adversarial perturbation techniques to defend against transformer-based traffic classifiers. Furthermore, our method can be easily deployed into practical network environments. Finally, multi-faceted experiments are conducted across several real-world datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can effectively undermine transformer-based classifiers, significantly reducing classification accuracy from 99\% to as low as 25.68\%.</description>

Abstract: The rapid rise of AI agents presents urgent challenges in authentication, authorization, and identity management. Current agent-centric protocols (like MCP) highlight the demand for clarified best practices in authentication and authorization. Looking ahead, ambitions for highly autonomous agents raise complex long-term questions regarding scalable access control, agent-centric identities, AI workload differentiation, and delegated authority. This OpenID Foundation whitepaper is for stakeholders at the intersection of AI agents and access management. It outlines the resources already available for securing today's agents and presents a strategic agenda to address the foundational authentication, authorization, and identity problems pivotal for tomorrow's widespread autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Gated Recurrent GAN with Gaussian Uncertainty for Network Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits, have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score (TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models. Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware, where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Internet censorship limits the access of nodes residing within a specific network environment to the public Internet, and vice versa. During the last decade, techniques for conducting Internet censorship have been developed further. Consequently, methodology for measuring Internet censorship had been improved as well.
  In this paper, we firstly provide a survey of network-level Internet censorship techniques. Secondly, we survey censorship measurement methodology. We further cover the censorship of circumvention tools and its measurement, as well as available datasets. In cases where it is beneficial, we bridge the terminology and taxonomy of Internet censorship with related domains, namely traffic obfuscation and information hiding. We further extend the technical perspective with recent trends and challenges, including human aspects of Internet censorship.</description>
