      <title>Canonical Frames for Bracket Generating Rank 2 Distributions which are not Goursat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09307v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We complete a uniform construction of canonical absolute parallelism for bracket generating rank $2$ distributions with $5$-dimensional cube on $n$-dimensional manifold with $n\geq 5$ by showing that the condition of maximality of class that was assumed previously by Doubrov-Zelenko for such a construction holds automatically at generic points. This also gives analogous constructions in the case when the cube is not $5$-dimensional but the distribution is not Goursat through the procedure of iterative Cartan deprolongation. This together with the classical theory of Goursat distributions covers in principle the local geometry of all bracket generating rank 2 distributions in a neighborhood of generic points. As a byproduct, for any $n\geq 5$ we describe the maximally symmetric germs among bracket generating rank $2$ distributions with $5$-dimensional cube, as well as among those which reduce to such a distribution under a fixed number of Cartan deprolongations. Another consequence of our results on maximality of class is for optimal control problems with constraint given by a rank $2$ distribution with $5$-dimensional cube: it implies that for a generic point $q_0$ of $M$, there are plenty abnormal extremal trajectories of corank $1$ (which is the minimal possible corank) starting at $q_0$. The set of such points contains all points where the distribution is equiregular.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the quaternion projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this note is to prove that the index of the identity map on a quaternion space form of constant quaternion sectional curvature $c$ is zero, provided that $c&lt;0$. As an immediate consequence, it is established that any compact quaternion space form of negative quaternion sectional curvature is stable and it is emphasized that, on the contrary (but in agreement with some known results), any quaternion projective space is unstable.</description>

      <title>Ricci curvature for hydrodynamics on the sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geometric description of incompressible hydrodynamics, as geodesic motion on the infinite-dimensional group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, enables notions of curvature in the study of fluids in order to study stability. Formulas for Ricci curvature are often simpler than those for sectional curvature, which typically takes both signs, but the drawback is that Ricci curvature is rarely well-defined in infinite-dimensional spaces. Here we suggest a definition of Ricci curvature in the case of two-dimensional hydrodynamics, based on the finite-dimensional Zeitlin models arising in quantization theory, which gives a natural tool for renormalization. We provide formulae for the finite-dimensional approximations and give strong numerical evidence that these converge in the infinite-dimensional limit, based in part on four new conjectured identities for Wigner $6j$ symbols. The suggested limiting expression for (average) Ricci curvature is surprisingly simple and demonstrates an average instability for high-frequency modes which helps explain long-term numerical observations of spherical hydrodynamics due to mixing.</description>

      <title>Planar graphs embedded in generic ways and realizing them as Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with long-time interest of us, especially, the author, in realizing graphs as Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions of certain nice classes.
  The Reeb graph of a differentiable function is the set consisting of all components of preimages of all single points and endowed with the quotient topology canonically. In tame cases, such objects are graphs. The Reeb graph of the natural height of the unit sphere of dimension at least $2$ is a graph with exactly one edge and homeomorphic to a closed interval. These graphs have been fundamental and strong tools in geometry since theory of Morse functions has been established in the former half of the last century.
  We present a new answer to the problem, saying that generically embedded planar graphs are homeomorphic to the Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions obtained by elementary polynomials and elementary procedures.</description>

      <title>A Fibration Theorem and Chas-Sullivan product for Morse-Novikov Homology with differential graded coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an oriented, closed and connected manifold X and a nonzero cohomology u $\in$ H 1 (X, R), we extend the constructions of Morse Homology with differential graded coefficients of [BDHO25] and of the Chas-Sullivan product described on this model in [Rie24] to Morse-Novikov Homology with differential graded coefficients. More precisely, we will construct a Morse-Novikov complex with differential graded coefficients and prove that, given a fibration E $\pi$ $\rightarrow$ X such that $\pi$ * u = 0 $\in$ H 1 (E, R) and the fiber is locally path-connected, there exists a Morse-Novikov model for a ''Novikov completion'' H * (E, u) of the singular homology of E. Moreover, we will prove that if the fibration is endowed with a morphism of fibrations on its fibers, then there exists a Chas-Sullivan-like product on H * (E, u) that can be described within this model.</description>

Abstract: We will use the tools developed in [Rie24] to give a Morse-theoretic description of a string topology product on the homology of the space of paths in a manifold Y with endpoints in a submanifold X and a module structure on this homology over the Chas-Sullivan ring of Y .

      <title>Applications of the Liouville symplectic form on the cotangent bundle of a loop group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a semisimple, simply connected, affine algebraic group defined over $\mathbb C$. Consider the Liouville symplectic structure on the total space $T^*G((t))$ of the cotangent bundle of the loop group $G((t))$, where $t$ is a formal parameter. We show that the Liouville symplectic structure on $T^*G((t))$ induces the symplectic structures on the moduli stack of framed principal Higgs $G$-bundles on a compact connected Riemann surface $X$ and also on the moduli spaces of framed $G$-connections on $X$. Similar symplectic structures -- on the moduli stack of framed principal Higgs $G$-bundles, with finite order framing, and also framed connections on $X$, with finite order framing -- were constructed earlier by various authors. Our results show that they all have a common origin.</description>

      <title>Mixed Christoffel-Minkowski problems for bodies of revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mixed Christoffel-Minkowski problem asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for a Borel measure on the Euclidean unit sphere to be the mixed area measure of some convex bodies, one of which, appearing multiple times, is free and the rest are fixed. In the case where all bodies involved are symmetric around a common axis, we provide a complete solution to this problem, without assuming any regularity. In particular, we refine Firey's classification of area measures of figures of revolution.
  In our argument, we introduce an easy way to transform mixed area measures and mixed volumes involving axially symmetric bodies, and we significantly improve Firey's estimate on the local behavior of area measures. As a secondary result, we obtain a family of Hadwiger type theorems for convex valuations that are invariant under rotations around an axis.</description>

      <title>An alternative condition for the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface equation on non-mean convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an alternative condition for the solvability of the Dirichlet problem for the minimal surface equation that applies to non-mean convex domains. This condition is derived from a second-order ordinary differential equation whose solution produces a barrier that appears to be novel in the context of barrier constructions. It admits an explicit formulation and, in the setting of Hadamard manifolds, reveals a direct and transparent relationship between the geometry of the domain and the behavior of the boundary data required for solvability. The condition also extends naturally to unbounded domains. In the Euclidean case, it is not only more practical to verify but also less restrictive than the classical Jenkins - Serrin criterion, ensuring the existence of solutions in situations where that approach fail. Furthermore, unlike the Jenkins-Serrin condition, our appproach separates the geometric properties of the domain from its boundary data, providing a clearer and more manageable framework for solvability analysis.</description>

We prove a key equivalence between the category of fair affine $C^\infty$-superschemes and the category of fair $C^\infty$-superrings. We place special emphasis on split $C^\infty$-superrings, which generalize the function algebras of supermanifolds and serve as building blocks for more complex, non-split structures.</description>

Abstract: We prove the rigidity of rectifiable boundaries with constant distributional mean curvature in the Brendle class of warped product manifolds (which includes important models in General Relativity, like the deSitter--Schwarzschild and Reissner--Nordstrom manifolds). As a corollary we characterize limits of rectifiable boundaries whose mean curvatures converge, as distributions, to a constant. The latter result is new, and requires the full strength of distributional CMC-rigidity, even when one considers smooth boundaries whose mean curvature oscillations vanish in arbitrarily strong $C^k$-norms.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we recapture the Smale conjecture on a Sasakian $3$-sphere via the Legendrian mean curvature flow. More precisely,~we deform the area-preserving contactomorphism (symplectomorphism) of Sasakian $3$-spheres to an isometry via the Legendrian mean curvature flow on the Legendrian graph in $\mathbb{S}^{2}\times \mathbb{S}^{3}$. By using the monotonicity formula and blow-up analysis, we obtain the minimal Legendrian graph in $\mathbb{S}^{2}\times \mathbb{S}^{3}$. Finally, we will address the rigidity theorem of $2$-dimensional Legendrian self-shrinkers in $\mathbb{R}^{5}$. We are able to reconstruct the Harvey-Lawson special Lagrangian cone in $\mathbb{C}^{3}$ from this Legendrian self-shrinker. The partial classification is also provided if the squared norm of the second fundamental form is constant.</description>

      <title>Embedding Signature-Changing Manifolds: A Braneworld and Kaluza-Klein Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08662v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a class of semi-Riemannian manifolds characterized by smooth metric signature changes with a transverse radical, This class includes spacetimes relevant to cosmological models such as the Hartle-Hawking "no boundary" proposal, where a Riemannian manifold transitions smoothly into a Lorentzian spacetime without boundaries or singularities. For this class, we prove the existence of global isometric embeddings into higher-dimensional pseudo-Euclidean spaces. We then strengthen this result by demonstrating that a specific type of global isometric embedding, which we term an $\mathcal{H}$-global embedding, also exists into both Minkowski space and Misner space. For the canonical $n$-dimensional signature-changing model, we explicitly construct a full global isometric embedding into $(n+1)$-dimensional Minkowski and Misner spaces, a significantly stronger result than an $\mathcal{H}$-global embedding for this specific case. This embedding framework provides new geometric tools for studying signature change and braneworlds through the geometry of submanifolds embedded in a bulk, thus presenting a mathematically well-defined approach to these phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hypersymplectic structure on a 4-manifold is a triple of symplectic forms for which any non-zero linear combination is again symplectic. In 2006, Donaldson conjectured that on a compact 4-manifold any hypersymplectic structure can be deformed through cohomologous hypersymplectic structures to a hyperk\"ahler triple. We prove this under the assumption that the initial structure is invariant under an effective $S^1$-action. In particular we show that the underlying 4-manifold is diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{T}^4$.</description>

      <title>Stringy Corrections to Heterotic SU(3)-Geometry</title>

Abstract: We analyse the $\alpha'^2$ corrections to the supersymmetry algebra constructed by Bergshoeff--de Roo for heterotic compactifications on SU(3) manifolds. The geometry is complex and conformally balanced. We find an integrability condition for solutions related to the graviton equation of motion together with a correction that is pure gauge. We derive the same condition independently from hermitian geometry. The curvature of the tangent bundle connection acquires a nonzero (0,2) component and thus is not an instanton, illustrating how $\alpha'$-corrections can disrupt semi-classical intuition.</description>
