      <title>Recurrence of integral zeros on trajectories of ergodic flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the following assertion. Let a flow $T_t$ preserve an ergodic measure $\mu$ and $\mu$-itegrable function $f$ have zero mean. Let $\mu(A)&gt;0$, then for almost all $x\in A$, for which $f(x)\neq 0$, there is ${t_k}\to \infty$ such that $T_{t_k}x\in A$ and $\int_0^{t_k} f(T_sx)ds=0$.</description>

      <title>Classifying Stein's groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a comprehensive classification of Stein's groups, which generalize the well-known Higman-Thompson groups. Stein's groups are defined as groups of piecewise linear bijections of an interval with finitely many breakpoints and slopes belonging to specified additive and multiplicative subgroups of the real numbers. Our main result establishes a classification theorem for these groups under the assumptions that the slope group is finitely generated and the additive group has rank at least 2. We achieve this by interpreting Stein's groups as topological full groups of ample groupoids. A central concept in our analysis is the notion of $H^1$-rigidity in the cohomology of groupoids. In the case where the rank of the additive group is 1, we adopt a different approach using attracting elements to impose strong constraints on the classification.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov Exponent and Stochastic Stability for Infinitely Renormalizable Lorenz Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that infinitely renormalizable contracting Lorenz maps with bounded geometry or the so-called {\it a priori bounds} satisfies the slow recurrence condition to the singular point $c$ at its two critical values $c_1^-$ and $c_1^+$. As the first application, we show that the pointwise Lyapunov exponent at $c_1^-$ and $c_1^+$ equals 0. As the second application, we show that such maps are stochastically stable.</description>

      <title>The Morse spectrum for linear random dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that projectivised finite-dimensional linear random dynamical systems possess a unique finest weak Morse decomposition. Based on this result, we define the Morse spectrum and investigate its basic properties. In particular, we show that the Morse spectrum is given by a finite union of closed intervals. Furthermore we demonstrate that under a bounded growth condition, the Morse spectrum coincides with the non-uniform dichotomy spectrum.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Equilibrium and Freezing States in Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with freezing phase transitions in general dynamical systems. A freezing phase transition is one in which, for a given potential $\phi$, there exists some inverse temperature $\beta_0 &gt; 0$ such that for all $\alpha, \beta &gt; \beta_0$, the collection of equilibrium states for $\alpha \phi$ and $\beta \phi$ coincide. In this sense, below the temperature $1 / \beta_0$, the system "freezes" on a fixed collection of equilibrium states.
  We show that for a given invariant measure $\mu$, it is no more restrictive that $\mu$ is the freezing state for some potential than it is for $\mu$ to be the equilibrium state for some potential. In fact, our main result applies to any collection of equilibrium states with the same entropy. In the case where the entropy map $h$ is upper semi-continuous, we show any ergodic measure $\mu$ can be obtained as a freezing state for some potential. In this upper semi-continuous setting, we additionally show that the collection of potentials that freeze at a single state is dense in the space of all potentials.</description>

      <title>Topological groups with tractable minimal dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Polish groups with the generic point property, the property that every minimal action on a compact space admits a comeager orbit. By a result of Ben Yaacov, Melleray, and Tsankov, this class of Polish groups contains those with metrizable universal minimal flow, and by a construction of Kwiatkowska, this containment is proper. Earlier work of the authors gives a robust generalization of the class of Polish groups with metrizable universal minimal flow that makes sense for all topological groups. In this work, we do the same for the class of Polish groups with the generic point property, thus defining the class of topological groups with tractable minimal dynamics and giving several characterizations of this class. These characterizations yield novel results even in the Polish case; for instance, we show that the universal minimal flow of a locally compact non-compact Polish group has no points of first countability. Motivated by work of Kechris, Pestov, and Todor\v{c}evi\'c that connects Ramsey properties of classes of structures to dynamical properties of automorphism groups, we state and prove an abstract KPT correspondence which characterizes topological groups with tractable minimal dynamics. As an application, we prove that this class is absolute between models of set theory, and then use forcing and absoluteness arguments to further explore these classes of groups.</description>

      <title>Exact Hausdorff dimension of some sofic self-affine fractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous work has shown that the Hausdorff dimension of sofic affine-invariant sets is expressed as a limit involving intricate matrix products. This limit has typically been regarded as incalculable. However, in several highly non-trivial cases, we demonstrate that the dimension can in fact be calculated explicitly. Specifically, the dimension is expressed as the solution to an infinite-degree equation with explicit coefficients, which also corresponds to the spectral radius of a certain linear operator. Our result provides the first non-trivial calculation of the exact Hausdorff dimension of sofic sets in $\mathbb{R}^3$. This is achieved by developing a new technique inspired by the work of Kenyon and Peres (1998).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the smoothness of the density function of absolutely continuous measures supported on random self-similar sets on the line. We show that the natural projection of a measure with symbolic local dimension greater than 1 at every point is absolutely continuous with H\"older continuous density almost surely. In particular, if the similarity dimension is greater than 1 then the random self-similar set on the line contains an interior point almost surely.</description>

      <title>The emergence of chaos in population game dynamics induced by comparisons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise description of population game dynamics introduced by revision protocols - an economic model describing the agent's propensity to switch to a better-performing strategy - is of importance in economics and social sciences in general. In this setting innovation or imitation of others is the force which drives the evolution of the economic system. As the continuous-time game dynamics is relatively well understood, the same cannot be said about revision driven dynamics in the discrete time. We investigate the behavior of agents in a $2\times 2$ anti-coordination game with symmetric random matching and a unique mixed Nash equilibrium. In continuous time the Nash equilibrium is attracting and induces a global evolutionary stable state. We show that in the discrete time one can construct (either innovative or imitative) revision protocol and choose a level of the time step, under which the game dynamics is Li-Yorke chaotic, inducing complex and unpredictable behavior of the system, precluding stable predictions of equilibrium. Moreover, we reveal that this unpredictability is encoded into any imitative revision protocol. Furthermore, we show that for any such game there exists a perturbed pairwise proportional imitation protocol introducing chaotic behavior of the agents for sufficiently large time step.</description>

      <title>Description of fixed points of an infinite dimensional operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an infinite-dimensional non-linear operator related to a hard core (HC) model with a countable set $\mathbb{N}$ of spin values. It is known that finding the fixed points of an infinite-dimensional operator is generally impossible. But we have fully analyzed the fixed points of an infinite-dimensional operator by applying a technique of reducing an infinite-dimensional operator to a two-dimensional operator. The set of parameters is divided into subsets $A_{i,j},$ where the index $i$ means the number of fixed points on the line $y=x$, $j$ means the number of fixed points outside of $y=x.$ The number of fixed points can be up to seven, and the explicit form of each fixed point is found.</description>

      <title>Fibre stability for dominated self-affine sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a planar self-affine set. Assuming a weak domination condition on the matrix parts, we prove for all backward Furstenberg directions $V$ that $$\max_{E\in\operatorname{Tan}(K)} \max_{x\in \pi_{V^\bot}(E)} \operatorname{dim_H} (\pi_{V^\bot}^{-1}(x)\cap E) = \operatorname{dim_A} K - \operatorname{dim_A} \pi_{V^\bot}(K).$$ Here, $\operatorname{Tan}(K)$ denotes the space of weak tangents of $K$. Unlike previous work on this topic, we require no separation or irreducibility assumptions. However, if in addition the strong separation condition holds, then there exists a $V\in X_F$ so that $$\max_{x\in \pi_{V^\bot}(K)} \operatorname{dim_H} (\pi_{V^\bot}^{-1}(x)\cap K) = \operatorname{dim_A} K - \operatorname{dim_A} \pi_{V^\bot}(K).$$ Our key innovation is an amplification result for slices of weak tangents via pigeonholing arguments.</description>

      <title>Modeling wildfire dynamics through a physics-based approach incorporating fuel moisture and landscape heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Anthropogenic climate change has increased the probability, severity, and duration of heat waves and droughts, subsequently escalating the risk of wildfires. Mathematical and computational models can enhance our understanding of wildfire propagation dynamics. In this work, we present a simplified Advection-Diffusion-Reaction (ADR) model that accounts for the effect of fuel moisture, and also considers wind, local radiation, natural convection and topography. The model explicitly represents fuel moisture effects by means of the apparent calorific capacity method, distinguishing between live and dead fuel moisture content. Using this model, we conduct exploratory simulations and present theoretical insights into various modeling decisions in the context of ADR-based models. We aim to shed light on the interplay between the different modeled mechanisms in wildfire propagation to identify key factors influencing fire spread and to estimate the model's predictive capacity.</description>

      <title>Identifiability of catenary and directed-cycle linear compartmental models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A parameter of a mathematical model is structurally identifiable if it can be determined from noiseless experimental data. Here, we examine the identifiability properties of two important classes of linear compartmental models: directed-cycle models and catenary models (models for which the underlying graph is a directed cycle or a bidirected path, respectively). Our main result is a complete characterization of the directed-cycle models for which every parameter is (generically, locally) identifiable. Additionally, for catenary models, we give a formula for their input-output equations. Such equations are used to analyze identifiability, so we expect our formula to support future analyses into the identifiability of catenary models. Our proofs rely on prior results on input-output equations, and we also use techniques from linear algebra and graph theory.</description>

      <title>Weighted Shift operators on spaces of analytic functions over an annulus -- I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We initiate a study of the forward weighted shift operator, denoted by $F_w$, defined on the Banach spaces $\ell^p_{a,b}(\mathtt{A})$ and $c_{0,a,b}(\mathtt{A})$ of analytic functions on a suitable annulus $\mathtt{A}$ in the complex plane. Here, $\ell^p_{a,b}(\mathtt{A})$ and $c_{0,a.b}(\mathtt{A})$, respectively, are the spaces of analytic functions on some annulus $\mathtt{A}$, having normalized Schauder bases of the form $\{(a_n+b_nz)z^n, ~~n\in \mathbb{Z}\}$, which are equivalent to the standard basis in $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$ and $c_0(\mathbb{Z})$. We first obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for $F_w$ to be bounded, and then we primarily study when $F_w$ and its adjoint $F_w^*$ are hypercyclic, supercyclic, and chaotic. It is proved that, under certain conditions on $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$, the operator $F_w$ similar to a compact perturbation of a classical bilateral weighted shift on $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$. Unlike the case of classical weighted shifts, the adjoint operator $F_w^*$ on the dual of $\ell^p_{a,b}(\mathtt{A})$ can have non-trivial periodic vectors, without being even hypercyclic. The zero-one law of orbital limit points fails for $F_w^*$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the 2D periodic stochastic Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes equations with body forces perturbed by multiplicative white noise. We first transform the stochastic Nernst-Planck-Navier-Stokes system into the deterministic system and address the problem of global well-posedness of the solution. Then, we generate a corresponding random dynamical system and dedicate to proving the existence of a compact random attractor for such random dynamical system. Furthermore, upper semicontinuity of the random attractor is established when the noise intensity approaches to zero.</description>

      <title>Long-Time behavior of the tangential surface Navier-Stokes equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the initial-value problem for the incompressible tangential Navier-Stokes equation with variable viscosity on a given two-dimensional surface without boundary. Existence of global weak and strong solutions under inhomogeneous forcing is proved by a fixed-point and continuation argument. Continuous dependence on data, backward uniqueness, and instantaneous regularization are also discussed. Depending on the effect of the inhomogeneous forcing on the dissipative and the nondissipative components of the system, we investigate the long-time behavior of solutions. We prove the existence and properties of the $\sigma$-global attractor, in the case of bounded trajectories, and of the so-called unbounded attractor, for unbounded trajectories.</description>

      <title>On Random Batch Methods (RBM) for interacting particle systems driven by L\'evy processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many real-world scenarios, the underlying random fluctuations are non-Gaussian, particularly in contexts where heavy-tailed data distributions arise. A typical example of such non-Gaussian phenomena calls for L\'evy noise, which accommodates jumps and extreme variations. We propose the Random Batch Method for interacting particle systems driven by L\'evy noises (RBM-L\'evy), which can be viewed as an extension of the original RBM algorithm in [Jin et al. J Compt Phys, 2020]. In our RBM-L\'evy algorithm, $N$ particles are randomly grouped into small batches of size $p$, and interactions occur only within each batch for a short time. Then one reshuffles the particles and continues to repeat this shuffle-and-interact process. In other words, by replacing the strong interacting force by the weak interacting force, RBM-L\'evy dramatically reduces the computational cost from $O(N^2)$ to $O(pN)$ per time step. Meanwhile, the resulting dynamics converges to the original interacting particle system, even at the appearance of the L\'evy jump. We rigorously prove this convergence in Wasserstein distance, assuming either a finite or infinite second moment of the L\'evy measure. Some numerical examples are given to verify our convergence rate.</description>

      <title>The boundary of a totally geodesic subvariety of moduli space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider subvarieties $N$ of $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$, the moduli space of genus $g$ Riemann surfaces with $n$ marked points, that are totally geodesic with respect to the Teichm\"uller metric. The Deligne-Mumford boundary of $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ decomposes into strata, each of which is essentially a product of lower complexity moduli spaces -- in such spaces there is a natural notion of totally geodesic. We show that the boundary locus of $N$ in any such stratum is itself totally geodesic. Furthermore, we prove that each such boundary locus decomposes into prime pieces, and for each such piece the projection to each factor is locally isometric in an appropriate sense.</description>

      <title>Floer Homology: From Generalized Morse-Smale Dynamical Systems to Forman's Combinatorial Vector Fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2105.02567v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a Floer type boundary operator for generalised Morse-Smale dynamical systems on compact smooth manifolds by counting the number of suitable flow lines between closed (both homoclinic and periodic) orbits and isolated critical points. The same principle works for the discrete situation of general combinatorial vector fields, defined by Forman, on CW complexes. We can thus recover the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ homology of both smooth and discrete structures directly from the flow lines (V-paths) of our vector field.</description>

      <title>Non-classifiability of Ergodic Flows up to Time Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.06086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A time change of a flow $\{T_t\}$, ${t\in\mathbb{R}}$, is a reparametrization of the orbits of the flow such that each orbit is mapped to itself by an orientation-preserving homeomorphism of the parameter space. If a flow $\{S_t\}$ is isomorphic to a flow obtained by a reparametrization of a flow $\{T_t\}$, then we say that $\{S_t\}$ and $\{T_t\}$ are isomorphic up to a time change. For ergodic flows $\{S_t\}$ and $\{T_t\}$, Kakutani showed that this happens if and only if the two flows have Kakutani equivalent transformations as cross-sections.
  We prove that the Kakutani equivalence relation on ergodic invertible measure-preserving transformations of a standard non-atomic probability space is not a Borel set. This shows in a precise way that classification of ergodic transformations up to Kakutani equivalence is impossible. In particular, our results imply the non-classifiability of ergodic flows up to isomorphism after a time change. Moreover, we obtain anti-classification results under isomorphism for ergodic invertible transformations of a sigma-finite measure space.
  We also obtain anti-classification results under Kakutani equivalence for ergodic area-preserving smooth diffeomorphisms of the disk, annulus, and 2-torus, as well as real-analytic diffeomorphisms of the $2$-torus. Our work generalizes the anti-classification results under isomorphism for ergodic transformations obtained by Foreman, Rudolph, and Weiss.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.10689v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study a class of bimodal cubic polynomials for which its critical points have the same $\omega$-limit set which is an invariant Cantor set. These maps have generalized Fibonacci combinatorics in terms of generalized renormalization on the twin principal nest. It is proved that such maps possess `decay of geometry' in the sense that the scaling factor of the twin principal nest decreases at least exponentially fast. As an application, we prove that they have no Cantor attractor.</description>

      <title>On irreducibility of prefixed algebraic sets in moduli spaces of prime degree polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.04778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the moduli space, $\mathcal{M}_{d}$, of degree $d \geq 2$ polynomials over $\mathbb{C}$, with a marked critical point. Given $k \geq 0,\; p$ an odd prime, we show that the set $\Sigma_{k,1,p}$ of conjugacy classes of degree $p$ polynomials, for which the marked critical point is strictly $(k,1)$-preperiodic, is an irreducible quasi-affine algebraic set. Irreducibility of these sets was conjectured by Milnor, and has been proved for $p=3$ by Buff, Epstein and Koch.
  We prove that the subspaces of $\Sigma_{k,1,p}$, that arise by varying the ramification index of the marked critical point all the way up to the unicritical case, are all irreducible subvarieties. Finally, using the irreducibility of $\Sigma_{k,1,p}$ we give a new and short proof of the fact that the set of all unicritical points of $\Sigma_{k,1,p}$ form one Galois orbit under the action of absolute Galois group of $\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

Abstract: For a class of potentials $\psi$ satisfying a condition depending on the roof function of a suspension (semi)flow, we show an EKP inequality, which can be interpreted as a H\"older continuity property in the weak${^*}$ norm of measures, with respect to the pressure of those measures, where the H\"older exponent depends on the $L^q$-space that $\psi$ belongs to. This also captures a new type of phase transition for intermittent (semi)flows (and maps).</description>

      <title>Non-intrusive model combination for learning dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In data-driven modelling of complex dynamic processes, it is often desirable to combine different classes of models to enhance performance. Examples include coupled models of different fidelities, or hybrid models based on physical knowledge and data-driven strategies. A key limitation of the broad adoption of model combination in applications is intrusiveness: training combined models typically requires significant modifications to the learning algorithm implementations, which may often be already well-developed and optimized for individual model spaces. In this work, we propose an iterative, non-intrusive methodology to combine two model spaces to learn dynamics from data. We show that this can be understood, at least in the linear setting, as finding the optimal solution in the direct sum of the two hypothesis spaces, while leveraging only the projection operators in each individual space. Hence, the proposed algorithm can be viewed as iterative projections, for which we can obtain estimates on its convergence properties. To highlight the extensive applicability of our framework, we conduct numerical experiments in various problem settings, with particular emphasis on various hybrid models based on the Koopman operator approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of camouflaging for bodies with specular surface in the framework of geometric optics. The index of visibility introduced in [Plakhov 2017] measures the mean deviation of light rays incident on the body's surface. We study the problem of minimal visibility index for bodies with fixed volume contained in the unit sphere. This problem is reduced to a special vector-valued problem of optimal mass transfer, which is solved partly analytically and partly numerically. This paper is a continuation of the study started in [Plakhov 2009], [Plakhov 2017], and [Plakhov and Roshchina 2011].</description>

      <title>Random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms on $\Bbb{C}^{2}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms (complex generalized H\'{e}non maps and their conjugate maps) of $\Bbb{C}^{2}.$ We show that a generic random dynamical system of polynomial automorphisms has ``mean stablity'' on $\Bbb{C}^{2}$. Further, we show that if a system has mean stability, then (1) for each $z\in \Bbb{C}^{2}$ and for almost every sequence $\gamma =(\gamma _{n})_{n=1}^{\infty }$ of maps, the maximal Lyapunov exponents of $\gamma $ at $z$ is negative, (2) there are only finitely many minimal sets of the system, (3) each minimal set is attracting, (4) for each $z\in \Bbb{C}^{2}$ and for almost every sequence $\gamma $ of maps, the orbit $\{ \gamma _{n}\cdots \gamma _{1}(z) \} _{n=1}^{\infty }$ tends to one of the minimal sets of the system, and (5) the transition operator of the system has the spectrum gap property on the space of Hoelder continuous functions with some exponent. Note that none of (1)--(5) can hold for any deterministic iteration dynamical system of a single complex generalized H\'{e}non map. We observe many new phenomena in random dynamical systems of polynomial automorphisms of $\Bbb{C}^{2}$ and observe the mechanisms. We provide new strategies and methods to study higher-dimensional random holomorphic dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for an $\Omega-$stable diffeomorphism to be a topologically transitive Anosov diffeomorphism: to exhibit a nonempty intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds of any pair of periodic orbits. To elucidate its dynamical nature, we compare this condition with other properties known to be sufficient for an Anosov diffeomorphism to be topologically transitive. We also describe the $C^1$ interior of the set of diffeomorphisms which comply with this condition, discuss examples with a variety of dynamics and present some applications of interest.</description>

Abstract: Consider the entire function $f(z)=\cosh(z)$. We show that the escaping set of this function - that is, the set of points whose orbits tend to infinity under iteration - has a structure known as a "spider's web". This disproves a conjecture of Sixsmith from 2020. In fact, we show that the "fast escaping set", i.e. the set of points whose orbits tend to infinity at an iterated exponential rate, is a spider's web. This answers a question of Rippon and Stallard from 2012. We also discuss a wider class of functions to which our results apply, and state some open questions.</description>

      <title>Subsystem Resetting of a Heterogeneous Network of Theta Neurons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic resetting has shown promise in enhancing the stability of dynamical systems. Here, we apply this concept to theta neuron networks with partial resetting, where only a fraction of neurons is intermittently reset. We examine both infinite and finite reset rates, using the averaged firing rate as an indicator of network stability. At infinite reset rates, a high proportion of resetting neurons drives the network to stable rest or spiking states, collapsing the bistable region at the Cusp bifurcation and producing smooth transitions. Finite resetting introduces stochastic fluctuations, leading to complex dynamics that sometimes deviate from theoretical predictions. These insights highlight the role of partial resetting in stabilizing neural dynamics, with applications in biological systems and neuromorphic computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every Toeplitz sequence $x$, one can identify a period structure ${\bf p}=(p_i)_{i\geq 0}$ which leads to a Bratteli-Vershik realization of the associated Toeplitz shift; we refer to this period structure as {\it constructive}. Let $(X,\sigma,x)$ and $(Y,\sigma,y)$ be Toeplitz shifts where $x\in X$ and $y\in Y$ are Toeplitz sequences with constructive period structures $(p^n)_{n\geq 1}$ and $(q^n)_{n\geq 1}$, respectively. Using the Bratteli-Vershik realization of factor maps between Toeplitz shifts, we prove that if there exists a topological factoring $ \pi:(X,\sigma)\rightarrow (Y,\sigma)$ with $\pi(x)=y$, then $q\mid p$. In particular, if $\pi$ is conjugacy, then $p=q$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.05183v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop data-driven methods incorporating geometric and topological information to learn parsimonious representations of nonlinear dynamics from observations. The approaches learn nonlinear state-space models of the dynamics for general manifold latent spaces using training strategies related to Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Our methods are referred to as Geometric Dynamic (GD) Variational Autoencoders (GD-VAEs). We learn encoders and decoders for the system states and evolution based on deep neural network architectures that include general Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and other architectures. Motivated by problems arising in parameterized PDEs and physics, we investigate the performance of our methods on tasks for learning reduced dimensional representations of the nonlinear Burgers Equations, Constrained Mechanical Systems, and spatial fields of Reaction-Diffusion Systems. GD-VAEs provide methods that can be used to obtain representations in manifold latent spaces for diverse learning tasks involving dynamics.</description>

      <title>Super approximation for $\text{SL}_2\times \text{SL}_2$ and $\text{ASL}_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $S\subset \text{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)\times \text{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ or $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)\ltimes \mathbb Z^2$ be finite symmetric and assume $S$ generates a group $G$ which is a Zariski-dense subgroup $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)\times \text{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)$ or $\text{SL}_2(\mathbb Z)\ltimes \mathbb Z^2$. We prove that the Cayley graphs $$\{\mathcal Cay(G(\text{mod } q), S (\text{mod } q))\}_{q\in \mathbb Z}$$ form a family of expanders.</description>

      <title>Marked Length Spectrum Rigidity for Surface Amalgams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09968v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that simple, thick negatively curved two-dimensional P-manifolds, a large class of surface amalgams, are marked length spectrum rigid. That is, if two piecewise negatively curved Riemannian metrics (satisfying certain smoothness conditions) on a simple, thick two-dimensional P-manifold assign the same lengths to all closed geodesics, then they differ by an isometry up to isotopy. Our main theorem is a natural generalization of Croke and Otal's celebrated results about marked length spectrum rigidity of negatively curved surfaces.</description>

      <title>Robust quasi-isometric embeddings inapproximable by Anosov representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{K}=\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$. For all but finitely many $m\in \mathbb{N}$, we exhibit the first examples of non-locally rigid, Zariski dense, robust quasi-isometric embeddings of hyperbolic groups in $\mathsf{SL}_m(\mathbb{K})$ which are not limits of Anosov representations. As a consequence, we show that higher rank analogues of Sullivan's structural stabilty theorem and of the density theorem for Kleinian groups fail for Anosov representations in $\mathsf{SL}_m(\mathbb{C}), m\geq 30$.</description>

      <title>Crossing Numbers of Billiard Curves in the Multidimensional Box via Translation Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The billiard table is modeled as an $n$-dimensional box $[0,a_1]\times [0,a_2]\times \ldots \times [0,a_n] \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, with each side having real-valued lengths $a_i$ that are pairwise commensurable. A ball is launched from the origin in direction $d=(1,1,\ldots,1)$. The ball is reflected if it hits the boundary of the billiard table. It comes to a halt when reaching a corner. We show that the number of intersections of the billiard curve at any given point on the table is either $0$ or a power of $2$. To prove this, we use algebraic and number theoretic tools to establish a bijection between the number of intersections of the billiard curve and the number of satisfying assignments of a specific constraint satisfaction problem.</description>

      <title>Deep learning for predicting the occurrence of tipping points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tipping points occur in many real-world systems, at which the system shifts suddenly from one state to another. The ability to predict the occurrence of tipping points from time series data remains an outstanding challenge and a major interest in a broad range of research fields. Particularly, the widely used methods based on bifurcation theory are neither reliable in prediction accuracy nor applicable for irregularly-sampled time series which are commonly observed from real-world systems. Here we address this challenge by developing a deep learning algorithm for predicting the occurrence of tipping points in untrained systems, by exploiting information about normal forms. Our algorithm not only outperforms traditional methods for regularly-sampled model time series but also achieves accurate predictions for irregularly-sampled model time series and empirical time series. Our ability to predict tipping points for complex systems paves the way for mitigation risks, prevention of catastrophic failures, and restoration of degraded systems, with broad applications in social science, engineering, and biology.</description>
