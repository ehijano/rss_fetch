      <title>Can repeller dynamics explain dominant pebble axis ratios?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we focus on the morphology of well abraded, almost perfectly ellipsoidal natural pebbles. Flat, oblate and prolate ellipsoidal pebbles are expected to be characterized by qualitatively different shape evolution due to being unequally prone to specific rolling and sliding motions in natural environments. The three typical motions are considered as sliding on the flattest side and rolling around the longest and shortest axes. First, we assume by mechanical considerations that each of these motions alone affects the shortening of only one or two principal axes, then we formulate a mathematical expression associating the willingness as a probability to each motion of a given ellipsoid with arbitrary axis ratios. As a consequence, any of the motions is capable of suppressing the other two when the pebble is either ideally flat, oblate or prolate. We present through a numerical analysis that our model predicts a self-excited shape evolution and curiously suggests the existence of an unstable equilibrium (repeller) in the vicinity of the naturally dominant average axis ratios found in the literature. Due to the self-excited evolution, pebbles diverging away from the proximity of the repeller are expected to rapidly become sufficiently thin or flat to easily break up into smaller fragments, which are no longer considered relevant in our investigation. Ultimately, our model outlines the possibility that the dominant axis ratios might be due to a well-balanced mixture of the motions and the corresponding slow evolution around the repeller. Besides the theoretical predictions, we present experimental investigations of the dominant motions of various 3D-printed ellipsoidal shapes over an inclined planar surface and compare the results with the predictions of our model.</description>

      <title>Seismic First Break Picking in a Higher Dimension Using Deep Graph Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contemporary automatic first break (FB) picking methods typically analyze 1D signals, 2D source gathers, or 3D source-receiver gathers. Utilizing higher-dimensional data, such as 2D or 3D, incorporates global features, improving the stability of local picking. Despite the benefits, high-dimensional data requires structured input and increases computational demands. Addressing this, we propose a novel approach using deep graph learning called DGL-FB, constructing a large graph to efficiently extract information. In this graph, each seismic trace is represented as a node, connected by edges that reflect similarities. To manage the size of the graph, we develop a subgraph sampling technique to streamline model training and inference. Our proposed framework, DGL-FB, leverages deep graph learning for FB picking. It encodes subgraphs into global features using a deep graph encoder. Subsequently, the encoded global features are combined with local node signals and fed into a ResUNet-based 1D segmentation network for FB detection. Field survey evaluations of DGL-FB show superior accuracy and stability compared to a 2D U-Net-based benchmark method.</description>
