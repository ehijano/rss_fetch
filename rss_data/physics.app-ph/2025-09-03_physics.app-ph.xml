      <title>Bimorph Lithium Niobate Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates a prototype bi-layer piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducer (PMUT) based on transferred periodically poled piezoelectric film (P3F) X-cut lithium niobate (LN). Opposite in-plane polarizations in the piezoelectric film stack are employed to enable efficient lateral field excitation of the flexural mode. Thanks to its high piezoelectric coefficient and low dielectric loss, the X-cut LN exhibits high figure of merits (FoMs) as both sensors and transducers. The fabricated PMUT demonstrates an out-of-plane mode near 1 MHz with an electromechanical coupling of 3.6\%. Laser Doppler vibrometry further validates the finite element analysis, showing a peak center displacement of 340 pm/V. These results establish bi-layer P3F LN PMUTs as a promising platform for compact and high-performance ultrasonic transducers. Future work will focus on theoretical analysis, modeling of the measured data, improving the design of the transducer topology, and mitigating feedthrough effects.</description>

      <title>Limits to the Hall effect and other nonreciprocal effects in three-dimensional metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterials can exhibit exotic nonreciprocal properties, yet corresponding fundamental limits and design blueprints achieving them are largely unexplored. Here, we derive comprehensive bounds on the effective nonreciprocal properties of three-dimensional metamaterials and identify microstructures achieving or approaching these bounds. We assume that the underlying equations are equivalent to the conductivity problem in a weak applied magnetic field. While we focus on the Hall effect, our results are more generally applicable, particularly to the Faraday effect in the quasistatic regime and in the absence of losses and resonances. Our bounds yield three important implications: First, the effective Hall mobility of a metamaterial cannot be larger than the largest Hall mobility among the constituent materials. Second, under additional conditions, the effective Verdet constant cannot be enhanced either. Third, for diagonal Hall tensor components, the optimal values are achieved either by one of the pure phases or a rank-1 laminate formed from them, provided that the Hall coefficients of all phases have the same sign. Our work elucidates the limits of nonreciprocal metamaterials and identifies key prerequisites for obtaining exotic phenomena such as sign-inversions and enhancements. Several extensions appear within reach, for example to the Faraday effect in metamaterials exhibiting plasmonic resonances.</description>

      <title>2D-to-3D transformation of ring origami via snap-folding instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shape-morphing structures have been intensively researched for a wide range of engineering applications, including multi-modal soft robots and property-programmable metamaterials, owing to their ability to change shape and size in response to external stimuli. Ring origami, consisting of closed-loop rods, is a class of shape-morphing structures that undergo shape transformation through folding enabled by snap-buckling instabilities. Previous studies have shown that 2D ring origami composed of rod segments with in-plane natural curvature (i.e., the stress-free curved state lies in the plane of the planar ring) can achieve diverse and intriguing 2D-to-2D shape transformations. Here, we propose a 2D-to-3D shape transformation strategy for ring origami by introducing out-of-plane natural curvature (i.e., the stress-free curved state lies in a plane perpendicular to the planar ring) into the rod segments. Due to natural curvature-induced out-of-plane bending moments, a 2D elastic ring spontaneously snaps out-of-plane and reaches equilibrium in a 3D configuration. These snapping-induced out-of-plane shape transitions not only enable self-guided, spontaneous shape morphing, but also allow the construction of complex structures from simple geometries, making them promising for the design of functional deployable and foldable structures. By combining a multi-segment Kirchhoff rod model with finite element simulations and experiments, we systematically investigate the 3D equilibrium states and transition behavior of these systems. We demonstrate that by rationally designing the out-of-plane natural curvature of rod segments, the rings can exhibit a range of functional behaviors, including spontaneous 2D-to-3D shape transformation (e.g., planar square to sphere) via snap-folding, multistable 3D configuration transitions, and compact monostable zero-energy 3D configurations.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of the Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation by a spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, which dictates that the emissivity of a surface equals its absorptivity under thermal equilibrium, fundamentally limits the efficiency of photonic systems by enforcing reciprocal energy exchange between source and detector. Breaking this reciprocity is particularly important for advancing photonic devices for energy conversion, radiative cooling, and mid-infrared sensing and imaging. Driven by the growing need for photonic platforms to overcome reciprocity constraints, we present the first demonstration of spatiotemporally modulated nonreciprocal metasurfaces operating at mid-infrared frequencies suitable for the violation of the Kirchhoff's law at room temperature. We fabricate a graphene-based integrated photonic structure and experimentally demonstrate nonreciprocal reflection from a metasurface modulated at gigahertz frequencies. We develop a theoretical framework to relate nonreciprocal scattering under spatiotemporal modulation with unequal absorptivity and emissivity for violation of the spectral directional Kirchhoff's law. Our experiment and theory imply effective decoupling of absorption and emission channels by breaking time-reversal symmetry at thermal wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature alignment-free magnetometry with boron vacancies in hot-pressed hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic field sensing is essential for applications in communication, environmental monitoring, and biomedical diagnostics. Quantum sensors based on solid-state spin defects, such as nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond or boron vacancies in single-crystal hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), typically require precise alignment between the external magnetic field and the defect's spin quantization axis to achieve reliable sensing. This alignment constraint complicates device integration and hinders scalability. Here, we demonstrate room-temperature optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) from negatively charged boron vacancies (VB-) in commercially available hot-pressed polycrystalline hBN. The random grain orientation inherently samples a broad range of spin quantization axes, enabling alignment-free magnetic field detection. Numerical modeling further confirms that sensing remains feasible despite anisotropic sensitivity, establishing hot-pressed hBN as a robust and practical platform for quantum magnetometry. This approach paves the way toward low-cost, scalable, and mechanically stable quantum magnetic field sensors suitable for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Observation of moir\'e trapped biexciton through sub-diffraction-limit probing using hetero-bilayer on nanopillar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to tune the degree of interaction among particles at the nanoscale is highly intriguing. The spectroscopic signature of such interaction is often subtle and requires special probes to observe. To this end, inter-layer excitons trapped in the periodic potential wells of a moir\'e superlattice offer rich interaction physics, specifically due to the presence of both attractive and repulsive components in the interaction. Here we show that the Coulomb force between two inter-layer excitons switches from repulsive to attractive when the length scale reduces from inter-moir\'e-pocket to intra-moir\'e-pocket in a WS$_2$/WSe$_2$ hetero-bilayer - thanks to the complex competition between direct and exchange interaction. The finding is a departure from the usual notion of repelling inter-layer excitons due to layer polarization. This manifests as the simultaneous observation of an anomalous superlinear power-law of moir\'e exciton and a stabilization of moir\'e trapped biexciton. The experimental observation is facilitated by placing the hetero-bilayer on a polymer-nanopillar/gold-film stack which significantly reduces the inhomogeneous spectral broadening by selectively probing a smaller ensemble of moir\'e pockets compared with a flat sample. This creates an interesting platform to explore interaction among moir\'e trapped excitons and higher order quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>Transitioning from Silicon to Carbon Nanotube based transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon Nanotubes have shown to be an attractive option in the race to find a replacement to silicon-based transistors, due to its high electrical conductivity, extraordinary mechanical strength, and thermal conductivity. However, challenges with regards to controlling the purity and chirality of CNTs have raised doubts if the mass production of these transistors are even viable. This paper explores the challenges of scalability and proposes methods such as Liquid and Gas phase oxidative methods and microwave heating to tackle the problem of metal impurities found within CNTs and the methods of Catalyst Engineering and Chemical Vapor Deposition to control the chirality of CNTs. It also suggests techniques such as Lithography, Screen Printing and Stack Engineering to facilitate the large-scale production of CNT transistors. This paper also attempts to explore the methods of Laser Ablation and Arc Discharge that allows for the synthesis of CNTs of pure quality and high yield further facilitating the rise of mass production of CNT transistors. The feasibility and challenges relating to the integration of CNT transistors with already pre-existing circuitry was also investigated and the methods of annealing and potassium doping were studied and analyzed. The main aim of this paper is providing a comprehensive guide to allow for the mass production and rapid integration of CNT transistors into the semi-conductor market.</description>

      <title>Repetition-Rate-Difference Tunable Dual-Comb Fiber Laser Using Bidirectional Lyot filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single cavity dual-comb fiber lasers adopting different multiplexing configurations are benefited from the natures of common-mode noise suppression and superior coherence. Particularly, repetition-rate tunable dual-combs enable non-ambiguous ranging and aliasing-free spectroscopy. However, their sampling rate and spectral resolution is severely restricted by the mechanical delay lines. In a previous work, as rapid as 500 kHz/s tuning rate was realized to address this issue, while the minimum comb frequency difference remained large under the inaccuracy of mechanical DLL. In this work, a dual-comb prototype incorporated with a thermally controlled bidirectional lyot filter is demonstrated with 870-times enhanced tuning precision compared with mechanical schemes. Linear correlation between temperature and repetition-rate-difference of this tuning mechanism is revealed. We achieve a tuning efficiency of 4.4 Hz/{\deg}C and a control accuracy of 0.44 Hz/K, denoting a significant advance in operating Hz-scale differential comb lines. This design offers an optimal playground for extending non-ambiguous distance in dead-zone-free dual-comb ranging and eliminating aliasing in spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>An Innovative Photon-Driven Subcritical Reactor Concept Powered by Synchrotron Radiation Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the conceptual design of a Photon Driven Reactor (PDR), an innovative subcritical reactor designed for energy generation driven by a synchrotron radiation. The PDR concept overcomes key technological challenges of conventional accelerator-driven systems, particularly the target's structural durability and its thermal management, by employing synchrotron photons directly interacting with fissile material to induce photonuclear reactions. Computational analyses involved criticality and fixed-source simulation using MCNPx and SERPENT Monte Carlo codes, providing robust evaluation of the neutron production, moderation, and multiplication mechanisms. The main focus of this study was to evaluate the system's capability to achieve a positive net energy gain, specifically assessing the thermal power output agains the electrical power absorbed from the grid. Furthermore, the adoption of spent nuclear fuel for the subcritical reactor core loading has been investigated, highlighting the sustainability and environmental benefits of the proposed PDR design. The proposed system is able to exploit a modularity feature. For each large synchrotron, up to fifty beam lines may be operated simultaneously, each delivering photons to an independent subcritical reactor core. With a photon flux on the order of $8.8 \times 10^{17}$ photons per second in each beamline, the results indicate that each individual reactor can achieve a thermal output up to 8 MW, while requiring about 435-660 kW of electrical input from the grid, thereby demonstrating the feasibility of energy amplification in the PDR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: THz emission associated with currents in conductive domains in BiFeO$_3$ following infrared radiation is theoretically investigated. This experimentally observed phenomenon is explained by the domain wall stripes acting as metallic resonators with the oscillating charge accumulation being at the domain wall edges. The charge oscillation frequency is related to the plasma frequency inside the domain wall. The value of plasma frequency determines both the frequency and the amplitude of the emission emanating from the BiFeO$_3$ lattice. We show that for certain geometries of the domain wall structure and for specific polarization of the incident pulse the THz emission embodies a non-vanishing chirality.</description>

      <title>400-Gbps/$\lambda$ Ultrafast Silicon Microring Modulator for Scalable Optical Compute Interconnects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exponential growth of artificial intelligence (AI) workloads is driving an urgent demand for optical interconnects with ultrahigh bandwidth, energy efficiency, and scalability. Silicon photonics, with its CMOS compatibility and wafer-scale manufacturability, has emerged as a promising platform for optical interconnect architectures. Silicon microring modulators (MRMs), with their compact footprint, low power consumption, and high modulation efficiency, have become ideal devices for modulation in interconnects. However, silicon MRMS have so far been constrained by the trade-off between modulation efficiency and bandwidth, hindering their potential for 400 Gbps-per-wavelength operation. To mitigate this trade-off, here we demonstrate a wafer-level fabricated and high-bandwidth silicon MRM with a novel heavily-doped trench-integrated structure on a 300-mm silicon photonic platform, achieving both outstanding device performance and remarkable wafer-scale uniformity. Exploiting dual operation modes: self-biasing for energy-efficient scale-up interconnects and depletion driving for ultrafast scale-out links, the device supports error-free 32-Gbps NRZ transmission over 2-km SSMF with only 0.43-Vpp drive and zero electrical bias, yielding energy efficiency of 0.97 fJ/bit without DSP. At higher swings, it further supports 280-Gbps PAM4 and error-free 80-Gbps NRZ optical modulation. For scale-out interconnects, open eye diagrams are achieved at 200 Gbps (NRZ), 360 Gbps (PAM4), and a record 400 Gbps (PAM6), establishing the first wafer-scale silicon MRM solution reaching 400 Gbps/$\lambda$. The sub-fJ/bit energy efficiency and high bandwidth demonstrated in this work establish the MRM as a scalable, high-performance solution for next-generation optical interconnect architectures in AI computing networks</description>

      <title>Direct spatiotemporal imaging of a long-lived bulk photovoltaic effect in $BiFeO_{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE), a manifestation of broken centrosymmetry, has attracted interest as a probe of the symmetry and quantum geometry of materials, and for use in novel optoelectronic devices. Despite its bulk nature, the BPVE is typically measured with interfaces and metal contacts, raising concerns as to whether the observed signals are genuinely of bulk origin. Here, we use a contactless pump-probe microscopy method to observe the space- and time-resolved dynamics of photoexcited carriers in single-crystal, monodomain $BiFeO_{3}$. We observe asymmetric transport of carriers along the polar axis, confirming the intrinsic bulk and symmetry-driven nature of BPVE. This asymmetric transport persists for several nanoseconds after photoexcitation, which cannot be explained by the shift or phonon ballistic current BPVE mechanisms. Monte Carlo simulations show that asymmetric momentum scattering by defects under non-equilibrium conditions explains the long-lived carrier drift, while first principles calculations confirm that oxygen vacancies have an asymmetric electronic state that can cause such asymmetric scattering. Our findings highlight the critical role of defects in long-lived photoresponses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray scattering at the carbon absorption edge is uniquely sensitive to local molecular bond identity and orientation in organic nanostructures, encoded as a function of photon energy and polarization. However, quantitative analysis is precluded due to the lack of accurate optical models with bond and orientation specificity. We generate such a model through an algorithm that parameterizes and refines density functional theory calculations with angle-resolved absorbance spectroscopy measurements. The resulting optical tensor is shown to reproduce data from samples with domains of different orientation and crystalline packing, enabling label-free orientation analyses of individual chemical moieties within molecular nanostructures using resonant X-rays.</description>

Abstract: This work reports the fabrication and characterization of high-quality tungsten-doped vanadium dioxide (WxV1-xO2, x = 0~3 at. %) by thermal oxidation of sputtered tungsten-vanadium alloyed thin films with different atomic percentages and high-temperature annealing in an extremely low oxygen atmosphere (5 to 20 ppm) along with reduction of surface over-oxides in high vacuum (1 mPa). Oxidation parameters such as temperature, time and nitrogen purging rate are first optimized for obtaining high quality undoped VO2 thin film. Insulator-to-metal (IMT) phase transition behavior of VO2 thin films fabricated in a low-O2 environment is characterized with temperature dependent spectral infrared transmittance and electrical resistivity measurements, where there is 15% higher infrared transmittance change and additional 1 order change in resistivity in comparison with VO2 thin films fabricated in a O2-rich environment. Grazing angle X-ray diffraction scan confirms no presence of higher oxides in the VO2 oxidized in low-O2 environment, which improves its quality significantly. Comprehensive studies on thermal annealing and vacuum reduction for tungsten doped VO2 thin films are also carried out to find the optimal fabrication conditions. With the tungsten at. % measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, the optimal WVO2 thin films fabricated through this streamlined oxidation, annealing and reduction processes in extremely low-O2 furnace environment exhibit lowered IMT temperature at -23{\deg}C per at.% of tungsten dopants from 68{\deg}C without doping. This low-cost and scalable fabrication method could facilitate the wide development of tunable WVO2 coatings in thermal and energy applications.</description>

      <title>Impact of early-age exposure to power ultrasound on the micromechanical properties of hardened cement paste</title>

Abstract: Cement paste serves as the universal binder in concrete, formed by mixing water with Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC). In its fresh state, cement paste is a suspension in which the initial particle inventory continuously dissolves, while simultaneously, a growing population of colloidal calcium silica-hydrate (C-S-H) particles forms and progressively builds a percolated structure that densifies and hardens through hydration. Like most colloidal gels, cement paste is sensitive to external stimuli such as mechanical vibrations and temperature variations. Here, we show that power ultrasound (PUS) applied to OPC paste during the very early stages of hydration significantly alters the mechanical properties of the hardened material. Freshly prepared cement pastes are exposed to PUS at varying durations and intensities before curing for 28 days. Micro-indentation testing at the scale of tens of microns reveals that increasing PUS amplitude and prolonged PUS exposure degrade the micro-mechanical properties of hardened cement paste, making it more ductile. This softening behavior evolves continuously with exposure conditions and is consistent with an increase in porosity, likely caused by micro-cracks induced by PUS. This scenario is further supported by micro-scratch testing, which shows higher levels of acoustic emission in PUS-exposed samples. Finally, nano-indentation confirms that the properties of the individual phases composing the hardened paste -- low-density and high-density C-S-H -- remain largely unaffected. These findings offer valuable experimental insights into novel pathways for modifying the mechanical properties of reactive colloidal gels.</description>

      <title>Mechanical performance of hybrid polymer-lipid vesicles with leaflet asymmetry engineered using microfluidics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lipid vesicles consist of aqueous cores surrounded by a bilayer of phospholipids. Hybrid polymer-lipid vesicles incorporate both polymers and lipids, offering promising properties for developing pharmaceuticals, biosensors, and artificial cells. The hybrid vesicles can be symmetric, in which their two leaflets contain identical compositions, or asymmetric, in which the leaflets possess dissimilar compositions and can lead to dramatically modified properties. However, methods to produce both symmetric and asymmetric hybrid vesicles result in heterogenous compositions and sizes, making it challenging to quantify the effect of asymmetry and limiting applications. Here, we use a microfluidic approach to produce hybrid vesicles containing symmetric or asymmetric leaflets with precisely engineered compositions. We find the vesicles with asymmetric leaflets are significantly stiffer and tougher than those with symmetric leaflets; moreover, the lateral diffusivity of lipids is greatly decreased. The structure for improved toughness consists of an inner leaflet that is a stretchable lipid leaflet and an outer leaflet that is a fully continuous polymer leaflet. This technique of precisely engineering asymmetric structures may be applied to hybrid vesicles composed of block copolymers and phospholipids dissolvable in chloroform and hexane, further expanding their applications.</description>

      <title>Improving atomic force microscopy structure discovery via style-translation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomic force microscopy (AFM) is a key tool for characterising nanoscale structures, with functionalised tips now offering detailed images of the atomic structure. In parallel, AFM simulations using the particle probe model provide a cost-effective approach for rapid AFM image generation. Using state-of-the-art machine learning models and substantial simulated datasets, properties such as molecular structure, electrostatic potential, and molecular graph can be predicted from AFM images. However, transferring model performance from simulated to experimental AFM images poses challenges due to the subtle variations in real experimental data compared to the seemingly flawless simulations. In this study, we explore style translation to augment simulated images and improve the predictive performance of machine learning models in surface property analysis. We reduce the style gap between simulated and experimental AFM images and demonstrate the method's effectiveness in enhancing structure discovery models through local structural property distribution comparisons. This research presents a novel approach to improving the efficiency of machine learning models in the absence of labelled experimental data.</description>

Abstract: Phase reconstruction is important in transmission electron microscopy for structural studies. We describe electron Fourier ptychography and its application to phase reconstruction of both radiation-resistant and beam-sensitive materials. We demonstrate that the phase of the exit wave can be reconstructed to high resolution using a modified iterative phase retrieval algorithm using data collected in an alternative optical geometry. This method achieves a spatial resolution of 0.63 nm at a fluence of $4.5 \times 10^2 \, e^-/\text{nm}^2$, as validated on Cry11Aa protein crystals under cryogenic conditions. Notably, this method requires no additional hardware modifications, is straightforward to implement, and can be seamlessly integrated with existing data collection software, providing a broadly accessible alternative approach to structural studies.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel underground imaging system that utilizes cosmic-ray muons to explore the subsurface environment at the City of David archaeological site in ancient Jerusalem. This report details the initial findings from measurements conducted at a large cistern, commonly called "Jeremiah's cistern" (referenced in Jeremiah 38:6). The system aims to locate and map hidden voids and structural anomalies within the overburden. Our primary outcome is the derivation of the angular ground depth, which serves as a proxy for understanding the integrated density distribution of the overburden. This work represents a significant interdisciplinary effort to deepen our understanding of this historically important site.</description>

      <title>Photolithography-Compatible Three-Terminal Superconducting Switch for Driving CMOS Loads</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16314v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting devices have enabled breakthrough performance in quantum sensing and ultra-low-power computing. Nevertheless, the need for a cryo-electronics platform that can interface superconductor electronics with Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) devices has become increasingly evident in many cutting-edge applications. In this work, we present a three-terminal micrometer-wide superconducting wire-based cryotron switch (wTron), fabricated using photolithography, that can directly interface with CMOS electronics. The wTron features an output impedance exceeding 1 k$\Omega$ and exhibits reduced sensitivity to ambient magnetic noise, similar to its nanoscale predecessor, the nanocryotron. In addition, its micrometer-wide wires support switching currents in the mA range, making wTrons well-suited for driving current-hungry resistive loads and highly capacitive CMOS loads. We demonstrate this capability by using the wTron to drive room-temperature CMOS electronics, including an LED and a MOSFET with a gate capacitance of 500 pF. We then examine the optimal design parameters of wTrons to drive CMOS loads, such as MOSFETs, HEMTs, and electro-optic modulators. Furthermore, to demonstrate the foundry readiness of the wTron, we fabricated wTrons using MIT Lincoln Laboratory's SFQ5ee superconducting process and characterized their switching behavior. Our work shows that wTron will facilitate the interface between superconductor electronics and CMOS, thereby paving the way for the development of foundry-compatible cryo-electronic ecosystems to advance next-generation computing and quantum applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06247v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter presents miniature millimeter wave (mmWave, above 30 GHz) acoustic resonators based on a single-layer thin-film lithium niobate (LN) platform. More specifically, we present high performance third-order antisymmetric (A3) mode laterally excited bulk acoustic resonators (XBAR). Compared to prior demonstrations, the proposed platform features a compact footprint due to a smaller lateral wavelength and aperture. We showcase an A3 mode device operating at 39.8 GHz with a high extracted electromechanical coupling (k^2) of 4%, a high 3-dB series resonance quality factor (Q_s) of 97, and a high 3-dB anti-resonance quality factor (Q_p) of 342, leading to a figure of merit (FoM=k^2*Q_p) of 13.7 with a footprint of 32x44 micron^2. To demonstrate frequency scalability, the piezoelectric film thickness is varied while keeping the device layout. As a result, we present a multitude of high-performance devices covering a wide frequency range of 30-50 GHz, validating the proposed XBAR design at mmWave.</description>

      <title>A high-performance all-silicon photodetector enabling telecom-wavelength detection at room temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are crucial for advancing optical communications, promising substantial gains in data transmission speed, bandwidth, and energy efficiency compared to conventional electronics. Telecom-wavelength photodetectors, operating near 1550 nm, are indispensable in PICs, where they enable the sensitive and low-noise conversion of optical signals to electrical signals for efficient data processing. While silicon is ideal for passive optical components, its limited absorption in the optical telecommunication range (1260-1625 nm) typically necessitates integrating an alternative material, such as germanium, for photodetection - a process that introduces significant fabrication challenges. Here, we present a high-performance, all-silicon waveguide-coupled photodetector, which operates at room temperature within the optical telecom C band. By introducing deep-level impurities into silicon at concentrations close to the solid-solubility limit, we enable efficient sub-bandgap absorption without compromising recombination carrier lifetimes and mobilities. This detector achieves a responsivity of 0.56 A/W, a quantum efficiency of 44.8%, a bandwidth of 2 GHz, and a noise-equivalent power of 4.2E-10 W/Hz1/2 at 1550 nm, fulfilling requirements for telecom applications. Our approach provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for the monolithic integration of telecom-wavelength photodetectors into silicon-based PICs, advancing the development of compact photonic systems for modern communication infrastructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cathodoluminescence, i.e. the radiation caused by the interaction of high-energy electron beams with matter, has gained a major interest in the analysis of minerals, semiconductors, and plasmonic resonances in nanoparticles. This radiation can either be coherent or incoherent, depending on the underlying interaction mechanism of electrons with nanostructured matter. Thanks to their high spatial resolution and large spectral excitation bandwidth, the evanescent near-field of a moving electron in a scanning electron microscope is used to probe locally photonic modes at the nanoscale, e.g., exciton or plasmon polaritons. The properties of these excitations can be analyzed through both spectral and temporal statistics of the emitted light. Here, we report on the technical design and implementation of a novel fiber-based cathodoluminescence detector for a scanning electron microscope. Moreover, we present first characterization measurements to prove the ability for raster scanning the cathodoluminescence emission using optical fibers with 3D printed micro-optics. The functionality and flexibility of this fiber-based detector is highlighted by resolving the spatial far-field distribution of the excited light, as well as cathodoluminescence spectroscopy and time-correlated single photon counting. Our findings pave the way for a better understanding of the characteristic of the light emitted from electron beams interacting with nanostructures and two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Expedited Noise Spectroscopy of Transmon Qubits</title>

Abstract: There has been tremendous progress in the physical realization of quantum computing hardware in recent times, bringing us closer than ever before to realizing the promise of quantum computing. However, noise continues to pose a crucial challenge when it comes to scaling up present day quantum processors. While decoherence limits the qubits ability to store information for long periods in the presence of uncontrollable noise sources, the erroneous implementation of control methods for state preparation and measurements leads to faulty implementations of quantum circuits. Conventional noise spectroscopy protocols can characterize and model environmental noise but are usually resource intensive and lengthy. Moreover, the underlying noise can vary in nature over time, making noise profile extraction futile as this new information cannot be harnessed to improve quantum error correction or dynamical decoupling protocols. In this work, we address this challenge using a machine learning-based methodology to quickly extract noise spectra of multiple qubits and demonstrate a possible noise mitigation strategy. The procedure involves implementing undemanding dynamical decoupling sequences to record coherence decays of the investigated qubits and then predict the underlying noise spectra with the help of a convolution neural network pre-trained on a synthetic dataset. While our protocol is virtually hardware-agnostic, we validate its effectiveness using superconducting qubits available on the IBM Quantum platform. We further use these rapidly obtained, yet accurate, noise spectra to design bespoke dynamic decoupling sequences and perform time-dependent noise spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field dependent VB- spin decoherence in hexagonal boron nitrides: A first-principles study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-) in h-BN is a spin-1 defect functioning as an optically addressable spin qubit in two-dimensional materials. A precise understanding of its spin decoherence is essential to advance it into a robust qubit platform. First-principles quantum many-body simulations are employed to investigate VB- decoherence in dense nuclear spin baths of h-BN under magnetic fields from 0.01 to 3 T, considering isotopic variants h-10B14N, h-11B14N, h-10B15N, and h-11B15N. A transition boundary (TB) is observed where the dominant decoherence mechanism changes: below the TB, sub-microsecond decoherence is governed by independent nuclear spin dynamics, whereas above it, pairwise flip-flops dominate, extending T2 to tens of microseconds. Analytical predictions place the TB at 0.502 T for h-10B14N and 0.205 T for h-11B14N. The larger TB in h-10BN results from the larger nuclear spin of 10B (I = 3), which produces stronger nuclear modulation over a wider field range. The analytical approach also explains the magnetic-field-insensitive fast modulation observed below the TB. These findings clarify the role of dense nuclear spin baths with large nuclear spins (I &gt;= 1) in VB- decoherence and provide design principles for isotopically engineered h-BN spin qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07445v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances of quantum technologies rely on precise control and integration of quantum objects, and technological breakthrough is anticipated for further scaling up to realize practical applications. Trapped-ion quantum technology is a promising candidates to realize them, while its scalability depends on the development of intra-node scaling up, reproducibility of quantum nodes and photonic interconnection among them. Utilization of integrated photonics instead of free-space optics is a crucial step toward mass production of trapped-ion quantum nodes and manifests itself as useful for laser delivery for various quantum operations and photon detection. However, whole architecture of the scalable photonic circuits for them is left unexplored. In this work, we discuss photonic architectures for trapped-ion quantum devices, in which lasers of multiple wavelengths are delivered to multiple trapping zones within a single chip. We analyze two methods of configuring nanophotonic waveguides and compare them in terms of loss of total laser power. This work opens up a new landscape of photonic architecture for various applications not only to quantum ones such as trapped-ion devices but also to classical photonics, e.g. optoelectronic devices and biochemical sensing.</description>

      <title>Oxyfluoride glasses obtained through incorporation of CaF$_2$ into photovoltaic cover glass melts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07571v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The glass industry has limited options to mitigate its environmental footprint, and the demand for cover glass to produce photovoltaic panels is increasing. Currently, the majority of this special type of glass is not being recycled, and in this work, we propose to reuse it as raw material to obtain oxyfluoride glasses. The incorporation of CaF$_2$ and the increasing Na$_2$CO$_3$ content resulted in a melting temperature of about 1200$^o$C, significantly lower than in soda-lime glasses, which adds up to the environmental benefits of reusing end-of-life cover glass. The obtained samples show high transparency and thermal stability, allowing the cover glass to make up to 80\% of its weight. XRF analysis was employed to determine the elemental composition of the samples, while XRD and Raman indicated that by adding CaF$_2$, the glass network was depolymerized. In situ XRD as a function of temperature showed the formation of a few crystalline phases in these oxyfluoride samples, evidencing that it can be explored as a matrix to obtain different glass-ceramics. The combination of the glass properties indicates that this method and the resulting material can contribute to reducing the environmental impact of the glass industry, by creating new glass or glass-ceramic materials that can be obtained at a reduced temperature compared to the soda-lime glass, while cover glass being the primary raw material could reduce the need to extract minerals from nature.</description>

      <title>Terahertz-field activation of polar skyrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09958v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unraveling collective modes arising from coupled degrees of freedom is crucial for understanding complex interactions in solids and developing new functionalities. Unique collective behaviors emerge when two degrees of freedom, ordered on distinct length scales, interact. Polar skyrmions, three-dimensional electric polarization textures in ferroelectric superlattices, disrupt the lattice continuity at the nanometer scale with nontrivial topology, leading to previously unexplored collective modes. Here, using terahertz-field excitation and femtosecond x-ray diffraction, we discovered subterahertz collective modes, dubbed 'skyrons', which appear as swirling patterns of atomic displacements functioning as atomic-scale gearsets. Momentum-resolved time-domain measurements of diffuse scattering revealed an avoided crossing in the dispersion relation of skyrons. We further demonstrated that the amplitude and dispersion of skyrons can be controlled by sample temperature and electric-field bias. Atomistic simulations and dynamical phase-field modeling provided microscopic insights into the three-dimensional crystallographic and polarization dynamics. The discovery of skyrons and their coupling with terahertz fields opens avenues for ultrafast control of topological polar structures.</description>

      <title>Localized surface plasmons in a Weyl semimetal nanosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the localized surface plasmon modes of a sub-wavelength spherical nanoparticle composed of a Weyl semimetal, taking into account the axion modification of electrodynamics. We derive analytical solutions for dipole and quadrupole normal modes by employing the quasistatic approximation. The axion term leads to modified Fr\"ohlich conditions, resulting in multiple non-degenerate plasmonic resonances with distinct polarization dependencies. In contrast to isotropic conventional metals, the magnetoelectric properties of Weyl semimetals enable an incident electromagnetic field, with the electric field transverse to the surface of the sphere, to excite a localized surface plasmon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16665v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We benchmark Lumerical FDTD and Tidy3D for 3D simulations of passive silicon photonic components on the SOI platform. Six devices -- including an MMI, directional coupler, waveguide crossing, mode converter, polarization splitter rotator, and ring resonator -- are simulated under matched conditions using geometries from the generic PDK from GDSFactory. Our study emphasize on comparing simulation accuracy across both solvers, alongside an analysis of runtime and broadband behavior over varying resolutions and bandwidths. Results show that both solvers are reliable with minimal discrepancies</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependent Mechanical and Structural Properties of Uniaxially Strained Planar Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, like the Young modulus, the third-order elastic modulus, the tensile strength and failure strain, is presented. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature. The distributions of bond lengths and bond angles at different strains and temperatures are also discussed and approximate analytical expressions are presented. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</description>

      <title>Extracting Membrane-like hexagonal Boron Nitride hosting single Defect Centers for Resonator Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13985v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of membranes into optical resonators plays a key role in a variety of applications, including optomechanics. If such membranes host atom-like systems, ideally with access to spin states, new roads in quantum photonics and also in optomechanics can be taken. Layered, two-dimensional materials have emerged as candidates for membranes hosting atom-like quantum emitters. Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is among the most promising two-dimensional platforms showing good mechanical properties combined with the ability to host various kinds of optical active (spin-) defects. However, the determinisitc creation of optically active defect centers in hBN membranes is an outstanding challenge. Commercially available flakes of hBN host defect centers with promising optical properties, but the integration into optical resonators suffers from scattering losses due to the flakes topography and suitable transfer, handling and manipulation techniques need to be established. Here, we develope a toolset of nano-scaled manipulation techniques to extract membrane-like structures of commercially-available hBN containing spectrally narrow single photon emitters. We demonstrate the transfer and integration into photonic devices, by coupling a single photon emitter in membran-like hBN to the mode of an open Fabry-Perot fiber cavity (FPFC) and observe cavity induced spectral enhancement by a factor of up to 100 at room temperature. Overcoming hBN-induced scattering for extracted hBN membranes, which host single photon emitters, paves the way for future applications such as its use as an optomechanical system.</description>

      <title>FDTRImageEnhancer: Combining Physics-Informed Deconvolution and Microstructure-Aware Deep Learning to Enhance Thermal Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present FDTRImageEnhancer, an open-source computational framework that improves thermal conductivity mapping from Frequency Domain ThermoReflectance (FDTR) phase data by integrating a physics-based Gaussian convolution abstraction with microstructure-aware deep learning. The Gaussian kernel models the spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, while k-means clustering of high-resolution structural images reduces the parameter space for inverse modeling. A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the detection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in conventional FDTR inversions. Demonstrated on finite element-generated synthetic data, the framework recovers bulk values within less than 0.5% error and qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image resolution. Full Python code and datasets are provided for reproducibility, with the methodology readily adaptable to other inverse thermal transport problems.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the edge of chaos for combinatorial optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables. In particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Dick Effect for AI-based Dynamic Gravimeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atom interferometer (AI)-based dynamic gravimeter enable high-precision absolute gravity measurements, crucial for applications in geophysics, navigation, resource exploration, and metrology. Understanding their underlying mechanisms and minimizing measurement noise are essential for enhancing performance. This work investigates the gravity measurement noise in AI-based systems induced by the dead time of the classical accelerometer. Using actual dynamic gravity measurement data, we demonstrate that a dead time of 0.12 s introduces significant gravity measurement noise of 8 mGal. To elucidate the mechanism of this noise, we derive a formula for this noise in frequency domain, identifying high-frequency aliasing as its source. Analysis of the derived expressions indicates that reducing the dead time duration and suppressing the high-frequency noise of the acceleration are effective strategies for mitigating this noise. This work provides significant insights for noise analysis and future scheme design of AI-based dynamic gravimeters.</description>

      <title>Isotope Enrichment and Element Separation by Self Generated Magnetic Centrifuge Fields in Ultrafast Laser Ablation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20299v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A self-consistent model is developed to explain the anomalously large enrichment of nickel isotopes observed in ablation plumes from ultrafast laser irradiation of solid surfaces. The model is based on the spontaneous creation of a magnetic centrifuge in the ablation plume and the associated cyclotron rotation of plasma ions with rotation rates on the order of 10^9 radians per second. Mass separation occurs around the radial coordinate of cylindrical symmetry with longitudinal axis normal to the ablating surface. A Gaussian shaped radial magnetic field distribution is extracted for Ni isotopes with peak field of 53 Megagauss and average field of 20 Megagauss. In addition to cyclotron rotation of ions, a rigid rotor model is also presented that is associated with the hydrodynamic rotation of the entire plasma and is shown to be of little consequence for the isotope enrichment. Cyclotron rotations dominate the process. A profound resonance of enrichment is observed for specific cyclotron charge states and is shown to be associated with Ion Bernstein Wave (IBW) coupling that provides electrostatic acceleration to these resonant orbits.</description>
