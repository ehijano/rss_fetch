      <title>Stable Computation of Laplacian Eigenfunctions Corresponding to Clustered Eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate computation of eigenfunctions corresponding to tightly clustered Laplacian eigenvalues remains an extremely difficult problem. In this paper, using the shape difference quotient of eigenvalues, we propose a stable computation method for the eigenfunctions of clustered eigenvalues caused by domain perturbation.</description>

      <title>An analysis of capital market through the lens of integral transforms: exploring efficient markets and information asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Post Modigliani and Miller (1958), the concept of usage of arbitrage created a permanent mark on the discourses of financial framework. The arbitrage process is largely based on information dissemination amongst the stakeholders operating in the financial market. The advent of the efficient market Hypothesis draws close to the M&amp;M hypothesis. Giving importance to the arbitrage process, which effects the price discovery in the stock market. This divided the market as random and efficient cohort system. The focus was on which information forms a key factor in deciding the price formation in the market. However, the conventional techniques of analysis do not permit the price cycles to be interpreted beyond its singular wave-like cyclical movement. The apparent cyclic measurement is not coherent as the technical analysis does not give sustained result. Hence adaption of theories and computation from mathematical methods of physics ensures that these cycles are decomposed and the effect of the broken-down cycles is interpreted to understand the overall effect of information on price formation and discovery. In order to break the cycle this paper uses spectrum analysis to decompose and understand the above-said phenomenon in determining the price behavior in National Stock Exchange of India (NSE).</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of nonlinear Robin energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the asymptotic behavior of a class of nonlinear variational problems with Robin-type boundary conditions on a bounded Lipschitz domain. The energy functional contains a bulk term (the $p$-norm of the gradient), a boundary term (the $q$-norm of the trace) scaled by a parameter $\alpha&gt;0$, and a linear source term. By variational methods, we derive first-order expansions of the minimum as $\alpha\to 0^+$ (Neumann limit) and as $\alpha\to+\infty$ (Dirichlet limit). In the Dirichlet limit, the energy converges to the one of Dirichlet problem with a power-type quantified rate (depending only on $q$), while the Neumann limit exhibits a dichotomy: under a compatibility condition, the energy linearly approaches the one of Neumann problem, otherwise, it diverges as a power of $\alpha$ depending only on $q$.</description>

      <title>Dirac spectral flow and Floer theory of hyperbolic three-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the interplay between hyperbolic geometry and monopole Floer homology for a closed oriented three-manifold $Y$ with $b_1=1$ equipped with a torsion spin$^c$ structure $\mathfrak{s}$. We show that, under favorable circumstances, one can completely describe the Floer theory of $(Y,\mathfrak{s})$ purely in terms of geometric data such as the lengths and holonomies of closed geodesics. In particular, we perform the first computations of monopole Floer chain complexes with non-trivial homology for hyperbolic three-manifolds. The examples we consider admit no irreducible solutions to the Seiberg-Witten equations, and the non-triviality of the Floer homology groups is a consequence of the geometry of the $1$-parameter family of Dirac operators associated to flat spin$^c$ connections. The main technical challenge is to understand explicitly how the Dirac eigenvalues with small absolute value cross the value zero in this family; we tackle this using Fourier analytic tools via the corresponding $1$-parameter family of odd Selberg trace formulas and its derivative.</description>

      <title>Spectral convergence of graph Laplacians with Ricci curvature bounds and in non-collapsed Ricci limit spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes quantitative high-probability bounds on the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of $\epsilon$-neighborhood graph Laplacians constructed from i.i.d. random variables on $m$-dimensional closed Riemannian manifolds $(M,g)$ that satisfy a uniform lower Ricci curvature bound $\operatorname{Ric}_g\ge -(m-1)K$, a positive lower volume bound, and an upper diameter bound. These results extend to non-collapsed Ricci limit spaces that are measured Gromov-Hausdorff limits of such manifolds, and the bounds give a spectral approximation of weighted Laplacians on manifolds with non-smooth points.</description>

      <title>On the stability of the annulus for the torsion of multiply connected domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a quantitative version of the isoperimetric inequality for the torsion of multiply connected domains, among sets with given area and with given joint area of the holes.
  Since the optimal shape is the annulus, we investigate how a given domain approaches an annular configuration when its torsion is close to the optimal value. Our result shows that when the torsional rigidity is nearly optimal, the domain $\Omega$ must be close to an annulus.</description>

      <title>Heat Kernel on Warped Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral properties of the scalar Laplacian on a $n$-dimen\-sional warped product manifold $M=\Sigma\times_f N$ with a $(n-1)$-dimensional compact manifold $N$ without boundary, a one dimensional manifold $\Sigma$ without boundary and a warping function $f\in C^\infty(\Sigma)$. We consider two cases: $\Sigma=S^1$ when the manifold $M$ is compact, and $\Sigma=\mathbb{R}$ when the manifold $M$ is non-compact. In the latter case we assume that the warping function $f$ is such that the manifold $M$ has two cusps with a finite volume. In particular, we study the case of the warping function $f(y)=[\cosh(y/b)]^{-2\nu/(n-1)}$ in detail, where $y\in\mathbb{R}$ and $b$ and $\nu$ are some positive parameters. We study the properties of the spectrum of the Laplacian in detail and show that it has both the discrete and the continuous spectrum. We compute the resolvent, the eigenvalues, the scattering matrix, the heat kernel and the regularized heat trace. We compute the asymptotics of the regularized heat trace of the Laplacian on the warped manifold $M$ and show that some of its coefficients are global in nature expressed in terms of the zeta function on the manifold $N$.</description>

      <title>Neural Tangent Kernel Analysis to Probe Convergence in Physics-informed Neural Solvers: PIKANs vs. PINNs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (PIKANs), and in particular their Chebyshev-based variants (cPIKANs), have recently emerged as promising models for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, their training dynamics and convergence behavior remain largely unexplored both theoretically and numerically. In this work, we aim to advance the theoretical understanding of cPIKANs by analyzing them using Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) theory. Our objective is to discern the evolution of kernel structure throughout gradient-based training and its subsequent impact on learning efficiency. We first derive the NTK of standard cKANs in a supervised setting, and then extend the analysis to the physics-informed context. We analyze the spectral properties of NTK matrices, specifically their eigenvalue distributions and spectral bias, for four representative PDEs: the steady-state Helmholtz equation, transient diffusion and Allen-Cahn equations, and forced vibrations governed by the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation. We also conduct an investigation into the impact of various optimization strategies, e.g., first-order, second-order, and hybrid approaches, on the evolution of the NTK and the resulting learning dynamics. Results indicate a tractable behavior for NTK in the context of cPIKANs, which exposes learning dynamics that standard physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) cannot capture. Spectral trends also reveal when domain decomposition improves training, directly linking kernel behavior to convergence rates under different setups. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic NTK study of cPIKANs, providing theoretical insight that clarifies and predicts their empirical performance.</description>

      <title>On domain monotonicity of Neumann eigenvalues of convex domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by a recent result of Funano's, we provide a sharp quantitative comparison result between the first nontrivial eigenvalues of the Neumann Laplacian on bounded convex domains $\Omega_{1} \subset \Omega_{2}$ in any dimension $d$ greater than or equal to two, recovering domain monotonicity up to an explicit multiplicative factor. We provide upper and lower bounds for such multiplicative factors for higher-order eigenvalues, and study their behaviour with respect to the dimension and order. We further consider different scenarios where convexity is no longer imposed. In a final section we formulate some related open problems.</description>

      <title>Notions of entropy for unitary representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13751v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Several notions of entropy are studied widely in the ergodic theory of probability-preserving actions of countable groups. These include the generalization of Kolmogorov--Sinai entropy for amenable groups using F\o lner sequences, percolative entropy entropy for general countable groups, and Bowen's sofic entropy for sofic groups.
  In this work we pursue these notions across the analogy between ergodic theory and representation theory. We arrive at new quantities associated to unitary representations of groups and representations of other C*-algebras. Our main results show that these new quantities can generally be evaluated as Fuglede--Kadison determinants. The resulting formulas for those determinants can be seen as various non-commutative generalizations of Szeg\H{o}'s limit theorem for Toeplitz determinants. They also establish connections with Arveson's theory of subdiagonal subalgebras, and with some more recent exact entropy calculations in the ergodic theory of actions by automorphisms of compact Abelian groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a scattering problem generated by the Sturm-Liouville equation on a tree which consists of an equilateral compact subtree and a half-infinite lead attached to its root. We assume that the potential on the lead is identically zero while the potentials on the finite edges are real. We show how to find the shape of the tree using the S-function of the scattering problem and the eigenvalues of the operators associated with the compact tree.</description>
