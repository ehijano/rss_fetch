      <title>Toward a Sparse and Interpretable Audio Codec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most widely-used modern audio codecs, such as Ogg Vorbis and MP3, as well as more recent "neural" codecs like Meta's Encodec or the Descript Audio Codec are based on block-coding; audio is divided into overlapping, fixed-size "frames" which are then compressed. While they often yield excellent reproductions and can be used for downstream tasks such as text-to-audio, they do not produce an intuitive, directly-interpretable representation. In this work, we introduce a proof-of-concept audio encoder that represents audio as a sparse set of events and their times-of-occurrence. Rudimentary physics-based assumptions are used to model attack and the physical resonance of both the instrument being played and the room in which a performance occurs, hopefully encouraging a sparse, parsimonious, and easy-to-interpret representation.</description>

      <title>Fast Differentiable Modal Simulation of Non-linear Strings, Membranes, and Plates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modal methods for simulating vibrations of strings, membranes, and plates are widely used in acoustics and physically informed audio synthesis. However, traditional implementations, particularly for non-linear models like the von K\'arm\'an plate, are computationally demanding and lack differentiability, limiting inverse modelling and real-time applications. We introduce a fast, differentiable, GPU-accelerated modal framework built with the JAX library, providing efficient simulations and enabling gradient-based inverse modelling. Benchmarks show that our approach significantly outperforms CPU and GPU-based implementations, particularly for simulations with many modes. Inverse modelling experiments demonstrate that our approach can recover physical parameters, including tension, stiffness, and geometry, from both synthetic and experimental data. Although fitting physical parameters is more sensitive to initialisation compared to other methods, it provides greater interpretability and more compact parameterisation. The code is released as open source to support future research and applications in differentiable physical modelling and sound synthesis.</description>

      <title>Learning Music Audio Representations With Limited Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large deep-learning models for music, including those focused on learning general-purpose music audio representations, are often assumed to require substantial training data to achieve high performance. If true, this would pose challenges in scenarios where audio data or annotations are scarce, such as for underrepresented music traditions, non-popular genres, and personalized music creation and listening. Understanding how these models behave in limited-data scenarios could be crucial for developing techniques to tackle them.
  In this work, we investigate the behavior of several music audio representation models under limited-data learning regimes. We consider music models with various architectures, training paradigms, and input durations, and train them on data collections ranging from 5 to 8,000 minutes long. We evaluate the learned representations on various music information retrieval tasks and analyze their robustness to noise. We show that, under certain conditions, representations from limited-data and even random models perform comparably to ones from large-dataset models, though handcrafted features outperform all learned representations in some tasks.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Blind Speech Separation with a Diffusion Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blind Speech Separation (BSS) aims to separate multiple speech sources from audio mixtures recorded by a microphone array. The problem is challenging because it is a blind inverse problem, i.e., the microphone array geometry, the room impulse response (RIR), and the speech sources, are all unknown. We propose ArrayDPS to solve the BSS problem in an unsupervised, array-agnostic, and generative manner. The core idea builds on diffusion posterior sampling (DPS), but unlike DPS where the likelihood is tractable, ArrayDPS must approximate the likelihood by formulating a separate optimization problem. The solution to the optimization approximates room acoustics and the relative transfer functions between microphones. These approximations, along with the diffusion priors, iterate through the ArrayDPS sampling process and ultimately yield separated voice sources. We only need a simple single-speaker speech diffusion model as a prior along with the mixtures recorded at the microphones; no microphone array information is necessary. Evaluation results show that ArrayDPS outperforms all baseline unsupervised methods while being comparable to supervised methods in terms of SDR.

      <title>A vector quantized masked autoencoder for audiovisual speech emotion recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03568v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important challenge in emotion recognition is to develop methods that can leverage unlabeled training data. In this paper, we propose the VQ-MAE-AV model, a self-supervised multimodal model that leverages masked autoencoders to learn representations of audiovisual speech without labels. The model includes vector quantized variational autoencoders that compress raw audio and visual speech data into discrete tokens. The audiovisual speech tokens are used to train a multimodal masked autoencoder that consists of an encoder-decoder architecture with attention mechanisms. The model is designed to extract both local (i.e., at the frame level) and global (i.e., at the sequence level) representations of audiovisual speech. During self-supervised pre-training, the VQ-MAE-AV model is trained on a large-scale unlabeled dataset of audiovisual speech, for the task of reconstructing randomly masked audiovisual speech tokens and with a contrastive learning strategy. During this pre-training, the encoder learns to extract a representation of audiovisual speech that can be subsequently leveraged for emotion recognition. During the supervised fine-tuning stage, a small classification model is trained on top of the VQ-MAE-AV encoder for an emotion recognition task. The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art emotion recognition results across several datasets in both controlled and in-the-wild conditions.</description>

      <title>Miipher-2: A Universal Speech Restoration Model for Million-Hour Scale Data Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training data cleaning is a new application for generative model-based speech restoration (SR). This paper introduces Miipher-2, an SR model designed for million-hour scale data, for training data cleaning for large-scale generative models like large language models. Key challenges addressed include generalization to unseen languages, operation without explicit conditioning (e.g., text, speaker ID), and computational efficiency. Miipher-2 utilizes a frozen, pre-trained Universal Speech Model (USM), supporting over 300 languages, as a robust, conditioning-free feature extractor. To optimize efficiency and minimize memory, Miipher-2 incorporates parallel adapters for predicting clean USM features from noisy inputs and employs the WaveFit neural vocoder for waveform synthesis. These components were trained on 3,000 hours of multi-lingual, studio-quality recordings with augmented degradations, while USM parameters remained fixed. Experimental results demonstrate Miipher-2's superior or comparable performance to conventional SR models in word-error-rate, speaker similarity, and both objective and subjective sound quality scores across all tested languages. Miipher-2 operates efficiently on consumer-grade accelerators, achieving a real-time factor of 0.0078, enabling the processing of a million-hour speech dataset in approximately three days using only 100 such accelerators.</description>
