      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the dynamical stability under linear perturbations of interacting systems in the hydrodynamic regime follows from the first and the second laws of thermodynamics. Our argument extends to systems with spontaneously or softly broken symmetries and in the presence of magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Reviving QFT in $2+1$ de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a conformally coupled scalar QFT on $2+1$ dimensional static Einstein universe $R \times S^2$, and write down the free theory Hilbert space. We explain that this theory is secretly a QFT in $2+1$ de Sitter space because all the quantum observables experience {\it quantum revivals}, which naturally restricts the timelike $R$ to the appropriate de Sitter time range. Our construction circumvents the causal obstruction to formulating QFT in de Sitter due to event horizons. There aren't any in static Einstein. The `unitary gauge' description of the theory is realized by the zonal harmonics $P_\ell(\hat n \cdot \hat n')$. We verify that interactions with conformally invariant external sources are mediated only by these modes. Hence these modes comprise the complete basis of the "bulk" theory. When the theory is cut off in the UV the basis dimension scales as the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.</description>

      <title>Holographic Hagedorn Temperature: Strong Coupling, Flavor and $\theta$-angle Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Hagedorn temperature $T_H$ of strongly coupled quantum field theories admitting a holographic string or M-theory description in various regimes and scenarios.
  In the first part of the paper we propose a ``thermal scalar'' effective approach to the calculation of $T_H$ in eleven-dimensional supergravity. The proposal allows to extend the existing results for $T_H$ to the strongly coupled string regime, i.e. to a previously unexplored regime of field theory parameters where the number of colors $N$ is smaller than (some power of) the 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$. We can thus extend the existing results for the $\alpha'$ expansion of the ABJM model, which have a spectacular agreement with predictions from integrability, in a different direction in parameter space. In particular, we explicitate the first non-perturbative corrections. We also apply the formalism to the Witten-Yang-Mills model, finding that the result for the ratio of $T_H$ with the deconfinement temperature is in the same ballpark of the lattice one for pure Yang-Mills. Within the same model, we study the dependence of the Hagedorn temperature on the $\theta$-angle.
  In the second part of the paper we analyze the effect of dynamical flavors on $T_H$ in confining theories. By studying the few available examples of regular backgrounds dual to confining theories with flavors, we find that generally the effects of flavors is to reduce the value of $T_H$ in units of the square root of the confining string tension. The effect turns out to be milder than the analogous reduction of the critical temperature for deconfinement when the latter is known.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in conformal field theory and holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a measure of symmetry breaking in quantum subsystems, inspired by quantum information theory, particularly suited to study out-of-equilibrium states. We study the entanglement asymmetry of a class of excited "coherent states" in conformal quantum field theories with a U(1) symmetry, employing Euclidean path-integral methods with topological symmetry defects and the replica formalism. We compute, at leading order in perturbation theory, the asymmetry for a variety of subsystems, including finite spherical subregions in flat space, in finite volume, and at positive temperature. We also study its Lorentzian time evolution, showcasing the dynamical restoration of the symmetry due to thermalization, as well as the presence of a quantum Mpemba effect. Our results are universal, and apply in any number of dimensions. We also show that the perturbative entanglement asymmetry is related to the Fisher information metric, which has a known holographic dual called Hollands-Wald canonical energy, and that it is captured by the AdS bulk charge contained in the entanglement wedge.</description>

      <title>Giant graviton expansion from eigenvalue instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, S. Murthy has proposed a convergent expansion of free partition functions and superconformal indices of finite-$N$ purely adjoint gauge theories based on a Fredholm determinant expansion. This expansion has been dubbed the giant graviton expansion and takes the form of an infinite series of corrections to the $N=\infty$ result, with the $m^\text{th}$ correction being of order $e^{-mN}$. We show that this expansion can be reproduced using eigenvalue instantons in unitary matrix integrals. This perspective allows us to get the giant graviton expansion proposed by S. Murthy without the intermediate step of the Hubbard Stratonovich transformation.</description>

      <title>Light transformation: A Celestial and Carrollian perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first study the consequence of spacetime translations and Lorentz transformations on Celestial CFT OPEs. Working with the light transforms of the operators belonging to the modified Mellin basis, we found that the leading order singularity in the OPE of such operators could be fixed purely using Poincar\'e symmetries owing to the non-trivial action of the translations on these operators. The OPE coefficient is then fixed using the soft limit of the correlation functions. We check that this singular structure obtained from symmetries is consistent with the OPE limit of three-point functions. This approach could potentially be useful for studying Celestial CFT without adverting to bulk physics. As another goal, we explore the significance of light transformation in Carrollian CFTs. In the special cases we considered, we show that light transformation equips us with a map between two branches of Carroll CFT in $d=3$ dimension at the level of correlation functions in near coincident limit.</description>

      <title>Vortices on Cylinders and Warped Exponential Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study 3d $\mathcal{N}=2$ $U(1)$ Chern-Simons-matter QFT on a cylinder $C\times\mathbb{R}$. The topology of $C$ gives rise to BPS sectors of low-energy solitons known as kinky vortices, which interpolate between (possibly) different vacua at the ends of the cylinder and at the same time carry magnetic flux.
  We compute the spectrum of BPS vortices on the cylinder in an isolated Higgs vacuum, through the framework of \emph{warped} exponential networks, which we introduce. We then conjecture a relation between these and standard vortices on $\mathbb{R}^2$, which are related to genus-zero open Gromov-Witten invariants of toric branes. More specifically, we show that in the limit of large Fayet-Iliopoulos coupling, the spectrum of kinky vortices on $C$ undergoes an infinite sequence of wall-crossing transitions, and eventually stabilizes. We then propose an exact relation between a generating series of stabilized CFIV indices and the Gromov-Witten disk potential, and discuss its consequences for the structure of moduli spaces of vortices.</description>

      <title>Off-shell invariants of linearized $4D, \mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity in the harmonic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the harmonic superspace approach, we construct, at the linearized level, $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric curvatures generalizing scalar curvature, Ricci curvature and Weyl tensor. These supercurvatures are the building blocks of various linearized $4D, \, \mathcal{N}=2$ Einstein supergravity invariants. The supercurvatures involving the scalar and Ricci curvatures are analytic harmonic ${\cal N}=2$ superfields, while the Weyl supertensor is a chiral $\mathcal{N}=2$ superfield. As the basic distinguished feature of our construction, all these objects are expressed through the fundamental analytic gauge prepotentials $h^{++M}, M= (\alpha\dot\alpha, +\alpha, +\dot\alpha, 5)$. The related characteristic features are the heavy use of harmonic derivatives and harmonic zero-curvature equations. On a number of instructive examples, we describe the component reduction of the superfield invariants constructed.</description>

      <title>Operator Origin of Anomalous Dimensions in de Sitter Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The late time limit of the power spectrum for heavy (principal series) fields in de Sitter space yields a series of polynomial terms with complex scaling dimensions. Such scaling behavior is expected to result from an associated operator with a complex dimension. In a free theory, these complex dimensions are known to match the constraints imposed by unitarity on the space of states. Yet, perturbative corrections to the scaling behavior of operators are naively inconsistent with unitary evolution of the quantum fields in dS. This paper demonstrates how to compute one-loop corrections to the scaling dimensions that appear in the two point function from the field theory description in terms of local operators. We first show how to evaluate these anomalous dimensions using Mellin space, which has the feature that it naturally accommodates a scaleless regulator. We then explore the consequences for the Soft de Sitter Effective Theory (SdSET) description that emerges in the long wavelength limit. Carefully matching between the UV and SdSET descriptions requires the introduction of novel non-dynamical "operators" in the effective theory. This is not only necessary to reproduce results extracted from the K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation (that use the space of unitary states directly), but it is also required by general arguments that invoke positivity.</description>

      <title>Analytic trajectory bootstrap for matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the large $N$ two-matrix model with $\text{Tr}[A,B]^2$ interaction and quartic potentials by the analytic trajectory bootstrap, where $A$ and $B$ represent the two matrices. In the large $N$ limit, we can focus on the single trace moments associated with the words composed of the letters $A$ and $B$. Analytic continuations in the lengths of the words and subwords lead to analytic trajectories of single trace moments and intriguing intersections of different trajectories. Inspired by the one-cut solutions of one-matrix models, we propose some simple ansatzes for the singularity structure of the two-matrix generating functions and the corresponding single trace moments. Together with the self-consistent constraints from the loop equations, we determine the free parameters in the ansatzes and obtain highly accurate solutions for the two-matrix model at a low computational cost. For a given length cutoff $L_\text{max}$, our results are within and more accurate than the positivity bounds from the relaxation method, such as about 6-digit accuracy for $L_\text{max}=18$. The convergence pattern suggests that we achieve about $8$-digit accuracy for $L_\text{max}=22$. As the singularity structure is closely related to the eigenvalue distributions, we further present the results for various types of eigenvalue densities. In the end, we study the symmetry breaking solutions using more complicated ansatzes.</description>

      <title>Resilience of DBI screened objects and their ladder symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar field theories with a shift symmetry come equipped with the $K$-mouflage (or kinetic screening) mechanism that suppresses the scalar interaction between massive objects below a certain distance, the screening radius. In this work, we study the linear response of the scalar field distribution around a screened (point-like) object subject to a long range external scalar field perturbation for the Dirac-Born-Infeld theory. We find that, for regular boundary conditions at the position of the particle, some multipoles have vanishing response for a lacunar series of the multipole order $\ell$ for any dimension. Some multipoles also exhibit a logarithmic running when the number of spatial dimensions is even. We construct a ladder operator structure, with its associated ladder symmetries, formed by two sets of ladders that are related to the properties of the linear response and the existence of conserved charges. Our results exhibit a remarkable resemblance with the Love numbers properties of black holes in General Relativity, although some intriguing differences subsist.</description>

      <title>Planar decomposition of the HOMFLY polynomial for bipartite knots and links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of the Kauffman bracket, which describes the Jones polynomial as a sum over closed circles formed by the planar resolution of vertices in a knot diagram, can be straightforwardly lifted from sl(2) to sl(N) at arbitrary N -- but for a special class of bipartite diagrams made entirely from the anitparallel lock tangle. Many amusing and important knots and links can be described in this way, from twist and double braid knots to the celebrated Kanenobu knots for even parameters -- and for all of them the entire HOMFLY polynomials possess planar decomposition. This provides an approach to evaluation of HOMFLY polynomials, which is complementary to the arborescent calculus, and this opens a new direction to homological techniques, parallel to Khovanov-Rozansky generalisations of the Kauffman calculus. Moreover, this planar calculus is also applicable to other symmetric representations beyond the fundamental one, and to links which are not fully bipartite what is illustrated by examples of Kanenobu-like links.</description>

      <title>Folding QQ-relations and transfer matrix eigenvalues: towards a unified approach to Bethe ansatz for super spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16660v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extending the method proposed in [arXiv:1109.5524], we derive QQ-relations (functional relations among Baxter Q-functions) and T-functions (eigenvalues of transfer matrices) for fusion vertex models associated with the twisted quantum affine superalgebras $U_{q}(gl(2r+1|2s)^{(2)})$, $U_{q}(gl(2r|2s+1)^{(2)})$, $U_{q}(gl(2r|2s)^{(2)})$, $U_{q}(osp(2r|2s)^{(2)})$ and the untwisted quantum affine orthosymplectic superalgebras $U_{q}(osp(2r+1|2s)^{(1)})$ and $U_{q}(osp(2r|2s)^{(1)})$ (and their Yangian counterparts, $Y(osp(2r+1|2s))$ and $Y(osp(2r|2s))$) as reductions (a kind of folding) of those associated with $U_{q}(gl(M|N)^{(1)})$. In particular, we reproduce previously proposed generating functions (difference operators) of the T-functions for the symmetric or anti-symmetric representations, and tableau sum expressions for more general representations for orthosymplectic superalgebras [arXiv:0911.5393,arXiv:0911.5390], and obtain Wronskian-type expressions (analogues of Weyl-type character formulas) for them. T-functions for spinorial representations are related to reductions of those for asymptotic limits of typical representations of $U_{q}(gl(M|N)^{(1)})$.</description>

      <title>Towards an Interpretation of the First Measurements of Energy Correlators in the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy correlators have recently been proposed as a class of jet substructure observables that directly link experimental measurements of the asymptotic energy flux with the field theoretic description of the underlying microscopic dynamics. This link holds particular promise in heavy-ion physics, where both experimental measurements and theoretical interpretations are inherently complex. With recent measurements of energy correlators in proton-proton collisions, the first measurement of these observables on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions underscores the importance of a theoretical understanding of their behavior in this complex environment. In this manuscript, we extend our previous calculations to account for several effects necessary for a qualitative understanding of the behavior of energy correlators on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions. Through a semi-analytic approach implemented in a hydrodynamically expanding quark-gluon plasma (QGP), we account for medium-induced radiation with leading broadening effects, selection biases arising from energy loss, and a description of the confinement transition. Our results represent a crucial first step towards interpreting the measurements of energy correlators on inclusive jets in heavy-ion collisions, which marks a significant milestone in connecting heavy-ion experiment and fundamental quantum field theory, in the quest to disentangle the microscopic dynamics of the QGP.</description>

      <title>Analytic framework for self-dual criticality in $\mathbb{Z}_k$ gauge theory with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the putative multicritical point in 2+1D $\mathbb{Z}_k$ gauge theory where the Higgs and confinement transitions meet. The presence of an $e$-$m$ duality symmetry at this critical point forces anyons with nontrivial braiding to close their gaps simultaneously, giving rise to a critical theory that mixes strong interactions with mutual statistics. An effective U(1) $\times$ U(1) gauge theory with a mutual Chern-Simons term at level $k$ is proposed to describe the vicinity of the multicritical point for $k \geq 4$. We argue analytically that monopoles are irrelevant in the IR CFT and compute the scaling dimensions of the leading duality-symmetric/anti-symmetric operators. In the large $k$ limit, these scaling dimensions approach $3 - \nu_{\rm XY}^{-1}$ as $1/k^2$, where $\nu_{\rm XY}$ is the correlation length exponent of the 3D XY model.</description>

      <title>Regular Electric Black Holes from EMS Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar (EMS) theories that admit regular electric black holes. Such a Maxwell-scalar theory is equivalent to some nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) at the level of equations of motion, but it has the advantage of circumventing the no-go theorem of regular electric black holes under a given Lagrangian of NLED. We study the thermodynamics and show that the mass of the regular black hole can be determined solely by the Maxwell field, without having to know the metric profile function. Our formalism allows to study the applications of the electrically-charged regular black holes in areas that were previously available only to the non-regular ones.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Gravitational Waves as a probe of the unknown post-inflationary primordial Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the key predictions of the standard inflationary paradigm is the quantum mechanical generation of the transverse and traceless tensor fluctuations due to the rapid accelerated expansion of space, which later constitute a stochastic background of primordial gravitational waves (GWs). The amplitude of the (nearly) scale-invariant inflationary tensor power spectrum at large scales provides us with crucial information about the energy scale of inflation in the case of the minimal inflaton coupling to gravity. Furthermore, the spectral energy density, $\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}(f)$, of the GWs at sufficiently small scales (or, large frequencies $f$) serves as an important observational probe of post-inflationary primordial dynamics. In fact, the small-scale spectral tilt, $n_{_{\rm GW}} = \frac{{\rm d}\log{\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}}}{{\rm d}\log{f}}$, of the spectral energy density of GWs is sensitive to the (unknown) post-inflationary equation of state (EoS), $w$, of the universe; with a softer EoS ($w &lt; 1/3$) leading to a red tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &lt; 0$, while a stiffer EoS ($w &gt; 1/3$) resulting in a blue tilt: $n_{_{\rm GW}} &gt; 0$. The post-inflationary dynamics, however, is generically expected to be quite complex, potentially involving a number of distinct phases. Hence, in this work, we discuss the possibility of multiple sharp transitions, namely $w_1 \to w_2 \to w_3 \to ... \to w_n$, in the EoS of the post-inflationary universe and compute the corresponding spectral energy density of the inflationary GWs. We explicitly determine the region of the parameter space $\lbrace{ w_1, \, w_2, \, w_3, ..., w_n\rbrace}$ which leads to a potentially detectable signal in the upcoming GW detectors, without violating the current constraints.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07964v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the invertible and non-invertible symmetries of topological finite group gauge theories in general spacetime dimensions, where the gauge group can be Abelian or non-Abelian. We focus in particular on the 0-form symmetry. The gapped domain walls that generate these symmetries are specified by boundary conditions for the gauge fields on either side of the wall. We investigate the fusion rules of these symmetries and their action on other topological defects including the Wilson lines, magnetic fluxes, and gapped boundaries. We illustrate these constructions with various novel examples, including non-invertible electric-magnetic duality symmetry in 3+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, and non-invertible analogs of electric-magnetic duality symmetry in non-Abelian finite group gauge theories. In particular, we discover topological domain walls that obey Fibonacci fusion rules in 2+1d gauge theory with dihedral gauge group of order 8. We also generalize the Cheshire string defect to analogous defects of general codimensions and gauge groups and show that they form a closed fusion algebra.</description>

      <title>General relativistic viscous accretion flow around a gravitational wave inspired black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the physical properties of accretion flows around Konoplya-Zhidenko (KZ) black hole, proposed by deforming Kerr spacetime to address the inaccuracies in the observation of gravitational waves resulting from a binary black hole merger. The dynamical equations describing the general relativistic viscous accreting flow are solved self-consistently to find the transonic accretion solutions in terms of global constants, such as energy ($E$), angular momentum ($\mathcal{L}$), viscosity parameter ($\alpha$), spin ($a_{k}$), and deformation parameter ($\eta_0$). We obtain five distinct types of accretion solutions (O, A, $\text{A}^{\prime}$, W, and I-types) and observe that those solutions are not unique but rather continue to exist for wide range of parameter spaces in the $\mathcal{L}-E$ plane. Furthermore, we find that the viscous accretion flows can harbor shock waves when relativistic shock conditions are satisfied. Consequently, the shock-induced global accretion solutions are obtained and the effect of $\eta_0$ on shock properties, such as shock radius ($r_{\rm sh}$) and change in electron temperature ($T_{\rm e}$) across the shock front are investigated. Moreover, we calculate the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of accretion flow using the relativistic thermal bremsstrahlung emission coefficient and study the modification of SEDs due to the increase of $\eta_0$ for both shock-induced and shock-free solutions. In addition, it has been noticed that the observable quantities, like quasi-periodic oscillation frequency ($\nu_{\rm QPO}$) and bolometric disc luminosity ($L$), are strongly depend on $\eta_0$. Finally, we phenomenologically show that the KZ black hole is consistent with the observed high-frequency QPOs, commonly observed in black hole binaries and black hole candidates.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of the gravitational scattering in the absence of peeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The symmetries of the gravitational scattering are intimately tied to the symmetries which preserve asymptotic flatness at null infinity. In Penrose's definition of asymptotic flatness, a central role is played by the notion of asymptotic simplicity and the ensuing peeling behavior which dictates the decay rate of the Weyl tensor. However, there is now accumulating evidence that in a generic gravitational scattering the peeling property is broken, so that the spacetime is not asymptotically-flat in the usual sense. These obstructions to peeling can be traced back to the existence of universal radiative low frequency observables called ''tails to the displacement memory''. The universality of these tail modes is the statement of the classical logarithmic soft graviton theorem of Sahoo, Saha and Sen. Four-dimensional gravitation scattering therefore exhibits a rich infrared interplay between tail to the memory, loss of peeling, and universal logarithmic soft theorems. In this paper we study the solution space and the asymptotic symmetries for logarithmically-asymptotically-flat spacetimes. These are defined by a polyhomogeneous expansion of the Bondi metric which gives rise to a loss of peeling, and represent the classical arena which can accommodate a generic gravitational scattering containing tails to the memory. We show that while the codimension-two generalized BMS charges are sensitive to the loss of peeling at $\mathcal{I}^+$, the flux is insensitive to the fate of peeling. Due to the tail to the memory, the soft superrotation flux contains a logarithmic divergence whose coefficient is the quantity which is conserved in the scattering by virtue of the logarithmic soft theorem. In our analysis we also exhibit new logarithmic evolution equations and flux-balance laws, whose presence suggests the existence of an infinite tower of subleading logarithmic soft graviton theorems.</description>

Abstract: A novel thermodynamic phenomenon has been observed in the quantum Ba\~{n}ados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (qBTZ) black hole, utilizing generalized free energy and Kramer escape rate. This phenomenon also reveals the unique property of the quantum black hole. The stochastic thermal motion of various thermodynamic states within the black hole system induces phase transitions, under the influence of generalized free energy which obtained by extending Maxwell's construction. Through the analysis of Kramer escape rate, it is discovered that the qBTZ black hole thermodynamic system exhibits a bounce effect. Furthermore, the overall thermodynamic picture of the qBTZ black hole has been obtained under different quantum backreactions.</description>

Abstract: The newly discovered Wormhole C--metric is a solution of Einstein's field equation coupled with a phantom scalar field which describes the accelerated wormholes. In the zero acceleration limit the solution reduces to an asymptotically flat wormhole. For certain range of parameter space this solution doesn't possess any horizon, thus making it a viable candidate of wormhole. To completely unveil this property we have studied the topological properties of this spacetime and shown that the throat is marginally connected. In the aforementioned range of parameters, the spacetime doesn't posses any photon orbit confirming the absence of shadow. We further analysed the stability of this spacetime under scalar perturbation. Under the usual boundary conditions (outgoing waves at both spatial infinities) there exists a continuous spectra. On the contrary one may achieve the quantization of the modes by exploiting a different but physically intuitive boundary condition. The lowest lying mode behaves as normal mode, and the imaginary part comes into play for the modes corresponding to first overtone number $(n=1)$ marking the onset of quasi-nomral modes for all azimuthal quantum number, $L$. We have also argued that the spacetime has a tendency to hold the excitation in it due to the external perturbation, rather than a fast de-excitation.</description>

Abstract: Since the development of Brans-Dicke gravity, it has become well-known that a conformal transformation of the metric can reformulate this theory, transferring the coupling of the scalar field from the Ricci scalar to the matter sector. Specifically, in this new frame, known as the Einstein frame, Brans-Dicke gravity is reformulated as General Relativity supplemented by an additional scalar field. In 1959, Hans Adolf Buchdahl utilized an elegant technique to derive a set of solutions for the vacuum field equations within this gravitational framework. In this paper, we extend Buchdahl's method to incorporate the cosmological constant and to the scalar-tensor cases beyond the Brans-Dicke archetypal theory, thereby, with a conformal transformation of the metric, obtaining solutions for a version of Brans-Dicke theory that includes a quadratic potential. More specifically, we obtain synchronous solutions in the following contexts: in scalar-tensor gravity with massless scalar fields, Brans-Dicke theory with a quadratic potential, where we obtain specific synchronous metrics to the Schwarzschild-de Sitter metric, the Nariai solution, and a hyperbolically foliated solution.</description>

      <title>Topological AdS black holes surrounded by Chaplygin dark fluid: from stability to geometrothermodynamic analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implementing the concept of Dark Fluid with a Chaplygin-like equation of state within General Relativity, we construct a new higher-dimensional, static, and spherically symmetric anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole solution. Energy conditions are explored alongside curvature singularity tools. The inspection at the level of the phase structure and $P-v$ critical behavior is carried out in the context of the extended phase space, where the cosmological constant appears as pressure. Our findings disclose non-trivial similarities between the small/large phase transition of AdS black holes surrounded by Chaplygin dark fluid and van der Waals systems' liquid/gas phase transition. This analysis offers insights into the physical interpretation of the $P-v$ diagram and identifies critical exponents that reveal the scaling behavior of thermodynamic quantities close to criticality in a universal manner. We finally deepen our understanding of the thermodynamic properties and microstructure of AdS black holes by leveraging the geometrothermodynamic formalism. Specifically, we employ tools, including Weinhold, Ruppeiner, Hendi-Panahiyan-Eslam-Momennia (HPEM) and Quevedo classes I and II. We show that each class of metrics predicts either the physical limitation point and/or the phase-transition critical points, with HPEM and Quevedo formulations providing richer information about the phase transitions. Altogether, this study contributes to advancing our knowledge of the role of Chaplygin gas in General Relativity and thoroughly examining the thermodynamic phase structure of high-dimensional AdS black holes under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>Investigating tidal heating in neutron stars via gravitational Raman scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a scattering amplitude formalism to study the tidal heating effects of nonspinning neutron stars incorporating both worldline effective field theory and relativistic stellar perturbation theory. In neutron stars, tidal heating arises from fluid viscosity due to various scattering processes in the interior. It also serves as a channel for the exchange of energy and angular momentum between the neutron star and its environment. In the interior of the neutron star, we first derive two master perturbation equations that capture fluid perturbations accurate to linear order in frequency. Remarkably, these equations receive no contribution from bulk viscosity due to a peculiar adiabatic incompressibility which arises in stellar fluid for non-barotropic perturbations. In the exterior, the metric perturbations reduce to the Regge-Wheeler (RW) equation which we solve using the analytical Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi (MST) method. We compute the amplitude for gravitational waves scattering off a neutron star, also known as gravitational Raman scattering. From the amplitude, we obtain expressions for the electric quadrupolar static Love number and the leading dissipation number to all orders in compactness. We then compute the leading dissipation number for various realistic equation-of-state(s) and estimate the change in the number of gravitational wave cycles due to tidal heating during inspiral in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) band.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate cosmological constraints on the holographic dark energy (HDE) using the state-of-the-art cosmological datasets: Planck CMB angular power spectra and weak lensing power spectra, Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) temperature power spectra, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and redshift-space distortion (RSD) measurements from six-degree-field galaxy survey and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (DR12 &amp; DR16) and the Cepheids-Supernovae measurement from SH0ES team (R22). We also examine the HDE model and $\Lambda$CDM with and without $N_{\rm eff}$ (effective number of relativistic species) being treated as a free parameter. We find that the HDE model can relieve the tensions of $H_0$ and $S_8$ to certain degrees. With ``Planck+ACT+BAO+RSD'' datasets, the constraints are $H_0 = 69.70 \pm 1.39\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ and $S_8 = 0.823 \pm 0.011$ in HDE model, which brings down the Hubble tension down to $1.92\sigma$ confidence level (C.L.) and the $S_8$ tension to $1$-$2\sigma$ C.L. By adding the R22 data, their values are improved as $H_0 = 71.86 \pm 0.93 \,\mathrm{km\ s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ and $S_8 = 0.813 \pm 0.010$, which further brings the Hubble tension down to $0.85\sigma$ C.L. and relieves the $S_{8}$ tension. We also quantify the goodness-of-fit of different models with Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC), and find that the HDE agrees with the observational data better than the $\Lambda$CDM and other extended models (treating $N_{\rm eff}$ as free for fitting).</description>

      <title>The Memory of Primordial Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial gravitational waves, after they enter the horizon and decay away, leave a residual displacement in test particles: a memory, in analogy with gravitational waves generated by astrophysical sources. The displacement in the distance between test particles $\xi^i$ does not depend on the cosmological evolution, but only on the primordial value $\bar h^i_{j}$ of the gravitational wave: $\Delta \xi^i = -\frac 12 \bar h^i_{j} \xi^j$. The memory is thus related to the adiabatic tensor mode that maps the unperturbed FLRW geometries at early and late times; this is analogous to the relation between memory in Minkowski spacetime and the BMS group. The primordial memory is also connected to the consistency relations of cosmological correlators, as the flat-space memory is related to the soft theorems for gravitational wave emission. We comment on the signature of the effect on the CMB $B$-modes and on the large-scale structure. There is also a primordial memory effect that is subleading in the spatial gradients of the wave: it is encoded in the rotation of free-falling gyroscopes.</description>

Abstract: We present quantum kinetic equations for neutrinos and derive Feynman rules for computing scattering rates involving coherent states. Our rules encompass both flavour- and particle-antiparticle coherence and allow writing down the scattering matrix elements and collision integrals with the same intuitive ease as with the usual non-coherent Feynman rules. Our results are useful for computing collision rates that arise routinely in the context of coherently mixing neutrinos with arbitrary masses. We give several explicit examples, including some collision integrals for coherently mixing neutrinos in supernovae.</description>

Abstract: High-energy scattering in pQCD in the Regge limit is described by the evolution of Wilson lines governed by the BK equation. In the leading order, the BK equation is conformally invariant and the eigenfunctions of the linearized BFKL equation are powers. It is a common belief that at $d\neq 4$ the BFKL equation is useless since unlike $d=4$ case it cannot be solved by usual methods. However, we demonstrate that at critical Wilson-Fisher point of QCD the relevant part of NLO BK restores the conformal invariance so the solutions are again powers. As a check of our approach to high-energy amplitudes at the Wilson-Fisher point, we calculate the anomalous dimensions of twist-2 light-ray operators in the Regge limit $j\rightarrow 1$.}</description>

Abstract: Topological field theories and holomorphic field theories naturally appear in both mathematics and physics. However, there exist intriguing hybrid theories that are topological in some directions and holomorphic in others, such as twists of supersymmetric field theories or Costello's 4-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. In this paper, we rigorously prove the ultraviolet (UV) finiteness for such hybrid theories on flat space, and present two significant vanishing results regarding anomalies.</description>

      <title>Non-universal SUSY models, $g_\mu-2$, $m_H$ and dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, $g_\mu - 2 \equiv 2 a_\mu$, in the context of supersymmetric models beyond the CMSSM, where the unification of either the gaugino masses $M_{1,2,3}$ or sfermion and Higgs masses is relaxed, taking into account the measured mass of the Higgs boson, $m_H$, the cosmological dark matter density and the direct detection rate. We find that the model with non-unified gaugino masses can make a contribution $\Delta a_\mu\sim 20 \times 10^{-10}$ to the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, for example if $M_{1,2} \sim 600$ GeV and $M_3\sim 8$ TeV. The model with non-universal sfermion and Higgs masses can provide even larger $\Delta a_\mu \sim 24 \times 10^{-10}$ if the sfermion masses for the first and the second generations are $ \sim 400 $ GeV and that of the third is $ \sim 8 $ TeV. We discuss the prospects for collider searches for supersymmetric particles in specific benchmark scenarios illustrating these possibilities, focusing in particular on the prospects for detecting the lighter smuon and the lightest neutralino.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional doped Dirac insulators foster simply connected (in both topological and trivial regimes) and annular (deep inside the topological regime) Fermi surfaces (FSs) in the normal state, and allow on-site repulsions among fermions with opposite spin ($U_1$) and parity ($U_2$) eigenvalues. From an unbiased leading-order (one-loop) renormalization group analysis, controlled by a suitable $\epsilon$ expansion, we show that this system develops strong propensity toward the nucleation of scalar $s$-wave and odd-parity pseudoscalar $p$-wave pairings, favored by repulsive $U_1$ and $U_2$ interactions, respectively, irrespective of the underlying FS topology. Our results can be pertinent for the observed superconductivity in various doped narrow gap semiconductors, and the theoretical foundation can readily be applied to investigate similar phenomenon in various doped topological materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1802.07819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are two sets of orbits of the Virasoro group which admit a K\"ahler structure. We consider the construction of coherent states for the orbit $\widehat{{\rm diff}\,S^1}$/$SL(2, {\mathbb R})$ which furnishes unitary representations of the group. The procedure is analogous to geometric quantization using a holomorphic polarization. We also give an explicit formula for the K\"ahler potential for this orbit and comment on normalization of the coherent states. We further explore some of the properties of these states, including the definition of symbols corresponding to operators and their star products. Some comments which touch upon the possibility of applying this to gravity in (2+1) dimensions are also given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2003.02879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the perturbative expansion of the free energy on $S^4$ for four dimensional Lagrangian ${\cal N}=2$ superconformal field theories, to all orders in the 't Hooft coupling, in the planar limit. We do so by using supersymmetric localization, after rewriting the 1-loop factor as an effective action involving an infinite number of single and double trace terms. The answer we obtain is purely combinatorial, and involves a sum over tree graphs. We also apply these methods to the perturbative expansion of the free energy at finite $N$, and to the computation of the vacuum expectation value of the 1/2 BPS circular Wilson loop, which in the planar limit involves a sum over rooted tree graphs.</description>

      <title>Boundary conditions and anomalies of conformal field theories in 1+1 dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.11190v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a relationship between conformally invariant boundary conditions and anomalies of conformal field theories (CFTs) in 1+1 dimensions. For a given CFT with a global symmetry, we consider symmetric gapping potentials which are relevant perturbations to the CFT. If a gapping potential is introduced only in a subregion of the system, it provides a certain boundary condition to the CFT. From this equivalence, if there exists a Cardy boundary state which is invariant under a symmetry, then the CFT can be gapped with a unique ground state by adding the corresponding gapping potential. This means that the symmetry of the CFT is anomaly free. Using this approach, we systematically deduce the anomaly-free conditions for various types of CFTs with several different symmetries. They include the free compact boson theory, Wess-Zumino-Witten models, and unitary minimal models. When the symmetry of the CFT is anomalous, it implies a Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type ingappability of the system. Our results are consistent with, where available, known results in the literature. Moreover, we extend the discussion to other symmetries including spin groups and generalized time-reversal symmetries.</description>

      <title>The Tameness of Quantum Field Theory, Part I -- Amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a generalized finiteness principle for physical theories, in terms of the concept of tameness in mathematical logic. A tame function or space can only have a finite amount of structure, in a precise sense which we explain. Tameness generalizes the notion of an analytic function to include certain non-analytic limits, and we show that this includes many limits which are known to arise in physics. For renormalizable quantum field theories, we give a general proof that amplitudes at each order in the loop expansion are tame functions of the external momenta and the couplings. We then consider a variety of exact non-perturbative results and show that they are tame but only given constraints on the UV definition of the theory. This provides further evidence for the recent conjecture of the second author that all effective theories that can be coupled to quantum gravity are tame. We also discuss whether renormalization group flow is tame, and comment on the applicability of our results to effective theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08498v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterotic toriodal Z2xZ2 orbifolds may possess discrete torsion between the two defining orbifold twists in the form of additional cocycle factors in their one-loop partition functions. Using Gauged Linear Sigma Models (GLSMs) the consequences of discrete torsion can be uncovered when the orbifold is smoothed out by switching on appropriate blowup modes. Here blowup modes with twisted oscillator excitations are chosen to reproduce bundles that are close to the standard embedding without torsion. The orbifold resolutions with discrete torsion are distinguished from resolutions without torsion, since they require NS5-branes at their exceptional cycles.</description>

      <title>Graviton Mass and Entanglement Islands in Low Spacetime Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been conjectured and proven that entanglement island is not consistent with long-range (massless) gravity in a large class of spacetimes, including typical asymptotically anti-de Sitter spacetimes, in high spacetime dimensions. The conjecture and its proof are motivated by the observation that existing constructions of entanglement islands in high dimensions are all in gravitational theories where the graviton is massive for which the standard gravitational Gauss' law doesn't apply. In this letter, we show that this observation persists to lower dimensional cases. We achieve this goal by providing a unified description of the gravitational Gauss' law violation in island models that can work in any dimensions. This unified description teaches us new lessons on entanglement islands and subregion physics in quantum gravity. We focus on the case of the (1+1)-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity for the purpose of demonstration.</description>

      <title>On AdS/CFT duality in the twisted sector of string theory on $AdS_5 \times S^5/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider type IIB string theory on an $AdS_5 \times S^5/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold background, which should be dual to 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal $SU(N)\times SU(N)$ gauge theory with two bi-fundamental hypermultiplets. The correlator of two chiral BPS operators from the twisted sector of this quiver CFT exhibits non-trivial dependence on the 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$ already in the planar limit. This dependence was recently determined using localisation and the expansion at large $\lambda$ contains a subleading contribution proportional to $\zeta(3) \lambda^{-3/2}$. We address the question of how to reproduce this correction on the string theory side by starting with the $\zeta(3) \alpha'^3$ term in the type IIB string effective action. We find a solution of type IIB supergravity which represents a resolution of the $AdS_5 \times S^5/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold singularity and demonstrate that the relevant light twisted sector states may be identified as additional supergravity 2-form modes "wrapping" a finite 2-cycle in the resolution space. Reproducing the structure of the gauge theory result becomes more transparent in the large R-charge or BMN-like limit in which the resolved background takes a pp-wave form with the transverse space being a product of $\mathbb R^4$ and the Eguchi-Hanson space.</description>

      <title>NCoder -- A Quantum Field Theory approach to encoding data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to interpretable AI inspired by Quantum Field Theory (QFT) which we call the NCoder. The NCoder is a modified autoencoder neural network whose latent layer is prescribed to be a subset of $n$-point correlation functions. Regarding images as draws from a lattice field theory, this architecture mimics the task of perturbatively constructing the effective action of the theory order by order in an expansion using Feynman diagrams. Alternatively, the NCoder may be regarded as simulating the procedure of statistical inference whereby high dimensional data is first summarized in terms of several lower dimensional summary statistics (here the $n$-point correlation functions), and subsequent out-of-sample data is generated by inferring the data generating distribution from these statistics. In this way the NCoder suggests a fascinating correspondence between perturbative renormalizability and the sufficiency of models. We demonstrate the efficacy of the NCoder by applying it to the generation of MNIST images, and find that generated images can be correctly classified using only information from the first three $n$-point functions of the image distribution.</description>

Abstract: We study marginal deformations of ${\cal N}=2$, $d=4$ long linear quiver CFTs using the holographic description. We find a two-parameter family of AdS$_5$ solutions that generically break all of supersymmetry, but preserve ${\cal N}=1$ for a particular tuning of the parameters. We study the G-structure of the ${\cal N}=2$ "parent" and the ${\cal N}=1$ backgrounds and carefully discuss the quantisation of charges in all cases. For the ${\cal N}=1$ and ${\cal N}=0$ cases, a picture emerges with "branes" back-reacted on either a spindle or its higher dimensional analogue. Comments on the marginally deformed dual CFTs are given, together with the study of some observables.</description>

Abstract: We work the lattice fermions and non-Hermitian formulation in the 2D GNY model and demonstrate the numerical implementation for two flavors by the Hybrid Monte Carlo. Our approach has a notable advantage in dealing with chiral symmetry on a lattice by avoiding the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem, due to the non-symmetrized finite-difference operator. We restore the hypercubic symmetry by averaging over all possible orientations with the proper continuum limit. Our study is the first simulation for the interacting fermion formulated in a non-hermitian way. We compare the numerical solution with the one-loop resummation. The resummation results matches with the numerical solution in $\langle\phi\rangle$, $\langle\phi^2\rangle$, $\langle\mathrm{Tr}(\bar{\psi}_1\psi_1+\bar{\psi}_2\psi_2)/2\rangle$, and $\langle\mathrm{Tr}(\bar{\psi}_1\psi_1+\bar{\psi}_2\psi_2)\phi/2\rangle$. We also used the one-loop resummation to provide the RG flow and asymptotic safety in the 2D GNY model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalized global symmetries, in particular non-invertible and categorical symmetries, have become a focal point in the recent study of quantum field theory (QFT). In this paper, we investigate aspects of symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs) and anomalies of non-invertible symmetries for 2D QFTs from a string theory perspective. Our primary focus is on an infinite class of 2D QFTs engineered on D1-branes probing toric Calabi-Yau 4-fold singularities. We derive 3D SymTFTs from the topological sector of IIB supergravity and discuss the resulting 2D QFTs, which can be intrinsically relative or absolute. For intrinsically relative QFTs, we propose a sufficient condition for them to exist. For absolute QFTs, we show that they exhibit non-invertible symmetries with an elegant brane origin. Furthermore, we find that these non-invertible symmetries can suffer from anomalies, which we discuss from a top-down perspective. Explicit examples are provided, including theories for $Y^{(p,k)}(\mathbb{P}^2)$, $Y^{(2,0)}(\mathbb{P}^1\times \mathbb{P}^1)$, and $\mathbb{C}^4/\mathbb{Z}_4$ geometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any unitary conformal field theory in two dimensions with the central charge $c$, we prove that, if there is a nontrivial primary operator whose conformal dimension $\Delta$ vanishes in some limit on the conformal manifold, the Zamolodchikov distance $t$ to the limit is infinite, the approach to this limit is exponential $\Delta = \exp(- \alpha t +O(1) )$, and the decay rate obeys the universal bounds $c^{-1/2} \leq \alpha \leq 1$. In the limit, we also find that an infinite tower of primary operators emerges without a gap above the vacuum and that the conformal field theory becomes locally a tensor product of a sigma-model in the large radius limit and a compact theory. As a corollary, we establish a part of the Distance Conjecture about gravitational theories in three-dimensional anti-de Sitter space. In particular, our bounds on $\alpha$ indicate that the emergence of exponentially light states is inevitable as the moduli field corresponding to $t$ rolls beyond the Planck scale along the steepest path and that this phenomenon can begin already at the curvature scale of the bulk geometry. We also comment on implications of our bounds for gravity in asymptotically flat spacetime by taking the flat space limit and compare with the Sharpened Distance Conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a general gravitational wave detector of gravitational wave interacting with an incoming gravitational wave carrying plus polarization only placed inside a harmonic trap. This model can be well acquainted with the description of a resonant detector of gravitational wave as well. The well known detector-gravitational wave interaction scenario uses the method of a semi classical approach where the detector is treated quantum mechanically but the gravitational wave is considered at a classical level. In our analysis, we use a discrete mode decomposition of the gravitational wave perturbation which results in a Hamiltonian involving the position and momentum operators corresponding to the gravitational wave and the harmonic oscillator. We have then calculated the transition probability for the harmonic oscillator-gravitational wave tensor product state for going from an initial state to some unknown final state. Using the energy flux relation of the gravitational waves, we observe that if we consider the total energy as a combination of the number of gravitons in the initial state of the detector then the transition probability for the resonant absorption case scenario takes the analytical form which is exactly similar to the semi-classical absorption case. In case of the emission scenario, we observe a spontaneous emission of a single graviton which was completely absent in the semi-classical analouge of this model. This therefore gives a direct signature of linearized quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Notes on heating phase dynamics in Floquet CFTs and Modular quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we explore the connection between the heating phase of periodically driven CFTs and the Modular Hamiltonian of a subregion in the vacuum state. We show that the heating phase Hamiltonian corresponds to the Modular Hamiltonian, with the fixed points mapping to the endpoints of the subregion. In the bulk dual, we find that these fixed points correspond to the Ryu-Takayanagi surface of the AdS-Rindler wedge. Consequently, the entanglement entropy associated to the boundary interval within two fixed points exactly matches with the Rindler entropy of AdS-Rindler. We observe the emergent Virasoro algebra in the boundary quantization of the Modular Hamiltonian has a striking similarity with the emergent near Horizon Virasoro algebra. This is a consequence of the fact that while obtaining the boundary Virasoro algebra, a cut-off with conformal boundary condition around the fixed point is introduced, which in the bulk is related to a stretched horizon, with an emergent two-dimensional conformal symmetry. We also argue that as one tunes the parameter space of Floquet Hamiltonians to transition from the non-heating to the heating phase the operator algebra type changes from Von Neumann type $I$ to $III_1$ factor, providing a non-equilibrium analogue of the Hawking-Page transition.</description>

Abstract: Recently, a new generalized family of infinite-dimensional $ \widetilde{W} $ algebras, each associated with a particular element of a commutative subalgebra of the $ W_{1+\infty} $ algebra, was described. This paper provides a comprehensive account of the aforementioned association, accompanied by the requisite proofs and illustrative examples. This approach allows a derivation of Ward identities for selected WLZZ matrix models and the expansion of corresponding $ W $-operators in terms of an infinite set of variables $ p_k $.</description>

      <title>The Penrose limit of the Weyl double copy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We embed the Penrose limit into the Weyl classical double copy. Thereby, we provide a lift of the double copy properties of plane wave spacetimes into black hole geometries and we open a novel avenue towards taking the classical double copy beyond statements about algebraically special backgrounds. In particular, the Penrose limit, viewed as the leading order Fermi coordinate expansion around a null geodesic, complements approaches leveraging asymptotic flatness such as the asymptotic Weyl double copy. Along the way, we show how our embedding of the Penrose limit within the Weyl double copy naturally fixes the functional ambiguity in the double copy for Petrov type N spacetimes. We also highlight the utility of a spinorial approach to the Penrose limit. In particular, we use this spinorial approach to derive a simple analytical expression for arbitrary Penrose limits of four-dimensional, vacuum type D spacetimes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that BPS-impurity theories may support BPS kink-kink solutions i.e., an energetically degenerated family of solutions describing two kinks at any mutual distance. This requires a singular impurity. As an example we consider the sine-Gordon and $\phi^6$ models coupled with such a BPS impurity. Interestingly, obtained solutions are identical to double sine-Gordon kinks and Christ-Lee kinks respectively.
  We also study the spectral flow on the moduli space. All the modes have an odd number of nodes to cancel the singularity of the impurity.</description>

      <title>Conformal Yang-Mills field in (A)dS space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ordinary-derivative (second-derivative) Lagrangian formulation of classical conformal Yang-Mills field in the (A)dS space of six, eight, and ten dimensions is developed. For such conformal field, we develop two gauge invariant Lagrangian formulations which we refer to as generic formulation and decoupled formulation. In both formulations, the usual Yang-Mills field is accompanied by additional vector and scalar fields, where the scalar fields are realized as Stueckelberg fields. In the generic formulation, the usual Yang-Mills field is realized as a primary field, while the additional vector fields are realized as auxiliary fields. In the decoupled formulation, the usual Yang-Mills field is realized as massless field, while the additional vector fields together with the Stueckelberg are realized as massive fields. Some massless/massive fields appear with the wrong sign of kinetic terms, hence demonstrating explicitly that the considered model is not unitary. The use of embedding space method allows us to treat the isometry symmetries of (A)dS space manifestly and obtain conformal transformations of fields in a relatively straightforward way. Accompanying each vector field by the respective gauge parameter, we introduce an extended gauge algebra. Levy-Maltsev decomposition of such algebra is noted. Use of the extended gauge algebra setup allows us to present concise form for the Lagrangian and gauge transformations of the conformal Yang-Mills field.</description>

      <title>Exponential Modification of AdS Black Hole and Thermodynamic Behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an exponential modification for the action of an AdS black hole in the absence of a matter field. An approximated black hole solution is obtained up to the third order of perturbation coefficient. A thermodynamic investigation in canonical ensemble shows that the behavior of a Van der Waals fluid is not seen in this model. Nevertheless, the study of thermodynamic potentials and other related quantities suggests that the thermodynamic phase transitions of the first and second types can occur in this model. The forms of the phase transitions are more similar to the Hawking-Page phase transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.06196v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By refining the method proposed in arXiv:2010.07660, entropy current and entropy density for a relativistic hydrostatic equilibrium system with spherical symmetry are constructed as a non-Noether conserved charge in the Einstein gravity with cosmological constant. It is shown that the constructed entropy density satisfies both the local Euler relation and the first law of thermodynamics non-perturbatively with respect to the Newton constant. Finally the established relativistic thermodynamics is applied to one of the systems with uniform energy density as a crude model of a degenerate star and its local thermodynamic observables are determined analytically.</description>

      <title>Entropic distinguishability of quantum fields in phase space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general way of quantifying the entropic uncertainty of quantum field configurations in phase space in terms of entropic distinguishability with respect to the vacuum. Our approach is based on the functional Husimi $Q$-distribution and a suitably chosen relative entropy, which we show to be non-trivially bounded from above by the uncertainty principle. The resulting relative entropic uncertainty relation is as general as the concept of coherent states and thus holds for quantum fields of bosonic and fermionic type. Its simple form enables diverse applications, among which we present a complete characterization of the uncertainty surplus of arbitrary states in terms of the total particle number for a scalar field and the fermionic description of the Ising model. Moreover, we provide a quantitative interpretation of the role of the uncertainty principle for quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric response in nodal-point semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this review, the thermoelectric properties in nodal-point semimetals with two bands are discussed. For the two-dimensional (2D) cases, it is shown that the expressions of the thermoelectric coefficients take different values depending on the nature of the scattering mechanism responsible for transport, by considering examples of short-ranged disorder potential and screened charged impurities. An anisotropy in the energy dispersion spectrum invariably affects the thermopower quite significantly, as illustrated by the results for a node of semi-Dirac semimetal and a single valley of graphene. The scenario when a magnetic field of magnitude $B$ is applied perpendicular to the plane of the 2D semimetal is also considered. The computations for three-dimensional (3D) cases necessarily involve the inclusion of nontrivial Berry phase effects. In addition to demonstrating the expressions for the response tensors, the exotic behaviour observed in planar Hall and planar thermal Hall set-ups is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Revisiting string-inspired running-vacuum models under the lens of light primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses $M_\mathrm{PBH}&lt;10^9\mathrm{g}$ can interestingly dominate the Universe's energy budget and give rise to early matter-dominated (eMD) eras before Big Bang Nucleosyntesis (BBN). During this eMD era, one is met with an abundant production of induced gravitational waves (GWs) serving as a portal to constrain the underlying theory of gravity. In this work, we study this type of induced GWs within the context of string-inspired running-vaccuum models (StRVMs), which, when expanded around de Sitter backgrounds, include logarithmic corrections of the space-time curvature. In particular, we discuss in detail the effects of StRVMs on the source as well as on the propagation of these PBH-induced GWs. Remarkably, under the assumption that the logarithmic terms represent quantum gravity corrections in the PBH era, we show that GW overproduction can be avoided if one assumes a coefficient of these logarithmic corrections that is much larger than the square of the reduced Planck mass. The latter cannot characterise quantum gravity corrections, though, prompting the need for revision of the quantisation of StRVMs in different than de Sitter backgrounds, such as those characterising PBH-driven eMD eras. This non trivial result suggests the importance of light PBHs as probes of new physics.</description>

      <title>Energy momentum tensor on and off the light cone: exposition with scalar Yukawa theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06896v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the gravitational form factors $A_i$, $D_i$ and $\bar c_i$ of the scalar Yukawa theory using both the light-cone and covariant perturbation theory at the one-loop level. The light-cone formalism provides a potential approach to access these form factors beyond the perturbative regime. However, unlike the covariant formulation, the Poincar\'e symmetry on the light cone is not manifest. In this work, we use perturbation theory as a benchmark to extract the gravitational form factors from the light-front energy-momentum tensor. By comparing results on and off the light cone, we identify $T^{++}, T^{+a}, T^{+-}, T^{12}$ as the "good currents" that are properly renormalized and can be used to extract the gravitational form factors.</description>

Abstract: The hallmark of the 4-parameter generalized entropy is that it can represent various known entropies proposed so far for suitable limits of the parameters, and thus the 4-parameter generalized entropy can be applied on additive as well as on non-additive systems. Thereafter the proposal of the generalized entropy, it becomes important to constrain the corresponding parameters. In the present work, we intend to do this from the perspective of primordial gravitational waves (GWs) generated during inflation. In the background level, the generalized entropy successfully drives a viable and smooth evolution of the universe, particularly from inflation to reheating followed by a radiation era, for certain ranges of the entropic parameters. Consequently we investigate whether such viable ranges of the entropic parameters (coming from the background level) allow the primordial GWs spectrum to pass through the sensitivity curves of various GWs observatories. Therefore, if the future observatories can detect the signal of primordial GWs, then our theoretical expectation carried in the present work may provide a possible tool for the measurement of the generalized entropic parameters.</description>

      <title>Higher-Dimensional MOG dark compact object: shadow behavior in the light of EHT observations</title>

Abstract: Consideration of extra spatial dimensions is motivated by the unification of gravity with other interactions, the achievement of the ultimate framework of quantum gravity, and fundamental problems in particle physics and cosmology. Much attention has been focused on the effect of these extra dimensions on the modified theories of gravity. Analytically examining astrophysical phenomena like black hole shadows is one approach to understand how extra dimensions would affect the modified gravitational theories. The purpose of this study is to derive a higher dimensional metric for a dark compact object in STVG theory and then examine the behavior of the shadow shapes for this solution in STVG theory in higher dimensions. We apply the Carter method to formulate the geodesic equations and the Hamilton Jacobi method to find photon orbits around this higher dimensional MOG dark compact object. We investigate the effects of extra dimensions and the STVG parameter alpha on the black hole shadow size. Next, we compare the shadow radius of this higher dimensional MOG dark compact object to the shadow size of the supermassive black hole M87, which has been realized by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaborations, in order to restrict these parameters. We find that extra dimensions in the STVG theory typically lead to a reduction in the shadow size of the higher dimensional MOG dark compact object, whereas the effect of parameter alpha on this black hole shadow is suppressible. Remarkably, given the constraints from EHT observations, we find that the shadow size of the four dimensional MOG dark compact object lies in the confidence levels of the EHT data. Finally, we investigate the issue of acceleration bounds in higher dimensional MOG dark compact object in confrontation with EHT data of M87.</description>
