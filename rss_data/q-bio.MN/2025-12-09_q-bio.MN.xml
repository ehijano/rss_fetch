      <title>Interpretable Neural Approximation of Stochastic Reaction Dynamics with Guaranteed Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic Reaction Networks (SRNs) are a fundamental modeling framework for systems ranging from chemical kinetics and epidemiology to ecological and synthetic biological processes. A central computational challenge is the estimation of expected outputs across initial conditions and times, a task that is rarely solvable analytically and becomes computationally prohibitive with current methods such as Finite State Projection or the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm. Existing deep learning approaches offer empirical scalability, but provide neither interpretability nor reliability guarantees, limiting their use in scientific analysis and in applications where model outputs inform real-world decisions. Here we introduce DeepSKA, a neural framework that jointly achieves interpretability, guaranteed reliability, and substantial computational gains. DeepSKA yields mathematically transparent representations that generalise across states, times, and output functions, and it integrates this structure with a small number of stochastic simulations to produce unbiased, provably convergent, and dramatically lower-variance estimates than classical Monte Carlo. We demonstrate these capabilities across nine SRNs, including nonlinear and non-mass-action models with up to ten species, where DeepSKA delivers accurate predictions and orders-of-magnitude efficiency improvements. This interpretable and reliable neural framework offers a principled foundation for developing analogous methods for other Markovian systems, including stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <title>Structure-conditioned input-to-state stability for layer-by-layer molecular computations in parallel chemical reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular computation in chemical reaction networks (CRNs) now constitutes a foundational framework for designing programmable biological systems. However, prevailing design methodologies primarily treat parallelism of chemical reactions as a liability, consequently motivating researchers to redirect research focus toward leveraging parallelism to implement layer-by-layer computations of composite functions in coupled mass-action systems (MASs). MASs exhibiting this property are termed composable. Present composability verification for MASs mainly depends on input-to-state stability (ISS) conditions, with structural characteristics of networks remaining underexplored. This paper investigates the structural conditions under which two MASs are composable. By leveraging ISS-Lyapunov functions, we identify a class of CRN architectures, whose reduced systems have zero deficiency, that guarantee composability with other networks. We also extend our conclusions to encompass some CRN architectures possessing nonzero deficiency. Some examples are presented to demonstrate the validity of our theoretical results. Finally, we employ our methods to devise an algorithm for constructing MASs capable of executing specified molecular computations.</description>

      <title>A network-driven framework for enhancing gene-disease association studies in coronary artery disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) link genetic variation to complex traits by leveraging expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data. However, most implementations are typically limited to local (cis-acting) effects and fail to account for long-range (trans) regulatory influences mediated through gene networks. We introduce GRN-TWAS, a framework that reconstructs gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and integrates their topology into gene expression prediction models, thereby propagating distal (trans) regulatory effects through tissue-specific gene networks to trait- or disease-associated phenotypes. By incorporating network-derived trans-eQTLs, GRN-TWAS generates gene expression imputation models that capture both local and distal genetic components, enabling a more complete, systems-level view of genetic regulation consistent with the omnigenic model hypothesis. Using genotype and multi-tissue expression data from 600 coronary artery disease (CAD) cases in the STARNET study together with GWAS summary statistics, we show that GRN-TWAS improves gene-expression prediction and sharpens discovery of CAD-associated genes. Across seven tissues, the framework identified 5,779 transcriptome-wide significant genes, more than 50\% of which appear to be previously unreported in the CAD literature. A knowledge-based gene-ranking engine then prioritized 882 genes as highly CAD-relevant, including 237 regulated exclusively through trans effects. Key-driver analysis highlighted 18 putative trans mediators with high network centrality and disease relevance, offering mechanistic hypotheses that complement association signals. Collectively, these results demonstrate that embedding network topology into TWAS improves discovery and interpretability by exposing tissue-specific regulatory routes from genotype to phenotype and expanding the landscape of gene-disease associations.</description>
