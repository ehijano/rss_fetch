      <title>New and old Saito-Kurokawa lifts classically via $L^2$ norms and bounds on their supnorms: level aspect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first half of the paper, we lay down a classical approach to the study of Saito-Kurokawa (SK) lifts of (Hecke congruence) square-free level, including the allied new-oldform theory. Our treatment of this relies on a novel idea of computing ranks of certain matrices whose entries are $L^2$-norms of eigenforms. For computing the $L^2$ norms we work with the Hecke algebra of $\mathrm{GSp}(2)$.
  In the second half, we formulate precise conjectures on the $L^\infty$ size of the space of SK lifts of square-free level, measured by the supremum of its Bergman kernel, and prove bounds towards them using the results from the first half. Here we rely on counting points on lattices, and on the geometric side of the Bergman kernels of spaces of Jacobi forms underlying the SK lifts. Along the way, we prove a non-trivial bound for the sup-norm of a Jacobi newform of square-free level and also discuss about their size on average.</description>

      <title>Murmurations of Mestre-Nagao sums</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the detection of the rank of elliptic curves with ranks 0 and 1, employing a heuristic known as the Mestre-Nagao sum
  \[ S(B) = \frac{1}{\log{B}} \sum_{\substack{p&lt;B \\ \textrm{good reduction}}} \frac{a_p(E)\log{p}}{p}, \]
where $a_p(E)$ is defined as $p + 1 - \#E(\mathbb{F}_p)$ for an elliptic curve $E/\mathbb{Q}$ with good reduction at prime $p$. This approach is inspired by the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.
  Our observations reveal an oscillatory behavior in the sums, closely associated with the recently discovered phenomena of murmurations of elliptic curves. Surprisingly, this suggests that in some cases, opting for a smaller value of $B$ yields a more accurate classification than choosing a larger one. For instance, when considering elliptic curves with conductors within the range of $[40\,000,45\,000]$, the rank classification based on $a_p$'s with $p &lt; B = 3\,200$ produces better results compared to using $B = 50\,000$. This phenomenon finds partial explanation in the recent work of Zubrilina.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Diophantine approximation to points on the Veronese curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the Hausdorff dimension of the set of simultaneously $q^{-\lambda}$-well approximable points on the Veronese curve for $\lambda$ between $\frac{1}{n}$ and $\frac{2}{2n-1}$. For $\lambda\le \frac{2}{n}$ we provide an upper bound for this Hausdorff dimension. In the course of the proof we establish that the number of cubic polynomials of height at most $H$ and non-zero discriminant at most $D$ is bounded from above by $c(\epsilon) H^{2/3 + \epsilon} D^{5/6}$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, using a quaternion formalism, we give a rigorous proof for the expression of the angle between adjacent sides in the skew polygons appearing at rational times in the evolution of regular polygons of $M$ sides under the vortex filament equation. More precisely, after transforming the rotation matrices that characterize those skew polygons into quaternions, we show that the products of those matrices can be expressed in terms of products of quaternions in a compact form, which enables us to reduce the problem of determining the angle into another one of proving that some trigonometric sums are purely imaginary.</description>

      <title>On Littlewood's estimate for the modulus of the zeta function on the critical line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by a result of Soundararajan, assuming the Riemann hypothesis (RH), we prove a new inequality for the logarithm of the modulus of the Riemann zeta-function on the critical line in terms of a Dirichlet polynomial over primes and prime powers. Our proof uses the Guinand-Weil explicit formula in conjunction with extremal one-sided bandlimited approximations for the Poisson kernel. As an application, by carefully estimating the Dirichlet polynomial, we revisit a 100-year-old estimate of Littlewood and give a slight refinement of the sharpest known upper bound (due to Chandee and Soundararajan) for the modulus of the zeta function on the critical line assuming RH, by providing explicit lower-order terms.</description>

      <title>A modular framework of generalized Hurwitz class numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover a non-trivial rather simple relation between the mock modular generating functions of the level $1$ and level $N$ Hurwitz class numbers. This relation yields a holomorphic modular form of weight $\frac{3}{2}$ and level $4N$, where $N &gt; 1$ is stipulated to be odd and square-free. We extend this observation to a non-holomorphic framework and obtain a higher level non-holomorphic Zagier Eisenstein series as well as a higher level preimage of it under the Bruinier--Funke operator $\xi_{\frac{1}{2}}$. All of these observations are deduced from a more general inspection of a certain weight $\frac{1}{2}$ Maass--Eisenstein series of level $4N$ at its spectral point $s=\frac{3}{4}$. This idea goes back to Duke, Imamo\={g}lu and T\'{o}th in level $4$ and relies on the theory of so-called sesquiharmonic Maass forms. We calculate the Fourier expansion of our sesquiharmonic preimage and of its shadow. We conclude by offering an example if $N=5$ or $N=7$ and we provide the SAGE code to compute the Fourier coefficients involved.</description>

      <title>The Adams conjecture and intersections of local Arthur packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Adams conjecture states that the local theta correspondence sends a local Arthur packet to another local Arthur packet. M{\oe}glin confirmed the conjecture when lifting to groups of sufficiently high rank and also showed that it fails in low rank. Recently, Baki\'c and Hanzer described when the Adams conjecture holds in low rank for a representation in a fixed local Arthur packet. However, a representation may lie in many local Arthur packets and each gives a minimal rank for which the Adams conjecture holds. In this paper, we study the interplay of intersections of local Arthur packets with the Adams conjecture.</description>

Abstract: For each nonnegative integer $g$, we classify the ramification types and monodromy groups of indecomposable coverings of complex curves $f: X\to Y$ where $X$ has genus $g$, under the hypothesis that $n:=\deg(f)$ is sufficiently large and the monodromy group is not $A_n$ or $S_n$. This proves a conjecture of Guralnick and several conjectures of Guralnick and Shareshian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the arithmetic properties of the multiplier polynomials for certain $1$-parameter families of polynomials. In particular, we answer the unsolved Excercise 4.12 (c) of the book ``The Arithmetic of Dynamical Systems" by J. H. Silverman for broader classes of polynomials than quadratic polynomials. As a corollary, we obtain the uniform upper bound of the naive height of parabolic parameters of unicritical polynomials. Moreover, candidates for the parabolic parameter are determined. We have also confirmed that it is a parabolic parameter, except $c=-3/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.01747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S(t) = \frac{1}{\pi}\Im \log\zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}+it\right)$. We prove an unconditional lower bound on the measure of the sets $\{t\in [T,2T] \colon S(t) \geq V\}$ for $\sqrt{\log\log T} \leq V \ll \left(\frac{\log T}{\log \log T}\right)^{1/3}$. For $V \leq (\log T)^{1/3-\varepsilon}$ our bound has a Gaussian shape with variance proportional to $\log\log T$. At the endpoint, $V \asymp \left(\frac{\log T}{\log \log T}\right)^{1/3}$, our result implies the best known $\Omega$-theorem for $S(t)$ which is due to Tsang. We also explain how the method breaks down for $V \gg \left(\frac{\log T}{\log \log T}\right)^{1/3}$ given our current knowledge about the zeros of the zeta function. Conditionally on the Riemann hypothesis we extend our results to the range $\sqrt{\log\log T} \leq V \ll \left(\frac{\log T}{\log \log T}\right)^{1/2}$.</description>

      <title>Semi-galois Categories IV: A deformed reciprocity law for Siegel modular functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13265v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is a sequel to our previous work, where we proved the ``modularity theorem'' for algebraic Witt vectors over imaginary quadratic fields. This theorem states that, in the case of imaginary quadratic fields $K$, the algebraic Witt vectors over $K$ are precisely those generated by the modular vectors whose components are given by special values of deformation family of Fricke modular functions; arithmetically, this theorem implies certain congruences between special values of modular functions that are not necessarily galois conjugate. In order to take a closer look at this modularity theorem, the current paper extends it to the case of CM fields. The main results include (i) a construction of algebraic Witt vectors from special values of deformation family of Siegel modular functions on Siegel upper-half space given by ratios of theta functions, and (ii) a galois-theoretic characterization of which algebraic Witt vectors arise in this modular way, intending to exemplify a general galois-correspondence result which is also proved in this paper.</description>

      <title>An Elementary Problem in Galois Theory about the Roots of Irreducible Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13880v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a field $K$, and a root $\alpha$ of an irreducible polynomial over $K$ (in some algebraic closure) the number of roots of $f(x)$ lying in $K(\alpha)$ is studied here. Given such an $f(x)$ of degree $n$ for which $r$ of the roots are i n $K(\alpha)$, we describe a construction that yields, for $d\ge2$, irreducible polynomials of degree $nd$ and with exactly $rd$ of the roots in the field generated by any one root of those polynomials. Our results are valid for all number fields and possibly some more perfect fields. As an application, for $K=Q$ and positive integers $n\ge3,d\ge2$, we provide irreducible polynomials of degree $nd$ with exactly $d$ roots in the field generated by one of the roots. Independently, for $k&lt;n$, we construct irreducible polynomials over the rationals of degree $n!/(n-k)!$ for which the field generated by one root contains exactly $k!$ roots. Many interesting new questions for further research are provided.</description>

      <title>On the density hypothesis for $L$-functions associated with holomorphic cusp forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14797v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the range of validity of the density hypothesis for the zeros of $L$-functions associated with cusp Hecke eigenforms $f$ of even integral weight and prove that $N_{f}(\sigma, T) \ll T^{2(1-\sigma)+\varepsilon}$ holds for $\sigma \geq 1407/1601$. This improves upon a result of Ivi\'{c}, who had previously shown the zero-density estimate in the narrower range $\sigma\geq 53/60$. Our result relies on an improvement of the large value estimates for Dirichlet polynomials based on mixed moment estimates for the Riemann zeta function. The main ingredients in our proof are the Hal\'{a}sz-Montgomery inequality, Ivi\'{c}'s mixed moment bounds for the zeta function, Huxley's subdivision argument, Bourgain's dichotomy approach, and Heath-Brown's bound for double zeta sums.</description>

      <title>Differentiability of Adelic Volumes and Equidistribution on Quasi-Projective Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentiability of geometric and arithmetic volumes of Hermitian line-bundles leads to the proof of equidistribution results on projective varieties using the variational principle. In this article, we work in the setting of adelic divisors on quasi-projective varieties recently introduced by Xinyi Yuan and Shou-Wu Zhang to show that their geometric and arithmetic adelic volume functions are differentiable on the big cone. We introduce the notions of positive intersection products and show that the differentials are realised as positive intersection products against integrable divisors at big points. We show an analogue of the Fujita Approximation for restricted volumes of adelic divisors in the geometric setting using a construction similar to those of positive intersections and as an application of our differentiability result we derive a slightly weaker quasi-projective analogue of the equidistribution theorem of Berman and Boucksom which generalises the equidistribution obtained by Yuan and Zhang for arithmetically nef adelic divisors on quasi-projective varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study conjectures of Ben-Zvi--Sakellaridis--Venkatesh that categorify the relationship between automorphic periods and $L$-functions in the context of the Geometric Langlands equivalence. We provide evidence for these conjectures in some low-rank examples, by using derived Fourier analysis and the theory of chiral algebras to categorify the Rankin-Selberg unfolding method.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of the trace formula for metaplectic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.06581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.06581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We stabilize the full Arthur-Selberg trace formula for the metaplectic covering of symplectic groups over a number field. This provides a decomposition of the invariant trace formula for metaplectic groups, which encodes information about the genuine $L^2$-automorphic spectrum, into a linear combination of stable trace formulas of products of split odd orthogonal groups via endoscopic transfer. By adapting the strategies of Arthur and Moeglin-Waldspurger from the linear case, the proof is built on a long induction process that mixes up local and global, geometric and spectral data. As a by-product, we also stabilize the local trace formula for metaplectic groups over any local field of characteristic zero.</description>
