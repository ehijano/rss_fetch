      <title>Two Egyptian Kings, Shepseskaf and Userkaf, and a solar eclipse (2471 BC)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, arXiv published a work by G. Magli about the eclipse of 1 April 2471 BC and a supposed influence of it on the end of the fourth Egyptian dynasty and the beginning of the fifth one. In Magli's arXiv/2412.13640 paper, the eclipse is defined as the 'Shepseskaf eclipse'. Magli considers that this eclipse happened during the reign of the 'last ruler of the 4th dynasty, Shepseskaf'. Some literature is giving the name of further members of this dynasty. Therefore, here we add some references, besides those given in arXiv. We will show that, in this literature, the same eclipse of 2471 BC is linked to king Userkaf of the fifth dynasty. Some observations about chronological data proposed by Magli are also necessary. Since in arxiv/2412.13640 paper we find mentioned by Magli the Akhet Khufu and the symbol of the 'solarized' horizon, it is necessary to stress that Akhet (horizon) is written with the crested ibis, as clearly shown by the Wady el-Jarf papyri, which are contemporary to Khufu's reign. The use of the crested ibis for 'horizon' is attested also in a Pepi II letter to his vizier Herkhuf, then three centuries after Khufu.</description>
