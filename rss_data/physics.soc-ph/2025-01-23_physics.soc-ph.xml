      <title>One-Dimensional Urban Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply recent findings from urban scaling theory to evaluate how it could be applied to a one-dimensional archetypal city. Our focus is on how the simplicity of a one-dimensional model can provide intuitive insights that might be obscured in more complex, multidimensional models. With this instructive model, it is possible to visualize that if the population's accessibility decreases more slowly than the increase in distance, an agglomeration effect occurs. This leads to increasing returns to scale when considering interactions between people or economies of scale in the case of amenities that serve the city. These findings highlight a key characteristic of complex systems: interacting parts that together exhibit properties that are not evident when considered individually. The results presented here are derived from both numerical simulations and theoretical analysis. Although one-dimensionality is used here as a simplification, many natural (e.g., Su{\l}oszowa in Poland) and artificial
  cities (e.g., The Line in Saudi Arabia) worldwide are shaped this way.</description>

      <title>Near decomposability of complex networks based on Simon's theory of complexity architecture: conceptions, approaches and an application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on Simon's theory of complexity architecture, we investigate the near decomposability of complex networks, including network near decomposable hierarchy (NDH) and near decomposability in behavior and properties (NDBP): the related conceptions and approaches are given and illustrated with an example. Different from existing researches, we emphasize the network NDBP; and follow Simon's generation mechanism of complex things to find the network NDH; In addition, based on Simon's theory that most things in the real world are complex systems with the NDH; and the situation that the approach for analyzing the NDH of a simple room system in Simon's example requires that the system adjacency matrix be in the near block diagonal form, which is often not the case for the adjacency matrices of complex systems in the real world, we propose an approach for analyzing the NDH of complex networks (complex systems) by splitting network adjacency matrices, which is suitable for solving real-world problems faced rather than for scientific discovery. The near decomposability of complex networks, due to the advantages of network language, can provide a more convenient and effective way than the near decomposability of complex systems for understanding and dealing with the problems of complex things.</description>

      <title>SF2A Environmental Transition Commission: What kind of astrophysics research for a sustainable world?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During its annual conference in 2024, the French Society of Astronomy \&amp;amp; Astrophysics (SF2A) hosted, for the fourth time, a special session dedicated to discussing the environmental transition within the French astrophysics research community. This year had a special context: both the CNRS-INSU and the CNES were preparing their scientific perspectives for the period 2025-2030 in the field of Astronomy-Astrophysics (AA). In this proceeding, we first describe the main actions undertaken by the Commission Transition Environnementale. Then, we summarize the discussions held during the half-day workshop, which brought together about 100 participants, and point to forthcoming proceeding, reports and other related resources. A key message is that the French A\&amp;amp;A community is now fully aware that astronomical activities simply cannot thrive indefinitely in the current situation, and seems now eager to seize the opportunity of developing our profession towards a better social and environmental impact.</description>

      <title>Multi-Platform Aggregated Dataset of Online Communities (MADOC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Multi-platform Aggregated Dataset of Online Communities (MADOC) is a comprehensive dataset that facilitates computational social science research by providing FAIR-compliant standardized access to cross-platform analysis of online social dynamics. MADOC aggregates and standardizes data from Bluesky, Koo, Reddit, and Voat (2012-2024), containing 18.9 million posts, 236 million comments, and 23.1 million unique users. The dataset enables comparative studies of toxic behavior evolution across platforms through standardized interaction records and sentiment analysis. By providing UUID-anonymized user histories and temporal alignment of banned communities' activity patterns, MADOC supports research on content moderation impacts and platform migration trends. Distributed via Zenodo with persistent identifiers and Python/R toolkits, the dataset adheres to FAIR principles while addressing post-API-era research challenges through ethical aggregation of public social media archives.</description>

      <title>Kaleidoscopic reorganization of network communities across different scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18665v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The notion of structural heterogeneity is pervasive in real networks, and their community organization is no exception. Still, a vast majority of community detection methods assume neatly hierarchically organized communities of a characteristic scale for a given hierarchical level. In this work, we demonstrate that the reality of scale-dependent community reorganization is convoluted with simultaneous processes of community splitting and merging, challenging the conventional understanding of community-scale adjustment. We provide a mathematical argument concerning the modularity function, the results from real-network analysis, and a simple network model for a comprehensive understanding of the nontrivial community reorganization process. The reorganization is characterized by a local drop in the number of communities as the resolution parameter varies. This study suggests a need for a paradigm shift in the study of network communities, which emphasizes the importance of considering scale-dependent reorganization to better understand the genuine structural organization of networks.</description>

      <title>Community attitudes towards the environmental cost of computational fluid dynamics research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09314v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations underpin much fluid dynamics research today. Such simulations often rely on large scale high performance computing (HPC) systems, and have a significant carbon footprint. Increasing the efficiency of data centers or the proportion of electricity coming from renewable sources can lessen the environmental impact of scientific computing to a degree, but the attitudes of researchers also play a role. There are many choices researchers make which influence the carbon footprint of simulations. To change behaviours around simulation use, it is first necessary to understand attitudes toward them. Here, we present a case study on fluid dynamics researchers based in the University of Manchester, UK. We find a low awareness of the carbon footprint of computations, compounded by a lack of knowledge of the specific hardware used to run simulations. There is a discrepancy between researchers self-declared attitudes towards reducing the carbon footprint of their work, and their actions and choices. Overall, researchers did not consider carbon footprint as important in their decision making, and we found no correlation between the impact and carbon cost of simulations. Improved education and awareness of the environmental impact of simulations is imperative in the interests of the sustainability of this field.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Mean-Field Theory of Complex Systems on Sparse Directed Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although real-world complex systems typically interact through sparse and heterogeneous networks, analytic solutions of their dynamics are limited to models with all-to-all interactions. Here, we solve the dynamics of a broad range of nonlinear models of complex systems on sparse directed networks with a random structure. By generalizing dynamical mean-field theory to sparse systems, we derive an exact equation for the path-probability describing the effective dynamics of a single degree of freedom. Our general solution applies to key models in the study of neural networks, ecosystems, epidemic spreading, and synchronization. Using the population dynamics algorithm, we solve the path-probability equation to determine the phase diagram of a seminal neural network model in the sparse regime, showing that this model undergoes a transition from a fixed-point phase to chaos as a function of the network topology.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Internet (Technical Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the emergence of quantum computing, the subsequent quantum revolution will be that of interconnecting individual quantum computers at global level. In the same way that classical computers only realised their full potential with the emergence of the internet, a fully realised quantum internet is the next stage of evolution for quantum computation. This work examines in detail how the quantum internet would evolve in practice, focusing not only on the technology itself but also on the implications it will have economically and politically. We present both original ideas, as well as an extensive review of relevant and related background material. This work begins with a description of classical networks before introducing the key concepts behind quantum networks, such as quantum internet protocols, quantum cryptography, and cloud quantum computing. The work is divided into technical sections (requiring only a basic knowledge of the notation of quantum mechanics), for those interested in mathematical details, as well as non-technical sections for those seeking a more general understanding. We target this work very broadly at quantum and classical computer scientists, classical computer systems, software and network engineers, physicists, economists, artists, musicians, and those just generally curious about the future of quantum technologies and what they might bring to humanity.</description>
