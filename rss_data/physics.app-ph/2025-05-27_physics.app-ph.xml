      <title>Thermal Conductivity above 2000 W/m.K in Boron Arsenide by Nanosecond Transducer-less Time-Domain Thermoreflectance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cubic boron arsenide (c-BAs) has been theoretically predicted to exhibit thermal conductivity \k{appa} comparable to that of diamond, yet experimental measurements have plateaued at ~1300W/mK. We report room-temperature \k{appa} exceeding 2000W/mK in c-BAs, on par with single-crystal diamond. This finding is enabled by high-quality single crystals and a newly developed nanosecond, transducer-less time-domain thermoreflectance technique that allows spatial mapping of \k{appa} without metal transducers. Thermal conductivity correlates with crystal quality, as evidenced by stronger photoluminescence and longer photoluminescence lifetimes. However, the observed nanosecond lifetimes remain shorter than expected for an indirect bandgap semiconductor, suggesting room for further crystal quality improvement and higher \k{appa}. These results challenge current theoretical models and highlight c-BAs as a promising material for next-generation electronics.</description>

      <title>Capacity Enhancement Analysis and Implementation of a 3D Array Based on Miniaturized Dipole Antennas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretically, the three-dimensional (3D) array architecture provides a higher communication degree of freedom (DoF) compared to the planar arrays, allowing for greater capacity potential in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, in practical implementations, the upper elements of 3D arrays significantly degrade the performance of the lower elements, leading to increased inter-element correlation and reduced array efficiency. As a result, the expected enhancement in MIMO performance is often suboptimal. To address this issue, this work employs a miniaturized antenna element to reduce the inter-element correlation and thus enhance the DoF of the 3D array. Moreover, to mitigate the efficiency degradation of the lower elements caused by the upper ones, the structures of lower elements are modified to achieve wideband impedance matching. The influence of upper element profile distribution on DoF and element efficiency is investigated, and the scalability of the proposed 3D array is theoretically analyzed. Finally, the MIMO performance of the proposed 3D array is evaluated under 3GPP scenarios, demonstrating a 16% higher capacity than conventional 2D arrays under the same SNR of 20 dB and a physical aperture area of 6.26 {\lambda}02. These results indicate that 3D arrays of appropriately arranged miniaturized elements offer a promising approach to enhancing MIMO system performance.</description>

      <title>Tuning the flexural frequency of overhang-/T-shaped microcantilevers for high harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic (HH) frequencies in microcantilever impose several applications in precision detection thanks to the higher sensitivity of the higher modes in comparison to the fundamental modes. In this study, we showed that by tuning the cantilever length via changing the clamped position, the dimensional ratio of the overhang to the main cantilever part is altered and the HHs could be effectively obtained. Multiple HH frequencies have been achieved, from 4th to 8th order of the second- and from 11th to 26th order of the third-mechanical mode versus the first mode, and these orders are much higher if higher modes are used. The analytical calculation is in agreement with available results of other groups. HH behavior when the cantilever is interaction with sample is also examined and is strongly depending on the overhang parameters. These results could guide the experimentalist in the tuning and controlling of the HHs in detecting objects.</description>

      <title>An Ultra-Low Power and Fast Ising Machine using Voltage-Controlled Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics-inspired computing paradigms, such as Ising machines, are emerging as promising hardware alternatives to traditional von Neumann architectures for tackling computationally intensive combinatorial optimization problems (COPs). While quantum, optical, and electronic devices have garnered significant attention for their potential in realizing Ising machines, their translation into practical systems for industry-relevant applications remains challenging, with each approach facing specific limitations in power consumption and speed. To address this challenge, we report the first chip-level spintronic Ising machine using voltage-controlled magnetoresistive random access memory. The core of our design leverages magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) driven by the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy effect to realize the probabilistic update of Ising spins through a new mechanism. It enables a latency below 1 ns and an energy consumption under 40 fJ per spin update, achieving a 1000-times improvement over previous current-driven MTJ-based implementations. We map two real-world COPs in electronic design automation-global routing and layer assignment-onto the Ising model and demonstrate high-quality results with an energy efficiency of 25000 solutions per second per watt. This outperforms state-of-the-art quantum and graphics processing units by six and seven orders of magnitude, respectively. These results establish voltage-controlled spintronics as a compelling route towards next-generation physics-inspired machine intelligence, offering a paradigm for ultra-low-power, high-speed, and scalable computation.</description>

      <title>Deployable 3D mesoscale structures through wafer fabrication, geometric frustration and bistable auxeticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transforming planar mesoscale devices into precise 3-D architectures is vital for next-generation flexible electronics, implants, and adaptive optics, yet wafer-based manufacturing to free-standing 3-D structures remain elusive. We fabricate polyimide architected 2-D precursors whose bistable unit cells deploy into stable 3-D mesoscale structures. Target Gaussian curvature is encoded by conformally flattening the desired mesh and locally tuning each cell so its second equilibrium matches the required scaling factor, aided by a computed library of isotropically expanding, bistable microstructures. The resulting heterogeneous tessellations uniquely morph into complex shapes. A flat disk deploys into a hemispherical dome with sub-millimeter accuracy and retains its shape after indentation. The same process yields positive- and negative-curvature geometries and tunable-focus paraboloidal mirrors whose reflected laser patterns coincide with geometric optics calculations. Our wafer-compatible, generative algorithm extends far beyond flexible substrates, enabling truly deployable, high-performance electronics and optical devices.</description>

      <title>Phase Biasing System for Optical Gyroscope Using Passive Non-Reciprocal Polarization Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometric Fiber Optic Gyroscopes (IFOGs) are widely used in precision navigation systems due to their high sensitivity, robustness, and solid-state nature. To ensure linear response and accurate angular velocity measurement, a fixed $\pi/2$ phase bias is typically introduced between the clockwise (CW) and counter-clockwise (CCW) beams using active modulation components. However, these active elements increase system complexity, power consumption, cost, and susceptibility to thermal drift and long-term degradation. In this work, we present a novel IFOG configuration that, to the best of our knowledge, achieves for the first time, simultaneous operation at two quadrature points ($\pi/2$ and $3\pi/2$), providing natural noise suppression without relying on active components. This is made possible through the integration of a Non-Reciprocal Polarization-Dependent Phase Shifter (NRPPS), which introduces a pure $\pi/2$ passive phase shift. We detail the optical architecture and provide theoretical modeling using Jones calculus to demonstrate how the NRPPS element introduces passive quadrature biasing. Simulation results show that the proposed NRPPS-IFOG achieves significantly improved sensitivity, with Angular Random Walk (ARW) values up to 40x lower than those of conventional IFOGs, depending on the fiber coil length. The design further leverages quadrature-phase signal detection and adjustable temporal offsets between photodetectors to enhance noise suppression. This passive biasing approach eliminates the need for active modulation, offering reduced power consumption, improved stability, and enhanced long-term reliability.</description>

      <title>A fast sound power prediction tool for genset noise using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of machine learning regression algorithms Kernel Ridge Regression (KRR), Huber Regressor (HR), and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) for predicting sound power levels of gensets, offering significant value for marketing and sales teams during the early bidding process. When engine sizes and genset enclosure dimensions are tentative, and measured noise data is unavailable, these algorithms enable reliable noise level estimation for unbuilt gensets. The study utilizes high fidelity datasets from over 100 experiments conducted at Cummins Acoustics Technology Center (ATC) in a hemi-anechoic chamber, adhering to ISO 3744 standards. By using readily available information from the bidding and initial design stages, KRR predicts sound power with an average accuracy of within 5 dBA. While HR and GPR show slightly higher prediction errors, all models effectively capture the overall noise trends across various genset configurations. These findings present a promising method for early-stage noise estimation in genset design.</description>

      <title>Tri-band Aperture-shared Antenna Array Using Scalable FSS-based Electromagnetic Transparent Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel dual-band electromagnetic transparent structure (DBTS) is firstly proposed and used to realize a tri-band aperture-shared antenna array. The DBTS achieves two tunable electromagnetic transparent frequency bands by periodically loading capacitive patches and meander lines to an inductive strip. Meanwhile, the DBTS features flexible frequency band scalability by loading additional serial L-C tanks. In tri-band aperture-shared arrays, the low-band (LB) dipole induces a deterioration in the radiation pattern of the middle-band (MB) and high-band (HB) antennas as a consequence of the shielding effects. To address this issue, the DBTS is utilized to construct the LB dipole, with its electromagnetic transparent bands allocated at MB and HB simultaneously. Consequently, a tri-band aperture-shared array is realized by combining the LB dipole with a dual-band subarray that operates at MB and HB within a shared aperture. The proposed array realizes an aperture-shared operation within the frequency ranges covering 0.65-0.88GHz (LB), 1.92-2.18GHz (MB) and 3.3-3.8GHz (HB). The LB dipole induces minimal shielding to the MB and HB antennas, resulting in their restored radiation performance with broadside gain deviation of less than 0.6dB.</description>

      <title>Strain Modulated Catalytic Activity of Pt2XSe3 (X = Hg, Zn) for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The catalytic properties of Pt2XSe3 (X = Hg, Zn) in hydrogen-electrode- (HER-) based catalysts have been investigated based on state-of-the-art ab initio simulations. Our results show that the late transition metal sites (Hg and Zn) exhibit the best activity for HER in an acidic environment. Furthermore, lattice stretching and compression can effectively modulate the H binding energy, achieving almost thermoneutral adsorption at 3% compressive strain. The changes are attributed to the modulation in the d-band centers of late transition metal sites, as well as the depletion of charge population on bonding states, contributing to the destabilization of the H-metal bonds. Our contribution explores strain engineering as an effective strategy to tailor the activity of 2D mineral-based catalyst materials for HER, advancing our understanding of how mechanical manipulation can effectively modulate the catalytic properties of these materials.</description>

      <title>Self-patterning of Liquid Field's Metal for Enhanced Performance of Two-dimensional Semiconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals semiconductors show promise for atomically thin flexible and transparent optoelectronic devices in future technologies.However, developing high-performance field-effect transistors (FETs) based on 2D materials is impeded by two key challenges, the high contact resistance at the 2D semiconductors-metal interface and the limited effective doping strategies. Here, we present a novel approach to overcome these challenges using self-propagating liquid Fields metal, a eutectic alloy with a low melting point of approximately 62 C. By modifying pre-patterned electrodes on WSe2 FETs through the deposition of Fields metal onto contact pad edges followed by vacuum annealing, we create new semimetal electrodes that seamlessly incorporate the liquid metal into 2D semiconductors. This integration preserves the original electrode architecture while transforming to semimetal compositions of Fields metal such as Bi, In, and Sn modifies the work functions to 2D semiconductors, resulting in reduced contact resistance without inducing Fermi-level pinning and charge carrier mobilities. Our method enhances the electrical performance of 2D devices and opens new avenues for designing high-resolution liquid metal circuits suitable for stretchable, flexible, and wearable 2D semiconductor applications.</description>

      <title>Electron and positron channeling and photon emission processes in boron doped periodically bent diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, theoretical and numerical analyses are conducted of the profiles of the planar (-110) crystallographic direction in the diamond layer doped with boron atoms. The planar profiles for periodic doping following several ideal dependencies of the boron concentration on the distance in the crystalline medium. Numerical simulations of the channeling and photon emission processes have been carried out for 855 MeV electron and 530 MeV positron beams incident on boron-doped diamond with a four-period bending profile in the samples grown at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The simulations were performed using the MBN Explorer software package. It is shown that the channeling efficiency and the intensity of the crystalline undulator radiation strongly depend on the orientation of the incident beam relative to the bent channel profile at the entrance to the boron-doped layer. For the same conditions at the crystal entrance, the intensity of radiation emitted by positrons is significantly higher than that for electrons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05780v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphene plasmons hold immense potential for terahertz (THz) detector application due to their fascinating interactions between radiation and matter. However, it has remained challenging to excite and manipulate graphene plasmons within continuous graphene that is free of patterning technique. Here, we report an adaptive wavelength-sensitive terahertz detector consisting of continuous graphene integrated onto a ferroelectric thin film with periodic polarization domains. This designed device is capable of absorbing THz waves with zero input bias voltage because of highly confinement of surface plasmons within the interface between graphene and ferroelectrics. By reconfiguring an interweaving squared ferroelectric domain array with alternating upward and downward polarizations, our devices theoretically own an ultrahigh responsivity of 17.56 A W-1 and a specific detectivity of 1.11*10^11 Jones at room temperature. We also demonstrate that the photodetectors make possible for spectrum reconstruction application of portable spectrometer at a broad operation band of 4.97 to 7.85 THz with resolution up to 0.02 THz combining the mathematical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Absorption and scattering properties of nanoparticles in an absorbing medium: modeling with experimental validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Absorption and scattering properties of nanoparticles immersed in an absorbing medium are essential in understanding the overall properties of composites and in designing materials with expected functionalities. In this paper, we establish a model based on both Kubelka-Munk theory and Mie theory that links the absorption and scattering properties of individual particles with the reflectance and transmittance spectra of its thin-film composite, supported by detailed experiments. Thin films consisting of TiO$_2$ nanoparticles embedded in PMMA are fabricated on glass substrates using spin-coating and then peeled off to form standalone samples for spectroscopy measurements. By using the Kubelka-Munk theory in combination with the Saunderson correction, the absorption $K$ and scattering $S$ coefficients of multiple nanoparticles are extracted from the measured transmittance and reflectance. On the other hand, the absorption $K$ and scattering $S$ coefficients are the function of absorption and scattering cross-sections of individual particles, which are calculated from the Mie theory specified for particles in an absorbing medium. The overall model is validated by matching well between the $K-S$ coefficients extracted from experimental data and theoretical calculations. This agreement provides deep insight into the significant attenuating effect of absorption and scattering on each particle due to the surrounding medium. The validated model of nanoparticles immersed in an absorbing medium can be used to obtain preliminary results for materials designed in a number of applications, such as radiative cooling.</description>

Abstract: Decoherence in superconducting quantum circuits, caused by loss mechanisms like material imperfections and two-level system (TLS) defects, remains a major obstacle to improving the performance of quantum devices. In this work, we present atomic-level characterization of cross-sections of a Josephson junction and a spiral resonator to assess the quality of critical interfaces. Employing scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and electron-energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), we identify structural imperfections associated with oxide layer formation and carbon-based contamination, and correlate these imperfections to the patterning and etching steps in the fabrication process and environmental exposure. These results suggest that TLS imperfections at critical interfaces significantly contribute to limiting device performance, emphasizing the need for an improved fabrication process.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, I present SEMIDV - a compact semiconductor device simulator incorporating quantum effects. SEMIDV solves the Poisson-Drift-Diffusion equations for semiconductor devices and provides a user-friendly Python interface for scripting and data analysis. Localization landscape theory is introduced to provide quantum corrections to the Drift-Diffusion equation. This theory directly solves the ground state of the Schrodinger equation without further approximation, offering an efficient solution for quantum effect modeling. Additionally, a compact mobility model considering ballistic transport is developed to capture the ballistic length dependence of mobility and the velocity overshoot effect in short-channel devices. Finally, a study on a nanosheet FET using SEMIDV is conducted. I analyze the electrical characteristics of a state-of-the-art GAA/RibbonFET with a 6 nm gate length and discuss the effects of velocity overshoot and quantum confinement on currents and capacitances. A design for an ultra-short-channel transistor with a gate length down to 4.5 nm with a Vdd = 0.45 V is proposed to push the boundaries of integrated circuit technology further.</description>
