      <title>Lipchitz curve selection and its application to Thamrongthanyalak's open problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve an open problem posed in Thamrongthanyalak's paper on the definable Banach fixed point property. A Lipschitz curve selection is a key of our solution. In addition, we show a definable version of Caristi fixed point theorem.</description>

      <title>Hyperreal differentiation with an idempotent ultrafilter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the hyperreals constructed using a free ultrafilter on R, where [f] is the hyperreal represented by f:R-&gt;R, it is tempting to define a derivative operator by [f]'=[f'], but unfortunately this is not generally well-defined. We show that if the ultrafilter in question is idempotent and contains (0,epsilon) for arbitrarily small real epsilon then the desired derivative operator is well-defined for all f such that [f'] exists. We also introduce a hyperreal variation of the derivative from finite calculus, and show that it has surprising relationships to the standard derivative. We give an alternate proof, and strengthened version of, Hindman's theorem.</description>

      <title>On one-parameter families of hermiticity-preserving superoperators which are not positive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11035v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A one-parameter family of hermiticity-preserving superoperators is a time-dependent family $\{\Phi_{t}\colon\mathbb{M}_{n}(\mathbb{C})\rightarrow\mathbb{M}_{n}(\mathbb{C})\}_{t\in\mathbb{R}}$ of hermiticity-preserving superoperators determined, in a certain sense, by real and complex polynomial functions in the variable $t\in\mathbb{R}$. The paper studies sufficient computable criteria for nonpositivity of superoperators in one-parameter families. More precisely, we give sufficient conditions for the following assertions to hold: $(1)$ every $\Phi_{t}$ is not positive, $(2)$ $\Phi_{t}$ is not positive for $t$ in some open interval $(u,v)\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ and $(3)$ there is some $\Phi_{t}$ which is not positive. We show that in some situations $(3)$ implies $(2)$. Our approach to the problem is based on the Descartes rule of signs and the Sturm-Tarski theorem. In order to apply these facts, we introduce the sign variation formulas. These formulas are first order logical formulas in one free variable $t$, generalising sign sequences of polynomials used in Descartes rule of signs.</description>

      <title>Lifting independence along functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a functor $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ and a model-theoretic independence relation on $\mathcal{D}$, we can lift that independence relation along $F$ to $\mathcal{C}$ by declaring a commuting square in $\mathcal{C}$ to be independent if its image under $F$ is independent. For each property that an independence relation can have we give assumptions on the functor that guarantee the property to be lifted.</description>

      <title>First-order definitions of rings of integral functions over algebraic extensions of function fields and undecidability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study questions of definability and decidability for infinite algebraic extensions ${\bf K}$ of $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$ and their subrings of $\mathcal{S}$-integral functions. We focus on fields ${\bf K}$ satisfying a local property which we call $q$-boundedness. This can be considered a function field analogue of prior work of the first author which considered algebraic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}$. One simple consequence of our work states that if ${\bf K}$ is a $q$-bounded Galois extension of $\mathbb{F}_p(t)$, then the integral closure $\mathcal{O}_{\bf K}$ of $\mathbb{F}_p[t]$ inside ${\bf K}$ is first-order definable in ${\bf K}$. Under the additional assumption that the constant subfield of ${\bf K}$ is infinite, it follows that both $\mathcal{O}_{\bf K}$ and ${\bf K}$ have undecidable first-order theories. Our primary tools are norm equations and the Hasse Norm Principle, in the spirit of Rumely. Our paper has an intersection with a recent arXiv preprint by Mart\'inez-Ranero, Salcedo, and Utreras, although our definability results are more extensive and undecidability results are much stronger.</description>

      <title>Coslice Colimits in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We contribute to the theory of (homotopy) colimits inside homotopy type theory. The heart of our work characterizes the connection between colimits in coslices of a universe, called coslice colimits, and colimits in the universe (i.e., ordinary colimits). To derive this characterization, we find an explicit construction of colimits in coslices that is tailored to reveal the connection. We use the construction to derive properties of colimits. Notably, we prove that the forgetful functor from a coslice creates colimits over trees. We also use the construction to examine how colimits interact with orthogonal factorization systems and with cohomology theories. As a consequence of their interaction with orthogonal factorization systems, all pointed colimits (special kinds of coslice colimits) preserve $n$-connectedness, which implies that higher groups are closed under colimits on directed graphs. We have formalized our main construction of the coslice colimit functor in Agda. The code for this paper is available at https://github.com/PHart3/colimits-agda.</description>

      <title>Connecting generalized Priestley duality to Hofmann-Mislove-Stralka duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.13938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We connect Priestley duality for distributive lattices and its generalization to distributive meet-semilattices to Hofmann-Mislove-Stralka duality for semilattices. Among other things, this involves consideration of various morphisms between algebraic frames. We also show how Stone duality for boolean algebras and generalized boolean algebras fits as a particular case of the general picture we develop.</description>

      <title>New definitions in the theory of Type 1 computable topological spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16340v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1957, Lacombe initiated a systematic study of the different possible notions of "computable topological spaces". However, he interrupted this line of research, settling for the idea that "computably open sets should be computable unions of basic open sets". We explain the limits of this approach, which in particular is not general enough to account for all spaces that admit a computable metric. We give a general notion of Type 1 computable topological space that does not rely on a notion of effective basis. Building on the work of Spreen, we show that the use of a $\textit{formal inclusion relation}$ should be systematized. We give the first general definition of the computable topology associated to a computable metric that does not rely on effective separability. This definition can be translated to other constructive settings, and its relevance goes beyond that of Type 1 computability. Finally, we give a new version of a theorem of Moschovakis, by showing that for an appropriate notion of effective basis, the "computably open sets" reduce to "computable unions of basic open sets" on computably separable spaces.</description>

      <title>On the $\Pi^1_2$ consequences of $\Pi^1_1$-$\mathsf{CA}_0$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a hierarchy dividing the set $\{\sigma \in \Pi^1_2 : \Pi^1_1$-$\mathsf{CA}_0 \vdash \sigma\}$. Then, we give some characterizations of this set using weaker variants of some principles equivalent to $\Pi^1_1$-$\mathsf{CA}_0$: leftmost path principle, Ramsey's theorem for $\Sigma^0_n$ classes of $[\mathbb{N}]^{\mathbb{N}}$ and determinacy for $(\Sigma^0_1)_n$ classes of $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$.</description>
