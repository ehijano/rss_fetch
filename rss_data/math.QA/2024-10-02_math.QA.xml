      <title>Coloring Trivalent Graphs: A Defect TFT Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the combinatorial matter of graph coloring is, in fact, quantum in the sense of satisfying the sum over all the possible intermediate state properties of a path integral. In our case, the topological field theory (TFT) with defects gives meaning to it. This TFT has the property that when evaluated on a planar trivalent graph, it provides the number of Tait-Coloring of it. Defects can be considered as a generalization of groups. With the Klein-four group as a 1-defect condition, we reinterpret graph coloring as sections of a certain bundle, distinguishing a coloring (global-sections) from a coloring process (local-sections.) These constructions also lead to an interpretation of the word problem, for a finitely presented group, as a cobordism problem and a generalization of (trivial) bundles at the level of higher categories.</description>

      <title>Finite dimensional bicovariant first order differential calculi and Laplacians on $q$-deformations of compact semisimple Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a construction in which a linear operator on a compact quantum group, which is supposed to become Laplacian, induces a bicovariant first order differential calculus equipped with a nondegenerate sesquilinear form with respect to which the linear operator is expressed as the ``square" of the differential. When applied to a classical Laplacian on a compact Lie group, the induced first order differential calculus is the classical differential calculus, as it should be. We further apply this construction to the $q$-deformation $K_q$ of a simply connected compact semisimple Lie group $K$ and (1) show that all finite dimensional bicovariant first order differential calculi on $K_q$ are induced by some linear operators, (2) explicitly compute the eigenvalues of these linear operators over the Peter-Weyl decomposition of $K_q$, which enables us to single out among them those that converge to a classical Laplacian on $K$ as $q \rightarrow 1$, in light of which we call them ``$q$-Laplacians", (3) prove that all differential calculi induced by $q$-Laplacians converge to the same classical first order differential calculus on $K$, and (4) show that the heat semigroups generated by $q$-Laplacians are non-Markovian, i.e., operators in the semigroups are not completely positive. The Last result suggests that stochastic processes on $K_q$ that are most relevant to the geometry of $K_q$ might be the non-Markovian ones.</description>

      <title>Orbifolds of Pointed Vertex Operator Algebras I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By a pointed vertex operator algebra (VOA) we mean one whose modules are all simple currents (i.e. invertible), e.g. lattice VOAs. This paper systematically explores the interplay between their orbifolds and tensor category theory. We begin by supplying an elementary proof of the Dijkgraaf-Witten conjecture, which predicts the representation theory of holomorphic VOA orbifolds. We then apply that argument more generally to the situation where the automorphism subgroup fixes all VOA modules, and relate the result to recent work of Mason-Ng and Naidu. Here our results are complete. We then turn to the other extreme, where the automorphisms act fixed-point freely on the modules, and realize any possible nilpotent group as lattice VOA automorphisms. This affords a considerable generalization of the Tambara-Yamagami categories. We conclude by considering some hybrid actions. In this way we use tensor category theory to organize and generalize systematically several isolated examples and special cases scattered in the literature. Conversely, we show how VOA orbifolds can be used to construct broad classes of braided crossed fusion categories and modular tensor categories.</description>

      <title>Formal extension of noncommutative tensor-triangular support varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00853v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a support variety theory defined on the compact part of a monoidal triangulated category, we define an extension to the non-compact part following the blueprint of Benson--Carlson--Rickard, Benson--Iyengar--Krause, Balmer--Favi, and Stevenson. We generalize important aspects of the theory of extended support varieties to the noncommutative case, and give characterizations of when an extended support theory detects the zero object, under certain assumptions. In particular, we show that when the original support variety theory is based on a Noetherian topological space, detects the zero object, satisfies a generalized tensor product property, and comes equipped with a comparison map, then the extended support variety also detects the zero object. In the case of stable categories of finite tensor categories, this gives conditions under which the central cohomological support admits an extension that detects the zero object, confirming part of a recent conjecture made by the second author together with Nakano and Yakimov.</description>

      <title>Deformed solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation associated to dual weak braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.05235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dual weak brace is an algebraic structure $\left(S,\,+,\,\circ\right)$ including skew braces and giving rise to a set-theoretic solution of the Yang-Baxter equation. We show that such a map belongs to a family of set-theoretic solutions, called deformed solutions, that are defined on $S$ and depending on certain parameters. We prove these elements are exactly those belonging to the distributor of $S$, i.e., $\mathcal{D}_r(S)=\{z \in S \, \mid \, \forall \, a,b \in S \quad (a+b) \circ z=a\circ z-z+b \circ z\}$, that is a full inverse subsemigroup of $\left(S, \circ\right)$. Regarding $S$ as a strong semilattice $[Y, B_\alpha, \phi_{\alpha,\beta}]$ of skew braces $B_\alpha$, we analyze when $\mathcal{D}_r(S)=\mathop{\dot{\bigcup}}\limits_{\alpha\in Y} \mathcal{D}_r(B_\alpha)$ and in which cases a deformed solution is the strong semilattices of deformed solutions.</description>

      <title>Quantum-symmetric equivalence is a graded Morita invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that if two $m$-homogeneous algebras have Morita equivalent graded module categories, then they are quantum-symmetrically equivalent, that is, there is a monoidal equivalence between the categories of comodules for their associated universal quantum groups (in the sense of Manin) which sends one algebra to the other. As a consequence, any Zhang twist of an $m$-homogeneous algebra is a 2-cocycle twist by some 2-cocycle from its Manin's universal quantum group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define a derivation on the enhanced nilHecke algebra yielding a p-dg algebra when working over a field of characteristic p. We define functors on the category of p-dg modules resulting in an action of small quantum sl2 on the Grothendieck group, which is isomorphic to a baby Verma module. We upgrade the derivation into an action of the Lie algebra sl(2).</description>
