      <title>Rank of normal functions and Betti strata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent work of the authors, we proved the generic positivity of the Beilinson-Bloch heights of the Gross-Schoen and Ceresa cycles. The geometric part of the proof was to prove the maximality of the rank of the associated normal function and the Zariski closedness of the Betti strata. In this paper, we generalize these geometric results to an arbitrary family of homologically trivial cycles. More generally, we prove a formula to compute the Betti rank and prove the Zariski closedness of the Betti strata, for any admissible normal function of a variation of Hodge structures of weight $-1$. We also define and prove results about degeneracy loci. In the end, we go back to the arithmetic setting and ask some questions about the rationality of the Betti strata and the torsion loci.</description>

      <title>Infinitesimal invariants of mixed Hodge structures II: Log Clemens conjecture and log connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following previous work, we continue the study of infinitesimal methods in mixed Hodge theory. In the first part, inspired by the deformation theory of curves on Calabi-Yau threefolds, we study deformations of smooth $\mathbb{Q}$-log Calabi-Yau pairs $(X,Y)$. We prove unobstructedness results for these pairs under Fano hypotheses. We define families of infinitesimal Abel-Jacobi maps associated with these deformation problems and show that they control the first-order deformations of smooth curves embedded in the pair. Crucially, for the $\frac{1}{2}$-log Calabi-Yau case, we establish an exact duality between deformations and obstructions, recovering the symmetry found in the absolute Calabi-Yau setting. We apply this framework to the cubic threefold, proposing a relative generalization of the Clemens conjecture regarding the injectivity of the infinitesimal Abel-Jacobi map, and establishing a criterion for its non-vanishing.
  In the second part, we define infinitesimal invariants for normal functions using extension classes and the log-Leray filtration. Relying on the theory of generalized Jacobian rings developed by Asakura and Saito, we prove a logarithmic Nori connectivity theorem for the universal family of open hypersurfaces, we also deduce a sharp algebraic criterion for the properness of the Hodge loci for open hypersurfaces, generalizing the proof of Carlson-Green-Griffiths-Harris.</description>

      <title>The Clemens Conjectures for Cubic Threefolds relative to a Hyperplane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an analogue of the Clemens conjectures for $\frac{1}{2}$-log Calabi-Yau threefolds, specifically for the pair $(X, Y)$ where $X$ is a cubic threefold and $Y$ is a hyperplane section. By exploiting a perfect deformation/obstruction duality specific to the $\frac{1}{2}$-log setting, we formulate conjectures regarding the injectivity of the relative infinitesimal Abel-Jacobi map and the finiteness of rational curves with fixed intersection on $Y$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our purpose in this paper is to construct new examples of twisted Brill Noether loci on curves of genus g greater than 2 with negative expected dimension. We begin by completing the proof of Butler's conjecture for coherent systems of certain type establishing the birationality, smoothness, and irreducibility of the corresponding loci. We also produce new points on the BN map.</description>

      <title>Partition identities associated with $A_r$-Surface singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a family of partition identities involving integer partitions in three colors. The conditions imposed on the types of partitions appearing in these identities involve constraints that arise in the Rogers-Ramanujan and Andrews-Gordon identities, as well as in their recent extensions. The identities established in this paper are associated with the $A_r$ surface singularities via the arc HP-series, which provides a measure of singularities of algebraic varieties defined using arc spaces.</description>

      <title>Kato's Ramification filtration via de Rham-Witt complex and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given an $F$-finite regular scheme $X$ of positive characteristic and a simple normal crossing divisor $E$ on $X$, we introduce a filtration on the de Rham-Witt complex $W_m\Omega^\bullet_{X\setminus E}$. When $X$ is the spectrum of a henselian discrete valuation ring $A$ with quotient field $K$, this extends the classical filtration on $W_m(K)$ due to Brylinski. We show that Kato's ramification filtration on $H^q_\et(X \setminus E, {\Q}/{\Z}(q-1))$ for $q \ge 1$ admits an explicit description in terms of the above filtration of the de Rham-Witt complex of $X \setminus E$. When $q =1$, this specializes to the results of Kato and Kerz-Saito.
  As applications, we prove refinements of the duality theorem of Jannsen-Saito-Zhao for smooth projective schemes over finite fields and the duality theorem of Zhao for semi-stable schemes over henselian discrete valuation rings of positive characteristic with finiteresidue fields. We also prove a modulus version of the duality theorem of Ekedahl. As another application, we prove Lefschetz theorems for Kato's ramification filtrations for smooth projective varieties over $F$-finite fields. This extends a result of Kerz-Saito for $H^1$ to higher cohomology. Similar results are proven for the Brauer group.</description>

      <title>The generalized Lax conjecture is true for topological reasons related to compactness, convexity and determinantal deformations of increasing products of pointwise approximating linear forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a topological approach to prove the generalized Lax conjecture using the fact that determinants of sufficiently big symmetric linear pencils are able to express the rigidly convex sets of RZ polynomials of any degree $d$. Monicity of the representation is assessed through a topological argument that allows us to perturbate a sufficiently close linear approximation into a suitable nice determinantal multiple of the initial RZ polynomial with the same rigidly convex set. The perturbation can be smoothly performed. This fact is what will allow us to determine that the multiple obtained respects the initial rigidly convex sets. This argument provides thus a full proof of the generalized Lax conjecture. However, an effective proof providing the representation in nice terms seems far from reachable at this moment.</description>

      <title>The relative GAGA Theorem and an application to the analytic mapping stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a relative GAGA theorem for perfect and pseudo-coherent complexes in non-archimedean analytic geometry, allowing bases given by Fredholm analytic rings, including those associated from affinoid perfectoid spaces. This answers a question raised in \cite{heuer2024padicnonabelianhodgetheory}. As an application, we show that for a proper scheme \(X\) and an Artin stack \(Y\) with suitable conditions, the analytification of the algebraic mapping stack \(\mathrm{Map}(X,Y)\) agrees with the intrinsic analytic mapping stack \(\mathrm{Map}(X^{\mathrm{an}},Y^{\mathrm{an}})\).</description>

      <title>Remarks on the second Chern class of a foliation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We bound the second Chern class of the tangent sheaf of a codimension-one foliation. Equivalently, we bound the degree of the pure codimension-two part of the singular scheme. In particular, for a degree-$d$ foliation on the projective space, the codimension-two part of its singular scheme must have degree at least $d+1$. Moreover, equality holds only for rational foliations of type $(1,d+1)$. These bounds involve counting an invariant related to first-order unfoldings of 2-dimensional foliated singularities.</description>

      <title>Residues and Infinitesimal Torelli for Equisingular Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study infinitesimal Torelli problems and infinitesimal variations of Hodge structure for families of curves arising in singular and extrinsically constrained geometric settings. Motivated by the Green--Voisin philosophy, we develop an explicit approach based on Poincar\'e residue calculus, allowing a uniform treatment of smooth, singular, and equisingular situations. In particular, we prove infinitesimal Torelli theorems for general equisingular plane curves of sufficiently high degree and construct relative IVHS exact sequences for curves lying on smooth projective threefolds.
  Our results show that maximal infinitesimal variation of Hodge structure persists even after imposing strong extrinsic conditions, such as fixed degree and prescribed singularities, and in the presence of isolated planar singularities. The methods presented here provide a concrete and geometric realization of Jacobian-type constructions and extend the Green--Voisin philosophy to singular and equisingular settings and provide a unified residue--theoretic framework for Torelli--type problems across dimensions and codimensions.</description>

      <title>An algebro-geometric perspective on the topology of moduli spaces of differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentials on Riemann surfaces correspond to translation surfaces with conical singularities, and affine transformations acting on them preserve the orders of these singularities. This viewpoint allows the moduli spaces of differentials to appear in various guises across many areas, including algebraic geometry, dynamical systems, combinatorial enumeration, and mathematical physics. Over the past few decades, remarkable progress has been made in computing invariants of these moduli spaces, classifying linear subvarieties, understanding degenerations and compactifications, and developing intersection theory on these spaces. Despite these advances, our understanding of the topology of moduli spaces of differentials remains limited, and many fundamental questions are still open. In this survey, we aim to present, from an algebro-geometric perspective, the known results and open problems concerning the topology of moduli spaces of differentials, as well as their connections to other aspects of the field, with the hope of inspiring further developments in the coming decade.</description>

      <title>Factoriality of normal projective varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a normal projective variety $X$, the $\bf Q$-factoriality defect $\sigma(X)$ is defined to be the rank of the quotient of the group of Weil divisors by the subgroup of Cartier ones. We prove a slight improvement of a topological formula of S.G. Park and M. Popa asserting that $\sigma(X)=h^{2n-2}(X)-h^2(X)$ by assuming only 2-semi-rationality, that is, $R^k\pi_*{\mathcal O}_{\widetilde{X}}=0$ for $k=1,2$, instead of rational singularities for $X$, where $\pi:\widetilde{X}\to X$ is a desingularization with $h^k(X):=\dim H^k(X,{\bf Q})$ and $n:=\dim X&gt;2$. Our proof generalizes the one by Y. Namikawa and J.H.M. Steenbrink for the case $n=3$ with isolated hypersurface singularities. We also give a proof of the assertion that $\bf Q$-factoriality implies factoriality if $X$ is a local complete intersection whose singular locus has at least codimension three. (This seems to be known to specialists in the case $X$ has only isolated hypersurface singularities with $n=3$ using Milnor's Bouquet theorem.) These imply another proof of Grothendieck's theorem in the projective case asserting that $X$ is factorial if $X$ is a local complete intersection whose singular locus has at least codimension four. We can also prove a variant with factorial and local complete intersection replaced respectively by $\bf Q$-factorial and Cohen-Macaulay, where $\bf Q$-factorial cannot be replaced by factorial.</description>

      <title>Nash approximation of differentiable semialgebraic maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T\subset{\mathbb R}^n$ be a semialgebraic set and let $\mu\ge0$ be a non-negative integer. We say that $T$ is a {\em Nash $\mu$-approximation target space} (or a $({\mathcal N},\mu)$-${\tt ats}$ for short) if it has the following universal approximation property: {\em For each $m\in{\mathbb N}$ and each locally compact semialgebraic subset $S\subset{\mathbb R}^m$, the subspace of Nash maps ${\mathcal N}(S,T)$ is dense in the space ${\mathcal S}^\mu(S,T)$ of ${\mathcal C}^\mu$ semialgebraic maps between $S$ and $T$}. A necessary condition to be a $({\mathcal N},\mu)$-${\tt ats}$ is that $T$ is locally connected by analytic paths. In this paper we show: {\em Nash manifolds with corners are $({\mathcal N},\mu)$-${\tt ats}$ for each $\mu\geq0$}. As an application of a stronger version of the previous statement, we show that if two Nash maps $f,g:S\to Q$, where $S$ is a locally compact semialgebraic set of ${\mathbb R}^m$ and $Q$ is a Nash manifold with corners, are close enough in the (strong) Whitney's semialgebraic topology of ${\mathcal S}^0(S,T)$ (and consequently they are (continuous) semialgebraically homotopic), then $f,g$ are Nash homotopic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be aa algebraically closed field of characteristic $p\geq3$ and let $Q_{n}\subset\mathbb{P}^{n+1}_{K}$ be a smooth quadric hypersurface. We show that if $n=2m\geq4$ then $Q_{n}$ is not $D$-affine. In particular, we show the grassmannian ${Gr}(2,4)$ is not $D$-affine, which gives an example of a non $D$-affine flag variety of minimal possible dimension in characteristic $p\geq3$. Our result complements previous work of A. Langer, who showed that if $p\geq n=2m+1$ then $Q_{n}$ is $D$-affine.</description>

      <title>Categorical Entropies of Hilbert Schemes of Points on Surfaces and Hyperk\"ahler Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the categorical entropy of autoequivalences of derived categories of Hilbert schemes of points on surfaces and hyperk\"ahler manifolds. One of the central questions about categorical entropy is whether it satisfies a Gromov-Yomdin type formula $h_{\mathrm{cat}}(\Phi) = \log\rho(\Phi)$. We say that $X$ has the Gromov-Yomdin (GY) property if this formula holds. We prove that if a surface $S$ fails to satisfy the (GY) property (e.g., K3 surfaces), then so does $\mathrm{Hilb}^n(S)$. Moreover, we show that no hyperk\"ahler or Enriques manifold satisfies the (GY) property by constructing an explicit autoequivalence with positive categorical entropy but unipotent action on the cohomology ring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct smooth varieties admitting small contractions from arbitrary smooth projective varieties. This construction generalizes Kawamata's four-dimensional example. We also give sufficient conditions for divisors on these varieties to be nef. As an application, we obtain weak Fano fourfolds from products of two del Pezzo surfaces.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic geometry and Infinitesimal Hodge Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a systematic approach to infinitesimal variations of Hodge structure for singular and equisingular families by means of logarithmic geometry and residue theory. The central idea is that logarithmic vector fields encode precisely those deformation directions that preserve singularities and act trivially on Hodge structures, while the effective variation is entirely governed by residue calculus. This viewpoint provides a conceptual reinterpretation of classical results of Griffiths, Green, and Voisin, and extends them to settings involving singular varieties and equisingular deformations. The resulting framework yields a geometric explanation for the appearance of Jacobian rings in infinitesimal Hodge theory and clarifies the structure of deformation spaces underlying Severi varieties and related moduli problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an orthogonal modular variety, we construct a complex which is defined in terms of lattices and elliptic modular forms, which resembles the Gersten complex in Milnor K-theory, and which has a morphism to the Gersten complex of the modular variety by the Borcherds lifting. This provides a formalism for approaching the higher Chow groups of the modular variety by special cycles and Borcherds products. The construction is an incorporation of the theory of Borcherds products and ideas from Milnor K-theory.</description>

      <title>Quantum Entanglement Geometry on Severi-Brauer Schemes: Subsystem Reductions of Azumaya Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate pure-state entanglement in families as a geometric obstruction. In standard quantum information, entanglement is defined relative to a chosen tensor-product factorization of a fixed Hilbert space. In contrast, for a twisted family of pure-state spaces, which can be described by Azumaya algebras $A$ of degree $n$ on $X$ and their Severi-Brauer schemes \[ SB(A)=P\times^{PGL_n}\mathbb{P}^{n-1}\to X, \] such a subsystem choice may fail to globalize. We formalize this algebro-geometrically: fixing a factorization type $\mathbf d=(d_1,\dots,d_s)$ with $n=\prod_i d_i$, the existence of a global product-state locus of type $\mathbf d$ is equivalent to a reduction of the underlying $PGL_n$-torsor $P\to X$ to the stabilizer $G_{\mathbf d}\subset PGL_n$. Thus, entanglement is the obstruction to the existence of a relative Segre subscheme inside $SB(A)$.
  Writing $\Sigma_{\mathbf d}\subset \mathbb{P}^{n-1}$ for the Segre variety, we call a reduction to $G_{\mathbf d}$ a $\mathbf d$-subsystem structure. Our first main result identifies the moduli of $\mathbf d$-subsystem structures with the quotient $P/G_{\mathbf d}$. Moreover, we realize naturally $P/G_{\mathbf d}$ as a locally closed subscheme of the relative Hilbert scheme, \[ \text{Hilb}^{\Sigma_{\mathbf d}}\!\bigl(SB(A)/X\bigr)\ \subset\ \text{Hilb}\bigl(SB(A)/X\bigr), \] parametrizing relative closed subschemes fppf-locally isomorphic to $\Sigma_{\mathbf d}\times X$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,x)$ be a pointed geometrically connected smooth projective variety over a sub-$p$-adic field $K$. For any given rank $n$, we prove that there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of representations $\pi_{1}^{EF}(X,x)\rightarrow \mathrm{GL}_{n}$, where $\pi_{1}^{EF}(X,x)$ is Nori's fundamental group of essentially finite bundles. Equivalently, there are only finitely many isomorphism classes of essentially finite bundles of rank $n$. This answers a question from C.Gasbarri.</description>

      <title>Toric Euler-Jacobi vanishing theorem and zeros at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Residues appear naturally in various questions in complex and algebraic geometry: interpolation, duality, representation problems, and obstructions. The first global vanishing result in the projective plane, known as the Euler-Jacobi theorem, was established by Jacobi in 1835. In the toric case, the input is a system of n Laurent sparse polynomials with fixed Newton polytopes, and the first version of the Euler-Jacobi toric vanishing theorem for residues in the n-torus is due to Khovanskii in 1978, under restrictive genericity assumptions. In this paper, we provide geometric conditions on the input Newton polytopes to ensure that this global vanishing is equivalent to the existence of zeros at infinity in the associated compact toric variety. We relate these conditions to the dimension at the toric critical degree of the quotient of the Cox ring by the ideal generated by the (multi)homogenizations of the input polynomials. We also relate the existence of zeros at infinity to interpolation questions.</description>

      <title>Angular pair-of-pants decompositions of complex varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define the notion of torically hyperbolic varieties and we construct pair-of-pants decompositions for these in terms of angle sets of essential projective hyperplane complements. This construction generalizes the classical pair-of-pants decomposition for hyperbolic Riemann surfaces. In our first main theorem, we prove that the natural angle map associated to an essential projective hyperplane complement is a homotopy equivalence, extending earlier work of Salvetti and Bj\"orner-Ziegler. By a topological argument, we further show that the angle map for a finite Kummer covering of an essential projective hyperplane complement is likewise a homotopy equivalence. We then explain how these local building blocks can be glued along the dual intersection complex of a semistable degeneration. Using the theory of Kato-Nakayama spaces, we prove that the resulting space is homotopy equivalent to the original algebraic variety. We make this explicit for complete intersections in projective space using techniques from tropical geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a semistable generalization of the Beilinson-Bloch-Esnault-Kerz fiber square, relating the algebraic K-theory of a semistable scheme to its logarithmic topological cyclic homology. We prove that the obstruction to lifting K-theory classes is governed by the Hyodo-Kato Chern character. This answers the $p$-adic deformation problem for continuous K-theory in the semistable case, extending the work of Antieau-Mathew-Morrow-Nikolaus. As an application, we provide a purely K-theoretic proof of Yamashita's semistable $p$-adic Lefschetz $(1,1)$-theorem.</description>

This generalizes a result of Burgos, Philippon, and Sombra for the case of continuous metrics and answers a question raised by Burgos, Kramer, and K\"uhn in 2016.</description>

      <title>Tropical Methods for Counting Plane Curves -- Complex, Real and Quadratically Enriched</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the first famous correspondence theorem by Mikhalkin appeared in 2005, tropical geometry has allowed a parallel treatment of real and complex counting problems. A prime example are the genus 0 Gromov-Witten invariants of the plane which count rational plane curves of degree d satisfying point conditions and their real counterpart, the Welschinger invariants, which both can be determined using tropical methods. Remarkably, the tropical computation of the two types of invariants works entirely in parallel. Recently, quadratically enriched enumerative geometry enables us to combine such real and complex counts under one roof, providing a simultaneous approach which can also be used for counts over other fields. Tropical geometry is a successful tool for the study and computation of such quadratically enriched enumerative invariants, too. In this survey, we provide an overview of tropical methods for plane curve counting problems over the real and complex numbers, and the new quadratically enriched counts.</description>

      <title>Weyl Mutations in Quiver Yangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of solving non-linear equations would be considerably simplified by a possibility to convert known solutions into the new ones. This could seem an element of art, but in the context of ADHM-like equations describing quiver varieties there is a systematic approach. In this note we study moduli spaces and dualities of quiver gauge theories associated to effective dynamics of D-branes compactified on Calabi-Yau resolutions. We concentrate on a subfamily of quivers $\mathfrak{Q}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ covering Dynkin diagrams for simple Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$, where the respective BPS algebra is expected to be the Yangian algebra $Y(\mathfrak{g})$. For Yangians labeled by quivers their representations are described by solutions of ADHM-like equations. As quivers substitute Dynkin diagrams a generalization of the Weyl group $\mathcal{W}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ acts on the ADHM solutions. Here we work with the case $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$ and treat this group as a group of electro-magnetic Seiberg-like dualities (we call them Weyl mutations) on the respective quiver gauge theories. We lift it to the case of higher representations associated to rectangular Young diagrams. An action of Weyl mutations on the BPS Yangian algebra is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Geometric realisations of type $\tilde{A}_n$ preprojective algebras in homological mirror symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The type $A_n$-singularity $\mathbb{C}^2/\mathbb{Z}_{n+1}$ can be resolved by hyper-K\"ahler manifolds $X_{\zeta}$ with underlying smooth manifolds diffeomorphic to the resolution of singularities $X_{\text{res}}$, whose hyper-K\"ahler structure depends on a parameter $\zeta\in H_2(X_{\text{res}};\mathbb{R})$. The structure as a complex manifold of each such hyper-K\"ahler manifold is equivalent to the resolution of singularities at the poles and the structure of a Milnor fibre with roots determined by $\zeta$ elsewhere; the symplectic structure is exact along the equator and is deformed by areas depending on $\zeta$ on the exceptional $(-2)$-spheres away from the equator.
  We show that removing suitable divisors $D_u$ from a fixed $X_{\zeta}$ varying with $u$ in the underlying upper hemisphere of the $S^2$-family of K\"ahler-structures yields a log Calabi--Yau hyper-K\"ahler family (in particular a family of log Calabi--Yau submanifolds), and that mirror symmetry is satisfied (partly conjectural in one direction) for this family by hyper-K\"ahler rotation, in particular by interchanging the structures over the equator and the pole. We furthermore show homological mirror symmetry after adding the missing divisors, which is related to attaching stops and computing singularity categories of certain Landau--Ginzburg potentials on the $A$-side and $B$-side, respectively.
  More concretely: we compute wrapped Fukaya categories and compare them with (previous and new) computations of derived categories of coherent sheaves and derived categories of singularities in algebraic geometry. We show that the relevant categories (with two exceptions) are triangulated equivalent to module categories over the additive and the multiplicative preprojective algebras of type $\tilde{A}_n$, or to deformations of these algebras depending on the parameters $\zeta$.</description>

Abstract: Let $d&gt;1$ be an integer and $K_0$ a perfect field such that $char(K_0)$ does not divide $d$. Let $n&gt;d$ be an integer that is prime to $d$. Let $f(x)\in K_0[x]$ be a degree $n$ monic polynomial without repeated roots, and $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ a smooth projective model of the affine curve $y^d=f(x)$. Let $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$ be the Jacobian of the $K_0$-curve $\mathcal{C}_{f,d} $. As usual, we identify $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ with its canonical image in $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$ (such that the only ``infinite point'' of $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}$ goes to the zero of the group law on $J(\mathcal{C}_{f,d})$).
  We say that an integer $m&gt;1$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over $K_0$ if there exists a polynomial $f(x)$ as above such that $\mathcal{C}_{f,d}(K_0)$ contains a torsion point of order $m$.
  Let us put $\ell_0:=[(n+d)/d], \ m_0:=\ell_0 d$. Earlier we proved that if $m$ is $(n,d)$-reachable, then either $m=d$ or $m = n$ or $m \ge m_0$ (in addition, both $d$ and $n$ are $(n,d)$-reachable over every $K_0$). We also proved that if $m_0$ is $(n,d)$-reachable over some $K_0$ then $n-m_0+\ell_0\ge 0$.
  In the present paper we discuss the $(n,d)$-reachability of $m_0$ when $n-m_0+\ell_0=0$ or $1$.</description>

      <title>Bi-Lipschitz invariance of Newton polygons along gradient canyons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bi-Lipschitz right-equivalence of holomorphic function germs $f:(\mathbb{C}^2,0)\to(\mathbb{C},0)$ via polar arcs and gradient canyons. For a polar arc $\gamma$ we consider the Newton polygon of $f_x(X+\gamma(Y),Y)$ and define its augmentation by adjoining the point $(0,\text{ord } f(\gamma(y),y)-1)$. We prove that the resulting augmented Newton polygon is constant along each gradient canyon of degree $&gt;1$ and is invariant under bi-Lipschitz right-equivalence. Moreover, its compact edges decompose into a topological part and a Lipschitz part: the latter encodes, through simple intercept relations, the second-level Henry-Parusi\'nski type invariants. As an application we introduce the polar multiplicity of a canyon and identify it with the horizontal length of the top edge of the augmented polygon, yielding a new discrete bi-Lipschitz invariant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double ramification (DR) hierarchies associated to rank-$1$ F-CohFTs are important integrable perturbations of the Riemann--Hopf hierarchy. In this paper, we perform bihamiltonian tests for these DR hierarchies, and conjecture that the ones that are bihamiltonian form a $2$-parameter family. Remarkably, our computations suggest that there is a $1$-parameter subfamily of the rank-$1$ F-CohFTs, where the corresponding DR hierarchy is conjecturally Miura equivalent to the Camassa--Holm hierarchy. We also prove a conjecture regarding bihamiltonian Hodge hierarchies. Finally, we systematically study Miura invariants, and for another $1$-parameter subfamily propose a conjectural relation to the Degasperis--Procesi hierarchy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nakajima constructed geometric representations of a deformed Kac-Moody Lie algebra using Hecke correspondences between quiver varieties. In this paper, we show that Hecke correspondences, which are holomorphic Lagrangians in products of Nakajima quiver varieties, can be obtained by applying the localized mirror construction to the morphism spaces between families of framed Lagrangian branes supported on the core of a plumbing of two-spheres. Moreover, for a non-ADE quiver, we show that the localized mirror functor is fully-faithful.</description>

Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve over a finite field of characteristic $p$. We describe and implement a practical algorithm for computing the $p$-divisible group $Jac(X)[p^\infty]$ via computing its Dieudonn\'{e} module, or equivalently computing the Frobenius and Verschiebung operators on the first crystalline cohomology of $X$. We build on Tuitman's $p$-adic point counting algorithm, which computes the rigid cohomology of $X$ and requires a ``nice'' lift of $X$ to be provided.</description>

Abstract: To a dominant morphism $X/S \to Y/S$ of N\oe therian integral $S$-schemes one has the inclusion $C_{X/Y}\subset B_{X/Y}$ of the critical locus in the branch locus of $X/Y$. Starting from the notion of locally complete intersection morphisms, we give conditions on the modules of relative differentials $\Omega_{X/Y}$, $\Omega_{X/S}$, and $\Omega_{Y/S}$ that imply bounds on the codimensions of $ C_{X/Y}$ and $ B_{X/Y}$. These bounds generalise to a wider class of morphisms the classical purity results for finite morphisms by Zariski-Nagata-Auslander, and Faltings and Grothendieck, and van der Waerden's purity for birational morphisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1212.4862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Codimension 2 complete intersections in P^N have a natural parameter space \bar{H}: a projective bundle over a projective space given by the choice of the lower degree equation and of the higher degree equation up to a multiple of the first. Motivated by the question of existence of complete families of smooth complete intersections, we study the birational geometry of \bar{H}. In a first part, we show that the first contraction of the MMP for \bar{H} always exists and we describe it. Then, we show that it is possible to run the full MMP for \bar{H}, and we describe it, in two degenerate cases. As an application, we prove the existence of complete curves in the punctual Hilbert scheme of complete intersection subschemes of A^2.</description>

Abstract: We characterize two objects by universal property: the derived de Rham complex and Hochschild homology together with its Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg (HKR) filtration. This involves endowing these objects with extra structure, built on notions of "homotopy-coherent cochain complex" and "filtered circle action" that we study here. We use these universal properties to give a conceptual proof that the associated graded of the HKR filtration identifies with the derived de Rham complex, as well as to give a new construction of the filtrations on cyclic, negative cyclic, and periodic cyclic homology that relate these invariants to derived de Rham cohomology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.12880v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a complete classification of degree-$2$ foliations on $\mathbb{P}^n$ in any dimension, assuming they are not algebraically integrable. If $\mathcal{F}$ is such a foliation, then either $\mathcal{F}$ is the linear pull-back of a degree-$2$ foliation by curves on $\mathbb{P}^{n-k+1}$, or a logarithmic foliation of type $(1^{n-k+1},2)$, or a logarithmic foliation of type $(1^{n-k+3})$, or the linear pull-back of a degree-$2$ foliation of dimension $2$ on $\mathbb{P}^{n-k+2}$ tangent to an action of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{aff}(\mathbb{C})$. Meanwhile, we prove that any $2$-dimensional foliation tangent to a global vector field must satisfy that its tangent sheaf is either not locally free or has a direct summand isomorphic to $\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^{n}}(a)$, with $a\in\{0,1\}$. As a byproduct of our classification, we describe the geometry of Poisson structures on $\mathbb{P}^{4}$ with generic rank two.</description>

Abstract: For a quasi-projective scheme $X$ admitting a smooth compactification over a local field of residue characteristic $p &gt; 0$, we construct a continuous reciprocity homomorphism from a tame class group to the abelian tame etale fundamental group of $X$. We describe the prime-to-$p$ parts of its kernel and cokernel. This generalizes the higher dimensional unramified class field theory over local fields by Jannsen-Saito and Forre. We also prove a finiteness theorem for the geometric part of the abelian tame etale fundamental group, generalizing the results of Grothendieck and Yoshida for the unramified fundamental group.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a non-compact GIT quotient of a vector space, in the presence of an abelian group action and an equivariant regular function (potential) on the quotient. We define virtual counts of quasimaps from prestable curves to the critical locus of the potential, and prove a gluing formula in the formalism of cohomological field theories.
  The main examples studied in this paper is when the above setting arises from quivers with potentials, where the above construction gives quantum correction to the equivariant Chow homology of the critical locus. Following similar ideas as in quasimaps to Nakajima quiver varieties studied by the Okounkov school, we analyse vertex functions in several examples, including Hilbert schemes of points on $\mathbb{C}^3$, moduli spaces of perverse coherent systems on the resolved conifold, and a quiver which defines higher $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-spin chains. Bethe equations are calculated in these cases.
  The construction in the present paper is based on the theory of gauged linear sigma models as well as shifted symplectic geometry of Pantev, To\"en, Vaquie and Vezzosi, and uses the virtual pullback formalism of symmetric obstruction theory of Park, which arises from the recent development of Donaldson-Thomas theory of Calabi-Yau 4-folds.</description>

      <title>On generalized Beauville decompositions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the Beauville decomposition of an abelian scheme and the "Perverse = Chern" phenomenon for a compactified Jacobian fibration, we study in this paper splittings of the perverse filtration for compactified Jacobian fibrations.
  On the one hand, we prove for the Beauville-Mukai system associated with an irreducible curve class on a $K3$ surface the existence of a Fourier-stable multiplicative splitting of the perverse filtration, which extends the Beauville decomposition for the nonsingular fibers. Our approach is to construct a Lefschetz decomposition associated with a Fourier-conjugate $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-triple, which relies heavily on recent work concerning the interaction between derived equivalences and LLV algebras for hyper-K\"ahler varieties. Motivic lifting and connections to the Beauville-Voisin conjectures are also discussed.
  On the other hand, we construct for any $g\geq 2$ a compactified Jacobian fibration of genus $g$ curves such that each curve is integral with at worst simple nodes and the (multiplicative) perverse filtration does not admit a multiplicative splitting. Our argument relies on the recently established universal double ramification cycle relations. This shows that in general an extension of the Beauville decomposition cannot exist for compactified Jacobian fibrations even when the simplest singular point appears.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a notion of distributions on $\mathbb{R}^n$, called distributions of C$^{{\mathrm{exp}}}$-class, based on wavelet transforms of distributions and the theory from Cluckers, Comte, Miller, Rolin, Servi (2018) about C$^{{\mathrm{exp}}}$-class functions. We prove that the framework of C$^{{\mathrm{exp}}}$-class distributions is closed under natural operations, like push-forward, pull-back, derivation and anti-derivation, and, in the tempered case, Fourier transforms. Our main result is the (real analytic) holonomicity of all distributions of C$^{{\mathrm{exp}}}$-class.</description>

Abstract: We count points on character varieties associated with punctured surfaces and regular semisimple generic conjugacy classes in reductive groups. We find that the number of points are palindromic polynomials. This suggests a $P=W$ conjecture for these varieties. We also count points on the corresponding additive character varieties and find that the number of points are also polynomials, which we conjecture have non-negative coefficients. These polynomials can be considered as the reductive analogues of the Kac polynomials of comet-shaped quivers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05189v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies Bernstein--Sato polynomials $b_{f,0}$ for homogeneous polynomials $f$ of degree $d$ with $n$ variables. It is open to know when $-{n\over d}$ is a root of $b_{f,0}$. For essential indecomposable hyperplane arrangements, this is a conjecture by Budur, Musta\c{t}\u{a} and Teitler and implies the strong topological monodromy conjecture for arrangements. Walther gave a sufficient condition that a certain differential form does not vanish in the top cohomology group of Milnor fiber. We use Walther's result to verify the $n\over d$-conjecture for weighted hyperplane arrangements satisfying the nonresonant condition.</description>

      <title>Canonical torus action on symplectic singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that any symplectic singularity lying on a smoothable projective symplectic variety locally admits a good action of an algebraic torus of dimension $r \geq 1$, which is canonical. Under mild assumptions, $r=1$ is also confirmed. In particular, it admits (canonical) good $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. This proves Kaledin's conjecture conditionally but in a substantially stronger form. Our key idea is to use Donaldson-Sun theory on local Kahler metrics in complex differential geometry to connect with the theory of Poisson deformations of symplectic varieties.
  For general symplectic singularities, we prove the same assertion -- namely, the existence of a canonical (local) torus action -- assuming that the Donaldson-Sun theory extends to such singularities along with suitable singular (hyper)Kahler metrics. Conversely, our results can be also used to study local behaviour of such metrics around the germ. For instance, we show that such singular hyperKahler metric around isolated singularity is close to a metric cone in a polynomial order, and satisfies $r=1$ i.e., has a good canonical (local) $\mathbb{C}^*$-action, as the complexification of the cone metric rescaling. Our theory also fits well to singularities on many hyperKahler reductions.</description>

      <title>Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg isomorphism for derived Deligne-Mumford stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00501v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a Hochschild--Konstant--Rosenberg (HKR) theorem for arbitrary derived Deligne--Mumford (DM) stacks, extending the results of Arinkin-C\u{a}ld\u{a}raru-Hablicsek in the smooth, global quotient case, although with different methods. To formulate our result, we introduce the notion of orbifold inertia stack of a derived DM stack; this supplies a finely tuned derived enhancement of the classical inertia stack, which does not always coincide with the classical truncation of the free loop space. We show that, in characteristic 0, given a derived DM stack, the shifted tangent bundle of its orbifold inertia stack is equivalent to its free loop space. This yields a canonical HKR isomorphism of algebras between the Hochschild homology of a derived DM stack and the cohomology of differential forms on its orbifold inertia stack. Moreover, this isomorphism intertwines the natural circle action and the de Rham differential. Similarly, HKR theorems for derived DM stacks are established for Hochschild cohomology, cyclic homology, negative cyclic homology, and periodic cyclic homology. As applications, we provide a rich supply of computations of Hochschild homology and Hochschild cohomology for interesting derived DM stacks, such as weighted projective lines, root stacks, quotients by algebraic groups, and mapping stacks, among others.</description>

Abstract: We provide explicit formulas for computing the motivic Chern and Hirzebruch classes of degeneracy loci, especially those coming from the symplectic and odd orthogonal Grassmannians. The Chern--Schwartz--MacPherson classes, K-theory classes, and Cappell--Shaneson L-classes arise as specializations of the motivic Chern and Hirzebruch classes. Our result is the analogue of the result of Anderson--Chen--Tarasca for the degeneracy loci from the ordinary Grassmannians. As applications, we obtain the motivic Chern and Hirzebruch classes of orthogonal and symplectic orbit closures in flag varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the normalization of a quasi-ordinary complex singularity is a Hirzebruch-Jung, see [Gon00; Pop04; AS05]. We extend this result to Puiseux hypersurfaces. Moreover, we prove that Hirzebruch-Jung singularities are precisely normalizations of Puiseux hypersurfaces. Our result holds over an algebraically closed field whose characteristic does not divide the degree of the polynomial defining the hypersurface. Finally, in the analytic complex case, we conclude that the normalization of an irreducible Puiseux hypersurface is the normalization of a complex analytic quasi-ordinary singularity.</description>

      <title>Complements of discriminants of real parabolic function singularities. II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We list all connected components of sets of non-discriminant functions within versal deformations of all {\em parabolic} function singularities. These singularities are the second most common family of singularity classes of smooth functions after {\em simple singularities}. Thus, we prove (and improve in one particular case) the corresponding conjectures from the previous work \cite{para} with the same title. As an application, we enumerate all local Petrovskii lacunas near arbitrary parabolic singularities of wavefronts of hyperbolic PDEs. We also show that the complements of the discriminant varieties of $X_9^+$ and $P_8^1$ singularities have nontrivial one-dimensional homology groups, in contrast to all simple singularities.
  These results are applications of a general method for investigating non-singular perturbations of real function singularities. An important part of this method is a computer program that formalizes Picard--Lefschetz theory and surgeries of Morse functions.</description>

Abstract: In the seminal paper of Borel and Tits about reductive groups, they show some fundamental results about Bruhat cells with respect to a minimal parabolic subgroup, e.g., relative Bruhat decomposition and its geometrization, relative Bruhat order and the relation of Zariski closure and topological closure. In this paper, we show analogous results for Bruhat cells of wonderful group compactification in the sense of De Concini and Procesi. Our results can be viewed as the version at infinity of those of Borel and Tits. Our main focus is general base field. When the base field is algebraically closed, most of our results are proved by Brion and Springer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Hilbert polynomial of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface $Z$ in a smooth toric variety $M$ associated to a convex polytope $\Delta$ is given by a lattice point count in the polytope boundary $\partial \Delta,$ just as the Hilbert polynomial of $M$ is known to be given by a lattice point count in the convex polytope $\Delta.$ Our main tool is a computation of the Euler class in $K$-theory of the normal line bundle to the hypersurface $Z,$ in terms of the Euler classes of the divisors corresponding to the facets of the moment polytope. We observe a remarkable parallel between our expression for the Euler class and the inclusion-exclusion principle in combinatorics. To obtain our result we combine these facts with the known relation between lattice point counts in the facets of $\Delta$ and the Hilbert polynomials of the smooth toric varieties corresponding to these facets.</description>

Abstract: We construct an irreducible rational curve of degree 10 in $CP^2$ which has 12 triple points and a union of three rational quartics with 19 triple points. This gives counter-examples to a conjecture by Dimca, Harbourne, and Sticlaru. We also prove that there exists an analytic family $C_u$ of curves of degree 10 with 12 triple points which tends as $u\to 0$ to the union of the dual Hesse arrangement of lines (9 lines with 12 triple points) with an additional line. We hope that our approach to the proof of the latter fact could be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the positivity of the double mixed discriminant associated with a positive linear map between spaces of third-order complex matrices, thereby settling the three-dimensional case of Finski's open problem. As an application, we obtain the weak positivity of the third Chern form for Griffiths positive vector bundles. Moreover, we show that all Schur forms are weakly positive for Griffiths positive vector bundles of rank three over complex threefolds. This yields a complete affirmative answer, in the case where both the rank and the dimension are three, to the question posed by Griffiths in 1969.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.03873v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new construction of $p$-adic heights on varieties over number fields using $p$-adic Arakelov theory. In analogy with Zhang's construction of real-valued heights in terms of adelic metrics, these heights are given in terms of $p$-adic adelic metrics on line bundles. In particular, we describe a construction of canonical $p$-adic heights on abelian varieties and we show that we recover the canonical Mazur--Tate height and, for Jacobians, the height constructed by Coleman and Gross. Our main application is a new and simplified approach to the Quadratic Chabauty method for the computation of rational points on certain curves over the rationals, by pulling back the canonical height on the Jacobian with respect to a carefully chosen line bundle. We show that our construction allows us to reprove, without using $p$-adic Hodge theory or arithmetic fundamental groups, several results due to Balakrishnan and Dogra. Our method also extends to primes $p$ of bad reduction. One consequence of our work is that for any canonical height ($p$-adic or $\mathbb{R}$-valued) on an abelian variety (and hence on pull-backs to other varieties), the local contribution at a finite prime $q$ can be constructed using $q$-analytic methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05925v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tilting theory is one of the central tools in modern representation theory, in particular in the study of Cohen-Macaulay representations. We study Cohen-Macaulay representations of $\mathbb N$-graded Artin-Schelter Gorenstein algebras $A$ of dimension one, without assuming the connectedness condition. This framework covers a broad class of noncommutative Gorenstein rings, including classical $\mathbb N$-graded Gorenstein orders. We prove that the stable category $\underline{\mathsf{CM}}_0^{\mathbb Z}A$ admits a silting object if and only if $A_0$ has finite global dimension. In this case we give such a silting object explicitly. Assuming that $A$ is ring-indecomposable, we further show that $\underline{\mathsf{CM}}_0^{\mathbb Z}A$ admits a tilting object if and only if either $A$ is Artin-Schelter regular or the average Gorenstein parameter of $A$ is non-positive. These results generalize those of Buchweitz, Iyama, and Yamaura. We give two proofs of the second result: one via Orlov-type semiorthogonal decompositions, and the other via a direct calculation. As an application, we show that for a Gorenstein tiled order $A$, the category $\underline{\mathsf{CM}}^{\mathbb Z}A$ is equivalent to the derived category of the incidence algebra of an explicitly constructed poset.
  We also apply our results and Koszul duality to study smooth noncommutative projective quadric hypersurfaces $\mathsf{qgr}\,B$ of arbitrary dimension. We prove that $\mathsf{D}^{\mathrm b}(\mathsf{qgr}\,B)$ admits an explicitly constructed tilting object, which contains the tilting object of $\underline{\mathsf{CM}}^{\mathbb Z}B$ due to Smith and Van den Bergh as a direct summand via Orlov's semiorthogonal decomposition.</description>

      <title>Crystallinity for syntomic cohomology, \'etale cohomology, and algebraic $K$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove for $n\geq c-1$ that the functor taking an animated ring $R$ to its mod $(p^c,v_1^{p^n})$ syntomic cohomology factors through the functor $R \mapsto R/p^{c(n+2)}$, a phenomenon we term crystallinity for mod $(p^c,v_1^{p^n})$ syntomic cohomology. As an application, we completely and explicitly compute the mod $(p,v_1 ^{p^{n}-1})$ algebraic $K$-theory of $\mathbb Z/p^{k}$ whenever $k \geq n+2$ and $p&gt;2$. As a second application, we deduce crystallinity for the mod $p^c$ syntomic complexes associated to smooth $p$-adic formal schemes, and in particular for the Galois equivariant mod $p^c$ \'etale cohomologies of their adic generic fibers. Finally, we strengthen known $p$-adic convergence theorems for the topological Hochschild homology of ring spectra, and as a result relate crystallinity for algebraic $K$-theory to Lichtenbaum--Quillen theorems.</description>

      <title>Serre's question on thin sets in projective space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We answer a question of Serre from the 1980s on rational points of bounded height on projective thin sets, in degree at least $4$. For degrees $2$ and $3$ we improve the known bounds in general. The focus is on thin sets of type II, namely corresponding to the images of ramified dominant quasi-finite covers of projective space, as thin sets of type I are already well understood via dimension growth results by the third author in 2002 (published in 2023) by a global variant of Heath-Brown's $p$-adic determinant method. For type II, we obtain a uniform affine variant of Serre's question which implies the projective case and for which the implicit constant is furthermore polynomial in the degree. We are able to avoid logarithmic factors when the degree is at least $5$ and we prove our results over any global field, of any characteristic. A key ingredient for obtaining the affine variant comes from Binyamini-Cluckers-Novikov (2024) and Binyamini-Cluckers-Kato (2025) where a question of the third author was answered by providing bounds, for rational points on irreducible curves, which are quadratic in the degree. A second key ingredient is an adaptation of Salberger's global determinant method to the case of weighted polynomials. The third key ingredient is the design of our affine variant of Serre's question, for weighted polynomials which are not necessarily weighted homogeneous.</description>

      <title>A decomposition theorem for the Hochschild homology of symmetric powers of a dg category</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture by Belmans, Fu and Krug concerning the Hochschild homology of the symmetric powers of a small dg category $\mathscr{C}$. More precisely, we show that these groups decompose into pieces that only depend on the Hochschild homology of the dg category $\mathscr{C}$.</description>

      <title>Cyclotomic integral points for affine dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $f:\mathbb{A}^N\to\mathbb{A}^N$ be a regular endomorphism of algebraic degree $d\geq2$ (i.e., $f$ extends to an endomorphism on $\mathbb{P}^N$ of algebraic degree $d$) defined over a number field. We prove that if the set of cyclotomic $f$-preperiodic points is Zariski-dense in $\mathbb{A}^N$, then some iterate $f^{\circ l}$ ($l\geq1$) is a quotient of a surjective algebraic group endomorphism $g:\mathbb{G}_m^N\to\mathbb{G}_m^N$, over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$. This result generalizes a theorem of Dvornicich and Zannier on cyclotomic preperiodic points of one-variable polynomials to higher dimensions. In fact, we prove a much more general rigidity result for dominant endomorphisms $f$ on an affine variety $X$ defined over a number field, concerning "almost $f$-invariant" Zariski-dense subsets of cyclotomic integral points. We apply our results to backward orbits of regular endomorphisms on $\mathbb{A}^N$ of algebraic degree $d\geq2$, and to periodic points of automorphisms of H\'enon type on $\mathbb{A}^N$.</description>

      <title>Subtlety of oscillation indices of oscillatory integrals of real analytic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a locally defined real analytic function, we study the relation between the oscillation index of oscillatory integrals and the real log canonical threshold. The former is always negative, and its absolute value is greater than or equal to the latter. They coincide very often, but there are certain exceptional cases even in the Newton nondegenerate convenient homogeneous case, for instance if the number of variables is even and smaller than the degree. This does not seem compatible with some standard formula in the literature, and there must be some error somewhere, although it does not seem easy to find it inside this paper.</description>

      <title>The intrinsic subgroup of an elliptic curve and Mazur's torsion theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define and study a biadditive symmetric (not necessarily perfect) pairing on the torsion part $\mathrm{Pic}(X)_{\mathrm{tors}}$ of the Picard group of a smooth projective curve $X$ over a field $k$ with values in $k^\times \otimes \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$. We call its kernel the intrinsic subgroup of $X$. It turns out that some information on the reduction type of $X$ can be read off from the intrinsic subgroup. Mazur's torsion theorem says that there are exactly 15 isomorphism classes of abelian groups that appear as the rational torsion points of an elliptic curve $X$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ (identified with $\mathrm{Pic}(X)_{\mathrm{tors}}$). We refine this result by determining which subgroups of those 15 groups appear as the intrinsic subgroups.</description>

      <title>A Second Main Theorem for Entire Curves Intersecting Three Conics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03948v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a Second Main Theorem for entire holomorphic curves \( f: \mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{P}^2 \) intersecting a generic configuration of three conics \(\mathcal{C}= \mathcal{C}_1+ \mathcal{C}_2+ \mathcal{C}_3 \) in the complex projective plane $\mathbb{P}^2$. Using invariant logarithmic $2$-jet differentials with negative twists, we prove the estimate \[ T_f(r) \leqslant 5 \sum_{i=1}^3 N_f^{[1]}(r, \mathcal{C}_i) + o\big(T_f(r)\big)\quad\parallel, \] where \( T_f(r) \) is the Nevanlinna characteristic function, and \( N_f^{[1]}(r, \mathcal{C}_i) \) is the $1$-truncated counting function.
  The key innovation of our approach is establishing new vanishing lemmas of the form \[ H^0\bigl(\mathbb{P}^2,\, E_{2,m}T_{\mathbb{P}^2}^*(\log \mathcal{C}) \otimes \mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{P}^2}(-t)\bigr) = 0 \] for specific pairs \((m, t)\), achieved by combining algebro-geometric arguments with computer-assisted computations through a mod-\(p\) reduction technique. This yields a systematic method for proving vanishing results for negatively twisted jet differentials -- a key component in complex hyperbolic geometry.</description>
