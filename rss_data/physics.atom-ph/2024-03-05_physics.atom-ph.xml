      <title>Indirect measurement of atomic magneto-optical rotation via Hilbert transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kramers-Kronig relations are a pivotal foundation of linear optics and atomic physics, embedding a physical connection between the real and imaginary components of any causal response function. A mathematically equivalent, but simpler, approach instead utilises the Hilbert transform. In a previous study, the Hilbert transform was applied to absorption spectra in order to infer the sole refractive index of an atomic medium in the absence of an external magnetic field. The presence of a magnetic field causes the medium to become birefringent and dichroic, and therefore it is instead characterised by two refractive indices. In this study, we apply the same Hilbert transform technique to independently measure both refractive indices of a birefringent atomic medium, leading to an indirect measurement of atomic magneto-optical rotation. Key to this measurement is the insight that inputting specific light polarisations into an atomic medium induces absorption associated with only one of the refractive indices. We show this is true in two configurations, commonly referred to in literature as the Faraday and Voigt geometries, which differ by the magnetic field orientation with respect to the light wavevector. For both cases, we measure the two refractive indices independently for a Rb thermal vapour in a 0.6 T magnetic field, finding excellent agreement with theory. This study further emphasises the application of the Hilbert transform to the field of quantum and atomic optics in the linear regime.</description>

      <title>Spectra of phosphorus ions for astrophysical modeling: P I - P XV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phosphorus (P), a basic element of life, has been a least studied element due to its poor presence in astrophysical spectra. However, search for the P lines has increased considerably with discoveries of exoplanets and are being detected by high resolution and sophisticated astronomical observatories, e.g. James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). JWST may provide a clue for life with detection of P in its infrared (IR) region. Identification of the element and analysis of the observed spectra will require high accuracy data for atomic processes that produces lines and their predicted features. The present study focuses on these needs and reports systematically regions of wavelengths, from x-ray to IR, that show prominent lines by the 15 individual ionization stages of phosphorus, P I - P XV for the first time. We present large amount of relevant atomic data for energies, transition parameters, and lifetimes obtained in relativistic Breit-Pauli approximation using the R-matrix method and atomic structure program SUPERSTRUCTURE. Our spectral features for the fifteen ions, P I - P XV, predict strengths of lines in various wavelength regions. They show dominance of P~I and P~II in the infrared region and other ions in the ultraviolet and optical regions often stretching to IR in the continuum. For determination of accuracy, we have made extensive comparisons of our atomic data with available experimental and theoretical values. Based on these, our results and features are expected to provide precise plasma diagnostics and astrophysical modeling.</description>

      <title>Continuously and widely tunable frequency-stabilized laser based on an optical frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuously and widely tunable lasers actively stabilized on a frequency reference are broadly employed in atomic, molecular and optical (AMO) physics. The frequency-stabilized optical frequency comb (OFC) provides a novel optical frequency reference with a broadband spectrum that meets the requirement of laser frequency stabilization. Therefore, we demonstrate a frequency-stabilized and precisely tunable laser system based on it. In this scheme, the laser frequency locked to the OFC is driven to jump over the ambiguity zones, which blocks the wide tuning of the locked laser, and tuned until the mode hopping happens with the always-activated feedback loop. Meanwhile, we compensate the gap of the frequency jump with a synchronized acoustic optical modulator to ensure the continuity. This scheme is applied to an external cavity diode laser (ECDL) and we achieve tuning at a rate of about 7 GHz/s with some readily available commercial electronics. Furthermore, we tune the frequency-stabilized laser only with the feedback of diode current and its average tuning speed can exceed 100 GHz/s. Due to the resource-efficient configuration and the simplicity of completion, this scheme can be referenced and find wide applications in AMO experiments.</description>

      <title>Strong-field quantum control by pulse shaping in the extreme ultraviolet domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tailored light-matter interactions in the strong coupling regime enable the manipulation and control of quantum systems with up to unit efficiency, with applications ranging from quantum information to photochemistry. While strong light-matter interactions are readily induced at the valence electron level using long-wavelength radiation, comparable phenomena have been only recently observed with short wavelengths, accessing highly-excited multi-electron and inner-shell electron states. However, the quantum control of strong-field processes at short wavelengths has not been possible, so far, due to the lack of pulse shaping technologies in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and X-ray domain. Here, exploiting pulse shaping of the seeded free-electron laser (FEL) FERMI, we demonstrate the strong-field quantum control of ultrafast Rabi dynamics in helium atoms with high fidelity. Our approach unravels the strong-field induced bound-continuum coupling of the electronic states in helium and enables substantial suppression of the ionization rate, with prospective applications in many XUV and X-ray experiments. Leveraging recent advances in intense few-femtosecond to attosecond XUV to X-ray light sources, our results open an avenue to the efficient manipulation and selective control of core electron processes and electron correlation phenomena in real time</description>

      <title>Influence of catastrophes and hidden dynamical symmetries on ultrafast backscattered photoelectrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the effect of using potentials with a Coulomb tail and different degrees of softening in the photoelectron momentum distributions (PMDs) using the recently implemented hybrid forward-boundary CQSFA (H-CQSFA). We show that introducing a softening in the Coulomb interaction influences the ridges observed in the PMDs associated with backscattered electron trajectories. In the limit of a hard-core Coulomb interaction, the re-scattering ridges close along the polarization axis, while for a soft-core potential, they are interrupted at ridge-specific angles. We analyze the momentum mapping of the different orbits leading to the ridges. For the hard-core potential, there exist two types of saddle-point solutions that coalesce at the ridge. By increasing the softening, we show that two additional solutions emerge as the result of breaking a hidden dynamical symmetry associated exclusively with the Coulomb potential. Further signatures of this symmetry breaking are encountered in subsets of momentum-space trajectories. Finally, we use scattering theory to show how the softening affects the maximal scattering angle and provide estimates that agree with our observations from the CQSFA. This implies that, in the presence of residual binding potentials in the electron's continuum propagation, the distinction between purely kinematic and dynamic caustics becomes blurred.</description>

      <title>Two-colour photon correlations probe coherent vibronic contributions to electronic excitation transport under incoherent illumination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying signatures of quantum coherent behaviour in photoactive systems that are maintained in stationary states away from thermal equilibrium is an open problem of wide interest in a variety of physical scenarios, including single photosynthetic complexes subjected to continuous incoherent illumination. Here we consider a prototype light-harvesting heterodimer exhibiting coherent and collective exciton-vibration interactions and show that the second-order frequency-filtered correlations of fluorescence photons provide insightful information on the influence of such coherent interactions for different transitions, thereby yielding fundamentally different photon-counting statistics. Furthermore, we show that coherent vibronic mechanisms strongly affect the asymmetries characteristic of time-resolved photon cross-correlations and manifest themselves in a time-dependent violation of the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality bounding cross-correlations for classically fluctuating fields. We finally discuss how such second-order correlation asymmetry establishes important connections between coherent vibronic interactions, directional exciton population transport, and violation of quantum detailed balance. Our work then indicates that measurement of two-colour photon correlation asymmetry can be an important avenue to investigate quantum behaviour of single photoactive biomolecular and chemical systems under incoherent illumination conditions.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Generalized Dicke Model for Spin-1 Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Dicke model is a staple of theoretical cavity Quantum Electrodynamics (cavity QED), describing the interaction between an ensemble of atoms and a single radiation mode of an optical cavity. It has been studied both quantum mechanically and semiclassically for two-level atoms, and demonstrates a rich variety of dynamics such as phase transitions, phase multistability, and chaos. In this work we explore an open, spin-1 Dicke model with independent co- and counter-rotating coupling terms as well as a quadratic Zeeman shift enabling control over the atomic energy-level structure. We investigate the stability of operator and moment equations under two approximations and show the system undergoes phase transitions. To compliment these results, we relax the aforementioned approximations and investigate the system semiclassically. We show evidence of phase transitions to steady-state and oscillatory superradiance in this semiclassical model, as well as the emergence of chaotic dynamics. The varied and complex behaviours admitted by the model highlights the need to more rigorously map its dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum counterdiabatic driving with local control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suppression of diabatic transitions in quantum adiabatic evolution stands as a significant challenge for ground state preparations. Counterdiabatic driving has been proposed to compensate for diabatic losses and achieve shortcut to adiabaticity. However, its implementation necessitates the generation of adiabatic gauge potential, which requires knowledge of the spectral gap of instantaneous Hamiltonians and involves highly non-local drivings in many-body systems. In this work, we consider local counterdiabatic (LCD) driving with approximate adiabatic gauge potential. Using transverse-field Ising model as an example, we present an in-depth study of the performance and optimization of LCD protocols. We then propose a novel two-step protocol based on LCD and simple local single-body control to further improve the performance. The optimization of these LCD-based protocols does not require knowledge of instantaneous Hamiltonians, and only additional local driving is involved. To benchmark the performance of LCD and the proposed local control-enhanced LCD technique, we experimentally implement digitized adiabatic quantum evolution in a trapped-ion system. We characterize the quality of the prepared states and explore the scaling behavior with system size up to 14 qubits. Our demonstration of quantum shortcut to adiabaticity opens a path towards preparing ground states of complex systems with accessible local controls.</description>

      <title>Relativistic corrections to energy spectrum of hydrogen due to the full one-photon-exchange interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we estimate the relativistic corrections to the energy spectrum of hydrogen resulting from the full one-photon-exchange interaction using a highly precise numerical method. In the frame of the effective Schrodinger-like equation, which is derived exactly from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in quantum electrodynamics, we express the effective potential corresponding to the full one-photon-exchange interaction in terms of eight scalar functions. Unlike the usual calculations performed in the references, where the effective potential is expanded in terms of momenta order by order, we retain the exact momentum dependence in the effective potential to estimate its corrections to the energy spectrum of hydrogen using a highly precise numerical method. We also use the same numerical method to double-check the results in the non-relativistic case to ensure accuracy. We discuss the comparison of the numerical results with those obtained using the usual bound-state perturbative theory. Our calculations suggest that it is possible to accurately account for all the relativistic contributions using this method. It would be interesting to extent these calculations to positronium, muonic hydrogen, and cases involving nuclear structure and radiative corrections.</description>

      <title>Signature of reentrant localization in collisional inhomogeneous spin-orbit coupled condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the appearance of reentrant localization in a one-dimensional spin-orbit coupled binary Bose-Einstein condensate confined in a quasiperiodic optical lattice in the presence of collisional inhomogeneity. We introduce the inhomogeneity of the spatial modulation of nonlinear interactions, which have the same nature as those of the quasiperiodic potential. A $\pi/2$ phase shift between the spatial modulation of nonlinearity and the quasiperiodic potential results in the appearance of an intermediate delocalized state sandwiched between two localized regions, a typical signature of reentrant localization. We employ numerical and variational approaches to characterize the structure and dynamics of reentrant localization. We find that the reentrant features appear either upon varying the strength of the inhomogeneity or changing the spin-orbit and Rabi coupling parameters. We further confirm the stability of the localized and delocalized state by performing the dynamical studies of the condensate by perturbing the ground state either through the velocity perturbation or upon quenching the trap strength.</description>

      <title>Cooling trapped ions with phonon rapid adiabatic passage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent demonstrations of the quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) computer architecture, circuit times are dominated by cooling. Some motional modes of multi-ion crystals take orders-of-magnitude longer to cool than others because of low coolant ion participation. Here we demonstrate a new technique, which we call phonon rapid adiabatic passage (phrap), that avoids this issue by coherently exchanging the thermal populations of selected modes on timescales short compared to direct cooling. Analogous to adiabatic rapid passage, we quasi-statically couple these slow-cooling modes with fast-cooling ones using DC electric fields. When the crystal is then adiabatically ramped through the resultant avoided crossing, nearly-complete phonon population exchange results. We demonstrate this on two-ion crystals, and show the indirect ground-state cooling of all radial modes--achieving an order of magnitude speedup compared to direct cooling. We also show the technique's insensitivity to trap potential and control field fluctuations, and find that it still achieves sub-quanta temperatures starting as high as n~200.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.10625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coherence time and gate fidelities in Rydberg atom quantum simulators and computers are fundamentally limited by the Rydberg state lifetime. Circular Rydberg states are highly promising candidates to overcome this limitation by orders of magnitude, as they can be effectively protected from decay due to their maximum angular momentum. We report the first realization of alkaline-earth circular Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezers, which provide unique and novel control possibilities due to the optically active ionic core. Specifically, we demonstrate creation of very high-$n$ ($n=79$) circular states of $^{88}$Sr. We measure lifetimes as long as 2.55 ms at room temperature, which are achieved via cavity-assisted suppression of black-body radiation. We show coherent control of a microwave qubit encoded in circular states of nearby manifolds, and characterize the qubit coherence time via Ramsey and spin-echo spectroscopy. Finally, circular state tweezer trapping exploiting the Sr$^+$ core polarizability is quantified via measurements of the trap-induced light shift on the qubit. Our work opens routes for quantum simulations with circular Rydberg states of divalent atoms, exploiting the emergent toolbox associated with the optically active core ion.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of CP-violation in atoms, molecules and role of medium-heavy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08858v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detection of parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetry-odd electric dipole moments (EDMs) within currently achievable resolution would evidence physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Via the CPT-theorem, which includes charge conjugation (C), such low-energy searches complement high-energy physics experiments that probe CP-violation up to the TeV scale. Heavy-elemental atoms and molecules are considered to be among the most promising candidates for a first direct detection of P,T-violation due to enhancement effects that increase steeply with increasing nuclear charge number $Z$. However, different P,T-odd sources on the subatomic level can contribute to molecular or atomic EDMs, which are target of measurements, and this complicates obtaining rigorous bounds on P,T-violation on a fundamental level. Consequently, several experiments of complementary sensitivity to these individual P,T-odd sources are required for this purpose. Herein, a simply-applicable qualitative model is developed for global analysis of the P,T-odd parameter space from an electronic-structure theory perspective. Rules of thumb are derived for the choice of atoms and molecules in terms of their angular momenta and nuclear charge number. Contrary to naive expectations from $Z$-scaling laws, it is demonstrated that medium-heavy molecules with $Z\leq54$ can be of great value to tighten global bounds on P,T-violating parameters, in particular, if the number of complementary experiments increases. The model is confirmed by explicit density functional theory calculations of all relevant P,T-odd electronic structure parameters in systems that were used in past experiments or are of current interest for future experiments, respectively: the atoms Xe, Cs, Yb, Hg, Tl, Ra, Fr and the molecules CaOH, SrOH, YO, CdH, BaF, YbF, YbOH, HfF$^+$, WC, TlF, PbO, RaF, ThO, ThF$^+$ and PaF$^{3+}$.</description>
