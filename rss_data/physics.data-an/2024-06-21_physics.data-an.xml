      <title>XENONnT WIMP Search: Signal &amp; Background Modeling and Statistical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The XENONnT experiment searches for weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter scattering off a xenon nucleus. In particular, XENONnT uses a dual-phase time projection chamber with a 5.9-tonne liquid xenon target, detecting both scintillation and ionization signals to reconstruct the energy, position, and type of recoil. A blind search for nuclear recoil WIMPs with an exposure of 1.1 tonne-years yielded no signal excess over background expectations, from which competitive exclusion limits were derived on WIMP-nucleon elastic scatter cross sections, for WIMP masses ranging from 6 GeV/$c^2$ up to the TeV/$c^2$ scale. This work details the modeling and statistical methods employed in this search. By means of calibration data, we model the detector response, which is then used to derive background and signal models. The construction and validation of these models is discussed, alongside additional purely data-driven backgrounds. We also describe the statistical inference framework, including the definition of the likelihood function and the construction of confidence intervals.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Pipeline for Track Finding in the Velo at LHCb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the next decade, increases in instantaneous luminosity and detector granularity will amplify the amount of data that has to be analysed by high-energy physics experiments, whether in real time or offline, by an order of magnitude. The reconstruction of charged particle tracks, which has always been a crucial element of offline data processing pipelines, must increasingly be deployed from the very first stages of the real time processing to enable experiments to achieve their physics goals. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received a great deal of attention in the community because their computational complexity scales nearly linearly with the number of hits in the detector, unlike conventional algorithms which often scale quadratically or worse. This paper presents ETX4VELO, a GNN-based track-finding pipeline tailored for the Run 3 LHCb experiment's Vertex Locator, in the context of LHCb's fully GPU-based first-level trigger system, Allen. Currently implemented in Python, ETX4VELO offers the ability to reconstruct tracks with shared hits using a novel triplet-based method. When benchmarked against the traditional track-finding algorithm in Allen, this GNN-based approach not only matches but occasionally surpasses its physics performance. In particular, the fraction of fake tracks is reduced from over 2\% to below 1\% and the efficiency to reconstruct electrons is improved. While achieving comparable physics performance is a milestone, the immediate priority remains implementing ETX4VELO in Allen in order to determine and optimise its throughput, to meet the demands of this high-rate environment.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Approach to Particles Identification in the MPD Experimen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identification of particles generated by ion collisions in the NICA collider is one of the basic functions of the Multipurpose Detector (MPD). The main means of identification in MPD are the time-of-flight system (TOF) and the time-projection chamber (TPC). The article considers the optimization of the algorithms of particles identification by these systems. Under certain conditions, the use of the statistical Bayesian approach has made it possible to achieve an optimal ratio of the efficiency of particle identification and contamination by incorrectly defined particles.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Evaluation of Generative Models in Calorimeter Shower Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of understanding fundamental particle interactions has reached unparalleled precision levels. Particle physics detectors play a crucial role in generating low-level object signatures that encode collision physics. However, simulating these particle collisions is a demanding task in terms of memory and computation which will be exasperated with larger data volumes, more complex detectors, and a higher pileup environment in the High-Luminosity LHC. The introduction of "Fast Simulation" has been pivotal in overcoming computational bottlenecks. The use of deep-generative models has sparked a surge of interest in surrogate modeling for detector simulations, generating particle showers that closely resemble the observed data. Nonetheless, there is a pressing need for a comprehensive evaluation of their performance using a standardized set of metrics. In this study, we conducted a rigorous evaluation of three generative models using standard datasets and a diverse set of metrics derived from physics, computer vision, and statistics. Furthermore, we explored the impact of using full versus mixed precision modes during inference. Our evaluation revealed that the CaloDiffusion and CaloScore generative models demonstrate the most accurate simulation of particle showers, yet there remains substantial room for improvement. Our findings identified areas where the evaluated models fell short in accurately replicating Geant4 data.</description>

      <title>Interpretable machine learning approach for electron antineutrino selection in a large liquid scintillator detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Several neutrino detectors, KamLAND, Daya Bay, Double Chooz, RENO, and the forthcoming large-scale JUNO, rely on liquid scintillator to detect reactor antineutrino interactions. In this context, inverse beta decay represents the golden channel for antineutrino detection, providing a pair of correlated events, thus a strong experimental signature to distinguish the signal from a variety of backgrounds. However, given the low cross-section of antineutrino interactions, the development of a powerful event selection algorithm becomes imperative to achieve effective discrimination between signal and backgrounds. In this study, we introduce a machine learning (ML) model to achieve this goal: a fully connected neural network as a powerful signal-background discriminator for a large liquid scintillator detector. We demonstrate, using the JUNO detector as an example, that, despite the already high efficiency of a cut-based approach, the presented ML model can further improve the overall event selection efficiency. Moreover, it allows for the retention of signal events at the detector edges that would otherwise be rejected because of the overwhelming amount of background events in that region. We also present the first interpretable analysis of the ML approach for event selection in reactor neutrino experiments. This method provides insights into the decision-making process of the model and offers valuable information for improving and updating traditional event selection approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy-Based Models (EBMs) have emerged as a powerful framework in the realm of generative modeling, offering a unique perspective that aligns closely with principles of statistical mechanics. This review aims to provide physicists with a comprehensive understanding of EBMs, delineating their connection to other generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and Normalizing Flows. We explore the sampling techniques crucial for EBMs, including Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, and draw parallels between EBM concepts and statistical mechanics, highlighting the significance of energy functions and partition functions. Furthermore, we delve into state-of-the-art training methodologies for EBMs, covering recent advancements and their implications for enhanced model performance and efficiency. This review is designed to clarify the often complex interconnections between these models, which can be challenging due to the diverse communities working on the topic.</description>

      <title>Encoder-Decoder Neural Networks in Interpretation of X-ray Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Encoder-decoder neural networks (EDNN) condense information most relevant to the output of the feedforward network to activation values at a bottleneck layer. We study the use of this architecture in emulation and interpretation of simulated X-ray spectroscopic data with the aim to identify key structural characteristics for the spectra, previously studied using emulator-based component analysis (ECA). We find an EDNN to outperform ECA in covered target variable variance, but also discover complications in interpreting the latent variables in physical terms. As a compromise of the benefits of these two approaches, we develop a network where the linear projection of ECA is used, thus maintaining the beneficial characteristics of vector expansion from the latent variables for their interpretation. These results underline the necessity of information recovery after its condensation and identification of decisive structural degrees for the output spectra for a justified interpretation.</description>

      <title>Gaussian approximation of dynamic cavity equations for linearly-coupled stochastic dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic dynamics on sparse graphs and disordered systems often lead to complex behaviors characterized by heterogeneity in time and spatial scales, slow relaxation, localization, and aging phenomena. The mathematical tools and approximation techniques required to analyze these complex systems are still under development, posing significant technical challenges and resulting in a reliance on numerical simulations. We introduce a novel computational framework for investigating the dynamics of sparse disordered systems with continuous degrees of freedom. Starting with a graphical model representation of the dynamic partition function for a system of linearly-coupled stochastic differential equations, we use dynamic cavity equations on locally tree-like factor graphs to approximate the stochastic measure. Here, cavity marginals are identified with local functionals of single-site trajectories. Our primary approximation involves a second-order truncation of a small-coupling expansion, leading to a Gaussian form for the cavity marginals. For linear dynamics with additive noise, this method yields a closed set of causal integro-differential equations for cavity versions of one-time and two-time averages. These equations provide an exact dynamical description within the local tree-like approximation, retrieving classical results for the spectral density of sparse random matrices. Global constraints, non-linear forces, and state-dependent noise terms can be addressed using a self-consistent perturbative closure technique. The resulting equations resemble those of dynamical mean-field theory in the mode-coupling approximation used for fully-connected models. However, due to their cavity formulation, the present method can also be applied to ensembles of sparse random graphs and employed as a message-passing algorithm on specific graph instances.</description>

      <title>On countering adversarial perturbations in graphs using error correcting codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of a graph subjected to adversarial perturbations, such as those arising from cyber-attacks, where edges are covertly added or removed. The adversarial perturbations occur during the transmission of the graph between a sender and a receiver. To counteract potential perturbations, we explore a repetition coding scheme with sender-assigned binary noise and majority voting on the receiver's end to rectify the graph's structure. Our approach operates without prior knowledge of the attack's characteristics. We provide an analytical derivation of a bound on the number of repetitions needed to satisfy probabilistic constraints on the quality of the reconstructed graph. We show that the method can accurately decode graphs that were subjected to non-random edge removal, namely, those connected to vertices with the highest eigenvector centrality, in addition to random addition and removal of edges by the attacker.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter investigates the application of Haldane's statistical correlation theory in classical systems. A modified statistical correlation theory has been proposed by including non-linearity into the original theory of Haldane. It is shown that indistinguishability can be introduced as a form of external statistical correlation into distinguishable systems. It is proved that this modified statistical correlation theory can be used to derive classical fractional exclusion statistics (CFES) using maximum entropy methods for a self-correlating system. An extended non-linear correlation model based on power series expansion is also proposed, which can produce various intermediate statistical models.</description>

      <title>From Maximum of Intervisit Times to Starving Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Very recently, a fundamental observable has been introduced and analyzed to quantify the exploration of random walks: the time $\tau_k$ required for a random walk to find a site that it never visited previously, when the walk has already visited $k$ distinct sites. Here, we tackle the natural issue of the statistics of $M_n$, the longest duration out of $\tau_0,\dots,\tau_{n-1}$. This problem belongs to the active field of extreme value statistics, with the difficulty that the random variables $\tau_k$ are both correlated and non-identically distributed. Beyond this fundamental aspect, we show that the asymptotic determination of the statistics of $M_n$ finds explicit applications in foraging theory and allows us to solve the open $d$-dimensional starving random walk problem, in which each site of a lattice initially contains one food unit, consumed upon visit by the random walker, which can travel $\mathcal{S}$ steps without food before starving. Processes of diverse nature, including regular diffusion, anomalous diffusion, and diffusion in disordered media and fractals, share common properties within the same universality classes.</description>

Abstract: We develop a comprehensive framework for analyzing full record statistics, covering record counts $M(t_1), M(t_2), \ldots$, and their corresponding attainment times $T_{M(t_1)}, T_{M(t_2)}, \ldots$, as well as the intervals until the next record. From this multiple-time distribution, we derive general expressions for various observables related to record dynamics, including the conditional number of records given the number observed at a previous time and the conditional time required to reach the current record, given the occurrence time of the previous one. Our formalism is exemplified by a variety of stochastic processes, including biased nearest-neighbor random walks, asymmetric run-and-tumble dynamics, and random walks with stochastic resetting.</description>

Abstract: Solving inverse problems, which means obtaining model parameters from observed data, using conventional computational fluid dynamics solvers is prohibitively expensive. Here we employ machine learning algorithms to overcome the challenge. As an example, we consider a moderately turbulent fluid flow, excited by a stationary force and described by a two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation with linear bottom friction. Given sparse and probably noisy data for the velocity and the general form of the model, we reconstruct the dense velocity and pressure fields in the observation domain, infer the driving force, and determine the unknown fluid viscosity and friction coefficient. Our approach involves training a physics-informed neural network by minimizing the loss function, which penalizes deviations from the provided data and violations of the Navier-Stokes equation. The suggested technique extracts additional information from experimental and numerical observations, potentially enhancing the capabilities of particle image/tracking velocimetry.</description>

      <title>Seeing the World through an Antenna's Eye: Reception Quality Visualization Using Incomplete Technical Signal Information</title>

Abstract: We come up with a novel application for image analysis methods in the context of direction dependent signal characteristics. For this purpose, we describe an inpainting approach adding benefit to technical signal information which are typically only used for monitoring and control purposes in ground station operations. Recalling the theoretical properties of the employed inpainting technique and appropriate modeling allow us to demonstrate the usefulness of our approach for satellite data reception quality assessment. In our application, we show the advantages of inpainting products over raw data as well as the rich potential of the visualization of technical signal information.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic embedding of brain networks as a tool for epileptic seizures forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10184</link>

Abstract: The evidence indicates that intracranial EEG connectivity, as estimated from daily resting state recordings from epileptic patients, may be capable of identifying preictal states. In this study, we employed hyperbolic embedding of brain networks to capture non-trivial patterns that discriminate between connectivity networks from days with (preictal) and without (interictal) seizure. A statistical model was constructed by combining hyperbolic geometry and machine learning tools, which allowed for the estimation of the probability of an upcoming seizure. The results demonstrated that representing brain networks in a hyperbolic space enabled an accurate discrimination (85%) between interictal (no-seizure) and preictal (seizure within the next 24 hours) states. The proposed method also demonstrated excellent prediction performances, with an overall accuracy of 87% and an F1-score of 89% (mean Brier score and Brier skill score of 0.12 and 0.37, respectively). In conclusion, our findings indicate that representations of brain connectivity in a latent geometry space can reveal a daily and reliable signature of the upcoming seizure(s), thus providing a promising biomarker for seizure forecasting.</description>
