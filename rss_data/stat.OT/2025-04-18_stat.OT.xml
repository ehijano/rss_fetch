      <title>Understanding and Evaluating Engineering Creativity:Development and Validation of the Engineering Creativity Assessment Tool (ECAT)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Creativity is essential in engineering education, enabling students to develop innovative and practical solutions. However, assessing creativity remains challenging due to a lack of reliable, domain-specific tools. Traditional assessments like the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking (TTCT) may not fully capture the complexity of engineering creativity. This study introduces and validates the Engineering Creativity Assessment Tool (ECAT), designed specifically for engineering contexts. ECAT was tested with 199 undergraduate students who completed a hands-on design task. Five trained raters evaluated the products using the ECAT rubric. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses supported a four-factor structure: fluency, originality, cognitive flexibility, and creative strengths. Reliability was high, convergent and discriminant validity were examined using TTCT scores, revealing moderate correlations that support ECATs domain specificity. ECAT offers a reliable, valid framework for assessing creativity in engineering education and provides actionable feedback to educators. Future work should examine its broader applicability across disciplines and instructional settings.</description>
