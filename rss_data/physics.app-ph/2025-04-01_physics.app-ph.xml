      <title>Demonstration of domain wall current in MgO-doped lithium niobate single crystals up to 400 {\deg}C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conductive ferroelectric domain walls (DWs) represent a promising topical system for the development of nanoelectronic components and device sensors to be operational at elevated temperatures. DWs show very different properties as compared to their hosting bulk crystal, in particular with respect to the high local electrical conductivity. The objective of this work is to demonstrate DW conductivity up to temperatures as high as 400 {\deg}C which extends previous studies significantly. Experimental investigation of the DW conductivity of charged, inclined DWs is performed using 5 mol% MgO-doped lithium niobate single crystals. Currentvoltage (IV) sweeps as recorded over repeated heating cycles reveal two distinct thermal activation energies for a given DW, with the higher of the activation energies only measured at higher temperatures. Depending on the specific sample, the higher activation energy is found above 160 {\deg}C to 230 {\deg}C. This suggests, in turn, that more than one type of defect/polaron is involved, and that the dominant transport mechanism changes with increasing temperature. First principles atomistic modelling suggests that the conductivity of inclined domain walls cannot be solely explained by the formation of a 2D carrier gas and must be supported by hopping processes. This holds true even at temperatures as high as 400 {\deg}C. Our investigations underline the potential to extend DW current based nanoelectronic and sensor applications even into the so-far unexplored temperature range up to 400 {\deg}C.</description>

      <title>Shocking a Shock Wave for Nonlinear Summation of GPa Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploring shock-shock interactions has been limited by experimental constraints, particularly in laser-induced shock experiments due to specialized equipment requirements. Herein, we introduce a tabletop approach to systematically investigate the excitation and superposition of dual laser-induced shock waves in water. Utilizing two laser pulses, spatio-temporally separated and focused into a confined water layer, we identify the optimal superposition leading to the highest combined shock pressure. Our results demonstrate that combining two shock waves each of $\sim$0.6~GPa pressure yields an overall shock pressure of $\sim$3~GPa. Our findings, suggesting an inherent nonlinear summation from the laser excitation process itself and highlights a new pathway for energy-efficient laser shock wave excitation.</description>

      <title>Chip-Scale Atomic Birefringent Diffractive-Optical-Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between light and vapors in the presence of magnetic fields is fundamental to many quantum technologies and applications. Recently, the ability to geometrically confine atoms into periodic structures has enabled the creation of hybrid atomic-diffractive optical elements. However, the application of magnetic fields to such structures remains largely unexplored, offering potential for both fundamental and applied insights. Here, we present measurements of an atomic-diffractive optical element subject to magnetic fields. In contrast to the well-known polarization rotation in Faraday configurations, the diffractive atomic elements exhibit additional rotation terms, which we validate both theoretically and experimentally. Moreover, we find that the introduction of spatially varying magnetic fields leads to a reduction in fringe visibility, which can be leveraged for gradiometric applications. Our study sheds light on the fundamental magneto-optic properties of geometrically confined atomic systems and provides guidelines for chip-scale gradient magnetic measurements.</description>

      <title>Non-Invasive Assessment of Sediment Accumulation Using Muography: A Pilot Run at the Shanghai Outer Ring Tunnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the application of cosmic-ray muography as a non-invasive method to assess sediment accumulation and tidal influences in the Shanghai Outer Ring Tunnel, an immersed tube tunnel beneath the Huangpu River in Shanghai, China. A portable, dual-layer plastic scintillator detector was deployed to conduct muon flux scans along the tunnel's length and to continuously monitor muon flux to study tidal effects. Geant4 simulations validated the correlation between muon attenuation and overburden thickness, incorporating sediment, water, and concrete layers. Key findings revealed an 11\% reduction in muon flux per meter of tidal water level increase, demonstrating a strong anti-correlation (correlation coefficient: -0.8) with tidal cycles. The results align with geotechnical data and simulations, especially in the region of interest, confirming muography's sensitivity to sediment dynamics. This work establishes muography as a robust tool for long-term, real-time monitoring of submerged infrastructure, offering significant advantages over conventional invasive techniques. The study underscores the potential for integrating muography into civil engineering practices to enhance safety and operational resilience in tidal environments.</description>

      <title>QUEST: A Quantized Energy-Aware SNN Training Framework for Multi-State Neuromorphic Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic devices, leveraging novel physical phenomena, offer a promising path toward energy-efficient hardware beyond CMOS technology by emulating brain-inspired computation. However, their progress is often limited to proof-of-concept studies due to the lack of flexible spiking neural network (SNN) algorithm frameworks tailored to device-specific characteristics, posing a significant challenge to scalability and practical deployment. To address this, we propose QUEST, a unified co-design framework that directly trains SNN for emerging devices featuring multilevel resistances. With Skyrmionic Magnetic Tunnel Junction (Sk-MTJ) as a case study, experimental results on the CIFAR-10 dataset demonstrate the framework's ability to enable scalable on-device SNN training with minimal energy consumption during both feedforward and backpropagation. By introducing device mapping pattern and activation operation sparsity, QUEST achieves effective trade-offs among high accuracy (89.6%), low bit precision (2-bit), and energy efficiency (93 times improvement over the ANNs). QUEST offers practical design guidelines for both the device and algorithm communities, providing insights to build energy-efficient and large-scale neuromorphic systems.</description>

      <title>Loop Stirling engines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stirling engine is a type of heat engine known as its high efficiency. It is applied in solar thermal power, cogeneration, space nuclear power, and other fields. Although there are many different types of Stirling engines, their airflow paths are always linear. This article designs two types of Stirling engines with loop airflow path: the O-type engines without regenerator and the 8-type engines with regenerator. The modeling and simulation of the O-type engines show its excellent performance compared with the conventional Stirling engine. At the same time, its design without regenerator makes it more practical and has greater potential in terms of power. The 8-type engines use its unique 8-type airflow path to allow gas to enter the regenerator in advance, eliminating the almost useless four heat exchanges, resulting in higher thermal efficiency and better robustness.</description>

      <title>Determining the acoustoelastic effect of longitudinal waves propagating inclined to principal stress directions in concrete: theory and experimental validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The concept of acoustoelasticity pertains to changes in elastic wave velocity within a medium when subjected to initial stresses. However, existing acoustoelastic expressions are predominantly developed for waves propagating parallel or perpendicular to the principal stress directions, where no shear stresses are involved. In our previous publication, we demonstrated that the impact of shear stresses on longitudinal wave velocity in concrete, when body waves propagate in the shear deformation plane, is negligible. This finding allows us to revise the acoustoelastic expression for longitudinal waves propagating inclined to the principal stress directions in stressed concrete. The revised expression reveals that the acoustoelastic effect for such longitudinal waves can be expressed using acoustoelastic parameters derived from waves propagating parallel and perpendicular to the uniaxial principal stress direction. To validate our theoretical statement, experiments were conducted on a concrete cylinder subjected to uniaxial stress. Despite slight fluctuations in the experimental observations, the overall trend of acoustoelastic effects for inclined propagating longitudinal waves aligns with the theory. This proposed theory holds potential for monitoring changes in the magnitudes and directions of principal stresses in the plane stress state.</description>

      <title>SEMIDV: A Compact Semiconductor Device Simulator with Quantum Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I present SEMIDV - a compact semiconductor device simulator incorporating quantum effects. SEMIDV solves the Poisson-Drift-Diffusion equations for semiconductor devices and provides a user-friendly Python interface for scripting and data analysis. Localization landscape theory is introduced to provide quantum corrections to the Drift-Diffusion equation. This theory directly solves the ground state of the Schrodinger equation without further approximation, offering an efficient solution for quantum effect modeling. Additionally, a compact mobility model considering ballistic transport is developed to capture the ballistic length dependence of mobility and the velocity overshoot effect in short-channel devices. Finally, a study on a nanosheet FET using SEMIDV is conducted. I analyze the electrical characteristics of a state-of-the-art GAA/RibbonFET with a 6 nm gate length and discuss the effects of velocity overshoot and quantum confinement on currents and capacitances. A design for an ultra-short-channel transistor with a gate length down to 4.5 nm with a Vdd = 0.45 V is proposed to push the boundaries of integrated circuit technology further.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A High-Pressure Ion Trap operating at pressure ~1 Torr is a core component of the portable hand-held mass-spectrometric gas analyzer. A comprehensive mathematical model of the HPIT is described in this paper. The influence of the instrumental parameters (gas composition, pressure, and temperature; applied voltages; ion trap size and geometry) and ion properties (mass, diffusion, and mobility) on the ion trap analytical parameters (mass-spectral peak position, height, and width) is examined. The model explained the difference between a high-pressure and regular low-pressure ion trap.</description>

      <title>High-performance Hybrid Lithium Niobate Electro-optic Modulators Integrated with Low-loss Silicon Nitride Waveguides on a Wafer-scale Silicon Photonics Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneously-integrated electro-optic modulators (EOM) are demonstrated using the hybrid-mode concept, incorporating thin-film lithium niobate (LN) by bonding with silicon nitride (SiN) passive photonics. At wavelengths near 1550 nm, these EOMs demonstrated greater than 30 dB extinction ratio, 3.8 dB on-chip insertion loss, a low-frequency half-wave voltage-length product ($V_\pi L$) of 3.8 V.cm, and a 3-dB EO modulation bandwidth exceeding 110 GHz. This work demonstrates the combination of multi-layer low-loss SiN waveguides with high-performance LN EOMs made in a scalable fabrication process using conventional low-resistivity silicon (Si) wafers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reducing electromagnetic scattering from an object has always been a task, inspiring efforts across disciplines such as materials science and electromagnetic theory. The pursuit of electromagnetic cloaking significantly advanced the field of metamaterials, yet achieving broadband, conformal cloaking for complex, non-trivial objects remains an unresolved challenge. Here, we introduce the concept of 'tailor-made metasurfaces' - machine-designed aperiodic structures optimized to suppress scattering from arbitrary objects by accounting for their layout, including resonant or large-scale features. Specifically, we demonstrated a wideband ~20% fractional bandwidth scattering suppression of more than 20-30 dB for various generic test objects, including randomly distributed wire meshes, spheres, and polygons. The demonstrated evolutionary optimization marks a leap forward in electromagnetic design, enabling the development of high-performance structures to meet complex technological demands.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Metal-Organic Chemical Vapor Deposition for Ultrawide Band-Gap MgSiN2 Thin Films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthorhombic II-IV nitride semiconductors offer an expanded and more tunable material set with unique properties, while maintaining close compatibility with the wurtzite crystal structure of the III-nitrides. In particular, MgSiN2, a II-IV nitride closely lattice matched to GaN and AlN has a band gap suitable for photonic applications in the UV-C wavelength region. MgSiN2 is also a promising candidate to exhibit ferroelectricity, which has only been observed in very few nitride materials. This study builds on our previous work on the metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) of MgSiN2 thin films grown on GaN-on-sapphire and c-plane sapphire substrates by exploring higher growth temperature windows, resulting in higher crystalline quality and improved interfaces. Correlations between the growth conditions (Mg:Si precursor molar flow rate ratio, reactor pressure, and growth temperatures from 900C to 960C) and the resultant film quality are investigated for films grown on GaN-on-sapphire. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) reveals high-quality orthorhombic single-crystal MgSiN2, confirming successful epitaxial growth on GaN. Optical transmittance measurements indicate the direct band gap is 6.34-6.36 eV and indirect band gap is 5.77-5.81 eV, affirming the realization of an ultrawide-band gap II-IV nitride semiconductor that is structurally compatible with existing III-nitride device platforms.</description>

      <title>Modal interactions between a linear oscillator and a nonlinear absorber: multiscale energy transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considerable attention has been given to the use of a nonlinear energy sink (NES) as a nonlinear absorber. The NES is an efficient passive control device, which has been the focus of extensive research. This paper uses the Complexification-Averaging/Geometric Singular Perturbation Theory (CX-A/GSPT) to investigate the multiscale energy transfers in a forced two-DOF system coupled to a grounded NES (GNES) with both nonlinear grounded stiffness and damping. Due to the coexistence of fundamental resonance and internal resonance in the system, complex modal interactions occur between the linear oscillator (LO) and the GNES. In addition, the ratio of the mass of the GNES and the LO can be seen as a perturbation. This may lead to the occurrence of multiscale dynamics and energy transfers in the system. By using the CX-A method, the slow flow equations of the system can be obtained. Further application of GSPT can obtain the critical manifold that is equivalent to the so-called slow invariant manifold (SIM). With different values of nonlinear grounded stiffness and damping, the critical manifolds have different structures. These critical manifolds can capture diverse types of system responses. Moreover, Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is used to analyze the time-frequency-energy relationship of system response. With different parameters, the instantaneous frequencies of the responses of the LO and GNES show a completely different change. The Hilbert spectrums confirm the occurrence of complex modal interactions and different time-scale energy transfers in the system.</description>

      <title>Scalable Superconducting Nanowire Memory Array with Row-Column Addressing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Developing ultra-low-energy superconducting computing and fault-tolerant quantum computing will require scalable superconducting memory. While conventional superconducting logic-based memory cells have facilitated early demonstrations, their large footprint poses a significant barrier to scaling. Nanowire-based superconducting memory cells offer a compact alternative, but high error rates have hindered their integration into large arrays. In this work, we present a superconducting nanowire memory array designed for scalable row-column operation, achieving a functional density of 2.6$\,$Mb/cm$^{2}$. The array operates at $1.3\,$K, where we implement and characterize multi-flux quanta state storage and destructive readout. By optimizing write and read pulse sequences, we minimize bit errors while maximizing operational margins in a $4\times 4$ array. Circuit-level simulations further elucidate the memory cell's dynamics, providing insight into performance limits and stability under varying pulse amplitudes. We experimentally demonstrate stable memory operation with a minimum bit error rate of $10^{-5}$. These results suggest a promising path for scaling superconducting nanowire memories to high-density architectures, offering a foundation for energy-efficient memory in superconducting electronics.</description>

Abstract: Cryo-computing - both classical and quantum, is severely limited by the absence of a suitable cryo-memory. The challenge both in terms of energy efficiency and speed have been known for decades, but so far conventional technologies have not been able to deliver adequate performance. Here we present a novel non-volatile memory device which incorporates a superconducting nanowire and an all-electronic charge configuration memristor (CCM) based on switching between charge-ordered states in a layered dichalcogenide material. We investigate the time-dynamics and current-voltage characteristics of such a device fabricated using a NbTiN nanowire and a 1T-TaS2 CCM. The observed dynamical response of the device is faithfully reproduced by modelling of the superconducting order parameter showing versatility of application. The inherent ultrahigh energy efficiency and speed of the device, which is compatible with single flux quantum logic, leads to a promising new memory concept for use in cryo-computing and quantum computing peripheral devices.</description>

      <title>Probing the dichotomy between Yu-Shiba-Rusinov and Majorana bound states via conductance, quantum noise and $\Delta_T$ noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16717v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the potential of charge and spin conductance as well as charge and spin quantum noise and $\Delta_T$ noise as probes to analyze and contrast Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states from Majorana bound states (MBS) in a one-dimensional metal/spin-flipper/metal/insulator/superconductor junction. YSR bound states, induced by magnetic impurities acting as spin-flippers within the superconducting gap, are distinct from MBS, which can also arise in systems with magnetic impurities, such as magnetic adatoms on superconductors, often leading to false positives in MBS detection. Replacing a trivial $s$-wave superconductor with a topological superconductor featuring triplet pairing, e.g., chiral-$p$ or spinless $p$-wave superconducting nanowire, we analyze and establish clear distinctions between YSR states and MBS. This work provides an unique signature for YSR states, demonstrating that charge or spin conductance as well as both charge and spin quantum noise, along their $\Delta_T$ noise counterparts are effective in identifying YSR bound states and distinguishing them from MBS.</description>

      <title>HTS Potential and Needs for Future Accelerator Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: HTS has the potential of a game changer for many applications of superconductivity, not last in the field of particle accelerators and detectors. This paper explores the potential of HTS, with a focus on REBCO-coated conductors, in relation to the evolving demands of superconducting magnets for accelerators. HTS already have a spectacular current carrying ability at high field, demonstrated and available on relevant lengths. Recent advances in non-conventional winding techniques for solenoids, in particular non-insulated windings, have shown that it is possible to reach engineering current densities in the coil exceeding by far those of LTS . This approach seems to offer an extended field reach, as well as solutions to the challenges associated with magnet mechanics, quench management and cost. Most important, beyond the ability to reach a field range higher than what is possible with LTS, HTS offers an extended range of operating temperature, with large margin. This can be exploited to obtain higher availability and better cryogenic efficiency, a must for the future of sustainable large scale research infrastructures such as particle accelerators.</description>

      <title>Determining diffusivity and dissipation of diffuse body waves in concrete with multiple planar boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new method for determining the diffusive properties of diffuse body waves, specifically diffusivity and dissipation, in concrete with multiple planar boundaries. Instead of relying on the analytical solution to the diffusion equation, which accounts for all possible reflections and has a significantly complex form, we propose a simpler method that considers the reflected energy originating from a limited number of image sources, making it easier to perform curve fitting and obtain diffusive properties. Our experimental findings highlight that distant image sources have a negligible effect on the acquired diffusive properties, suggesting that the number of image sources considered should be determined based on their maximum contribution to the main energy. Additionally, failing to account for the reflected energy during the fitting process results in an underestimation of both the diffusivity and dissipation. The obtained diffusive properties can be used to evaluate damage in concrete.</description>
