      <title>A High-Resolution Analysis of Receiver Quantization in Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate performance limits and design of communication in the presence of uniform output quantization with moderate to high resolution. Under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) complex Gaussian codebook and nearest neighbor decoding rule, an achievable rate is derived in an analytical form by the generalized mutual information (GMI). The gain control before quantization is shown to be increasingly important as the resolution decreases, due to the fact that the loading factor (normalized one-sided quantization range) has increasing impact on performance. The impact of imperfect gain control in the high-resolution regime is characterized by two asymptotic results: 1) the rate loss due to overload distortion decays exponentially as the loading factor increases, and 2) the rate loss due to granular distortion decays quadratically as the step size vanishes. For a $2K$-level uniform quantizer, we prove that the optimal loading factor that maximizes the achievable rate scales like $2\sqrt{\ln 2K}$ as the resolution increases. An asymptotically tight estimate of the optimal loading factor is further given, which is also highly accurate for finite resolutions.</description>

      <title>Several Representations of $\alpha$-Mutual Information and Interpretations as Privacy Leakage Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present several novel representations of $\alpha$-mutual information ($\alpha$-MI) in terms of R{\' e}nyi divergence and conditional R{\' e}nyi entropy. The representations are based on the variational characterizations of $\alpha$-MI using a reverse channel. Based on these representations, we provide several interpretations of the $\alpha$-MI as privacy leakage measures using generalized mean and gain functions. Further, as byproducts of the representations, we propose novel conditional R{\' e}nyi entropies that satisfy the property that conditioning reduces entropy and data-processing inequality.</description>

      <title>Lossless data compression at pragmatic rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of variable-rate lossless data compression is considered, for codes with and without prefix constraints. Sharp bounds are derived for the best achievable compression rate of memoryless sources, when the excess-rate probability is required to be exponentially small in the blocklength. Accurate nonasymptotic expansions with explicit constants are obtained for the optimal rate, using tools from large deviations and Gaussian approximation. Examples are shown indicating that, in the small excess-rate-probability regime, the approximation to the fundamental limit of the compression rate suggested by these bounds is significantly more accurate than the approximations provided by either normal approximation or error exponents. The new bounds reinforce the crucial operational conclusion that, in applications where the blocklength is relatively short and where stringent guarantees are required on the rate, the best achievable rate is no longer close to the entropy. Rather, it is an appropriate, more pragmatic rate, determined via the inverse error exponent function and the blocklength.</description>

      <title>Integrating Mediumband with Emerging Technologies: Unified Vision for 6G and Beyond Physical Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a vision for the physical layer of 6G and beyond, where emerging physical layer technologies integrate to drive wireless links toward mediumband operation, addressing a major challenge: deep fading, a prevalent, and perhaps the most consequential, obstacle in wireless communication link performance. By leveraging recent insights into wireless channel fundamentals and advancements in computing, multi-modal sensing, and AI, we articulate how reflecting surfaces (RS), sensing, digital twins (DTs), ray-tracing, and AI can work synergistically to lift the burden of deep fading in future wireless communication networks. This refreshingly new approach promises transformative improvements in reliability, spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and network resilience, positioning 6G for truly superior performance.</description>

      <title>The Distributed Multi-User Point Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of information-theoretic distributed multi-user point function, involving a trusted master node, $N \in \mathbb{N}$ server nodes, and $K\in \mathbb{N}$ users, where each user has access to the contents of a subset of the storages of server nodes. Each user is associated with an independent point function $f_{X_k,Z_k}: \{1,2,\hdots,T\} \rightarrow{GF(q^{m R_k})},T,mR_k \in \mathbb{N}$. Using these point functions, the trusted master node encodes and places functional shares $G_1,G_2,\hdots,G_N \in GF(q^{M}), M \in \mathbb{N}$ in the storage nodes such that each user can correctly recover its point function result from the response transmitted to itself and gains no information about the point functions of any other user, even with knowledge of all responses transmitted from its connected servers. For the first time, we propose a multi-user scheme that satisfies the correctness and information-theoretic privacy constraints, ensuring recovery for all point functions. We also characterize the inner and outer bounds on the capacity -- the maximum achievable rate defined as the size of the range of each point function $mR_k$ relative to the storage size of the servers $M$ -- of the distributed multi-user point function scheme by presenting a novel converse argument.</description>

      <title>Entropic versions of Bergstr\"om's and Bonnesen's inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish analogues of the Bergstr\"om and Bonnesen inequalities, related to determinants and volumes respectively, for the entropy power and for the Fisher information. The obtained inequalities strengthen the well-known convolution inequality for the Fisher information as well as the entropy power inequality in dimensions $d&gt;1$, while they reduce to the former in $d=1$. Our results recover the original Bergstr\"om inequality and generalize a proof of Bergstr\"om's inequality given by Dembo, Cover and Thomas. We characterize the equality case in our entropic Bonnesen inequality.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficiency and Spectral-Efficiency Trade-off in Distributed Massive-MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01271v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the inherent trade-off between energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) in distributed massive-MIMO (D-mMIMO) systems. Optimizing the EE and SE together is crucial as increasing spectral efficiency often leads to higher energy consumption. Joint power allocation and AP-UE association are pivotal in this trade-off analysis because they directly influence both EE and SE. We address the gap in existing literature where the EE-SE trade-off has been analyzed but not optimized in the context of D-mMIMO systems. The focus of this study is to maximize the EE with constraints on uplink sum SE through judicious power allocation and AP-UE association, essential for enhancing network throughput. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the proposed model, exploring the impacts of AP-UE association and power allocation on the EE-SE trade-off in uplink D-mMIMO scenarios.</description>

      <title>Complex-Valued Neural Networks for Ultra-Reliable Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the evolving landscape of 5G and 6G networks, the demands extend beyond high data rates, ultra-low latency, and extensive coverage, increasingly emphasizing the need for reliability. This paper proposes an ultra-reliable multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme utilizing quasi-orthogonal space-time block coding (QOSTBC) combined with singular value decomposition (SVD) for channel state information (CSI) correction, significantly improving performance over QOSTBC and traditional orthogonal STBC (OSTBC) when analyzing spectral efficiency. Although QOSTBC enhances spectral efficiency, it also increases computational complexity at the maximum likelihood (ML) decoder. To address this, a neural network-based decoding scheme using phase-transmittance radial basis function (PT-RBF) architecture is also introduced to manage QOSTBC's complexity. Simulation results demonstrate improved system robustness and performance, making this approach a potential candidate for ultra-reliable communication in next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>Informativity Conditions for Multiple Signals: Properties, Experimental Design, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies highlight the importance of persistently exciting condition in single signal sequence for model identification and data-driven control methodologies. However, maintaining prolonged excitation in control signals introduces significant challenges, as continuous excitation can reduce the lifetime of mechanical devices. In this paper, we introduce three informativity conditions for various types of multi-signal data, each augmented by weight factors. We explore the interrelations between these conditions and their rank properties in linear time-invariant systems. Furthermore, we introduce open-loop experimental design methods tailored to each of the three conditions, which can synthesize the required excitation conditions either offline or online, even in the presence of limited information within each signal segment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these informativity conditions in least-squares identification. Additionally, all three conditions can extend Willems' fundamental lemma and are utilized to assess the properties of the system. Illustrative examples confirm that these conditions yield satisfactory outcomes in both least-squares identification and the construction of data-driven controllers.</description>

      <title>Quantum Advantage in Private Multiple Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For multiple hypothesis testing based on classical data samples, we demonstrate a quantum advantage in the optimal privacy-utility trade-off (PUT), where the privacy and utility measures are set to (quantum) local differential privacy and the pairwise-minimum Chernoff information, respectively. To show the quantum advantage, we consider some class of hypotheses that we coin smoothed point masses. For such hypotheses, we derive an upper bound of the optimal PUT achieved by classical mechanisms, which is tight for some cases, and propose a certain quantum mechanism which achieves a better PUT than the upper bound. The proposed quantum mechanism consists of a classical-quantum channel whose outputs are pure states corresponding to a symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measure (SIC-POVM), and a depolarizing channel.</description>

      <title>Invariant Theory and Magic State Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the performance of a linear self-orthogonal $GF(4)$ code for magic state distillation of Bravyi and Kitaev's $|T\rangle$-state is characterized by its simple weight enumerator. We compute weight enumerators of all such codes with less than 20 qubits and find none whose threshold exceeds that of the 5-qubit code. Using constraints on weight enumerators from invariant theory and linear programming, we obtain bounds on the exponent characterizing noise suppression of a $|T\rangle$-state distillation protocol. We also obtain new non-negativity constraints on such weight enumerators by demanding consistency of the associated magic state distillation routine. These ``quantum constraints'' lead to new bounds on the distance of classical self-dual and maximal self-orthogonal linear $GF(4)$ codes, in particular, implying the nonexistence of a self-dual $[12m, 6m, 2m+4]_{GF(4)}$ linear code.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While signal processing is a mature area, its connections with quantum computing have received less attention. In this work, we propose approaches that perform classical discrete-time signal processing using quantum systems. Our approaches encode the classical discrete-time input signal into quantum states, and design unitaries to realize classical concepts of finite impulse response (FIR) filters. We also develop strategies to cascade lower-order filters to realize higher-order filters through designing appropriate unitary operators. Finally, a few directions for processing quantum states on classical systems after converting them to classical signals are suggested for future work.</description>

      <title>ODMA-Based Cell-Free Unsourced Random Access with Successive Interference Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the unsourced random access problem with multiple receivers and propose a cell-free type solution for that. In our proposed scheme, the active users transmit their signals to the access points (APs) distributed in a geographical area and connected to a central processing unit (CPU). The transmitted signals are composed of a pilot and polar codeword, where the polar codeword bits occupy a small fraction of the data part of the transmission frame. The receiver operations of pilot detection and channel and symbol estimation take place at the APs, while the actual message bits are detected at the CPU by combining the symbol estimates from the APs forwarded over the fronthaul. The effect of the successfully decoded messages is then subtracted at the APs. Numerical examples illustrate that the proposed scheme can support up to 1400 users with a high energy efficiency, and the distributed structure decreases the error probability by more than two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Joint Active and Passive Beamforming Optimization for Beyond Diagonal RIS-aided Multi-User Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benefiting from its capability to generalize existing reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) architectures and provide additional design flexibility via interactions between RIS elements, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS) has attracted considerable research interests recently. However, due to the symmetric and unitary passive beamforming constraint imposed on BD-RIS, existing joint active and passive beamforming optimization algorithms for BD-RIS either exhibit high computational complexity to achieve near optimal solutions or rely on heuristic algorithms with substantial performance loss. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing an efficient optimization framework for BD-RIS assisted multi-user multi-antenna communication networks. Specifically, we solve the weighted sum rate maximization problem by introducing a novel beamforming optimization algorithm that alternately optimizes active and passive beamforming matrices using iterative closed-form solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that our algorithm significantly reduces computational complexity while ensuring a sub-optimal solution.</description>

Abstract: Deep neural networks provide reliable solutions for many classification and regression tasks; however, their application in real-time wireless systems with simple sensor networks is limited due to high energy consumption and significant bandwidth needs. This study proposes a multi-sensor wireless inference system with memristor-based analog computing. Given the sensors' limited computational capabilities, the features from the network's front end are transmitted to a central device where an $L_p$-norm inspired approximation of the maximum operation is employed to achieve transformation-invariant features, enabling efficient over-the-air transmission. We also introduce a trainable over-the-air sensor fusion method based on $L_p$-norm inspired combining function that customizes sensor fusion to match the network and sensor distribution characteristics, enhancing adaptability. To address the energy constraints of sensors, we utilize memristors, known for their energy-efficient in-memory computing, enabling analog-domain computations that reduce energy use and computational overhead in edge computing. This dual approach of memristors and $L_p$-norm inspired sensor fusion fosters energy-efficient computational and transmission paradigms and serves as a practical energy-efficient solution with minimal performance loss.</description>

      <title>Information Theory for Complex Systems Scientists</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.12482v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 21st century, many of the crucial scientific and technical issues facing humanity can be understood as problems associated with understanding, modelling, and ultimately controlling complex systems: systems comprised of a large number of non-trivially interacting components whose collective behaviour can be difficult to predict. Information theory, a branch of mathematics historically associated with questions about encoding and decoding messages, has emerged as something of a lingua franca for those studying complex systems, far exceeding its original narrow domain of communication systems engineering. In the context of complexity science, information theory provides a set of tools which allow researchers to uncover the statistical and effective dependencies between interacting components; relationships between systems and their environment; mereological whole-part relationships; and is sensitive to non-linearities missed by commonly parametric statistical models.
  In this review, we aim to provide an accessible introduction to the core of modern information theory, aimed specifically at aspiring (and established) complex systems scientists. This includes standard measures, such as Shannon entropy, relative entropy, and mutual information, before building to more advanced topics, including: information dynamics, measures of statistical complexity, information decomposition, and effective network inference. In addition to detailing the formal definitions, in this review we make an effort to discuss how information theory can be interpreted and develop the intuition behind abstract concepts like "entropy," in the hope that this will enable interested readers to understand what information is, and how it is used, at a more fundamental level.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Secure Multiplication: Hiding Information in the Rubble of Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of private distributed multi-party multiplication. It is well-established that Shamir secret-sharing coding strategies can enable perfect information-theoretic privacy in distributed computation via the celebrated algorithm of Ben Or, Goldwasser and Wigderson (the "BGW algorithm"). However, perfect privacy and accuracy require an honest majority, that is, $N \geq 2t+1$ compute nodes are required to ensure privacy against any $t$ colluding adversarial nodes. By allowing for some controlled amount of information leakage and approximate multiplication instead of exact multiplication, we study coding schemes for the setting where the number of honest nodes can be a minority, that is $N&lt; 2t+1.$ We develop a tight characterization privacy-accuracy trade-off for cases where $N &lt; 2t+1$ by measuring information leakage using {differential} privacy instead of perfect privacy, and using the mean squared error metric for accuracy. A novel technical aspect is an intricately layered noise distribution that merges ideas from differential privacy and Shamir secret-sharing at different layers.</description>

      <title>Graph Compression with Side Information at the Decoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of graph compression with side information at the decoder. The focus is on the situation when an unlabelled graph (which is also referred to as a structure) is to be compressed or is available as side information. For correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi weighted random graphs, we give a precise characterization of the smallest rate at which a labelled graph or its structure can be compressed with aid of a correlated labelled graph or its structure at the decoder. We approach this problem by using the entropy-spectrum framework and establish some convergence results for conditional distributions involving structures, which play a key role in the construction of an optimal encoding and decoding scheme. Our proof essentially uses the fact that, in the considered correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model, the structure retains most of the information about the labelled graph. Furthermore, we consider the case of unweighted graphs and present how the optimal decoding can be done using the notion of graph alignment.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Codes for $(t,s)$-Burst Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11750v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, codes for correcting a burst of errors have attracted significant attention. One of the most important reasons is that bursts of errors occur in certain emerging techniques, such as DNA storage. In this paper, we investigate a type of error, called a $(t,s)$-burst, which deletes $t$ consecutive symbols and inserts $s$ arbitrary symbols at the same coordinate. Note that a $(t,s)$-burst error can be seen as a generalization of a burst of insertions ($t=0$), a burst of deletions ($s=0$), and a burst of substitutions ($t=s$). Our main contribution is to give explicit constructions of $q$-ary $(t,s)$-burst correcting codes with $\log n + O(1)$ bits of redundancy for any given constant non-negative integers $t$, $s$, and $q \geq 2$. These codes have optimal redundancy up to an additive constant. Furthermore, we apply our $(t,s)$-burst correcting codes to combat other various types of errors and improve the corresponding results. In particular, one of our byproducts is a permutation code capable of correcting a burst of $t$ stable deletions with $\log n + O(1)$ bits of redundancy, which is optimal up to an additive constant.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quantization for Matrix Multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent work in machine learning community proposed multiple methods for performing lossy compression (quantization) of large matrices. This quantization is important for accelerating matrix multiplication (main component of large language models), which is often bottlenecked by the speed of loading these matrices from memory. Unlike classical vector quantization and rate-distortion theory, the goal of these new compression algorithms is to be able to approximate not the matrices themselves, but their matrix product. Specifically, given a pair of real matrices $A,B$ an encoder (compressor) is applied to each of them independently producing descriptions with $R$ bits per entry. These representations subsequently are used by the decoder to estimate matrix product $A^\top B$. In this work, we provide a non-asymptotic lower bound on the mean squared error of this approximation (as a function of rate $R$) for the case of matrices $A,B$ with iid Gaussian entries. Algorithmically, we construct a universal quantizer based on nested lattices with an explicit guarantee of approximation error for any (non-random) pair of matrices $A$, $B$ in terms of only Frobenius norms $\|\bar{A}\|_F, \|\bar{B}\|_F$ and $\|\bar{A}^\top \bar{B}\|_F$, where $\bar{A},\bar{B}$ are versions of $A,B$ with zero-centered columns, respectively. For iid Gaussian matrices our quantizer achieves the lower bound and is, thus, asymptotically optimal. A practical low-complexity version of our quantizer achieves performance quite close to optimal. In addition, we derive rate-distortion function for matrix multiplication of iid Gaussian matrices, which exhibits an interesting phase-transition at $R\approx 0.906$ bit/entry.</description>

      <title>Singular Detection in Noncoherent Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a general analysis of codeword detection in noncoherent communications. Motivated by the existence of error floors in various regimes, fundamental characteristics of signal design are investigated. In particular, the necessary and sufficient conditions for asymptotically singular detection (i.e. error-free in the limit) are derived from classical results in detection theory. By leveraging tools from linear algebra and the theory of Hilbert spaces, we are able to characterize asymptotic singularity in two main scenarios: the large array and high SNR regimes. The results generalize previous works and extend the notion of unique identification, as well as recontextualize the geometry of Grassmannian constellations from an alternative perspective.</description>

Abstract: Soprunov and Soprunova introduced the notion of a good infinite family of toric codes. We prove that such good families do not exist by proving a more general Szemer\'edi-type result: for all $c\in(0,1]$ and all positive integers $N$, subsets of density at least $c$ in $\{0,1,\dots,N-1\}^n$ contain hypercubes of arbitrarily large dimension as $n$ grows.</description>

      <title>Parsings of Stationary Processes, Stopping Times and the Fundamental Pointwise Convergence Theorems of Ergodic Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The idea of a parsing of a stationary process according to a collection of words is introduced, and the basic framework required for the asymptotic analysis of these parsings is presented. We demonstrate how the pointwise ergodic theorem and the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem can be deduced from their respective weaker convergence in probability versions combined with our observations regarding parsings, where the parsings are done according to collections that originate in stopping times tailored for that purpose.</description>

      <title>Optimizing hypergraph product codes with random walks, simulated annealing and reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09622v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hypergraph products are quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes constructed from two classical LDPC codes. Although their dimension and distance depend only on the parameters of the underlying classical codes, optimizing their performance against various noise channels remains challenging. This difficulty partly stems from the complexity of decoding in the quantum setting. The standard, ad hoc approach typically involves selecting classical LDPC codes with large girth. In this work, we focus on optimizing performance against the quantum erasure channel. A key advantage of this channel is the existence of an efficient maximum-likelihood decoder, which enables us to employ optimization techniques based on sampling random codes, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Simulated Annealing (SA). Our results indicate that these techniques improve performance relative to the state-of-the-art.</description>
