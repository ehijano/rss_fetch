      <title>On the Defense of the Recent Solution to Hilbert's Sixteenth Problem: Clarifying Misinterpretations and the Incorrect Conclusions in Buzzi and Novaes's note</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the covariant formulation of the geometric bifurcation theory, developed in a previous paper, has been applied to two elementary problems: the study of limit cycles of dynamical systems and the second part of Hilbert's sixteenth problem. First, it has been shown that dynamical systems with more than one limit cycle are understood to be those in which the scalar curvature $\mbox{R}$ is positive and its magnitude diverges to infinity at different singular points. In the second, it has been demonstrated that $n$th-degree polynomial systems have the maximum number of $2(n-1)(4(n-1)-2)$ limit cycles with their relative positions determined by the singularities of the magnitude of $\mbox{R}$, thus providing a successful response to the original Hilbert's challenge. It is the purpose of this letter to point out that Buzzi and Novaes's note is incorrect and leads to erroneous results as an immediate consequence of their superficial reading of our work, the omission of critical aspects of the GBT to induce doubt, and reliance on incorrect assumptions or interpretations that deviate from those established in the framework of GBT.</description>

      <title>Energy-based dual-phase dynamics identification of clearance nonlinearities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy-based dual-phase dynamics identification (EDDI) method is a new data-driven technique for the discovery of equations of motion (EOMs) of strongly nonlinear single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) oscillators. This research uses the EDDI method to obtain mathematical models for SDOF systems with clearance nonlinearities. The first key aspect of the EDDI method is that it relates the kinetic energy of the system to the dissipated energy and the underlying non-conservative forces acting on the oscillator. The second key aspect is that the EOM is identified with only knowledge of the mass of the oscillator and the transient response. The first phase of the EDDI method constructs the dissipated energy from the kinetic energy, then identifies a mathematical model for the damping based on the dissipated energy. To achieve this, the moments in time when the displacements are zero, where the mechanical and kinetic energies are equal, are used to compute the energy dissipated by the damping of the system. The second phase begins by computing the conservative force acting on the oscillator from either a balance of the other forces in the system or through the Lagrange equation. Finally, the stiffness model is determined by solving a set of linear equations to construct a mathematical model for the conservative (elastic) force. The governing equations are discovered by incorporating both the damping and stiffness terms. The method is demonstrated by employing analytical and real measured responses of nonlinear SDOF systems with different clearances nonlinearities, which shows that the proposed approach is suitable for non-smooth mechanical systems as well as smooth systems.</description>

      <title>Twist Coefficients of Periodic Orbits of Minkowski Billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental properties of Minkowski billiards and introduce a new coordinate system $(s,u)$ on the phase space $\mathcal{M}$. In this coordinate system, the Minkowski billiard map $\mathcal{T}$ preserves the standard area form $\omega = ds \wedge du$. We then classify the periodic orbits of Minkowski billiards with period $2$ and derive formulas for the twist coefficient $\tau_1$ for elliptic periodic orbits, expressed in terms of the geometric characteristics of the billiard table. Additionally, we analyze the stability properties of these elliptic periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and integrability of polynomial vector fields on the $n$-dimensional sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize arbitrary polynomial vector fields on $S^n$. We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a degree one vector field on the odd-dimensional sphere $S^{2n-1}$ to be Hamiltonian. Additionally, we classify polynomial vector fields on $S^n$ up to degree two that possess an invariant great $(n-1)$-sphere. We present a class of completely integrable vector fields on $S^n$. We found a sharp bound for the number of invariant meridian hyperplanes for a polynomial vector field on $S^2$. Furthermore, we compute the sharp bound for the number of invariant parallel hyperplanes for any polynomial vector field on $S^n$. Finally, we study homogeneous polynomial vector fields on $S^n$, providing a characterization of their invariant $(n-1)$-spheres.</description>

      <title>Mean dimension theory for infinite dimensional Bedford-McMullen sponges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tsukamoto (2022) introduced the notion of Bedford-McMullen carpet system, a subsystem of $([0,1]^{\mathbb{N}}\times[0,1]^{\mathbb{N}},shift)$ whose metric mean dimension and mean Hausdorff dimension does not coincide in general. The aim of this paper is to develop the mean dimension theory for Bedford-McMullen sponge system, which is a subsystem of $(([0,1]^r)^{\mathbb{N}},shift)$ with arbitrary $3\leq r\in\mathbb{N}$. In particular, we compute the metric mean dimension and mean Hausdorff dimension of such topological dynamical systems explicitly, extending the results by Tsukamoto. The metric mean dimension is a weighted combination of the standard topological entropy, whereas the mean Hausdorff dimension is expressed in terms of weighted topological entropy. We also exhibit a special situation for which the metric mean dimension and the mean Hausdorff dimension of a sponge system coincide.</description>

      <title>Backtracking New Q-Newton's method for finding roots of meromorphic functions in 1 complex variable: Global convergence, and local stable/unstable curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we research more in depth properties of Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (recently designed by the third author), when used to find roots of meromorphic functions.
  If $f=P/Q$, where $P$ and $Q$ are polynomials in 1 complex variable z with $deg (P)&gt;deg (Q)$, we show the existence of an exceptional set $\mathcal{E}\subset\mathbf{C}$, which is contained in a countable union of real analytic curves in $\mathbf{R}^2=\mathbf{C}$, so that the following statements A and B hold. Here, $\{z_n\}$ is the sequence constructed by BNQN with an initial point $z_0$, not a pole of $f$.
  A) If $z_0\in\mathbb{C}\backslash\mathcal{E}$, then $\{z_n\}$ converges to a root of $f$.
  B) If $z_0\in \mathcal{E}$, then $\{z_n\}$ converges to a critical point - but not a root - of $f$.
  Experiments seem to indicate that in general, even when $f$ is a polynomial, the set $\mathcal{E}$ is not contained in a finite union of real analytic curves. We provide further results relevant to whether locally $\mathcal{E}$ is contained in a finite number of real analytic curves. A similar result holds for general meromorphic functions. Moreover, unlike previous work, here we do not require that the parameters of BNQN are random, or that the meromorphic function $f$ is generic.
  Based on the theoretical results, we explain (both rigorously and heuristically) of what observed in experiments with BNQN, in previous works by the authors. The dynamics of BNQN seems also to have some similarities (and differences) to the classical Leau-Fatou's flowers.</description>

      <title>Quasi-fixed points of substitutive systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study automatic sequences and automatic systems generated by general constant length (nonprimitive) substitutions. While an automatic system is typically uncountable, the set of automatic sequences is countable, implying that most sequences within an automatic system are not themselves automatic. We provide a complete and succinct classification of automatic sequences that lie in a given automatic system in terms of the quasi-fixed points of the substitution defining the system. Our result extends to factor maps between automatic systems and highlights arithmetic properties underpinning these systems. We conjecture that a similar statement holds for general nonconstant length substitutions.</description>

      <title>An illustrated introduction to the arithmetic of Apollonian circle packings, continued fractions, and other thin orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02050v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These notes cover and expand upon the material for two summer schools: The first, which was held at CIRM, Marseille, France, July 10-14, 2023, as part of "Renormalization and Visualization for packing, billiard and surfaces", was titled "Number theory as a door to geometry, dynamics and illustration". The second was held at NSU IMS in Singapore, June 3-7, 2024, as part of "Computational Aspects of Thin Groups", and was titled "Integral packings and number theory". Both courses were put together by a number theorist for students and researchers in other fields. They cover a web of ideas relating to Apollonian circle packings, integral orbits, thin groups, hyperbolic geometry, continued fractions, and Diophantine approximation. The connection of geometry and dynamics to number theory gives an opportunity to illustrate arithmetic by appealing to our visual intuition.</description>

      <title>Transformer-based Koopman Autoencoder for Linearizing Fisher's Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Transformer-based Koopman autoencoder is proposed for linearizing Fisher's reaction-diffusion equation. The primary focus of this study is on using deep learning techniques to find complex spatiotemporal patterns in the reaction-diffusion system. The emphasis is on not just solving the equation but also transforming the system's dynamics into a more comprehensible, linear form. Global coordinate transformations are achieved through the autoencoder, which learns to capture the underlying dynamics by training on a dataset with 60,000 initial conditions. Extensive testing on multiple datasets was used to assess the efficacy of the proposed model, demonstrating its ability to accurately predict the system's evolution as well as to generalize. We provide a thorough comparison study, comparing our suggested design to a few other comparable methods using experiments on various PDEs, such as the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the Burger's equation. Results show improved accuracy, highlighting the capabilities of the Transformer-based Koopman autoencoder. The proposed architecture in is significantly ahead of other architectures, in terms of solving different types of PDEs using a single architecture. Our method relies entirely on the data, without requiring any knowledge of the underlying equations. This makes it applicable to even the datasets where the governing equations are not known.</description>

      <title>Interaction Identification of a Heterogeneous NDS with Quadratic-Bilinear Subsystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper attacks time-domain identification for the interaction parameters of a heterogeneous networked dynamic system (NDS), with each of its subsystems being described by a continuous-time descriptor quadratic-bilinear time-invariant (QBTI) model. No restrictions are put on the sampling rate. Explicit formulas are derived respectively for the transient and steady-state responses of the NDS, provided that the probing signal is generated by a linear time invariant (LTI) system. Some relations have been derived between the NDS steady-state response and its frequency domain input-output mappings. These relations reveal that the value of some NDS associated TFMs can in principle be estimated at almost any interested point of the imaginary axis from input-output experimental data, as well as its derivatives and a right tangential interpolation along an arbitrary direction. Based on these relations, an estimation algorithm is suggested respectively for the parameters of the NDS and the values of these TFMs.</description>

      <title>The Dimension of the Disguised Toric Locus of a Reaction Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Under mass-action kinetics, complex-balanced systems emerge from biochemical reaction networks and exhibit stable and predictable dynamics. For a reaction network $G$, the associated dynamical system is called $\textit{disguised toric}$ if it can yield a complex-balanced realization on a possibly different network $G_1$. This concept extends the robust properties of toric systems to those that are not inherently toric. In this work, we study the $\textit{disguised toric locus}$ of a reaction network - i.e., the set of positive rate constants that make the corresponding mass-action system disguised toric. Our primary focus is to compute the exact dimension of this locus. We subsequently apply our results to Thomas-type and circadian clock models.</description>

      <title>Asymptically full measure sets of almost-periodic solutions for the NLS equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the global dynamics of solutions to a family of nonlinear Schr\"odinger %(NLS) equations on the circle, with a smooth convolution potential and Gevrey regular initial data. Our main result is the construction of an asymptotically full measure set of time almost-periodic solutions, whose hulls are invariant tori. Specifically, we show that for most choices of the convolution potential there exists a bi-Lipschitz map from a ball in the space of linear solutions to the space of initial data, such that all linear solutions with frequencies satisfying a non-resonance condition are mapped to initial data giving rise to an almost-periodic solution. As a consequence, we establish that the Gevrey norm of many initial data remains approximately constant in time and hence the elliptic fixed point at the origin is Lyapunov statistically stable with respect to such a norm. Furthermore, we construct a Cantor foliation of the phase space, where regions corresponding to positive actions are foliated by invariant maximal tori. This result generalizes the classical KAM theory in the infinite-dimensional setting, providing a statistical description of the global dynamics near the fixed point. Our work suggests that diffusive solutions should be looked for in spaces of lower regularity, in line with recent findings in the theory of Hamiltonian PDEs</description>

Abstract: A key component of transformers is the attention mechanism orchestrating how each token influences the propagation of every other token through a transformer. In this paper we provide a rigorous, mathematical analysis of the asymptotic properties of attention in transformers. Although we present several results based on different assumptions, all of them point to the same conclusion, all tokens asymptotically converge to each other, a phenomenon that has been empirically reported in the literature. Our findings are carefully compared with existing theoretical results and illustrated by simulations and experimental studies using the GPT-2 model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.04449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The question of how Algebra can be used to solve dynamical systems and characterize chaos was first posed in a fertile mathematical context by Ziglin, Morales, Ramis and Sim\'o using differential Galois theory. Their study was aimed at first-order, later higher-order, variational equations of Hamiltonian systems. Recent work by this author formalized a compact yet comprehensive expression of higher-order variationals as one infinite linear system, thereby simplifying the approach. More importantly, the dual of this linear system contains all information relevant to first integrals, regardless of whether the original system is Hamiltonian. This applicability to formal calculation of conserved quantities is the centerpiece of this paper, following an introduction to the requisite context. Three important examples, namely particular cases of Dixon's system, the SIR epidemiological model with vital dynamics and the Van der Pol oscillator, are tackled, and explicit convergent first integrals are provided for the first two.</description>

      <title>Rigged Dynamic Mode Decomposition: Data-Driven Generalized Eigenfunction Decompositions for Koopman Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Rigged Dynamic Mode Decomposition (Rigged DMD) algorithm, which computes generalized eigenfunction decompositions of Koopman operators. By considering the evolution of observables, Koopman operators transform complex nonlinear dynamics into a linear framework suitable for spectral analysis. While powerful, traditional Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) techniques often struggle with continuous spectra. Rigged DMD addresses these challenges with a data-driven methodology that approximates the Koopman operator's resolvent and its generalized eigenfunctions using snapshot data from the system's evolution. At its core, Rigged DMD builds wave-packet approximations for generalized Koopman eigenfunctions and modes by integrating Measure-Preserving Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition with high-order kernels for smoothing. This provides a robust decomposition encompassing both discrete and continuous spectral elements. We derive explicit high-order convergence theorems for generalized eigenfunctions and spectral measures. Additionally, we propose a novel framework for constructing rigged Hilbert spaces using time-delay embedding, significantly extending the algorithm's applicability (Rigged DMD can be used with any rigging). We provide examples, including systems with a Lebesgue spectrum, integrable Hamiltonian systems, the Lorenz system, and a high-Reynolds number lid-driven flow in a two-dimensional square cavity, demonstrating Rigged DMD's convergence, efficiency, and versatility. This work paves the way for future research and applications of decompositions with continuous spectra.</description>

      <title>On the Hausdorff dimension of Weighted Singular Vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a sharp upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension of weighted singular vectors in $\mathbb{R}^m$ using dynamics on homogeneous spaces, specifically the method of integral inequalities. Together with the lower bound proved recently by Kim and Park \cite{KimPark2024}, this determines the Hausdorff dimension of weighted singular vectors, thereby generalizing to arbitrary dimension, the work of Liao, Shi, Solan, and Tamam \cite{LSST}, who determined the Hausdorff dimension of weighted singular vectors in two dimensions. We also provide the first known bounds for the Hausdorff dimension of weighted singular vectors restricted to fractal subsets.</description>

      <title>Maximal equicontinuous factor and minimal map on finitely suslinean continua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of negatively regionally proximal pairs of onto maps which coincides with the set of regionally proximal pair of $f^{-1}$, whenever $f$ is an homeomorphism and we prove the maximal equicontinoues factor for any onto map on a locally connected continuum is monotone. Using this, we prove that if $f$ is a minimal map on a finitely suslinean continua $X$, then $X$ must be a topological circle and $f$ some irrational rotation of circle.</description>

      <title>Decrypting Nonlinearity: Koopman Interpretation and Analysis of Cryptosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12714v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Public-key cryptosystems rely on computationally difficult problems for security, traditionally analyzed using number theory methods. In this paper, we introduce a novel perspective on cryptosystems by viewing the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and the Rivest-Shamir-Adleman cryptosystem as nonlinear dynamical systems. By applying Koopman theory, we transform these dynamical systems into higher-dimensional spaces and analytically derive equivalent purely linear systems. This formulation allows us to reconstruct the secret integers of the cryptosystems through straightforward manipulations, leveraging the tools available for linear systems analysis. Additionally, we establish an upper bound on the minimum lifting dimension required to achieve perfect accuracy. Our results on the required lifting dimension are in line with the intractability of brute-force attacks. To showcase the potential of our approach, we establish connections between our findings and existing results on algorithmic complexity. Furthermore, we extend this methodology to a data-driven context, where the Koopman representation is learned from data samples of the cryptosystems.</description>

      <title>Real eternal PDE solutions are not complex entire: a quadratic parabolic example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06490v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In parabolic or hyperbolic PDEs, solutions which remain uniformly bounded for all real times $t=r\in\mathbb{R}$ are often called PDE entire or eternal. For example, consider the quadratic parabolic PDE \begin{equation*} \label{*} w_t=w_{xx}+6w^2-\lambda, \tag{*} \end{equation*} for $0&lt;x&lt;\tfrac{1}{2}$, under Neumann boundary conditions. By its gradient-like structure, all real eternal non-equilibrium orbits $\Gamma(r)$ of \eqref{*} are heteroclinic among equilibria $w=W_n(x)$. All nontrivial real $W_n$ are rescaled and properly translated real-valued Weierstrass elliptic functions with Morse index $i(W_n)=n$.
  We show that the complex time extensions $\Gamma(r+\mathrm{i}s)$, of analytic real heteroclinic orbits towards $W_0=-\sqrt{\lambda/6}$, are not complex entire. For example, consider the time-reversible complex-valued solution $\psi(s)$ of the nonlinear and nonconservative quadratic Schr\"odinger equation \begin{equation*} \label{**} \mathrm{i}\psi_s=\psi_{xx}+6\psi^2-\lambda \tag{**} \end{equation*} with real initial condition $\psi_0=\Gamma(r_0)$. Then there exist $r_0$ such that $\psi(s)$ blows up at some finite real times $\pm s^*$.
  Abstractly, our results are formulated in the setting of analytic semigroups. They are based on Poincar\'e non-resonance of unstable eigenvalues at equilibria $W_n$, near pitchfork bifurcation. Technically, we have to except a discrete set of $\lambda&gt;0$, and are currently limited to unstable dimensions $n\leq22$, or to fast unstable manifolds of dimensions $d&lt;1+\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}n$.</description>

      <title>Exploring Geometrical Properties of Chaotic Systems Through an Analysis of the Rulkov Neuron Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While extensive research has been conducted on chaos emerging from a dynamical system's temporal dynamics, our research examines extreme sensitivity to initial conditions in discrete-time dynamical systems from a geometrical perspective. Specifically, we develop methods of detecting, classifying, and quantifying geometric structures that lead to chaotic behavior in maps, including certain bifurcations, fractal geometry, strange attractors, multistability, fractal basin boundaries, and Wada basins of attraction. We also develop slow-fast dynamical systems theory for discrete-time systems, with a specific application to modeling the spiking and bursting behavior emerging from the electrophysiology of biological neurons. Our research mainly focuses on two simple low-dimensional slow-fast Rulkov maps, which model both non-chaotic and chaotic spiking-bursting neuronal behavior. We begin by exploring the maps' individual dynamics and parameter spaces, performing bifurcation analyses, describing and quantifying their chaotic dynamics, and modeling an injection of current into them. Then, by putting these neurons into different physical arrangements and coupling them with a flow of current, we find that complex dynamics and geometries emerge from the existence of multistability and final state sensitivity in higher-dimensional state space. We then analyze the complexity and fractalization of these coupled neuron systems' attractors and basin boundaries using our mathematical and computational methods. This paper begins with a conversational introduction to the geometry of chaos, then integrates mathematics, physics, neurobiology, computational modeling, and electrochemistry to present original research that provides a novel perspective on how types of geometrical sensitivity to initial conditions appear in discrete-time neuron systems.</description>

      <title>Relevance of the Basset history term for Lagrangian particle dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01041v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The movement of small but finite spherical particles in a fluid can be described by the Maxey-Riley equation (MRE) if they are too large to be considered passive tracers. The MRE contains an integral "history term" modeling wake effects, which causes the force acting on a particle at some given time to depend on its full past trajectory. The history term causes complications in the numerical solution of the MRE and is therefore often neglected, despite both numerical and experimental evidence that its effects are generally not negligible. By numerically computing trajectories with and without the history term of a large number of particles in different flow fields, we investigate its impact on the large-scale Lagrangian dynamics of simulated particles. We show that for moderate to large Stokes numbers, ignoring the history term leads to significant differences in clustering patterns. Furthermore, we compute finite-time Lyapunov exponents and show that, even for small particles, the differences in the resulting scalar field from ignoring the BHT can be significant, in particular if the underlying flow is turbulent.</description>

      <title>Infinite graph product of groups I: Geometry of the extension graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the extension graph of graph product of groups and study its geometry. This enables us to study properties of graph product by exploiting large scale geometry of its defining graph. In particular, we show that the extension graph is isomorphic to the crossing graph of a canonical quasi-median graph and exhibits the same phenomenon about asymptotic dimension as quasi-trees of metric spaces studied by Bestvina-Bromberg-Fujiwara. As an application of the extension graph, we prove relative hyperbolicity of graph-wreath product. This provides a new construction of relatively hyperbolic groups.</description>
