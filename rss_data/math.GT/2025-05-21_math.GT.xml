      <title>Computation of the knot Floer complex of knots of thickness one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and implement an algorithm that computes the full knot Floer complex of knots of thickness one. As an application, by extending this algorithm to certain knots of thickness two, we show that all but finitely many non-integral Dehn surgery slopes are characterizing for most knots with up to 17 crossings.</description>

      <title>A 2-torsion invariant of 2-knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe what should perhaps be called a `type-2' Vassiliev invariant of knots S^2 -&gt; S^4. We give a formula for an invariant of 2-knots, taking values in Z_2 that can be computed in terms of the double-point diagram of the knot. The double-point diagram is a collection of curves and diffeomorphisms of curves, in the domain S^2, that describe the crossing data with respect to a projection, analogous to a chord diagram for a projection of a classical knot S^1 -&gt; S^3. Our formula turns the computation of the invariant into a planar geometry problem. More generally, we describe a numerical invariant of families of knots S^j -&gt; S^n, for all n &gt;= j+2 and j &gt;= 1. In the co-dimension two case n=j+2 the invariant is an isotopy invariant, and either takes values in Z or Z_2 depending on a parity issue.</description>

      <title>Distinguishing closed 4-manifolds by slicing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One approach to produce a pair of homeomorphic-but-not-diffeomophic closed 4-manifolds is to find a knot which is smoothly slice in one but not the other. This approach has never been run successfully. We give the first examples of a pair of closed 4-manifolds with the same integer cohomology ring where the diffeomorphism type is distinguished by this approach. Along the way, we produce the first examples of 4-manifolds with nonvanishing Seiberg-Witten invariants and the same integer cohomology as $\mathbb{C}P^2\#\overline{\mathbb{C}P^2}$ which are not diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{C}P^2\#\overline{\mathbb{C}P^2}$. We also give a simple new construction of a 4-manifold which is homeomorphic-but-not-diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{C}P^2\#5\overline{\mathbb{C}P^2}$.</description>

      <title>Geometry on curves passing through Whitney umbrella</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study geometry on curves passing through a Whitney umbrella by using a Darboux frame along it. We define three invariants by using Frenet-Serre type formula relating to the geodesic curvature, the normal curvature, and the geodesic torsion. We investigate the degrees of divergence and the top-terms of these invariants and their geometric meanings. We also consider a developable surface along the curve.</description>

      <title>EuLearn: A 3D database for learning Euler characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present EuLearn, the first surface datasets equitably representing a diversity of topological types. We designed our embedded surfaces of uniformly varying genera relying on random knots, thus allowing our surfaces to knot with themselves. EuLearn contributes new topological datasets of meshes, point clouds, and scalar fields in 3D. We aim to facilitate the training of machine learning systems that can discern topological features. We experimented with specific emblematic 3D neural network architectures, finding that their vanilla implementations perform poorly on genus classification. To enhance performance, we developed a novel, non-Euclidean, statistical sampling method adapted to graph and manifold data. We also introduce adjacency-informed adaptations of PointNet and Transformer architectures that rely on our non-Euclidean sampling strategy. Our results demonstrate that incorporating topological information into deep learning workflows significantly improves performance on these otherwise challenging EuLearn datasets.</description>

      <title>The Last Three T-degrees in Triply-Graded Link Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the structure of reduced triply graded link homology $\overline{\mathrm{HHH}}$ in the top/bottom three $T-$degrees for links arising as closures of positive/negative braids. Using a diagrammatic approach to the Hochschild cohomology of Soergel bimodules, we provide explicit computations of $\overline{\mathrm{HHH}}$ as $R-$modules in these degrees. Our results reveal that the homology here is often zero, especially in the negative braid case, and display striking uniformity.</description>

      <title>Separatrix configurations in holomorphic flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of boundary orbits (separatrices) of basins of simple equilibria and global elliptic sectors in holomorphic flows with real time. We elucidate whether a blow-up scenario provides an appropriate characterization of separatrices. The continuity of transit times along the boundaries of open, flow-invariant subsets, which we establish in this paper, acts as the central tool in deriving the following three main results: First, we prove that the boundary of basins of centers is entirely composed of double-sided separatrices (blow-up in finite positive and finite negative time). Second, we show that boundary orbits of node and focus basins exhibit finite-time blow-up in the same time direction in which the orbits within the basin tend towards the equilibrium. Additionally, we provide a counterexample to the claim in Theorem 4.3 (3) in [The structure of sectors of zeros of entire flows, K. Broughan (2003)], demonstrating that such a blow-up does not necessarily have to occur in both time directions. Third, we describe the boundary structure of global elliptic sectors. It consists of the multiple equilibrium, one incoming and one outgoing separatrix attached to it, and at most countably many double-sided separatrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02417v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In my 1993 paper, "Pappus's Theorem and the Modular Group", I explained how the iteration of Pappus's Theorem gives rise to a $2$-parameter family of representations of the modular group into the group of projective automorphisms. In this paper we realize these representations as isometry groups of patterns of geodesics in the symmetric space $X=SL_3(\R)/SO(3)$. The patterns have the same asymptotic structure as the geodesics in the Farey triangulation, so our construction gives a $2$ parameter family of deformations of the Farey triangulation inside $X$. We also describe a bending phenomenon associated to these patterns.</description>

      <title>Embeddable of hieroglyphs into torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08692v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are interested in finding combinatorial criteria for embedding graphs into torus and using them in the embedding check algorithm. It is a well-known fact that any connected graph can be reduced to a one-vertex graph with loops and is homotopy equivalent to such a graph. If a connected graph has intersection of some edges, then some loops of one-vertex graph will also intersect. Therefore the problem of embedding graphs in some surface is equivalent to the question of embedding one-vertex graph in given surface. This paper considers a graph with rotation structure (not necessarily geometric) or rotation graph called hieroglyph. The equivalence of four conditions is proved: (1) embedding hieroglyph in the torus; (2) the absence of forbidden subgraphs in a hieroglyph; (3) some condition for the graph of loops; (4) the existence of a reduction of hieroglyph to one of the list of hieroglyphs. We also prove the existence of an algorithm with complexity $\mathcal{O}(n)$ that recognizes embedding hieroglyph in the torus.</description>

      <title>Quantum Phase diagrams and transitions for Chern topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological invariants such as Chern classes are by now a standard way to classify topological phases. Introducing and varying parameters in such systems leads to phase diagrams, where the Chern classes may jump when crossing a critical locus. These systems appear naturally when considering slicing of higher dimensional systems or when considering systems with parameters. As the Chern classes are topological invariants, they can only change if the "topology breaks down". We give a precise mathematical formulation of this phenomenon and show that synthetically any phase diagram of Chern topological phases can be designed and realized by a physical system, using covering, aka. winding maps. Here we provide explicit families realizing arbitrary Chern jumps. The critical locus of these maps is described by the classical rose curves. These realize the lower bound on the number of Dirac points necessary obtained from viewing them as local charges. We treat several concrete models and show that they have the predicted generic behavior. In particular, we focus on different types of lattices and tight-binding models, and show that effective winding maps, and thus higher Chern numbers, can be achieved using k-th nearest neighbors. We give explicit formulas for a family of 2D lattices using imaginary quadratic field extensions and their norms. Our study includes the square, triangular, honeycomb and Kagome lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compare eight versions of finite-dimensional categorifications of the colored Jones polynomial and show that they yield isomorphic results over a field of characteristic zero. As an application, we verify a physics-motivated conjectural formula for colored superpolynomials based on Poincar\'e polynomials of the Khovanov homology of cables. We also obtain a conjectural closed formula for the Poincar\'e series of the skein lasagna module of $\overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$. Accompanying this note is an online database of colored superpolynomials.</description>

      <title>Counting totally real units and eigenvalue patterns in $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb Z)$ and $\rm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb Z)$ along thin tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fix a vector $(v=(v_1,\dots ,v_n)$ with $v_1&gt;\cdots&gt;v_n$ and $\sum v_i=0$, and let $B_\varepsilon(Tv)$ be the $\varepsilon$-ball around $Tv$ for $T&gt;1$. As $T\to\infty$, (1) the number of degree-$n$ totally real units whose logarithmic embeddings lie in $B_\varepsilon(Tv)$, and (2) the number of eigenvalue patterns of $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb Z)$ whose logarithmic embeddings lie in $B_\varepsilon(Tv)$, both grow like $$\exp\left(\rho_{\rm{SL}_n}(v)\,T\right)$$ where $ \rho_{\rm{SL}_n}(v)=\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}(n-i)\,v_i$ is the half-sum of positive roots of $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb R)$. Hence the two arithmetic problems share the same "directional entropy". Because each eigenvalue pattern determines an $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb R)$-conjugacy class, this yields a lower bound of order $\exp\left(\rho_{\rm{SL}_n}(v)T\right)$ for the number of $\rm{SL}_n(\mathbb Z)$-conjugacy classes with a prescribed eigenvalue pattern; we also obtain an upper bound of order $\exp \left(2\rho_{\rm{SL}_n}(v)T\right)$. A parallel argument for the symplectic lattice $\rm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb Z)$ and $v=(v_1,\dots ,v_n,-v_n,\dots ,-v_1), v_1&gt;\cdots&gt;v_n&gt;0,$ gives growth $\exp\left(\rho_{\rm{Sp}_{2n}}(v)T\right)$ with $\rho_{\rm{Sp}_{2n}}(v)=\sum_{i=1}^n(n+1-i)v_i$, the half-sum of positive roots of $\rm{Sp}_{2n}(\mathbb R)$.</description>
