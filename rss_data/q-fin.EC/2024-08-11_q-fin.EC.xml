      <title>Lower bounds of uncertainty and upper limits on the accuracy of forecasts of macroeconomic variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the randomness of values and volumes of market deals as a major factor that describes lower bounds of uncertainty and upper limits on the accuracy of the forecasts of macroeconomic variables, prices, and returns. We introduce random macroeconomic variables, whose average values coincide with usual macroeconomic variables, and describe their uncertainty by coefficients of variation that depend on the volatilities, correlations, and coefficients of variation of random values or volumes of trades. The same approach describes bounds of uncertainty and limits on the accuracy of forecasts for growth rates, inflation, interest rates, etc. Limits on the accuracy of forecasts of macroeconomic variables depend on the certainty of predictions of their probabilities. The number of predicted statistical moments determines the veracity of macroeconomic probability. To quantify macroeconomic 2nd statistical moments, one needs additional econometric methodologies, data, and calculations of variables determined as sums of squares of values or volumes of market trades. Forecasting of macroeconomic 2nd statistical moments requires 2nd order economic theories. All of that is absent and for many years to come, the accuracy of forecasts of the probabilities of random macroeconomic variables, prices, and returns will be limited by the Gaussian approximations, which are determined by the first two statistical moments.</description>

      <title>Relationships between six cultural scales and ten ageism dimensions: Correlation analysis using data from 31 countries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the aging of the world accelerates, clarifying the relationship between cultural differences and ageism is an urgent issue. Therefore, in this study, we conducted a correlation analysis between the six cultural scales of Hofstede et al. [1] and the 10 ageism scales calculated from data on 35,232 people from 31 countries included in the World Values Survey Wave 6 by Inglehart et al. [2]. The results of a partial correlation analysis controlling for economic and demographic factors showed that the cultural scales were correlated with ageism. This is the first study to show that diverse cultural scales are related to multiple dimensions of ageism.</description>

      <title>Democratic Favor Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large body of literature in economics and political science examines the impact of democracy and political freedoms on various outcomes using cross-country comparisons. This paper explores the possibility that any positive impact of democracy observed in these studies might be attributed to powerful democratic nations, their allies, and international organizations treating democracies more favorably than nondemocracies, a concept I refer to as democratic favor channel. Firstly, after I control for being targeted by sanctions from G7 or the United Nations and having military confrontations and cooperation with the West, most of the positive effects of democracy on growth in cross-country panel regressions become insignificant or negatively significant. Secondly, using the same empirical specification as this literature for demonstrating intermediating forces, I show that getting sanctioned, militarily attacked, and not having defense cooperation with the West are plausible channels through which democracy causes growth. Lastly, in the pre-Soviet-collapse period, which coincides with the time when democracy promotion was less often used as a justification for sanctions, the impact of democracy on GDP per capita is already weak or negative without any additional controls, and it becomes further negative once democratic favor is controlled. These findings support the democratic favor channel and challenge the idea that the institutional qualities of democracy per se lead to desirable outcomes. The critique provided in this paper applies to the broader comparative institutions literature in social sciences and political philosophy.</description>

      <title>The Economic Analysis of the Common Pool Method through the HARA Utility Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water market is a contemporary marketplace for water trading and is deemed to one of the most efficient instruments to improve the social welfare. In modern water markets, the two widely used trading systems are an improved pair-wise trading, and a 'smart market' or common pool method. In comparison with the economic model, this paper constructs a conceptual mathematic model through the HARA utility functions. Mirroring the concepts such as Nash Equilibrium, Pareto optimal and stable matching in economy, three significant propositions are acquired which illustrate the advantages of the common pool method compared with the improved pair-wise trading.</description>

      <title>Redefining Accountability: Navigating Legal Challenges of Participant Liability in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the digital era, where innovative technologies like blockchain are revolutionizing traditional organizational paradigms, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) emerge as avant-garde models of collective governance. However, their unique structure challenges existing legal frameworks, especially concerning the liability of participants. This study focuses on analyzing the legal implications of the decentralized nature of DAOs, with a particular emphasis on the aspects of participant liability. Such considerations are essential for understanding how current legal systems might be adapted or reformed to effectively address these novel challenges.
  The paper examines the specificity of DAOs, highlighting their decentralized governance structure and reliance on smart contracts, which introduce unique issues related to the blurring of liability boundaries. It underscores how the anonymity of DAO participants and the automatic execution of smart contracts complicate the traditional concept of legal liability, both within the DAO context and in interactions with external parties.
  The analysis also includes a comparison between DAOs and traditional organizational forms, such as corporations and associations, to identify potential analogies and differences in participant liability. It explores how existing regulations on partner liability might be insufficient or inapplicable in the DAO context, prompting the search for new, innovative legal solutions.</description>
