      <title>Local structure theory of Einstein manifolds with boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study local structure of the moduli space of compact Einstein metrics with respect to the boundary conformal metric and mean curvature. In dimension three, we confirm M. Anderson's conjecture in a strong sense, showing that the map from Einstein metrics to such boundary data is generically a local diffeomorphism. In dimensions greater than three, we obtain similar results for Ricci flat metrics and negative Einstein metrics under new non-degenerate boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>The 4-Planes of Spin(7) Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the geometric structures and properties of 8-dimensional manifolds with Spin(7)-holonomy. We focus on the characterization and implications of 4-planes within these manifolds, which are endowed with an almost symplectic structure compatible with the Spin(7)-structure. We provide a detailed analysis of the differential forms defining these structures, including the Cayley 4-form and its stabilization under the Spin(7) group actions. Furthermore, we explore the concept of mirror duality within the context of exceptional holonomy, elucidating the relationship between dual structures and their topological constraints. By examining the conditions under which mirror duality arises, we enhance the understanding of the interplay between Spin(7)-structures and symplectic geometry. This endeavor contributes to our deeper understanding of the intricate symmetries and topological properties of these remarkable manifolds.</description>

      <title>First Eigenvalue of Jacobi operator and Rigidity Results for Constant Mean Curvature Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain geometric upper bounds for the first eigenvalue $\lambda_1^J$ of the Jacobi operator for both closed and compact with boundary hypersurfaces having constant mean curvature (CMC). As an application, we derive new rigidity results for the area of CMC hypersurfaces under suitable conditions on $\lambda_1^J$ and the curvature of the ambient space. We also address the Jacobi-Steklov problem, proving geometric upper bounds for its first eigenvalue $\sigma_1^J$ and deriving rigidity results related to the length of the boundary. Additionally, we present some results in higher dimensions related to the Yamabe invariants.</description>

      <title>Diameter estimates in K\"ahler geometry II: removing the small degeneracy assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we remove the small degeneracy assumption in our earlier works [10, 11]. This is achieved by a technical improvement of Corollary 5.1 in [10]. As a consequence, we establish the same geometric estimates for diameter, Green's functions and Sobolev inequalities under an entropy bound for the K\"ahler metrics, without any small degeneracy assumption.</description>

      <title>Minimal hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{S}^{4}(1)$ by doubling the equatorial $\mathbb{S}^{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For each large enough $m\in\mathbb{N}$ we construct by PDE gluing methods a closed embedded minimal hypersurface ${\breve{M}_m}$ doubling the equatorial three-sphere $\mathbb{S}_{eq}^3$ in $\mathbb{S}^4(1)$, with ${\breve{M}_m}$ containing $m^2$ bridges modelled after the three-dimensional catenoid and centered at the points of a square $m\times m$ lattice $L$ contained in the Clifford torus $\mathbb{T}^2\subset \mathbb{S}_{eq}^3$. The construction respects the symmetries of the lattice $L$ as a subset of $\mathbb{S}^4(1)$ and is based on the Linearized Doubling (LD) methodology which was first introduced in the construction of minimal surface doublings of $\mathbb{S}_{eq}^2$ in $\mathbb{S}^3(1)$.</description>

      <title>Thom's gradient conjecture for nonlinear evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: R. Thom's gradient conjecture states that if a gradient flow of an analytic function converges to a limit, it does so along a unique limiting direction. In this paper, we extend and settle this conjecture in the context of infinite dimensional problems. Building on the foundational works of {\L}ojasiewicz, L. Simon, and the resolution of the conjecture for finite dimensional cases by Kurdyka-Mostowski-Parusinski, we focus on nonlinear evolutions on Riemannian manifolds as studied by L. Simon. This framework includes geometric PDEs such as minimal surface, harmonic map, mean curvature flow, and normalized Yamabe flow. Our main result not only confirms the uniqueness of the limiting direction but also characterizes the rate of convergence and possible limiting directions for both classical and infinite dimensional settings.</description>

      <title>Projective structures and Hodge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every compact Riemann surface $X$ admits a natural projective structure $p_u$ as a consequence of the uniformization theorem. In this work we describe the construction of another natural projective structure on $X$, namely the Hodge projective structure $p_h$, related to the second fundamental form of the period map. We then describe how projective structures correspond to $(1,1)$-differential forms on the moduli space of projective curves and, from this correspondence, we deduce that $p_u$ and $p_h$ are not the same structure.</description>

      <title>Discrete connections on principal bundles: the Discrete Atiyah Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.06843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.06843v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we study discrete analogues of an exact sequence of vector bundles introduced by M. Atiyah in 1957, associated to any smooth principal $G$-bundle $\pi:Q\rightarrow Q/G$. In the original setting, the splittings of the exact sequence correspond to connections on the principal bundle $\pi$. The discrete analogues that we consider here can be studied in two different categories: the category of fiber bundles with a (chosen) section, FBS, and the category of local Lie groupoids, lLgpdC. In FBS we find a correspondence between a) (semi-local) splittings of the discrete Atiyah sequence (DAS) of $\pi$, b) discrete connections on the same bundle $\pi$, and c) isomorphisms of the DAS with certain fiber product extensions in FBS. We see that the right splittings of the DAS (in FBS) are not necessarily right splittings in lLgpdC: we use this obstruction to define the discrete curvature of a discrete connection. Then, there is a correspondence between the splittings of the DAS in lLgpdC and discrete connections with trivial discrete curvature. We also introduce a semidirect product between (some) local Lie groupoids and prove that there is a correspondence between semidirect product extensions and splittings of the DAS in lLgpdC.</description>

      <title>New spectral Bishop-Gromov and Bonnet-Myers theorems and applications to isoperimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show a sharp and rigid spectral generalization of the classical Bishop-Gromov volume comparison theorem: if a closed Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ of dimension $n\geqslant 3$ satisfies \[ \lambda_1\left(-\frac{n-1}{n-2}\Delta+\mathrm{Ric}\right)\geqslant n-1,\] then $\operatorname{vol}(M)\leqslant \operatorname{vol}(\mathbb S^{n})$, and $\pi_1(M)$ is finite. Moreover, the constant $\frac{n-1}{n-2}$ cannot be improved, and if $\operatorname{vol}(M)=\operatorname{vol}(\mathbb S^n)$ holds, then $M\cong \mathbb S^{n}$. A sharp generalization of the Bonnet-Myers theorem is also shown under the same spectral condition. The proofs involve the use of a new unequally weighted isoperimetric problem, and unequally warped $\mu$-bubbles. As an application, in dimensions $3\leqslant n\leqslant 5$, we infer sharp results on the isoperimetric structure at infinity of complete manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature and uniformly positive spectral biRicci curvature.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Power Theory Revisited with Classical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper revisits the concepts of instantaneous active and reactive powers and provides a novel definition for basic circuit elements based on quantities utilized in classical mechanics, such as absolute and relative velocity, momentum density, angular momentum and apparent forces. The discussion leverages from recent publications by the authors that interpret the voltage and current as velocities in generalized Lagrangian coordinates. The main result of the paper is a general and compact expression for the instantaneous active and reactive power of inductances, capacitances and resistances as a multivector proportional to the generalized kinetic energy and the geometric frequency multivector. Several numerical examples considering stationary and transient sinusoidal and non-sinusoidal conditions are discussed in the case study.</description>
