      <title>A tutorial for mesoscale computer simulations of lipid membranes: tether pulling, tubulation and fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lipid membranes and membrane deformations are a long-standing area of research in soft matter and biophysics. Computer simulations have complemented analytical and experimental approaches as one of the pillars in the field. However, setting up and using membrane simulations can come with barriers due to the multidisciplinary effort involved and the vast choice of existing simulations models. In this review, we introduce the non-expert reader to coarse-grained membrane simulations (CGMS) at the mesoscale. Firstly, we give a concise overview of the modelling approaches to study fluid membranes, together with guidance to more specialized references. Secondly, we provide a conceptual guide on how to develop CGMS. Lastly, we construct a hands-on tutorial on how to apply CGMS, by providing a pedagogical examination of tether pulling, tubulation and fluctuations with three different membrane models, and discussing them in terms of their scope and how resource-intensive they are. To ease the reader's venture into the field, we provide a repository with ready-to-run tutorials.</description>

      <title>Landscapes and nonequilibrium fluctuations of eukaryotic gene regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay among processes that occur over different timescales is a challenging issue in the physics of systems regulation. In gene regulation, the timescales for changes in chromatin states can differ from those for changes in the concentration of product protein, raising questions about how to understand their coupled dynamics. In this study, we examine the effects of these different timescales on eukaryotic gene regulation using a stochastic model that describes the landscapes and probability currents of nonequilibrium fluctuations. This model shows that slow, nonadiabatic transitions of chromatin states significantly impact gene-regulation dynamics. The simulated circular flow of the probability currents indicates a maximum entropy production when the rates of chromatin-state transitions are low in the intensely nonadiabatic regime. In the mildly nonadiabatic regime, this circular flow fosters hysteresis, suggesting that changes in chromatin states precede changes in transcription activity. Furthermore, calculations using a model of a circuit involving three core genes in mouse embryonic stem cells illustrate how multilayer regulation of chromatin, or deep epigenetic regulation, can flexibly tune fluctuations in individual genes. These findings highlight the rich effects of nonadiabatic chromatin-state transitions on gene regulation in eukaryotic cells.</description>

      <title>The allosteric lever: towards a principle of specific allosteric response</title>

Abstract: Allostery, the phenomenon by which the perturbation of a molecule at one site alters its behavior at a remote functional site, enables control over biomolecular function. Allosteric modulation is a promising avenue for drug discovery and is employed in the design of mechanical metamaterials. However, a general principle of allostery, i.e. a set of quantitative and transferable "ground rules", remains elusive. It is neither a set of structural motifs nor intrinsic motions. Focusing on elastic network models, we here show that an allosteric lever -- a mode-coupling pattern induced by the perturbation -- governs the directional, source-to-target, allosteric communication: a structural perturbation of an allosteric site couples the excitation of localized hard elastic modes with concerted long range soft-mode relaxation. Perturbations of non-allosteric sites instead couple hard and soft modes uniformly. The allosteric response is shown to be generally non-linear and non-reciprocal, and allows for minimal structural distortions to be efficiently transmitted to specific changes at distant sites. Allosteric levers exist in proteins and "pseudoproteins" -- networks designed to display an allosteric response. Interestingly, protein sequences that constitute allosteric transmission channels are shown to be evolutionarily conserved. To illustrate how the results may be applied in drug design, we use them to successfully predict known allosteric sites in proteins.</description>

      <title>Memory in neural activity: long-range order without criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ''criticality hypothesis'', based on observed scale-free correlations in neural activity, posits that the brain operates at a critical point of transition between two phases. However, the validity of this hypothesis is still debated. Here, using a commonly used model of cortical dynamics, we find that a phase of long-range order (LRO) in neural activity may be induced by memory (time non-locality) without invoking criticality. The cortical dynamics model contains fast and slow time scales that govern the neural and resource (memory) dynamics, respectively. When the resource dynamics are sufficiently slow, we observe an LRO phase, which manifests in avalanche size and duration probability distributions that are scale-free and satisfy finite-size scaling. When the slow and fast time scales are no longer sufficiently distinct, LRO is destroyed. Since this LRO phase spans a wide range of parameters, it is robust against perturbations, unlike critical systems.</description>

      <title>Multicomponent mixtures exhibit a vast nucleation-and-growth regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixtures of many interacting components can exhibit numerous coexisting droplet types. An exciting example is the cytosol of biological cells, where diverse droplets called condensates are indispensable for cellular function, but it is currently unclear how much their formation is restricted by thermodynamics. Interestingly, linear stability analysis predicts that homogeneous mixtures become more stable with increasing component count. In contrast, we show via numerical simulations and analytical scaling laws that equilibrium states typically contain many coexisting droplets. Combining both results suggests that generic multicomponent mixtures can sustain many stable states with various droplet counts, generalizing the nucleation-and-growth regime of binary mixtures. Our theory also indicates why cells exhibit much fewer condensates than components and how multistability could be leveraged to form condensates independently.</description>

      <title>Rhythmic sharing: A bio-inspired paradigm for zero-shot adaptation and learning in neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brain can rapidly adapt to new contexts and learn from limited data, a coveted characteristic that artificial intelligence algorithms have struggled to mimic. Inspired by oscillatory rhythms of the mechanical structures of neural cells, we developed a learning paradigm that is based on oscillations in link strengths and associates learning with the coordination of these oscillations. We find that this paradigm yields rapid adaptation and learning in artificial neural networks. Link oscillations can rapidly change coordination, endowing the network with the ability to sense subtle context changes in an unsupervised manner. In other words, the network generates the missing contextual tokens required to perform as a generalist AI architecture capable of predicting dynamics in multiple contexts. Oscillations also allow the network to extrapolate dynamics to never-seen-before contexts. These capabilities make our learning paradigm a powerful starting point for novel models of learning and cognition. Furthermore, learning through link coordination is agnostic to the specifics of the neural network architecture, hence our study opens the door for introducing rapid adaptation and learning capabilities into leading AI models.</description>
