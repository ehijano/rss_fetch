      <title>On unclosed mappings with Poletsky inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manuscript is devoted to the boundary behavior of mappings with bounded and finite distortion. We consider mappings of domains of the Euclidean space that satisfy weighted Poletsky inequality. Assume that, the definition domain is finitely connected on its boundary and, in addition, on the set of all points which are pre-images of the cluster set of this boundary. Then the specified mappings have a continuous boundary extension provided that the majorant in the Poletsky inequality satisfies some integral divergence condition, or has a finite mean oscillation at every boundary point.</description>

      <title>Korenblum's principle for Bergman spaces with radial weights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14699v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the Korenblum maximum (domination) principle is valid for weighted Bergman spaces $A^p_w$ with arbitrary (non-negative and integrable) radial weights $w$ in the case $1\le p&lt;\infty$. We also notice that in every weighted Bergman space the supremum of all radii for which the principle holds is strictly smaller than one. Under the mild additional assumption $\liminf_{r\to 0^+} w(r)&gt;0$, we show that the principle fails whenever $0&lt;p&lt;1$.</description>

      <title>Zero distributions of derivatives of polynomial families centering on a set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose $C \subset \mathbb{C}$ is compact. Let $q_k$ be a sequence of polynomials of degree $n_k \to \infty$, such that the locus of roots of all the polynomials is bounded, and the number of roots of $q_k$ in any closed set $L$ not meeting $C$ is uniformly bounded. Supposing that $(q_k)_k$ has an asymptotic root distribution $\mu$ we provide conditions on $C$ and $\mu$ assuring the sequence of $m$th derivatives $(q_k^{(m)})_k$ also has asymptotic root distribution $\mu$ for any $m\geq 1$. This complements recent results of Totik.</description>

      <title>Eremenko's conjecture, wandering Lakes of Wada, and maverick points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.10256v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general technique for realising full closed subsets of the complex plane as wandering sets of entire functions. Using this construction, we solve a number of open problems.
  (1) We construct a counterexample to Eremenko's conjecture, a central problem in transcendental dynamics that asks whether every connected component of the set of escaping points of a transcendental entire function is unbounded.
  (2) We prove that there is a transcendental entire function for which infinitely many Fatou components share the same boundary. This resolves the long-standing problem whether "Lakes of Wada continua" can arise in complex dynamics, and answers the analogue of a question of Fatou from 1920 concerning Fatou components of rational functions.
  (3) We answer a question of Rippon concerning the existence of non-escaping points on the boundary of a bounded escaping wandering domain, that is, a wandering Fatou component contained in the escaping set. In fact we show that the set of such points can have positive Lebesgue measure.
  (4) We give the first example of an entire function having a simply connected Fatou component whose closure has a disconnected complement, answering a question of Boc Thaler.
  In view of (3), we introduce the concept of "maverick points": points on the boundary of a wandering domain whose accumulation behaviour differs from that of internal points. We prove that the set of such points has harmonic measure zero, but that both escaping and oscillating wandering domains can contain large sets of maverick points.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross
