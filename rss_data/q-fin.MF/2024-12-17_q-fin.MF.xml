      <title>Continuous-time optimal investment with portfolio constraints: a reinforcement learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a reinforcement learning (RL) framework, we study the exploratory version of the continuous time expected utility (EU) maximization problem with a portfolio constraint that includes widely-used financial regulations such as short-selling constraints and borrowing prohibition. The optimal feedback policy of the exploratory unconstrained classical EU problem is shown to be Gaussian. In the case where the portfolio weight is constrained to a given interval, the corresponding constrained optimal exploratory policy follows a truncated Gaussian distribution. We verify that the closed form optimal solution obtained for logarithmic utility and quadratic utility for both unconstrained and constrained situations converge to the non-exploratory expected utility counterpart when the exploration weight goes to zero. Finally, we establish a policy improvement theorem and devise an implementable reinforcement learning algorithm by casting the optimal problem in a martingale framework. Our numerical examples show that exploration leads to an optimal wealth process that is more dispersedly distributed with heavier tail compared to that of the case without exploration. This effect becomes less significant as the exploration parameter is smaller. Moreover, the numerical implementation also confirms the intuitive understanding that a broader domain of investment opportunities necessitates a higher exploration cost. Notably, when subjected to both short-selling and money borrowing constraints, the exploration cost becomes negligible compared to the unconstrained case.</description>

      <title>Simulation of square-root processes made simple: applications to the Heston model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a simple, efficient and accurate nonnegative preserving numerical scheme for simulating the square-root process. The novel idea is to simulate the integrated square-root process first instead of the square-root process itself. Numerical experiments on realistic parameter sets, applied for the integrated process and the Heston model, display high precision with a very low number of time steps. As a bonus, our scheme yields the exact limiting Inverse Gaussian distributions of the integrated square-root process with only one single time-step in two scenarios: (i) for high mean-reversion and volatility-of-volatility regimes, regardless of maturity; and (ii) for long maturities, independent of the other parameters.</description>

      <title>Self-Exciting Random Evolutions (SEREs) and their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of a new so-called self-exciting random evolutions (SEREs) and their applications. We introduce a new random process $x(t)$ such that it is based on a superposition of a Markov chain $x_n$ and a Hawkes process $N(t)$; i.e., $x(t) := x_{N(t)}$. We call this process self-walking imbedded semi-Hawkes process (Swish Process or SwishP). Then the self-exciting REs (SEREs) can be constructed in similar way as, e.g., semi-Markov REs, but instead of semi-Markov process $x(t)$ we have SwishP. We give classifications and examples of self-exciting REs (SEREs). Then we consider limit theorems for SEREs such as averaging, diffusion approximation, normal deviations and rates of convergence of SEREs. Applications of SEREs are devoted to the so-called self-exciting traffic/transport process and self-exciting summation on a Markov chain, which are examples of continuous and discrete SERE, respectively. From these processes we can construct many other self-exciting processes, e.g., such as impulse traffic/transport process, self-exciting risk process, etc. We present averaged, diffusion and normal deviated self-exciting processes. Rates of convergence in these cases are presented as well. The originality and novelty of the paper associated with new features of REs and their many applications, namely, self-exciting and clustering effects.</description>

      <title>Stochastic optimal self-path-dependent control: A new type of variational inequality and its viscosity solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a new class of stochastic control problems characterized by specific control constraints. Specifically, the admissible controls are subject to the ratcheting constraint, meaning they must be non-decreasing over time and are thus self-path-dependent. This type of problems is common in various practical applications, such as optimal consumption problems in financial engineering and optimal dividend payout problems in actuarial science. Traditional stochastic control theory does not readily apply to these problems due to their unique self-path-dependent control feature. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new class of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations, which are variational inequalities concerning the derivative of a new spatial argument that represents the historical maximum control value. Under the standard Lipschitz continuity condition, we demonstrate that the value functions for these self-path-dependent control problems are the unique solutions to their corresponding HJB equations in the viscosity sense.</description>

      <title>Joint SPX-VIX calibration with Gaussian polynomial volatility models: deep pricing with quantization hints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.08297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the joint SPX-VIX calibration within a general class of Gaussian polynomial volatility models in which the volatility of the SPX is assumed to be a polynomial function of a Gaussian Volterra process defined as a stochastic convolution between a kernel and a Brownian motion. By performing joint calibration to daily SPX-VIX implied volatility surface data between 2012 and 2022, we compare the empirical performance of different kernels and their associated Markovian and non-Markovian models, such as rough and non-rough path-dependent volatility models. In order to ensure an efficient calibration and a fair comparison between the models, we develop a generic unified method in our class of models for fast and accurate pricing of SPX and VIX derivatives based on functional quantization and Neural Networks. For the first time, we identify a \textit{conventional one-factor Markovian continuous stochastic volatility model} that is able to achieve remarkable fits of the implied volatility surfaces of the SPX and VIX together with the term structure of VIX futures. What is even more remarkable is that our conventional one-factor Markovian continuous stochastic volatility model outperforms, in all market conditions, its rough and
  non-rough path-dependent counterparts with the same number of parameters.</description>

      <title>Worst-Case Optimal Investment in Incomplete Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study and solve the worst-case optimal portfolio problem as pioneered by Korn and Wilmott (2002) of an investor with logarithmic preferences facing the possibility of a market crash with stochastic market coefficients by enhancing the martingale approach developed by Seifried in 2010. With the help of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs), we are able to characterize the resulting indifference optimal strategies in a fairly general setting. We also deal with the question of existence of those indifference strategies for market models with an unbounded market price of risk. We therefore solve the corresponding BSDEs via solving their associated PDEs using a utility crash-exposure transformation. Our approach is subsequently demonstrated for Heston's stochastic volatility model, Bates' stochastic volatility model including jumps, and Kim-Omberg's model for a stochastic excess return.</description>

      <title>Subleading correction to the Asian options volatility in the Black-Scholes model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The short maturity limit $T\to 0$ for the implied volatility of an Asian option in the Black-Scholes model is determined by the large deviations property for the time-average of the geometric Brownian motion. In this note we derive the subleading $O(T)$ correction to this implied volatility, using an asymptotic expansion for the Hartman-Watson distribution. The result is used to compute subleading corrections to Asian options prices in a small maturity expansion, sharpening the leading order result obtained using large deviations theory. We demonstrate good numerical agreement with precise benchmarks for Asian options pricing in the Black-Scholes model.</description>

      <title>Capital Asset Pricing Model with Size Factor and Normalizing by Volatility Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19444v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) relates a well-diversified stock portfolio to a benchmark portfolio. We insert size effect in CAPM, capturing the observation that small stocks have higher risk and return than large stocks, on average. Dividing stock index returns by the Volatility Index makes them independent and normal. In this article, we combine these ideas to create a new discrete-time model, which includes volatility, relative size, and CAPM. We fit this model using real-world data, prove the long-term stability, and connect this research to Stochastic Portfolio Theory. We fill important gaps in our previous article on CAPM with the size factor.</description>

      <title>Optimal investment with insider information using Skorokhod &amp; Russo-Vallois integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the maximization of the logarithmic utility for an insider with different anticipating techniques. Our aim is to compare the utilization of Russo-Vallois forward and Skorokhod integrals in this context. Theoretical analysis and illustrative numerical examples showcase that the Skorokhod insider outperforms the forward insider. This remarkable observation stands in contrast to the scenario involving risk-neutral traders. Furthermore, an ordinary trader could surpass both insiders if a significant negative fluctuation in the driving stochastic process leads to a sufficiently negative final value. These findings underline the intricate interplay between anticipating stochastic calculus and nonlinear utilities, which may yield non-intuitive results from the financial viewpoint.</description>
