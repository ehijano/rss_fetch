      <title>The Asymptotics of Difference Systems of Sets for Synchronization and Phase Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We settle the problem of determining the asymptotic behavior of the parameters of optimal difference systems of sets, or DSSes for short, which were originally introduced for computationally efficient frame synchronization under the presence of additive noise. We prove that the lowest achievable redundancy of a DSS asymptotically attains Levenshtein's lower bound for any alphabet size and relative index, answering the question of Levenshtein posed in 1971. Our proof is probabilistic and gives a linear-time randomized algorithm for constructing asymptotically optimal DSSes with high probability for any alphabet size and information rate. This provides efficient self-synchronizing codes with strong noise resilience. We also point out an application of DSSes to phase detection.</description>

      <title>Linear Network Coding for Robust Function Computation and Its Applications in Distributed Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate linear network coding in the context of robust function computation, where a sink node is tasked with computing a target function of messages generated at multiple source nodes. In a previous work, a new distance measure was introduced to evaluate the error tolerance of a linear network code for function computation, along with a Singleton-like bound for this distance. In this paper, we first present a minimum distance decoder for these linear network codes. We then focus on the sum function and the identity function, showing that in any directed acyclic network there are two classes of linear network codes for these target functions, respectively, that attain the Singleton-like bound. Additionally, we explore the application of these codes in distributed computing and design a distributed gradient coding scheme in a heterogeneous setting, optimizing the trade-off between straggler tolerance, computation cost, and communication cost. This scheme can also defend against Byzantine attacks.</description>

      <title>A Symbol-Pair Decoder for CSS Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between stabilizer codes and binary codes provided by Gottesman and Calderbank et al. is a celebrated result, as it allows the lifting of classical codes to quantum codes. An equivalent way to state this result is that the work allows us to lift decoders for classical codes over the Hamming metric to decoders for stabilizer quantum codes. A natural question to consider: Can we do something similar with decoders for classical codes considered over other metrics? i.e., Can we lift decoders for classical codes over other metrics to obtain decoders for stabilizer quantum codes? In our current work, we answer this question in the affirmative by considering classical codes over the symbol-pair metric. In particular, we present a relation between the symplectic weight and the symbol-pair weight and use it to improve the error correction capability of CSS-codes (a well-studied class of stabilizer codes) obtained from cyclic codes.</description>

      <title>On Performance of Distributed RIS-aided Communication in Random Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the geometrically averaged performance of a wireless communication network assisted by a multitude of distributed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), where the RIS locations are randomly dropped obeying a homogeneous Poisson point process. By exploiting stochastic geometry and then averaging over the random locations of RISs as well as the serving user, we first derive a closed-form expression for the spatially ergodic rate in the presence of phase errors at the RISs in practice. Armed with this closed-form characterization, we then optimize the RIS deployment under a reasonable and fair constraint of a total number of RIS elements per unit area. The optimal configurations in terms of key network parameters, including the RIS deployment density and the array sizes of RISs, are disclosed for the spatially ergodic rate maximization. Our findings suggest that deploying larger-size RISs with reduced deployment density is theoretically preferred to support extended RIS coverages, under the cases of bounded phase shift errors. However, when dealing with random phase shifts, the reflecting elements are recommended to spread out as much as possible, disregarding the deployment cost. Furthermore, the spatially ergodic rate loss due to the phase shift errors is quantitatively characterized. For bounded phase shift errors, the rate loss is eventually upper bounded by a constant as $N\rightarrow\infty$, where $N$ is the number of reflecting elements at each RIS. While for random phase shifts, this rate loss scales up in the order of $\log N$. These analytical observations are validated through numerical results.</description>

      <title>MUSE: Flexible Voiceprint Receptive Fields and Multi-Path Fusion Enhanced Taylor Transformer for U-Net-based Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04589v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving a balance between lightweight design and high performance remains a challenging task for speech enhancement. In this paper, we introduce Multi-path Enhanced Taylor (MET) Transformer based U-net for Speech Enhancement (MUSE), a lightweight speech enhancement network built upon the Unet architecture. Our approach incorporates a novel Multi-path Enhanced Taylor (MET) Transformer block, which integrates Deformable Embedding (DE) to enable flexible receptive fields for voiceprints. The MET Transformer is uniquely designed to fuse Channel and Spatial Attention (CSA) branches, facilitating channel information exchange and addressing spatial attention deficits within the Taylor-Transformer framework. Through extensive experiments conducted on the VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset, we demonstrate that MUSE achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing both training and deployment costs, boasting a mere 0.51M parameters.</description>

      <title>Generalized Measures of Anticipation and Responsivity in Online Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of classic information-theoretic measures of predictive uncertainty in online language processing, based on the simulation of expected continuations of incremental linguistic contexts. Our framework provides a formal definition of anticipatory and responsive measures, and it equips experimenters with the tools to define new, more expressive measures beyond standard next-symbol entropy and surprisal. While extracting these standard quantities from language models is convenient, we demonstrate that using Monte Carlo simulation to estimate alternative responsive and anticipatory measures pays off empirically: New special cases of our generalized formula exhibit enhanced predictive power compared to surprisal for human cloze completion probability as well as ELAN, LAN, and N400 amplitudes, and greater complementarity with surprisal in predicting reading times.</description>

      <title>Meijer-G Function with Continued Product and Integer Exponent: Performance of Multi-Aperture UOWC System over EGG Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Signal transmission over underwater optical wireless communication (UOWC) experiences the combined effect of oceanic turbulence and pointing errors statistically modeled using the sum of two Meijer-G functions. There is a research gap in the exact statistical analysis of multi-aperture UOWC systems that use selection combining diversity techniques to enhance performance compared to single-aperture systems. In this paper, we develop a general framework for the continued product and positive integer exponent for the sum of Meijer-G functions to analyze the exact statistical performance of the UOWC system in terms of multivariate Fox-H function for both independent and non-identically distributed (i.ni.d.) and independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) channels. We also approximate the performance of a multi-aperture UOWC system with i.i.d. channels using the single-variate Fox-H function. Using the generalized approach, we present analytical expressions for average bit-error rate (BER) and ergodic capacity for the considered system operating over exponential generalized gamma (EGG) oceanic turbulence combined with zero-boresight pointing errors. We also develop asymptotic expressions for the average BER at a high signal-to-noise (SNR) to capture insights into the system's performance. Our simulation findings confirm the accuracy of our derived expressions and illustrate the impact of turbulence parameters for i.ni.d. and i.i.d. models for the average BER and ergodic capacity, which may provide a better estimate for the efficient deployment of UOWC.</description>

      <title>A New Class of Linear Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07986v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $n$ be a prime power, $r$ be a prime with $r\mid n-1$, and $\varepsilon\in (0,1/2)$. Using the theory of multiplicative character sums and superelliptic curves, we construct new codes over $\mathbb F_r$ having length $n$, relative distance $(r-1)/r+O(n^{-\varepsilon})$ and rate $n^{-1/2-\varepsilon}$. When $r=2$, our binary codes have exponential size when compared to all previously known families of linear and non-linear codes with relative distance asymptotic to $1/2$, such as Delsarte--Goethals codes. Moreover, concatenating with a Reed--Solomon code gives a family of codes of length $n$, asymptotic distance $1/2$ and rate $\Omega(n^{-\varepsilon})$ for any fixed small $\varepsilon&gt;0$, improving our initial construction. Such rate is also asymptotically better than the one by Kschischang and Tasbihi obtained by concatenating a Reed--Solomon with Reed--Muller, improving by a factor in $\Omega(n^{1/2}/\log(n))$.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Security over Fluid Antenna Systems: Secrecy Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of physical layer security (PLS) in fluid antenna-aided communication systems under arbitrary correlated fading channels. In particular, it is considered that a single fixed-antenna transmitter aims to send confidential information to a legitimate receiver equipped with a planar fluid antenna system (FAS), while an eavesdropper, also taking advantage of a planar FAS, attempts to decode the desired message. For this scenario, we first present analytical expressions of the equivalent channel distributions at the legitimate user and eavesdropper by using copula, so that the obtained analytical results are valid for any arbitrarily correlated fading distributions. Then, with the help of Gauss-Laguerre quadrature, we derive compact analytical expressions for the average secrecy capacity (ASC), the secrecy outage probability (SOP), and the secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) for the FAS wiretap channel. Moreover, for exemplary purposes, we also obtain the compact expression of ASC, SOP, and SEE by utilizing the Gaussian copula under correlated Rayleigh fading channels as a special case. Eventually, numerical results indicate that applying the fluid antenna with only one activated port to PLS can guarantee more secure and reliable transmission, when compared to traditional antenna systems (TAS) exploiting maximal ratio combining (MRC) and antenna selection (AS) under selection combining (SC).</description>

      <title>Age of $k$-out-of-$n$ Systems on a Gossip Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider information update systems on a gossip network, which consists of a single source and $n$ receiver nodes. The source encrypts the information into $n$ distinct keys with version stamps, sending a unique key to each node. For decoding the information in a $k$-out-of-$n$ system, each receiver node requires at least $k+1$ different keys with the same version, shared over peer-to-peer connections. Each node determines $k$ based on a given function, ensuring that as $k$ increases, the precision of the decoded information also increases. We consider two different schemes: a memory scheme (in which the nodes keep the source's current and previous encrypted messages) and a memoryless scheme (in which the nodes are allowed to only keep the source's current message). We measure the ''timeliness'' of information updates by using the $k$-keys version age of information. Our work focuses on determining closed-form expressions for the time average age of information in a heterogeneous random graph under both with memory and memoryless schemes.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Optimization of RIS-Assisted Cell-Free Massive MIMO NOMA Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, where each access point (AP) serves all the users with the aid of the RIS. We practically model the system by considering imperfect instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and employing imperfect successive interference cancellation at the users end. We first obtain the channel estimates using linear minimum mean square error approach considering the spatial correlation at the RIS and then derive a closed-form downlink spectral efficiency (SE) expression using the statistical CSI. We next formulate a joint optimization problem to maximize the sum SE of the system. We first introduce a novel successive Quadratic Transform (successive-QT) algorithm to optimize the transmit power coefficients using the concept of block optimization along with quadratic transform and then use the particle swarm optimization technique to design the RIS phase shifts. Note that most of the existing works on RIS-aided cell-free systems are specific instances of the general scenario studied in this work. We numerically show that i) the RIS-assisted link is more advantageous at lower transmit power regions where the direct link between AP and user is weak, ii) NOMA outperforms orthogonal multiple access schemes in terms of SE, and iii) the proposed joint optimization framework significantly improves the sum SE of the system.</description>

      <title>Generalized Maximum Entropy Differential Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a sampling-based trajectory optimization method derived from the maximum entropy formulation of Differential Dynamic Programming with Tsallis entropy. This method is a generalization of the legacy work with Shannon entropy, which leads to a Gaussian optimal control policy for exploration during optimization. With the Tsallis entropy, the policy takes the form of $q$-Gaussian, which further encourages exploration with its heavy-tailed shape. Moreover, the sampling variance is scaled according to the value function of the trajectory. This scaling mechanism is the unique property of the algorithm with Tsallis entropy in contrast to the original formulation with Shannon entropy, which scales variance with a fixed temperature parameter. Due to this property, our proposed algorithms can promote exploration when necessary, that is, the cost of the trajectory is high. The simulation results with two robotic systems with multimodal cost demonstrate the properties of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>A rate-distortion framework for MCMC algorithms: geometry and factorization of multivariate Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework rooted in a rate distortion problem for Markov chains, and show how a suite of commonly used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are specific instances within it, where the target stationary distribution is controlled by the distortion function. Our approach offers a unified variational view on the optimality of algorithms such as Metropolis-Hastings, Glauber dynamics, the swapping algorithm and Feynman-Kac path models. Along the way, we analyze factorizability and geometry of multivariate Markov chains. Specifically, we demonstrate that induced chains on factors of a product space can be regarded as information projections with respect to a particular divergence. This perspective yields Han--Shearer type inequalities for Markov chains as well as applications in the context of large deviations and mixing time comparison. Finally, to demonstrate the significance of our framework, we propose a new projection sampler based on the swapping algorithm that provably accelerates the mixing time by multiplicative factors related to the number of temperatures and the dimension of the underlying state space.</description>

Abstract: Quantum error correction plays a prominent role in the realization of quantum computation, and quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are believed to be practically useful stabilizer codes. While qLDPC codes are defined to have constant weight parity-checks, the weight of these parity checks could be large constants that make implementing these codes challenging. Large constants can also result in long syndrome extraction times and bad error propagation that can impact error correction performance. Hastings recently introduced weight reduction techniques for qLDPC codes that reduce the weight of the parity checks as well as the maximum number of checks that acts on any data qubit. However, the fault tolerance of these techniques remains an open question. In this paper, we analyze the effective distance of the weight-reduced code when single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits are considered for error correction. We prove that there exists single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits that largely preserve the effective distance of the weight-reduced qLDPC codes. In addition, we also show that the distance balancing technique introduced by Evra et al. preserves effective distance. As a corollary, our result shows that higher-dimensional hypergraph product (HGP) codes, also known as homological product codes corresponding to the product of 1-complexes, have no troublesome hook errors when using any single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuit.</description>

      <title>CROSS: A Contributor-Project Interaction Lifecycle Model for Open Source Software</title>

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of open source software (OSS), its sustainability remains a critical concern, particularly in light of security vulnerabilities and the often inadequate end-of-service (EoS) processes for OSS projects as they decline. Existing models of OSS community participation, like the Onion model and the episodic contribution model, offer valuable insights but are fundamentally incompatible and fail to provide a comprehensive picture of contributor engagement with OSS projects. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing the CROSS model, a novel contributor-project interaction lifecycle model for open source, which delineates the various lifecycle stages of contributor-project interaction, along with the driving and retaining forces pertinent to each stage. By synthesizing existing research on OSS communities, organizational behavior, and human resource development, it explains a range of archetypal cases of contributor engagement and highlights research gaps, especially in EoS/offboarding scenarios. The CROSS model provides a foundation for understanding and enhancing the sustainability of OSS projects, offering a robust foundation for future research and practical application.</description>
