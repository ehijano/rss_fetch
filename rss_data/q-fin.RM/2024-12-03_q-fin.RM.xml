      <title>Counter-monotonic Risk Sharing with Heterogeneous Distortion Risk Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study risk sharing among agents with preferences modeled by heterogeneous distortion risk measures, who are not necessarily risk averse. Pareto optimality for agents using risk measures is often studied through the lens of inf-convolutions, because allocations that attain the inf-convolution are Pareto optimal, and the converse holds true under translation invariance. Our main focus is on groups of agents who exhibit varying levels of risk seeking. Under mild assumptions, we derive explicit solutions for the unconstrained inf-convolution and the counter-monotonic inf-convolution, which can be represented by a generalization of distortion risk measures. Furthermore, for a group of agents with different levels of risk aversion or risk seeking, we consider a portfolio manager's problem and explicitly determine the optimal investment strategies. Interestingly, we observe a counterintuitive phenomenon of comparative statics: even if all agents in the group become more risk seeking, the portfolio manager acting on behalf of the group may not necessarily allocate a larger proportion of investments to risky assets, which is in sharp contrast to the case of risk-averse agents.</description>

      <title>On-Chain Credit Risk Score (OCCR Score) in DeFi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) and smart contracts are the next generation and fast-growing market for quick and safe interaction between lenders and borrowers. However for maintaining a streamline ecosystem it is necessary to understand the risk associated with the particular user under consideration. In this paper we have developed 'On Chain Credit Risk Score' of a wallet is an answer to quantifying the risk of the particular wallet, namely the probability that the particular wallet may have a loan liquidated. 'On Chain Credit Risk Score (OCCR Score)' of wallets, will help lending borrowing protocols and other DeFi institutes to understand the risk involved in giving out loans to a wallet and may change the Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio and subsequently the Liquidation Threshold (LT) if required.</description>

      <title>Performance-based variable premium scheme and reinsurance design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the literature, insurance and reinsurance pricing is typically determined by a premium principle, characterized by a risk measure that reflects the policy seller's risk attitude. Building on the work of Meyers (1980) and Chen et al. (2016), we propose a new performance-based variable premium scheme for reinsurance policies, where the premium depends on both the distribution of the ceded loss and the actual realized loss. Under this scheme, the insurer and the reinsurer face a random premium at the beginning of the policy period. Based on the realized loss, the premium is adjusted into either a ''reward'' or ''penalty'' scenario, resulting in a discount or surcharge at the end of the policy period. We characterize the optimal reinsurance policy from the insurer's perspective under this new variable premium scheme. In addition, we formulate a Bowley optimization problem between the insurer and the monopoly reinsurer. Numerical examples demonstrate that, compared to the expected-value premium principle, the reinsurer prefers the variable premium scheme as it reduces the reinsurer's total risk exposure.</description>

      <title>Risk models from tree-structured Markov random fields following multivariate Poisson distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose risk models for a portfolio of risks, each following a compound Poisson distribution, with dependencies introduced through a family of tree-based Markov random fields with Poisson marginal distributions inspired in C\^ot\'e et al. (2024b, arXiv:2408.13649). The diversity of tree topologies allows for the construction of risk models under several dependence schemes. We study the distribution of the random vector of risks and of the aggregate claim amount of the portfolio. We perform two risk management tasks: the assessment of the global risk of the portfolio and its allocation to each component. Numerical examples illustrate the findings and the efficiency of the computation methods developed throughout. We also show that the discussed family of Markov random fields is a subfamily of the multivariate Poisson distribution constructed through common shocks.</description>

      <title>Spanning Multi-Asset Payoffs With ReLUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14231v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a distributional formulation of the spanning problem of a multi-asset payoff by vanilla basket options. This problem is shown to have a unique solution if and only if the payoff function is even and absolutely homogeneous, and we establish a Fourier-based formula to calculate the solution. Financial payoffs are typically piecewise linear, resulting in a solution that may be derived explicitly, yet may also be hard to numerically exploit. One-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks instead provide a natural and efficient numerical alternative for discrete spanning. We test this approach for a selection of archetypal payoffs and obtain better hedging results with vanilla basket options compared to industry-favored approaches based on single-asset vanilla hedges.</description>

      <title>QFNN-FFD: Quantum Federated Neural Network for Financial Fraud Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02595v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study introduces the Quantum Federated Neural Network for Financial Fraud Detection (QFNN-FFD), a cutting-edge framework merging Quantum Machine Learning (QML) and quantum computing with Federated Learning (FL) for financial fraud detection. Using quantum technologies' computational power and the robust data privacy protections offered by FL, QFNN-FFD emerges as a secure and efficient method for identifying fraudulent transactions within the financial sector. Implementing a dual-phase training model across distributed clients enhances data integrity and enables superior performance metrics, achieving precision rates consistently above 95%. Additionally, QFNN-FFD demonstrates exceptional resilience by maintaining an impressive 80% accuracy, highlighting its robustness and readiness for real-world applications. This combination of high performance, security, and robustness against noise positions QFNN-FFD as a transformative advancement in financial technology solutions and establishes it as a new benchmark for privacy-focused fraud detection systems. This framework facilitates the broader adoption of secure, quantum-enhanced financial services and inspires future innovations that could use QML to tackle complex challenges in other areas requiring high confidentiality and accuracy.</description>
