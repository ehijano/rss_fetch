      <title>Geometric modular flows in 2d CFT and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study geometric modular flows in two-dimensional conformal field theories. We explore which states exhibit a geometric modular flow with respect to a causally complete subregion and, conversely, how to construct a state from a given geometric modular flow. Given suitable boundary conditions, we find that generic geometric modular flows in the Rindler wedge are conformally equivalent. Based on this insight, we show how conformal unitaries can be used to explicitly construct a state for each flow. We analyze these states, deriving general formulas for the energy density and entanglement entropy. We also consider geometric flows beyond the Rindler wedge setting, and in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Entropy, Quantum Corrections and EFT Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit and study quantum corrections to the supersymmetric entropy of BPS black holes in 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ effective field theories (EFTs), which can be obtained from Type IIA string theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold. Macroscopically, these corrections arise from an infinite series of higher-derivative F-terms that encode certain modifications to the two-derivative supergravity effective action. Within the large volume regime, we analyze in detail the moduli dependence of these semi-classical contributions and explore their implications for the black hole entropy. As a byproduct, we show that the entropy captures, in a rather intricate way, the transition between four- and five-dimensional dual EFT descriptions. In fact, the expansion parameter $\alpha$ controlling the relevant asymptotic series can be related to the ratio of the black hole horizon and the Kaluza-Klein scale, given here by the inverse D0-brane mass. Furthermore, we are able to resum the series into a well-behaved convergent expression for all values of $\alpha$. This demonstrates, in turn, that (stable) black holes can, indeed, probe scales besides the quantum gravity cutoff. More precisely, by examining two representative BPS systems --the D0-D2-D4 and D2-D6 black hole solutions-- we explicitly illustrate how highly non-local (perturbative) quantum effects resolve the divergences, ultimately leading to a well-defined entropy function. Additionally, in certain cases, we show that one can take a suitable decompactification limit to 5d and verify that the corrected entropy function reproduces the exact microstate counting of the underlying five-dimensional black string. Our results also clarify the role of non-perturbative quantum corrections, which, remarkably, do not modify any of our prior conclusions.</description>

      <title>The Conformal Primon Gas at the End of Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Belinksy-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz dynamics of gravity close to a spacelike singularity can be mapped, at each point in space separately, onto the motion of a particle bouncing within half the fundamental domain of the modular group. We show that the semiclassical quantisation of this motion is a conformal quantum mechanics where the states are constrained to be modular invariant. Each such state defines an odd automorphic $L$-function. In particular, in a basis of dilatation eigenstates the wavefunction is proportional to the $L$-function along the critical axis and hence vanishes at the nontrivial zeros, realising suggestions by Connes and Berry-Keating for the Riemann zeta function. We show that the $L$-function along the positive real axis is equal to the partition function of a gas of non-interacting charged oscillators labeled by prime numbers. This generalises Julia's notion of a primon gas. Each state therefore has a corresponding, dual, primon gas with a distinct nontrivial set of chemical potentials that ensure modular invariance. We extract universal features of these theories by averaging the logarithm of the partition function over the chemical potentials. The averaging produces the Witten index of a fermionic primon gas.</description>

      <title>The String Dual to Two-dimensional Yang-Mills Theory Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that chiral two-dimensional Yang-Mills theory on a Riemann surface is dual to a deformed stationary subsector of the Gromov-Witten theory of that Riemann surface. Firstly, we argue that the algebraic structure that underlies the large N limit of the chiral gauge theory is a partial permutation Frobenius algebra of observables which codes covering maps of all degrees simultaneously. Secondly, we exploit the Gromov-Witten/Hurwitz correspondence to interpret chiral Yang-Mills theory as a finite deformation of a Gromov-Witten theory by an area-dependent transposition interaction and an operator that codes a compactification of Hurwitz space. The proposed string dual manifestly includes an integral over the moduli space of Riemann surfaces as well as the identification of closed string states as completed cycles.</description>

      <title>Love numbers of black p-branes: fine tuning, Love symmetries, and their geometrization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute scalar static response coefficients (Love numbers) of non-dilatonic black $p$-brane solutions in higher dimensional supergravity. This calculation revels a fine-tuning behavior similar to that of higher dimensional black holes, which we explain by ``hidden'' near-zone Love symmetries. In general, these symmetries act on equations for perturbations but they are not background isometries. The Love symmetry of charged $p=0$ branes is described by the usual $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$ algebra. For $p=1$ the Love symmetry has an algebraic structure $SL(2,\mathbb{R})\times SL(2,\mathbb{R})$. The $p=0,1$ Love symmetries reduce to isometries of the near-horizon Schwarzschild-AdS$_{p+2}$ metric in the near-extremal finite temperature limit. They further reduce to the AdS$_{p+2}$ isometries in the extremal zero-temperature limit. We call this process geometrization. In contrast, for the $p&gt;1$ cases, the Love symmetry is always an $SL(2,\mathbb{R})$, and there is no limit in which it becomes geometric. We interpret geometrization and its absence as a consequence of the local equivalence between the Schwarzschild-AdS$_{p+2}$ and pure AdS$_{p+2}$ spaces for $p=0,1$, which does not hold for $p&gt;1$. We also show that the static Love numbers of extremal $p$-branes are always zero regardless of spacetime dimensionality, which contrasts starkly with the non-extremal case. Overall, our results suggest that the Love symmetry is hidden by nature, and it can acquire a geometric meaning only if the background has an AdS$_{2}$ or AdS$_{3}$ limit.</description>

      <title>Cherenkov emission by fast-moving uncharged Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that in the presence of an external magnetic field, an uncharged classical Schwarzschild black hole moving superluminally in a dielectric with permittivity $\epsilon &gt; 1$ produces Cherenkov emission. This is a new physical effect: classical (non-quantum) emission of electromagnetic waves by a completely charge-neutral ``particle''. The governing equations (involving General Relativity, electromagnetism, and the physics of continuous media) have no external electromagnetic source - it is the distortion of the initial electromagnetic fields by the gravity of the black hole that plays the role of a superluminally moving source. The effect relies on nonzero values of both the magnetic field and the gravitational radius, as well as on the usual Cherenkov condition on the velocity, $v/c &gt; 1/\sqrt{\epsilon}$. Unlike Cherenkov emission by a point charge, the effective source in this case is spatially distributed, with emission generated along the single Cherenkov emission cone. The emitted spectrum is red-dominated, with power $\propto dk_z /|k_z|$ for wave numbers $|k_z| \leq 1/R_G$, where $R_G$ is the Schwarzschild radius. We comment on possible observability of this process during black hole -- neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>On the Underlying Nonrelativistic Nature of Relativistic Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past quarter century, considerable effort has been invested in the study of nonrelativistic (NR) string theory, its U-dual NR brane theories, and their geometric foundations in (generalized) Newton-Cartan geometry. Many interesting results have been obtained, both for their intrinsic value and in the hope that they hold useful lessons for relativistic string/M theory. By synthesizing two strands of recent developments (especially, arXiv:2312.13243 and arXiv:2410.03591), we argue that this hope has already come to fruition, because standard, relativistic holography can now be recognized as a statement within a corresponding nonrelativistic brane theory. Our main conclusions are general, but within the familiar example of D3-brane based holography, they read as follows: (i) N=4 SYM is exactly the worldvolume theory of D3-branes within `NR D3-brane theory'; (ii) AdS_5*S^5 is exactly the corresponding RR black 3-brane, and includes an asymptotically-flat-Newton-Cartan region; (iii) AdS/CFT duality is precisely synonymous with black-brane/D-brane (i.e., closed-string/open-string) duality within NR D3-brane theory; (iv) Newton-Cartan geometry is the underlying structure upon which entanglement of the D3-brane degrees of freedom builds relativistic spacetime.</description>

      <title>Conformal Partial Wave Expansion of Celestial Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel definition of holographic correlation functions on the celestial sphere of Minkowski space was recently introduced in arXiv:2301.01810 as the extrapolation of bulk time-ordered correlation functions to the celestial sphere. In this work, focusing on theories of scalar fields in $(d+2)$-dimensional Minkowski space, we show that in perturbation theory such celestial correlation functions admit a conformal partial wave expansion with meromorphic spectral density, and hence also an expansion into conformal blocks. This is achieved in the hyperbolic slicing of Minkowski space by extending the harmonic function (``spectral") decomposition of AdS bulk-to-bulk propagators to the Minkowski Feynman propagator. We study the conformal partial wave expansion of celestial correlators for four-point contact and tree-level exchange diagrams, and extract the contributions to their conformal block expansions in the direct channel. When all scalar fields are massless, the tree-level exchange diagram takes a remarkably simple form and is given by a finite sum of conformal blocks (and, for $d=2$, their derivatives as well). We also discuss the conformal partial wave expansion at the non-perturbative level, where Lorentz unitarity manifests as positivity of the spectral density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study families of solutions depending only on one coordinate for the theories of N=2,five-dimensional supergravity coupled to vector multiplets. Four families of solutions, valid for all space-time signatures, are obtained. The explicit metrics of the solutions depend on the Jordan normal forms of constrained matrices. Examples with three charges are given for the so-called STU model.</description>

      <title>High-precision numerical evaluation of Lauricella functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for high-precision numerical evaluations of Lauricella functions, whose indices are linearly dependent on some parameter $\varepsilon$, in terms of their Laurent series expansions at zero. This method is based on finding analytic continuations of these functions in terms of Frobenius generalized power series. Being one-dimensional, these series are much more suited for high-precision numerical evaluations than multi-dimensional sums arising in approaches to analytic continuations based on re-expansions of hypergeometric series or Mellin--Barnes integral representations. To accelerate the calculation procedure further, the $\varepsilon$ dependence of the result is reconstructed from the evaluations of given Lauricella functions at specific numerical values of $\varepsilon$, which, in addition, allows for efficient parallel implementation. The method has been implemented in the $\texttt{PrecisionLauricella}$ package, written in Wolfram Mathematica language.</description>

      <title>Finiteness of the Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons action in linear covariant gauges by taking into account gauge copies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the effects of removing infinitesimal Gribov copies from the path integral of gauge-fixed Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theories formulated in three-dimensional Euclidean space have been investigated. Part of the interest resides on the fact that such an elimination of gauge copies introduces a mass parameter, the Gribov parameter, which is relevant when the assumptions of the Faddeev-Popov procedure are not well-grounded. Such a parameter enters the propagator of the gauge field which is topologically massive due to the Chern-Simons term. The resulting action, which eliminates infinitesimal Gribov copies in this context, has been constructed in linear covariant gauges and the interplay between the aforementioned mass-parameters allows for a rich phase diagram in which confining and deconfining signatures are observed in the gauge-field propagator. In the present work, we establish the renormalization properties of such a theory at all orders in perturbation theory by means of the algebraic renormalization framework and show that the removal of infinitesimal Gribov copies does not affect the standard non-renormalization properties of standard gauge-fixed Yang-Mills-Chern-Simons theories, i.e., the theory is finite.</description>

      <title>Heat engines for scale invariant systems dual to black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to holography, a black hole is dual to a thermal state in a strongly coupled quantum system. The principle example of holography is the Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory (AdS/CFT) correspondence. We construct reversible heat engines where the working substance consists of a static thermal equilibrium state of a CFT. For thermal states dual to an asymptotically AdS black hole, this yields a novel realization of Johnson's holographic heat engines. We compute the efficiency for a number of idealized heat engines, such as the Carnot, Brayton, Otto, Diesel, and Stirling cycles. The efficiency of most heat engines can be derived from the CFT equation of state, which follows from scale invariance, and we compare them to the efficiencies for an ideal gas. However, the Stirling efficiency for a generic CFT is uniquely determined in terms of its characteristic temperature and volume only in the high-temperature or large-volume regime. We derive an exact expression for the Stirling efficiency for CFT states dual to AdS-Schwarzschild black holes, and compare the subleading corrections in the high-temperature regime with those in a generic CFT.</description>

      <title>Kramer's Escape Rate and Phase Transition Dynamics in AdS Black Holes with Dark Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17849v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional static methods in phase transition studies, such as the swallowtail bifurcation diagram, provide good insights into the thermodynamics of black holes. However, they practically lose sight of the dynamic aspects and temporal sequence of events. The Kramers escape rate, central to our research, offers a somewhat dynamic approach to phase transition. We examine the free energy landscapes for black holes under the influence of â€™darkâ€™ and â€™stringy+darkâ€™ structures, assessing how additional parameters affect the escape rates and dynamics of the transition during the first-order phase transition from small to large black holes. In our analysis, we consider the escape rate as a function of the black hole radius and study its variations. We will observe that, on one hand, the escape rate well represents our assumption based on the movement from zero, increasing to a maximum point, and then decreasing back to zero as reactive structures become active during the phase transition interval. However, the critical point in this method is the encounter with a specific and distinct point. This is where the diagram of the direct process (escape rate from small to large black holes) intersects with the reverse process (large to small black holes), becoming equally probable (contact point). The point, which seems improbable at the onset of the phase transition or very negligible, gains more significance as the process progresses. This increase indicates the dominance of a region where the escape rate from larger black holes to smaller ones prevails. The predominance of the reverse process, which increases as we approach the end of the process and is necessarily accompanied by a variation in radius, may be considered as a natural reaction of the black hole against the â€™phase changeâ€™ action. A reaction which attempting to prevent any uncontrolled radial growth that could jeopardize the stability of the black hole.</description>

      <title>Mutual Influence of Photon Sphere and Non-Commutative Parameter in Various Non-Commutative Black Holes: Part I- Towards evidence for WGC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09557v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-commutative black holes(NCBH), due to the non-commutativity of spacetime coordinates, lead to a modification of the spacetime metric. By replacing the Dirac delta function with a Gaussian distribution, the mass is effectively smeared, eliminating point-like singularities. Our objective is to investigate the impact of this change on spacetime geodesics, including photon spheres and time-like orbits. We will demonstrate how the photon sphere can serve as a tool to classify spacetime, illustrating the influence of the NC parameter and constraining its values in various modes of these black holes. Additionally, using this classification, we will show how the addition of the nonlinear Einstein-Born-Infeld(BI) field to the model enhances its physical alignment with reality compared to the charged model. In the dS BI model, we will show how the study of the effective potential and photon sphere can provide insights into the initial structural status of the model, thereby establishing this potential as an effective tool for examining the initial conditions of black holes. Finally, by examining super-extremality conditions, we will show that the AdS BI model, with the necessary conditions, can be a suitable candidate for studying and observing the effects of the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of the Weak Cosmic Censorship Conjecture (WCCC) through Gedankenexperiments involving black hole perturbations induced by test particles. Our approach allows for the calculation of perturbations to any order for a general class of black holes that admit the zero-temperature extremal limit. We find that the WCCC for extremal and near-extremal black holes is hinged upon the positive sign of only one quantity, namely $W=\left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial T} \right)_{Q_\alpha ; T=0}$, which is indeed positive for all the well-known black holes.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{G}_2$-structures with torsion and the deformed Shatashvili-Vafa vertex algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct representations of the deformed Shatashvili-Vafa vertex algebra $\mathrm{SV}_a$, with parameter $a \in \mathbb{C}$, as recently proposed in the physics literature by Fiset and Gaberdiel. The geometric input for our construction are integrable $\mathrm{G}_2$-structures with closed torsion, solving the heterotic $\mathrm{G}_2$ system with $\alpha'=0$ on the group manifolds $S^3\times T^4$ and $S^3\times S^3\times S^1$. From considerations in string theory, one expects the chiral algebra of these backgrounds to include $\mathrm{SV}_a$, and we provide a mathematical realization of this expectation by obtaining embeddings of $\mathrm{SV}_a$ in the corresponding superaffine vertex algebra and the chiral de Rham complex. In our examples, the parameter $a$ is proportional to the scalar torsion class of the $\mathrm{G}_2$ structure, $a \sim \tau_0$, as expected from previous work in the semi-classical limit by the second author, jointly with De la Ossa and Marchetto.</description>

      <title>Lattice Weyl Fermion on a Single Spherical Domain-Wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a single spherical domain-wall embedded in a three-dimensional Euclidean lattice. We employ the Shamir-type domain-wall fermion formulation, where the negative mass region is confined inside the $S^2$ domain-wall, while the positive mass outside is taken to the infinite limit, allowing the exterior region to be neglected effectively. In the absence of a gauge potential, Weyl fermions emerge as edge-localized modes along the $S^2$ domain-wall. When a nontrivial $U(1)$ gauge potential is present, additional zero modes with opposite chirality appears, localized at the center near the monopole. This centrally localized mode originates from the effective mass contribution of the Wilson term, which induces a domain-wall near the monopole.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have carried out lattice simulations of $(2+1)$-flavor QCD using highly improved staggered quarks at the physical pion mass on $32^3 \times 8$ and $48^3 \times 12$ lattices, with magnetic field strengths ranging up to 0.8 GeV$^2$ and nonzero baryon chemical potentials employing the Taylor expansion framework. We present lattice QCD continuum estimate results, along with the magnetized hadron resonance and ideal gas comparisons, for the leading-order Taylor expansion coefficients for bulk thermodynamic quantities such as pressure, number density, energy density, and entropy density, focusing on the significant impact of strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a minijet model to examine the behavior of the total cross section, $\sigma_{tot}$, and the ratio of the real to imaginary parts of the scattering amplitude, $\rho$, at high energies. In this framework, the growth of $\sigma_{tot}$ in $pp$ and $\bar{p}p$ channels is driven by semihard partonic processes dominated by gluon interactions. The QCD contribution to $\sigma_{tot}$ for the jet production is computed in the next-to-leading order. We analyze data separately from the TOTEM and ATLAS/ALFA Collaborations and find evidence in both cases suggesting the necessity of an odd semihard component that becomes asymptotically significant at high energies.</description>

      <title>Topological Sum Rules and Spectral Flows of Chiral and Gravitational Axion-like Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the structure of off-shell effective actions arising from chiral and gravitational anomalies, focusing on the $JJJ_A$ (axial-vector/vector/vector) and $J_A TT $ (axial-vector/stress-energy tensors) correlators, relevant in the analysis of anomaly-driven interactions in perturbation theory. Our approach relies on conformal field theory in momentum space, extended to chiral anomalies. The analysis centers on the presence of both particle poles and anomaly poles within these interactions, characterizing their behavior both in the conformal and non conformal limits. Through explicit computations, we show that universal sum rules in the longitudinal sector regulate these interactions for all kinematic conditions, extending previous analysis, and we discuss the resulting spectral flow, an area law of the absorptive part of the anomaly form factors as one moves away from or returns to the conformal point. These features are absent in the local effective action of anomaly interactions, commonly used in the description of axion-like particles. The spectral densities in both cases are shown to be self-similar. Our results further show that anomaly poles correspond to true particle poles only in the conformal limit, when the interaction describes a massless S-matrix process supported on a null-surface. Under these conditions, they can be effectively described by two kinetically mixed pseudoscalar fields propagating on the light-cone. These studies find application in polarized deeply inelastic scattering, axion-like dark matter and analogue systems such as topological materials.</description>

      <title>Percolation of Domain Walls in the Two-Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Domain walls formed during a phase transition in a simple field theory model with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in a periodic box have been demonstrated to annihilate as fast as causality allows and their area density scales $\propto t^{-1}$. We have performed numerical simulations of the dynamics of domain walls in the Two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) where the potential has $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry in two spatial dimensions. We observed significant differences with the standard case. Although the extreme long-time limit is the same for the $\approx 10^{5}$ sets of random initial configurations analysed, the percolation process is much slower due to the formation of long-lived loops. We suggest that this is due to the build up of superconducting currents on the walls which could lead ultimately to stationary configurations known as Kinky Vortons. We discuss the relevance of these findings for the production of Vortons in three spatial dimensions.</description>

      <title>Two-loop helicity amplitudes for diphoton production with massive quark loop</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute two-loop helicity amplitudes in QCD for diphoton production through quark- and gluon-initiated channels, accounting for a massive internal quark loop by keeping its full mass dependence. Using physical projectors, we directly decompose the amplitude into its helicity components. By renormalising the heavy quark mass in on-shell, and other quantities in $\overline{\rm MS}$ schemes, we obtain finite remainders. This work paves the way for calculating the cross-section for diphoton production at higher orders in QCD with a massive quark loop, employing different subtraction schemes. The effect of a heavy quark is expected to play a crucial role in high-luminosity LHC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify higher-order Maxwell-Einstein theories linear in the curvature tensor and quadratic in the derivatives of the electromagnetic field strength whose kinetic matrices are degenerate. This provides a generalisation of quadratic degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor theories for a U(1) gauge field. After establishing a classification of the independent Lagrangians, we obtain all the theories with at most third order field equations involving only second order derivatives of the metric, thus generalising Horndeski's quadratic theory for a gauge field. Some of these are shown to be conformally invariant. We then classify degenerate non-minimally coupled interactions, obtaining all conformally invariant ones. Finally, we investigate the effect of U(1)-preserving disformal transformations on these degenerate Lagrangians. The ``mimetic" singular transformations are obtained and new ghost-free degenerate theories are generated.</description>

      <title>Corrections to Kerr-Newman black hole from Noncommutative Einstein-Maxwell equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we introduce the noncommutative geometry into the standard Einstein-Hilbert-Maxwell action via the $\partial_t\wedge\partial_\phi$ Drinfeld twist and solve the equation of motion pertubatively in the expansion of the noncommutative parameter $a$. The equation of motion, the NC Einstein-Maxwell equation, turns out to be effectively a problem in nonlinear electrodynamics where the energy-momentum tensor $T_{\mu\nu}$ obtains correction terms with three Faraday tensors $F_{\mu\nu}$. A solution with nonzero $a^1$ terms turns out to be the Kerr-Newman black hole modified with nonzero $g_{t\theta}, g_{r\phi}, g_{tr}$ and $g_{\phi\theta}$ components proportional to $a$, while the electromagnetic potential is the Seiberg-Witten expanded Kerr-Newman potential which introduces a nonzero $A_{\theta}$ term proportional to $a$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a U(1)-gauged 2-component spin system in 3 dimensions. For the gauge fields we use the Villain formulation with a constraint that removes lattice monopoles and in this form couple the gauge fields to 2-component spins. We discuss the simulation strategies for this highly constraint system and present first results for the phase structure. Our preliminary Monte Carlo simulations indicate that the system undergoes a second order phase transition driven by the spin coupling. However, the correlation length critical exponent is inconsistent with the conformal bootstrap constraint for a critical (rather than multi-critical) fixed point, which forces a conclusion that the transition is likely weakly 1st order, passing close to a multi-critical point. To reliably resolve the nature of the transition, simulations on larger lattices will be necessary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imaginary baryon number chemical potential simulations are a popular workaround for the (in)famous sign problem plaguing finite density QCD studies on the lattice. One is necessarily left with the problem of analytically continuing results to real values of $\mu_B$. In the framework of the Bielefeld Parma Collaboration, we have in recent years studied a multi-point Pad\'e description of the net baryon number density computed as a function of imaginary baryon number chemical potential. While our main emphasis has till now been on the determination of Lee-Yang singularities, the method is per se a natural tool to analytically continue results. We report on the status of our projects with this respect, comparing the Pad\'e approach to analytic continuation to another, new strategy, which is an application of the Cauchy integral formula in the sense of an inverse problem.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of monitored SSH Model in Krylov Space: From Complexity to Quantum Fisher Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of a non-Hermitian SSH model that arises out of the no-click limit of a monitored SSH model in the Krylov space. We find that the saturation timescale of the complexity associated with the spread of the state in the Krylov subspace increases with the measurement rate, and late time behaviour differs across the $\mathrm{PT}$ symmetry transition point. Furthermore, extending the notion of this complexity for subsystems in Krylov space, we find that the scaling of its late time value with subsystem size shows a discontinuous jump across the $\mathrm{PT}$ transition point, indicating that it can be used as a suitable order parameter for such transition but not for the measurement-induced transition. Finally, we show that the measurement-induced transition can be detected using a generalized measure in the Krylov subspace, which contains information about the correlation landscape, such as Quantum Fisher information, which also possesses some structural similarity with the complexity functional.</description>

      <title>Analyticity and Unitarity for Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.01695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.01695v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fundamentals of quantum field theory on a rigid de Sitter space. We show that the perturbative expansion of late-time correlation functions to all orders can be equivalently generated by a non-unitary Lagrangian on a Euclidean AdS geometry. This finding simplifies dramatically perturbative computations, as well as allows us to establish basic properties of these correlators, which comprise a Euclidean CFT. We use this to infer the analytic structure of the spectral density that captures the conformal partial wave expansion of a late-time four-point function, to derive an OPE expansion, and to constrain the operator spectrum. Generically, dimensions and OPE coefficients do not obey the usual CFT notion of unitarity. Instead, unitarity of the de Sitter theory manifests itself as the positivity of the spectral density. This statement does not rely on the use of Euclidean AdS Lagrangians and holds non-perturbatively. We illustrate and check these properties by explicit calculations in a scalar theory by computing first tree-level, and then full one-loop-resummed exchange diagrams. An exchanged particle appears as a resonant feature in the spectral density which can be potentially useful in experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Carrollian Partition Functions and the Flat Limit of AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13668v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formulation of the S-matrix as a path integral with specified asymptotic boundary conditions naturally leads to the realization of a Carrollian partition function defined on the boundary of Minkowski space. This partition function, specified at past and future null infinity in the case of massless particles, generates Carrollian correlation functions that encode the S-matrix. We explore this connection, including the realization of symmetries, soft theorems arising from large gauge transformations, and the correspondence with standard momentum space amplitudes. This framework is also well-suited for embedding the Minkowski space S-matrix into the AdS/CFT duality in the large radius limit. In particular, we identify the AdS and Carrollian partition functions through a simple map between their respective asymptotic data, establishing a direct correspondence between the actions of symmetries on both sides. Our approach thus provides a coherent framework that ties together various topics extensively studied in recent and past literature.</description>

      <title>Mellin amplitudes for $AdS_3 \times S^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17420v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are holographic superconformal theories in all dimensions between two and six which allow arbitrary tree-level four-point functions to be fixed by basic consistency conditions. Although Mellin space is usually the most efficient setting for imposing these contraints, four-point functions in two dimensions have thus far been an exception due to their more intricate dependence on the conformal cross-ratios. In this paper, we introduce a simple fix which exploits the relation between a parity-odd conformal block in two dimensions and a parity-even conformal block in four dimensions. We then apply the resulting toolkit to a study of the paradigmatic holographic theory in two dimensions which is the D1-D5 CFT. For correlators involving Kaluza-Klein modes of the tensor multiplet, this analysis reproduces results which were previously obtained using hidden conformal symmetry. With four Kaluza-Klein modes of the graviton multiplet, it yields new results including a compact formula for the correlators of all pairwise identical operators,</description>

      <title>Brick Wall in AdS-Schwarzschild Black Hole: Normal Modes and Emerging Thermality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the normal modes of a probe scalar field in a five-dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole with the brick wall boundary condition near the horizon. We employ various techniques to compute the spectrum and analyze its properties. Our results reveal a linear dependence of the spectrum on the principal quantum number while demonstrating a non-trivial dependence on the angular momentum quantum number. We compute the Spectral Form Factor (SFF) and find a dip-ramp-plateau structure, with the slope of the ramp approaching unity as the brick wall nears the horizon. We also observe that as the brick wall approaches the horizon, the poles of the retarded Green's function condense on the real line, leading to an emergent thermal behavior in the boundary theory. This work extends previous studies on lower-dimensional black holes to higher dimensions, providing insights into the connection between black hole microstate models and boundary chaos. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discussions on the information paradox and the nature of black hole interiors in the context of AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>

      <title>The underlying black hole phase transitions in an Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model with a holographic critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05065v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model exhibits a first-order phase transition curve that terminates at a holographic critical endpoint, offering intriguing insights into the phase diagram of the dual system living on the boundary. However, the specific instability within the underlying spacetime that triggers the formation of the hairy black hole remains somewhat obscure. This raises the question of whether one of the hairy black hole phases represents a superconducting or scalarized state and how the two distinct phases merge into a indistinguishable one at the critical point. This work investigates the associated black hole phase transition and the underlying instabilities by exploring a specific Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton model. The approach aims to provide transparent insights into the black hole phase transitions in the bulk. By introducing a nonminimal coupling between a massive real scalar field and a Maxwell field in a five-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime, we identify two types of scalarization corresponding to tachyonic instabilities in the ultraviolet and infrared regions. These distinct instabilities lead to a first-order phase transition between two phases in the $\mu-T$ phase diagram. Furthermore, this first-order transition terminates at a critical point, beyond which the curve turns back, and the transition becomes a numerically elusive third-order one. Although one does not encounter a critical endpoint, the model still offers a consistent interpretation for the observed {\it cross-over} in the low baryon density region. We analyze the thermodynamic properties of the scalarized hairy black holes and discuss the implications of our findings.</description>

      <title>Soft Metric Fluctuations During Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conservation of the long wavelength fluctuations of the metric plays a vital role in cosmology as the link between quantum fluctuations during inflation and late time observations. This is a well-known property of the classical evolution equations, but demonstrating that it is robust to quantum correction involves a number of technical arguments. In this paper, we will use effective field theory (EFT) techniques to demonstrate the all orders conservation of the super-horizon scalar and tensor fluctuations of the metric during inflation. We show how to construct an EFT for these soft modes, in analogy with Soft de Sitter Effective Theory. We pay particular attention to how the breaking of time-diffeomorphisms by the inflationary background introduces new time scales that alter the structure of the EFT. In this description, the all orders conservation of the metric fluctuations is a direct consequence of symmetries and power counting that cannot be altered by loop corrections. We further show that this holds when the inflaton (or metric fluctuations) is coupled to additional heavy fields, as in quasi-single field inflation. We match this behavior to several calculations in the ultraviolet (UV) theory and show how the Mellin representation enables a more transparent connection between the UV and the EFT descriptions.</description>

Abstract: We explore the meromorphic structure of the $\zeta$-function associated to the boundary eigenvalue problem of a modified Sturm-Liouville operator subject to spectral dependent boundary conditions at one end of a segment of length $l$. We find that it presents isolated simple poles which follow the general rule valid for second order differential operators subject to standard local boundary conditions. We employ our results to evaluate the determinant of the operator and the Casimir energy of the system it describes, and study its dependence on $l$ for both the massive and the massless cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We undertake a comprehensive analysis of the supersymmetric partition function of the $\text{U}(N)_k\times\text{U}(N)_{-k}$ ABJM theory on a Seifert manifold, evaluating it to all orders in the $1/N$-perturbative expansion up to exponentially suppressed corrections. Through holographic duality, our perturbatively exact result is successfully matched with the regularized on-shell action of a dual Euclidean AdS$_4$-Taub-Bolt background incorporating 4-derivative corrections, and also provides valuable insights into the logarithmic corrections that emerge from the 1-loop calculations in M-theory path integrals. In this process, we revisit the Euclidean AdS$_4$-Taub-Bolt background carefully, elucidating the flat connection in the background graviphoton field. This analysis umambiguously determines the U(1)$_R$ holonomy along the Seifert fiber, thereby solidifying the holographic comparison regarding the partition function on a large class of Seifert manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19592v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider N Dirac fermions on a 4-dimensional Euclidean space with a quadratic interaction given by arbitrary external Clifford-valued fields. The divergence of the axial current satisfies on the classical level a relation that is violated after quantization. Using the Pauli-Villars method to regularize the fields, we find the conditions that guarantee the finiteness of the anomaly. We also find this anomaly. Our result generalizes the well-known computation of axial anomaly of Dirac fermions interacting with an external Yang-Mills field.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi Entanglement of Purification and Half R\'enyi Reflected Entropy in Free Scalar Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the AdS/CFT context, the entanglement of purification (EoP) of CFT is conjectured to be dual to the entanglement wedge cross section (EWCS) in bulk. However, another quantity called reflected entropy $S_{R}$ is also supposed to be dual to two times the EWCS. A natural question is whether they are the same in holographic CFTs even though they are different in general. Previous studies have shown $\mathrm{EoP} \ge \frac{1}{2} S_{R}^{n}, n \ge2$ for random tensor networks. In this paper, we study this inequality beyond $n \ge 2$, and we focus on the range $0 &lt; n &lt; 2$. However, the calculations of EoP are notoriously difficult in general. Thus, our calculations mainly focus on the free scalar theory which is close to the holographic CFTs. We generalized the previous strategy for EoP in \cite{Takayanagi:2018sbw} to the R\'enyi case. And we have also presented two methods for R\'enyi reflected entropy, one is using correlators, the other one is Gaussian wavefunction ansatz. Our calculations show that the inequality still holds for $0 &lt; n &lt; 2$, and it may give us some insights into the equivalence of EoP and half reflected entropy in holographic CFTs. As byproducts of our research, we have also demonstrated the positivity of the R\'enyi Markov gap and the monotonicity of the R\'enyi reflected entropy in the free scalar theory.</description>

      <title>BPS spectroscopy with reinforcement learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We apply reinforcement learning (RL) to establish whether at a given position in the Coulomb branch of the moduli space of a 4d $\mathcal{N} = 2$ quantum field theory (QFT) the BPS spectrum is finite. If it is, we furthermore determine the full BPS spectrum at such point in moduli space. We demonstrate that using a RL model one can efficiently determine the suitable sequence of quiver mutations of the BPS quiver that will generate the full BPS spectrum. We analyse the performance of the RL model on random BPS quivers and show that it converges to a solution various orders of magnitude faster than a systematic brute-force scan. As a result, we show that our algorithm can be used to identify all minimal chambers of a given $\mathcal{N}=2$ QFT, a task previously intractable with computer scanning. As an example, we recover all minimal chambers of the $\text{SU}(2)$ $N_f = 4$ gauge theory, and discover new minimal chambers for theories that can be realized by IIB geometric engineering.</description>

      <title>Inequivalence between the Euclidean and Lorentzian versions of the type IIB matrix model from Lefschetz thimble calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The type IIB matrix model is conjectured to describe superstring theory nonperturbatively in terms of ten $N \times N$ bosonic traceless Hermitian matrices $A_\mu$ ($\mu=0, \ldots , 9$), whose eigenvalues correspond to $(9+1)$-dimensional space-time. Quite often, this model has been investigated in its Euclidean version, which is well defined although the ${\rm SO}(9,1)$ Lorentz symmetry of the original model is replaced by the ${\rm SO}(10)$ rotational symmetry. Recently, a well-defined model respecting the Lorentz symmetry has been proposed by gauge-fixing the Lorentz symmetry nonperturbatively using the Faddeev-Popov procedure. Here we investigate the two models by Monte Carlo simulations, overcoming the severe sign problem by the Lefschetz thimble method, in the case of matrix size $N=2$ omitting fermionic contributions. We add a quadratic term $\gamma \, \mathrm{tr} (A_\mu A^\mu)$ in the action and calculate the expectation values of rotationally symmetric (or Lorentz symmetric) observables as a function of the coefficient $\gamma$. Our results exhibit striking differences between the two models around $\gamma=0$ and in the $\gamma&gt;0$ region, associated with the appearance of different saddle points, clearly demonstrating their inequivalence against naive expectations from quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>On heat coefficients, multiplicative anomaly and 4D Casimir energy for GJMS operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This note aims to verify a prediction on the total derivative term of the 4D trace anomaly, and the corresponding heat coefficient, for GJMS operators. It stems from the explicit computation of an {\it improved} Casimir (or vacuum) energy on the sphere that takes into account the multiplicative anomaly among the (shifted) Laplacian factors and connects, via the Cappelli-Coste relation, with both the type A central charge and the total derivative term of the 4D trace anomaly. The present heat coefficient computation is based on Juhl's explicit formula for GJMS operators, Gilkey's formula for the integrated heat coefficient of higher-order Laplacians, and the \textit{conformal principle} by Branson and {\O}rsted.</description>

Abstract: The idea of reduction of couplings consists in the search for relations between seemingly independent couplings of a renormalizable theory that are renormalization group invariant. In this article, we demonstrate the existence of such 1-loop relations among the top Yukawa, the Higgs quartic and the gauge colour couplings of the Type-II Two Higgs Doublet Model at a high-energy boundary. The phenomenological viability of the reduced theory suggests the value of $\tan\beta$ and the scale in which new physics may appear.</description>

Abstract: We consider a scalar field coupled to the torsion in Teleparallel Gravity with a coupling function that does not allow for a tachyonic instability to occur, and it leads to the formation of new black holes with scalar hair. The scalarized black hole solutions are asymptotically flat, and they are studied under their thermodynamics, and we show that they are meta-stable solutions without phase transitions of first and second order. Also, we demonstrate the existence of distinct branches of solutions classified by the number of nodes of the scalar field. For the branches analysed, the scalarized solutions have lower free energy than the Schwarzschild black hole; therefore, they are always thermodinamically preferred. Also, we show that the scalarized black holes are entropically favoured compared to the Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02729v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geometric optics effectively describes the propagation of electromagnetic waves when the wavelength is much smaller than the characteristic length scale of the medium, making wave phenomena like diffraction negligible. As a result, light propagation in a vacuum is typically modeled by rays that follow null geodesics. However, general relativity predicts that polarization-dependent deviations from these geodesics occur in an inhomogeneous gravitational field. In this article, we evaluate the corrections for the deflection and emission of light by a massive gravitating body. Additionally, we derive the scaling behavior of the physical parameters characterizing the trajectories. The calculations are performed at leading order in frequency. We use these results to assess the significance of the birefringence effect in various astrophysical observations. We find that the effect cannot be measured with current instruments but may be detectable in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the homogeneous coordinate rings of partial flag varieties and Grassmannians in their Pl\"ucker embeddings and exhibit an embedding of the former into the latter. Both rings are cluster algebras and the embedding respects the cluster algebra structures in the sense that there exists a seed for the Grassmannian that restricts to a seed for the partial flag variety (\textit{i.e.} it is obtained by freezing and deleting some cluster variables).
  The motivation for this project stems from the application of cluster algebras in scattering amplitudes: spinor helicity and momentum twistor varieties describe massless scattering without assuming dual conformal symmetry. Both may be obtained from Grassmanninas which model the dual conformal case. They are instances of partial flag varieties and their cluster structures reveal information for the scattering amplitudes. As an application of our main result we exhibit the relation between these cluster algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17318v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: New constraints on the expansion rate of the Universe seem to favor evolving dark energy in the form of thawing quintessence models, i.e., models for which a canonical, minimally coupled scalar field has, at late times, begun to evolve away from potential energy domination. We scrutinize the evidence for thawing quintessence by exploring what it predicts for the equation of state. We show that, in terms of the usual Chevalier-Polarski-Linder parameters, ($w_0$, $w_a$), thawing quintessence is, in fact, only marginally consistent with a compilation of the current data. Despite this, we embrace the possibility that thawing quintessence is dark energy and find constraints on the microphysics of this scenario. We do so in terms of the effective mass $m^2$ and energy scale $V_0$ of the scalar field potential. We are particularly careful to enforce un-informative, flat priors on these parameters so as to minimize their effect on the final posteriors. While the current data favors a large and negative value of $m^2$, when we compare these models to the standard $\Lambda$CDM model we find that there is scant evidence for thawing quintessence.</description>

      <title>From spacetime thermodynamics to Weyl transverse gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There exist two consistent theories of self-interacting gravitons: general relativity and Weyl transverse gravity. The latter has the same classical solutions as general relativity, but different local symmetries. We argue that Weyl transverse gravity also naturally arises from thermodynamic arguments. In particular, we show that thermodynamic equilibrium of local causal diamonds together with the strong equivalence principle encodes the gravitational dynamics of Weyl transverse gravity rather than general relativity. We obtain this result in a self-consistent way, verifying the validity of our initial assumptions, i.e. the proportionality between entropy and area and the different versions of the equivalence principle in Weyl transverse gravity. Furthermore, we extend the thermodynamic derivation of the equations of motion from Weyl transverse gravity to a class of modified theories of gravity with the same local symmetries. For this purpose, we employ the general expression for Wald entropy in such theories.</description>

      <title>Wigner distributions in Rindler spacetime and nonvacuum Minkowski states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10054v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the 1970s, Fulling, Davies, and Unruh demonstrated that the vacuum state perceived by an inertial observer in Minkowski space appears as a thermal bath to a uniformly accelerated observer. We explore the transformation of the Wigner distribution of a real scalar field from an inertial to a Rindler frame, utilizing both Minkowski and Unruh modes. We present a general expression for the reduced Wigner distribution for a specific set of massless scalar field configurations, and validate it against known distributions within this set. This includes arbitrary Gaussian states of Unruh-Minkowski modes, the Minkowski vacuum state, the Rindler vacuum, and the thermal bath of Unruh particles. Additionally, we analyze several other distributions, such as a uniform momentum distribution, a slight deviation from the Minkowski vacuum, and a distribution with a Fermionic component in the Rindler frame. The conclusions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Finitely supertranslated Schwarzschild black hole and its perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A finitely supertranslated Schwarzschild black hole possesses nontrivial super-Lorentz charges compared with the standard one. This may impact the quasinormal modes of the black hole. Since the Einstein's equations are generally covariant, the quasinormal modes of a supertranslated black hole can be obtained by supertranslating the familiar results for a standard black hole. It turns out that the supertranslated quasinormal modes can be obtained by simply shifting the retarded time of the standard modes by an angle-dependent function parameterizing the supertranslation. Therefore, the supertranslated quasinormal modes oscillate at the same frequencies and decay at the same rates as the corresponding standard ones. The supertranslated metric is time translation invariant, but does not explicitly respect spherical symmetries, although it is implicitly rotationally symmetric. So the supertranslated perturbations can still be written as linear combinations of the eigenfunctions of the generalized angular momentum operators for the underlying rotational symmetry. With a suitably defined asymptotic parity transformation, any perturbation can be decomposed into the even and odd parity parts. Then, one may conclude that the isospectrality still holds. To detect such supertranslated quasinormal modes, one has to place multiple gravitational wave interferometers around the supertranslated black hole, and measure the differences in the time shifts between interferometers. Gravitational lensing may also be helpful in the same spirit.</description>

      <title>TMD-like functions through the twisted quark states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03741v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a new class of transverse momentum dependent functions (TMDs), as known as align-spin (AS) functions. In the paper, we propose the most suitable proof of the AS-function existence together with the demonstration of the preponderances if the framework of twisted quark states has been employed. The twisted state corresponds to the elementary particle (quark) which possesses the nontrivial intrinsic orbital angular momentum owing to the swirling trajectory of motion. In its turn, it leads to the cylindric system applied for the consideration. In this connection, we reveal that the twisted (vortex) quark states serve as effective tools for the study of TMDs, thereby facilitating a comprehensive analysis of AS-functions. In contrast to the previous studies, where the existence of new TMDs is related to the the corresponding interactions encoded in the correlators, we now focus on the leading order of interactions providing a simplified and robust method. This has been ensured by the twisted quark in the corresponding correlator because the essential transverse momentum dependence of quarks generated by interactions in the correlators can be alternatively described by the twisted states. Using a cylindrical formulation for twisted states, we can combine the properties of plane-wave particles with a description stemmed from spherical harmonics, resulting in well-defined propagation directions accompanied by essential OAM projections. In particular, this innovative framework opens a new window for the direct investigations of AS-functions, generating the unique angular $\phi$-dependence of differential cross sections. It also points towards promising applications in experimental particle physics.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Torque on an Inhomogeneous Chiral Body out of Thermal Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper we showed that an inhomogeneous body in vacuum will experience a spontaneous force if it is not in thermal equilibrium with its environment. This is due to the asymmetric asymptotic radiation pattern such an object emits. We demonstrated this self-propulsive force by considering an expansion in powers of the electric susceptibility: A torque arises in first order, but only if the material constituting the body is nonreciprocal. No force arises in first order. A force does occur for bodies made of ordinary (reciprocal) materials in second order. Here we extend these considerations to the torque. As one would expect, a spontaneous torque will also appear on an inhomogeneous chiral object if it is out of thermal equilibrium with its environment. Once a chiral body starts to rotate, it will experience a small quantum frictional torque, but much more important, unless a mechanism is provided to maintain the nonequilibrium state, is thermalization: The body will rapidly reach thermal equilibrium with the vacuum, and the angular acceleration will essentially become zero. For a small, or even a large, inhomogeneous chiral body, a terminal angular velocity will result, which seems to be in the realm of observability.</description>

      <title>Light rings and shadows of static black holes in effective quantum gravity II: A new solution without Cauchy horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among the three known types of static solutions proposed within the Hamiltonian constraint approach to effective quantum gravity (EQG), the first two have been extensively investigated, whereas the third type-which preserves general covariance, is free of Cauchy horizons, and was only recently obtained-remains relatively unexplored. This solution can describe a black hole with an event horizon for certain parameter ranges, or a horizonless compact object beyond those ranges. In this paper, we focus on the third type and show that its light rings feature both stable and unstable branches, and that the black hole shadow size grows with the quantum parameter-unlike in the first two types. However, when we account for both the shadow and the lensing ring, the overall behavior closely resembles that of the second type, in which an increasing quantum parameter leads to a larger portion of the lensing ring being occupied by the shadow. This feature can serve as a hallmark of black holes in EQG, offering a potential way to distinguish them from their GR counterparts. Remarkably, the parameter ranges under which the solution remains a black hole are highly consistent with the current observational constraints on black hole shadows, lending strong support to the classification of the third type of compact object in EQG as a black hole endowed with an event horizon.</description>

      <title>Cosmological quantum mechanics on FLRW spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18295v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We apply our recent formulation of general relativistic quantum mechanics to the case of an FLRW cosmological background. The formalism comes from noncommutative geometry and provides an operator version of the equations of a geodesic, while its Schroedinger picture has wave functions on spacetime and evolution by the Klein-Gordon operator and with respect to geodesic proper time. Stationary states in this Klein-Gordon quantum mechanics are solutions of the Klein-Gordon equation for different eigenvalues and in the case of positive spatial curvature we find a discrete spectrum of cosmological atom-like modes. For nonstationary states, we show that the system can be factorised and appears for each spatial Laplacian eigenvector as a novel 1-dimensional quantum system on the time axis with potential $1/a(t)^2$, where $a(t)$ is the Friedmann expansion factor. We also show how this is relevant to quantum mechanics on space with respect to time $t$, identifying potentially new physics when the Hubble constant exceeds $2/3$ of the particle mass, as typically occurs during inflation. We also find washout of the evolution of spatial observables at late times and a backward-traveling reflected mode generated when the value of $H$ transitions to a larger value.</description>
