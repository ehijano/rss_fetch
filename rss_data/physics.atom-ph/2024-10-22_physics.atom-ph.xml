      <title>Dead-zone-free single-beam atomic magnetometer based on free-induction-decay of Rb atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Free-induction-decay (FID) magnetometers have evolved as simple magnetic sensors for sensitive detection of unknown magnetic fields. However, these magnetometers suffer from a fundamental problem known as a "dead zone," making them insensitive to certain magnetic field directions. Here, we demonstrate a simple experimental scheme for the dead-zone-free operation of a FID atomic magnetometer. Using a single laser beam containing equal strength of linear- and circular-polarization components and amplitude-modulation at a low-duty cycle, we have synchronously pumped the rubidium-87 atoms with both first- and second-order frequency harmonics. Such a novel pumping scheme has enabled us to observe the free Larmor precession of atomic spins at a frequency of $\Omega_L$ (orientation) and/or 2$\Omega_L$ (alignment) in a single FID signal, depending on the direction of the external magnetic field. We observed that the amplitude of the FID signal does not go to zero for any magnetic field direction, proving the absence of dead zones in the magnetometer. The magnetometer has a sensitivity in the range of 3.5 - 7.8 pT/$\sqrt{Hz}$ in all directions. Such a generic experimental scheme can play a crucial role in developing miniaturized atomic magnetometers for various practical applications, including geomagnetic applications.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Transformations of Atoms Under the Influence of Acoustic Oscillations on Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of studies on the properties of ordinary and heavy water subjected to sharp mechanical impacts at acoustic repetition frequency are presented. Experimental evidence for the phenomenon of acoustically induced nuclear processes in water is provided, supported by direct measurements of radiation emission and the formation of new elements, which cannot be explained by chemical reactions. The complex influence of mechanical oscillations on changes in the concentrations of stable isotopes of elements such as Ti, B, Na, Mg, and Li in water is demonstrated. The cause of surface erosion of metal structures during cavitation in water is explained through the formation of fluorine and the subsequent creation of aggressive HF acid molecules. A mechanism for the occurrence of sonoluminescence under sharp acoustic impact on water is proposed.</description>

      <title>State Selective Preparation and Nondestructive Detection of Trapped ${\rm O}_2^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to prepare molecular ions in selected quantum states enables studies in areas such as chemistry, metrology, spectroscopy, quantum information, and precision measurements. Here, we demonstrate (2+1) resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) of oxygen, both in a molecular beam and in an ion trap. The two-photon transition in the REMPI spectrum is rotationally resolved, allowing ionization from a selected rovibrational state of ${\rm O}_2$. Fits to this spectrum determine spectroscopic parameters of the ${\rm O}_2$ $d\,^1\Pi_g$ state and resolve a discrepancy in the literature regarding its band origin. The trapped molecular ions are cooled by co-trapped atomic ions. Fluorescence mass spectrometry nondestructively demonstrates the presence of the photoionized ${\rm O}_2^+$. We discuss strategies for maximizing the fraction of ions produced in the ground rovibrational state. The combination of state-selective loading and nondestructive detection of trapped molecular ions has applications in optical clocks, tests of fundamental physics, and control of chemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Dual wavelength brillouin laser terahertz source stabilized to carbonyl sulfide rotational transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical-based terahertz sources are important for many burgeoning scientific and technological applications. Among such applications is precision spectroscopy of molecules, which exhibit rotational transitions at terahertz frequencies. Stemming from precision spectroscopy is frequency discrimination and stabilization of terahertz sources. Because many molecular species exist in the gas phase at room temperature, their transitions are prime candidates for practical terahertz frequency references. We demonstrate the stabilization of a low phase-noise, dual-wavelength Brillouin laser (DWBL) terahertz oscillator to a rotational transition of carbonyl sulfide (\ce{OCS}). We achieve an instability of $1.2\times10^{-12}/\sqrt{\tau}$, where $\tau$ is the averaging time in seconds. The signal-to-noise ratio and intermodulation limitations of the experiment are also discussed. We thus demonstrate a highly stable and spectrally pure terahertz frequency source. Our presented architecture will likely benefit metrology, spectroscopy, precision terahertz studies, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum information collapse-and-revival in a strongly-interacting Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interactions of isolated quantum many-body systems typically scramble local information into the entire system and make it unrecoverable. Ergodicity-breaking systems possess the potential to exhibit fundamentally different information scrambling dynamics beyond this paradigm. For many-body localized systems with strong ergodicity breaking, local transport vanishes and information scrambles logarithmically slowly. Whereas in Rydberg atom arrays, local qubit flips induce dynamical retardation on surrounding qubits through the Rydberg blockade effect, giving rise to quantum many-body scars that weakly break ergodicity, and resulting in the predicted unconventional quantum information spreading behaviours. Here, we present the first measurements of out-of-time-ordered correlators and Holevo information in a Rydberg atom array, enabling us to precisely track quantum information scrambling and transport dynamics. By leveraging these tools, we observe a novel spatio-temporal collapse-and-revival behaviour of quantum information, which differs from both typical chaotic and many-body localized systems. Our experiment sheds light on the unique information dynamics in many-body systems with kinetic constraints, and demonstrates an effective digital-analogue approach to coherently reverse time evolution and steer information propagation in near-term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Binding energies, charge radii, spins and moments: odd-odd Ag isotopes and discovery of a new isomer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the masses and hyperfine structure of ground and isomeric states in $^{114,116,118,120}$Ag isotopes, measured with the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique (PI-ICR) with the JYFLTRAP mass spectrometer and the collinear laser spectroscopy beamline at the Ion Guide Isotope Separator On-Line (IGISOL) facility, Jyv\"askyl\"a, Finland. We measured the masses and excitation energies, electromagnetic moments, and charge radii, and firmly established the nuclear spins of the long-lived states. A new isomer was discovered in $^{118}$Ag and the half-lives of $^{118}$Ag long-lived states were reevaluated. We unambiguously pinned down the level ordering of all long-lived states, placing the inversion of the $I = 0^-$ and $I = 4^+$ states at $A = 118$ $(N = 71)$. Lastly, we compared the electromagnetic moments of each state to empirical single-particle moments to identify the dominant configuration where possible.</description>

      <title>Simulating quantum emitters in arbitrary photonic environments using FDTD: beyond the semi-classical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical algorithm that integrates quantum two-level systems (TLSs) into the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) framework for simulating quantum emitters in arbitrary 3D photonic environments. Conventional methods struggle with these systems due to their semi-classical nature and spurious self-interactions that arise when a TLS is driven by its own radiation field. We address these issues by determining the correct electric field for driving the TLS, as well as the current source used in FDTD for modeling photon emission. Our method, focusing on single-excitation states, employs a total field-incident field (TF-IF) technique to eliminate self-interactions, enabling precise simulations of photon emission and scattering. The algorithm also successfully models complex phenomena such as resonant energy transfer, superradiance, and vacuum Rabi splitting. This powerful computational tool is expected to substantially advance research in nanophotonics, quantum physics, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Observation of anomalous information scrambling in a Rydberg atom array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling, which describes the propagation and effective loss of local information, is crucial for understanding the dynamics of quantum many-body systems. In general, a typical interacting system would thermalize under time evolution, leading to the emergence of ergodicity and linear lightcones of information scrambling. Whereas, for a many-body localized system, strong disorders give rise to an extensive number of conserved quantities that prevent the system from thermalization, resulting in full ergodicity breaking and a logarithmic lightcone for information spreading. Here, we report the experimental observation of anomalous information scrambling in an atomic tweezer array. Working in the Rydberg blockade regime, where van der Waals interaction dominates, we observe a suppressed linear lightcone of information spreading characterized by out-of-time-order correlators for the initial N\'eel state, accompanied by persistent oscillations within the lightcone. Such an anomalous dynamics differs from both generic thermal and many-body localized scenarios. It originates from weak ergodicity breaking and is the characteristic feature for quantum many-body scars. The high-quality single-atom manipulations and coherent constraint dynamics, augmented by the effective protocol for time-reversed evolution we demonstrate, establish a versatile hybrid analog-digital simulation approach to explore diverse exotic non-equilibrium dynamics with atomic tweezer arrays.</description>

      <title>Multiple ionization, fragmentation and dehydrogenation of coronene in collision with swift proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coronene molecules have been bombarded by protons of energy by 75 to 300 keV. The time of flight mass spectrum has been recorded using a two stage Wiley McLaren type spectrometer. A large enhancement in the doubly and triply ionized recoil ion is observed compared to the singly ionized one. The single, double and triple ionization yields have also been calculated using the continuum distorted wave eikonal initial state (CDW EIS) theoretical model and are compared with the experimental results. Experimental double to single ionization yield ratios and triple to single ionization yield ratios have been compared with the theoretical ratios which are found to be much higher w.r. t. the gas atoms. Evaporation peaks due to the loss of several neutral C2H2 and C3H3 are observed corresponding to their parent singly, doubly and triply charge coronene ions. Small fragmentation peaks CnHx+ (n = 3 to 7) are present in the spectra due to higher energy transfer by the projectile to the molecule. The hydrogen losses are observed in the cation, di-cation and tri-cation coronene peak structures. A maximum of the 7 H losses are detected which depends on the beam energy.</description>

      <title>Higher-order and fractional discrete time crystals in Floquet-driven Rydberg atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13657v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order and fractional discrete time crystals (DTCs) are exotic phases of matter where the discrete time translation symmetry is broken into higher-order and non-integer category. Generation of these unique DTCs has been widely studied theoretically in different systems. However, no current experimental methods can probe these higher-order and fractional DTCs in any quantum many-body systems. We demonstrate an experimental approach to observe higher-order and fractional DTCs in Floquet-driven Rydberg atomic gases. We have discovered multiple $n$-DTCs with integer values of $n$ = 2, 3, and 4, and others ranging up to 14, along with fractional $n$-DTCs with $n$ values beyond the integers. The system response can transition between adjacent integer DTCs, during which the fractional DTCs are investigated. Study of higher-order and fractional DTCs expands fundamental knowledge of non-equilibrium dynamics and is promising for discovery of more complex temporal symmetries beyond the single discrete time translation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Molecular Quantum Control Algorithm Design by Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Precision measurements of polyatomic molecules offer an unparalleled paradigm to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. The rich internal structure within these molecules makes them exquisite sensors for detecting fundamental symmetry violations, local position invariance, and dark matter. While trapping and control of diatomic and a few very simple polyatomic molecules have been experimentally demonstrated, leveraging the complex rovibrational structure of more general polyatomics demands the development of robust and efficient quantum control schemes. In this study, we present a general, reinforcement-learning-designed, quantum logic approach to prepare molecular ions in a single, pure quantum state. The reinforcement learning agent optimizes the pulse sequence, each followed by a projective measurement, and probabilistically manipulates the collapse of the quantum system to a single state. The performance of the control algorithm is numerically demonstrated in the case of a CaH$^+$ ion, with up to 96 thermally populated eigenstates and under the disturbance of environmental thermal radiation. We expect that the method developed, with physics-informed learning, will be directly implemented for quantum control of polyatomic molecular ions with densely populated structures, enabling new experimental tests of fundamental theories.</description>
