      <title>RT-utils: A Minimal Python Library for RT-struct Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Towards the need for automated and precise AI-based analysis of medical images, we present RT-utils, a specialized Python library tuned for the manipulation of radiotherapy (RT) structures stored in DICOM format. RT-utils excels in converting the polygon contours into binary masks, ensuring accuracy and efficiency. By converting DICOM RT structures into standardized formats such as NumPy arrays and SimpleITK Images, RT-utils optimizes inputs for computational solutions such as AI-based automated segmentation techniques or radiomics analysis. Since its inception in 2020, RT-utils has been used extensively with a focus on simplifying complex data processing tasks. RT-utils offers researchers a powerful solution to enhance workflows and drive significant advancements in medical imaging.</description>

      <title>A statistical reconstruction algorithm for positronium lifetime imaging using time-of-flight positron emission tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.06463v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) is an important modality for diagnosing diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's disease, capable of revealing the uptake of radiolabeled molecules that target specific pathological markers of the diseases. Recently, positronium lifetime imaging (PLI) that adds to traditional PET the ability to explore properties of the tissue microenvironment beyond tracer uptake has been demonstrated with time-of-flight (TOF) PET and the use of non-pure positron emitters. However, achieving accurate reconstruction of lifetime images from data acquired by systems having a finite TOF resolution still presents a challenge. This paper focuses on the two-dimensional PLI, introducing a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method that employs an exponentially modified Gaussian (EMG) probability distribution that describes the positronium lifetime data produced by TOF PET. We evaluate the performance of our EMG-based MLE method against \st{traditional} approaches using exponential likelihood functions and penalized surrogate methods. Results from computer-simulated data reveal that the proposed EMG-MLE method can yield quantitatively accurate lifetime images. We also demonstrate that the proposed MLE formulation can be extended to handle PLI data containing multiple positron populations.</description>

      <title>Advances in the Large Area Picosecond Photo-Detector (LAPPD): 8" x 8" MCP-PMT with Capacitively Coupled Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present advances made in the Large Area Picosecond Photodetector (LAPPD), an 8" $\times$ 8" microchannel plate photomultiplier tube (MCP-PMT), since pilot production was initiated at Incom, Inc. in 2018. The Gen-I LAPPD utilizes a stripline anode for direct charge readout. The novel Gen-II LAPPD employs an internal resistive thin-film which capacitively couples to a customizable external signal readout board, streamlining production. The Gen-II LAPPD, with an active area of 373 cm$^2$, is capable of high single photoelectron (PE) gain of $\sim$10$^7$, low dark rates ($\sim$1 kHz/cm$^2$), single PE timing resolution of $\sim$65 ps, and $\mathcal{O}$(mm) position resolution. Coupled with a UV-grade fused silica window, the LAPPD features a high quantum efficiency (QE) bialkali photocathode of $&gt;$30% with spectral response down to $\sim$165 nm. The LAPPD is an excellent candidate for electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) timing layers, photon-based neutrino detectors, high energy collider experiments, medical imaging systems, and nuclear non-proliferation applications.</description>
