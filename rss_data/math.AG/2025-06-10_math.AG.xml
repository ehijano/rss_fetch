      <title>Heuristics for (ir)reducibility of $p$-rank strata of the moduli space of hyperelliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}_g$ denote the moduli space of smooth hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ in characteristic $p\geq 3$, and let $\mathcal{H}_g^f$ denote the $p$-rank $f$ stratum of $\mathcal{H}_g$ for $0 \leq f \leq g$. Achter and Pries note in their 2011 work that determining the number of irreducible components of $\mathcal{H}_g^f$ would lead to several intriguing corollaries. In this paper, we present a computational approach for estimating the number of irreducible components in various $p$-rank strata. Our strategy involves sampling curves over finite fields and calculating their $p$-ranks. From the data gathered, we conjecture that the non-ordinary locus is geometrically irreducible for all genera $g&gt; 1$. The data also leads us to conjecture that the moduli space $\mathcal{H}^{g-2}_g$ is irreducible and suggests that $\mathcal{H}^f_g$ is irreducible for all $1 \leq f \leq g$. We conclude with a brief discussion on $\mathcal{H}^0_g$.</description>

      <title>The Chow Ring of the 2-Sylow Subgroup of $\mathrm{GL}(4,2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a computation of the mod 2 Chow ring of the motivic \'etale classifying space of the finite group $\mathrm{Syl}_2(\mathrm{GL}(4,2))$. It outlines a general computation strategy, adapted from work by Burt Totaro, that has been largely automated by the author. This strategy can be used to compute more examples of Chow rings of motivic \'etale classifying spaces quickly.</description>

      <title>Remarks on Higgs bundles twisted by a vector bundle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any V-twisted Higgs bundle on a compact Riemann surface X, where V is a holomorphic vector bundle of rank two on X, there are two associated Higgs bundles on X, twisted by line bundles, which are constructed using a Hecke transformation on V. We characterize all such pairs of Higgs bundles (twisted by line bundles) given by V-twisted Higgs bundles. Using this characterization, we provide a spectral correspondence for the moduli space, identifying V-twisted Higgs bundles with the direct images of certain rank one torsionfree Higgs sheaves twisted by a line bundle on a spectral covering of the curve X.</description>

      <title>Persistence of Galois property of integral hypersurfaces across other characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate hypersurfaces in projective spaces defined over the integers. We demonstrate that if a projection from a point is Galois extension a base field with a certain characteristic, it remains Galois after a base change to a field with another characteristic. Furthermore, for quartic hypersurfaces, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the Galois group to be given by a projective linear group, depending on the characteristic of the base field.</description>

      <title>Mirror Symmetry in Geometric Constraints: Analytic and Riemann-Roch Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the discovery of mirror symmetry phenomena in compatible pair Spencer complexes, this paper develops rigorous analytical foundations through systematic application of elliptic perturbation theory and characteristic class analysis. We establish a comprehensive multi-level framework revealing the mathematical mechanisms underlying the symbolic transformation $(D,\lambda) \mapsto (D,-\lambda)$: metric invariance analysis via Spencer metric theory, topological isomorphisms through elliptic operator perturbation methods, and algebraic geometric equivalences via GAGA principle and characteristic class machinery.
  Main results include: (1) Rigorous proof of Spencer-Hodge Laplacian perturbation relations and cohomological mirror isomorphisms using Fredholm theory; (2) Complete characteristic class equivalence theorems establishing algebraic geometric foundations for mirror symmetry; (3) Systematic Spencer-Riemann-Roch decomposition formulas with explicit error estimates on Calabi-Yau manifolds; (4) Computational verification frameworks demonstrated on elliptic curves.
  This research demonstrates that mirror symmetry in constraint geometry possesses deep analytical structure accessible through modern elliptic theory and algebraic geometry, establishing Spencer complexes as a bridge between constraint analysis and contemporary geometric theory.</description>

      <title>Spencer Differential Degeneration Theory and Its Applications in Algebraic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the compatible pair theory of principal bundle constraint systems, this paper discovers and establishes a complete Spencer differential degeneration theory. We prove that when symmetric tensors satisfy a $\lambda$-dependent kernel condition $\delta_{\mathfrak{g}}^{\lambda}(s)=0$, the Spencer differential degenerates to the standard exterior differential, thus establishing a precise bridge between the complex Spencer theory and the classical de Rham theory. One of the advances in this paper is the rigorous proof that this degeneration condition remains stable under mirror transformations, revealing the profound symmetry origins of this phenomenon. Based on these rigorous mathematical results, we construct a canonical mapping from degenerate Spencer cocycles to de Rham cohomology and elucidate its geometric meaning. Finally, we demonstrate the application potential of this theory in algebraic geometry, particularly on K3 surfaces, where we preliminarily verify that this framework can systematically identify (1,1)-Hodge classes satisfying algebraicity conditions. This work provides new perspectives and technical approaches for studying algebraic invariants using tools from constraint geometry.</description>

Abstract: In this article we describe the

  reductive algebraic group $G$. In particular, our results extend the
  results in \cite{u1} and \cite{u2} on the regular embeddings of $G$,
  to the equivariant topological $K$-ring of a larger class of
  (possibly singular) cellular toroidal embeddings. They are also a
  topological analogue of the results in \cite{gon} on the operational
  equivariant algebraic $K$-ring, for cellular toroidal
  embeddings.</description>

      <title>Trigonometric Ratios Can Prove the Pythagorean Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent interest in noncircular trigonometric proofs has underscored the need for alternative methodologies. Jackson and Johnson's 2024 study addresses a longstanding gap in the foundations of trigonometric proofs. Inspired by the work of Jackson and Johnson [JJ24], we present three noncircular proofs of the Pythagorean theorem based on trigonometric identities. First, we establish the Pythagorean theorem via an isosceles triangle construction and the tangent double-angle formula. Second, we present an alternative proof utilizing an isosceles-triangle and the angle-bisector theorem. Third, we derive a novel trigonometric relation from the angle-bisector theorem, thereby unifying and extending the two preceding approaches. These approaches collectively demonstrate that the principal contribution of Jackson and Johnson lies in their strategic use of the double-angle formula. These proofs clarify the role of trigonometric identities independent of infinite series.</description>

      <title>On gluing and splitting series invariants of plumbed 3-manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study series invariants for plumbed 3-manifolds and knot complements twisted by a root lattice. Our series recover recent results of Gukov-Pei-Putrov-Vafa, Gukov-Manolescu, Park, and Ri and apply more generally to 3-manifolds which are not necessarily negative definite. We show that our series verify certain gluing and splitting properties related to the corresponding operations on 3-manifolds. We conclude with an explicit description of the case of lens spaces and Brieskorn spheres.</description>

Abstract: We propose a conjecture on the $p$-adic nowhere density of the Hecke orbit of subvarieties of Hodge type Shimura varieties. By investigating the monodromy of $p$-adic Galois representations associated with points on such Shimura varieties, we prove that the locus in a formal $\mathcal{O}_K$-neighborhood of a mod $p$ point that has large monodromy is open dense, where $K$ is a totally ramified finite extension of $\breve{\mathbb{Q}}_p.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shellability of the boundary complex of an unbounded polyhedron is investigated. To this end, it is necessary to pass to a suitable compactification, e.g., by one point. This observation can be exploited to prove that any tropical hypersurface is shellable. Under the hood there is a subtle interplay between the duality of polyhedral complexes and their shellability. Translated into discrete Morse theory, that interplay entails that the tight span of an arbitrary regular subdivision is collapsible, but not shellable in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive two finiteness properties as consequences of the geometrical non-degeneracy of an algebraic subvariety $W$ of a power of the multiplicative group, concerning the intersections of $W$ with translates of a subtorus $H$ of dimension greater than or equal to the codimension of $W$. The first one is that every translate of $H$ intersects $W$, unless $H$ is contained in one of finitely many proper subtori depending only on $W$. The second one is that every translate of $H$ by a torsion point intersects $W$, unless the translate is contained in one of finitely many proper algebraic subgroups, again depending only on $W$. We use methods from tropical geometry and equidistribution, as well as some very mild model theory.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Geometry of Cactus, Pascal, and Pappus Matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study rank-three matroids, known as point-line configurations, and their associated matroid varieties, defined as the Zariski closures of their realization spaces. Our focus is on determining finite generating sets of defining equations for these varieties, up to radical, and describing the irreducible components of the corresponding circuit varieties. We generalize the notion of cactus graphs to matroids, introducing a family of point-line configurations whose underlying graphs are cacti. Our analysis includes several classical matroids, such as the Pascal, Pappus, and cactus matroids, for which we provide explicit finite generating sets for their associated matroid ideals. The matroid ideal is the ideal of the matroid variety, whose construction involves a saturation step with respect to all the independence relations of the matroid. This step is computationally very expensive and has only been carried out for very small matroids. We provide a complete generating set of these ideals for the Pascal, Pappus, and cactus matroids. The proofs rely on classical geometric techniques, including liftability arguments and the Grassmann--Cayley algebra, which we use to construct so-called bracket polynomials in these ideals. In addition, we prove that every cactus matroid is realizable and that its matroid variety is irreducible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide a deep and systematic study of the classes of what it means to be an immersion, a submersion, a local diffeomorphism, and unramified in a tangent category. We also give a systematic study of the ways in which these classes of morphisms interact, the properties they have, and give very explicit and concrete characterizations of how each class of maps appear in algebraic geometry, in differential geometry, in the theory of semirings, and in the theory of Cartesian differential categories. Additionally, we discuss the notion of being carrable with respect to the tangent bundle projection, then use this to define the notion of horizontal descent in a tangent category, which we then use as a key tool to study the aforementioned classes of morphisms. We in particular use this to define a de Rham relative cotangent complex in an arbitrary tangent category and to give a partial answer of when it is that a submersion admits not just a section but a section which is linear.</description>

      <title>A necessary condition for liftings of positive characteristic varieties with finite fundamental groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a necessary condition for the existence of characteristic zero liftings of certain smooth, proper varieties in positive characteristic, using \'etale homotopy theory and Wall's finiteness obstruction. For a variety with finite \'etale fundamental group pi, we define a notion of mod-l finite dominatedness based on the F_l-chain complex of the universal cover of its l-profinite \'etale homotopy type. We prove that such a variety can be lifted to characteristic zero only if this complex is quasi-isomorphic to a bounded complex of finitely generated projective F_l[pi]$-modules. This extends classical finiteness results in topology to the l-adic and algebro-geometric setting.</description>

      <title>Shrinking dynamic on multidimensional tropical series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.07982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.07982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define multidimensional tropical series, i.e. piecewise linear functions which are tropical polynomials locally but may contain an infinite number of monomials. Tropical series appeared in the study of the growth of pluriharmonic functions. However, our motivation stems from sandpile models where certain wave dynamic governs the behavior of sand and exhibits a power law (so far only experimental evidence). In this paper we lay the groundwork for tropical series and corresponding tropical analytical hypersurfaces in the multidimensional setting. The main object of study is an $\Omega$-tropical series where $\Omega$ is a compact convex domain which can be thought of as the region of convergence of such a series.
  Our main theorem is that the sandpile dynamics producing an $\Omega$-tropical analytical hypersurface passing through a given finite set of points can always be slightly perturbed so that the intermediate $\Omega$-tropical analytical hypersurfaces have only mild singularities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.00889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a target variety $X$ and a nodal curve $C$, we introduce a one-parameter stability condition, termed $\epsilon$-admissibility, for maps from nodal curves to $X\times C$. If $X$ is a point, $\epsilon$-admissibility interpolates between moduli spaces of stable maps to $C$ relative to some fixed points and moduli spaces of admissible covers with arbitrary ramifications over the same fixed points and simple ramifications elsewhere on $C$. Using Zhou's entangled tails, we prove wall-crossing formulas relating invariants for different values of $\epsilon$. If $X$ is a surface, we use this wall-crossing in conjunction with author's quasimap wall-crossing to show that the relative Pandharipande-Thomas/Gromov-Witten correspondence of $X\times C$ and Ruan's extended crepant resolution conjecture of the pair $X^{[n]}$ and $[X^{(n)}]$ are equivalent up to explicit wall-crossings. We thereby prove the crepant resolution conjecture for 3-point genus-0 invariants in all classes, if $X$ is a toric del Pezzo surface.</description>

Abstract: We provide a relative version of the trace map from the work of Beyer, which can be associated to any finite tale morphism $X \to Y$ of smooth rigid Stein spaces and which then relates the Serre duality on $X$ with the Serre duality on $Y$. Furthermore, we consider the behaviour of any rigid Stein space under (completed) base change to any complete extension field and deduce a commutative diagram relating Serre duality over the base field with the Serre duality over the extension field.</description>

Abstract: This work establishes new results on the classification of $t$-structures for many subcategories of the derived category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a Noetherian scheme. Our work makes progress in two different directions. On one hand, we provide an improvement of a result of Takahashi on $t$-structures, generalizing it to the case of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on a quasi-compact CM-excellent scheme of finite Krull dimension. On the other hand, via independent techniques, we prove a variation of a recent result of Neeman which resolved a conjecture of Antieau, Gepner, and Heller.</description>

Abstract: In their homonymous article, Sam Payne and Thomas Willwacher construct a combinatorial graph complex to compute the weight 11 part of the compactly supported cohomology of the moduli space of curves $\cM_{g,n}$ and compute explicitly the cohomology of the introduced graph complexes in cases of complexes of excess zero, one, two, and three. In this paper, we extend the computation the cohomology to excess four graph complexes. Along the way, we give more details on generators, the computation process, and the definition of the graph complex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06616v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A moduli space of stable maps to the fibers of a fiber bundle is constructed. The new moduli space is a family version of the classical moduli space of stable maps to a non-singular complex projective variety. The virtual cycle for this moduli space is also constructed, and an analogue of Gromov-Witten invariants is defined. As an application, we recover the formula for the number of rational degree d curves in P3, whose image lies in a plane in P3 (known as planar curves in P3), intersecting r general lines while passing through given s general points, where r + 2s = 3d + 2, firstly proved by R. Mukherjee, R. Kumar Singh and the fourth named author.</description>

Our proofs are based on Terracini's classification of defective surfaces, careful analysis of the intersection theory of moment varieties, and a recent result on sufficient conditions for rational identifiability of secant varieties by Massarenti--Mella.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the generating series of special cycles on $\mathcal{A}_1(N)\times \mathcal{A}_g(N)$, with full level $N$ structure, valued in the cohomology of degree $2g$. The modularity theorem of Kudla-Millson for locally symmetric spaces implies that these series are modular. When $N=1$, the images of these loci in $\mathcal{A}_g$ are the $d$-elliptic Noether-Lefschetz loci, which are conjectured to be modular. In the appendix, it is shown that the resulting modular forms are nonzero for $g=2$ when $N\geq 11$ and $N\neq 12$.</description>

Abstract: A. Weil identified a 2-dimensional space of rational classes of Hodge type (n,n) in the middle cohomology of every 2n-dimensional abelian variety with a suitable complex multiplication by an imaginary quadratic number field. These abelian varieties are said to be of Weil type and these Hodge classes are known as Weil classes. We prove that the Weil classes are algebraic for all abelian sixfold of Weil type of discriminant -1, for all imaginary quadratic number fields. The algebraicity of the Weil classes follows for all abelian fourfolds of Weil type (for all discriminants and all imaginary quadratic number fields), by a degeneration argument of C. Schoen. The Hodge Conjecture for abelian fourfolds is known to follow from the above result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of the intersection cohomology of moduli spaces of semistable bundles was initiated by Frances Kirwan in the 1980's. In this paper, we give a complete geometric proof of a recursive formula, which reduces the calculation of the intersection Betti numbers of the moduli spaces of semistable bundles on Riemann surfaces in degree-0 and arbitrary rank to the known formulas of the Betti numbers of the smooth, degree-1 moduli spaces. Our formula was motivated by the work of Mozgovoy and Reineke from 2015, and appears as a consequence of the Decomposition Theorem applied to the forgetful map from a parabolic moduli space. We give a detailed description of the topology of this map, and that of the relevant local systems. Our work is self-contained, geometric and focuses on using the multiplicative structures of the theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In arXiv:2409.03960, we introduced an approach to the question of extendability of projective varieties via degeneration to ribbons. In this article we build on these methods to give a new proof of optimal results on the extendability of general non-prime $K3$ surfaces, classification of non-prime Fano threefolds and Mukai varieties and the irreducibility of their Hilbert schemes. The methods in this article also show the non-extendability of prime $K3$ surfaces for infinitely many values of $g$, for example when $g$ is of the form $g = 4k+1$, $k \geq 5$. This involves degenerations of $K3$ surfaces to ribbons on embedded Hirzebruch surfaces, called $K3$ carpets. We directly give optimal upper bounds on the cohomology of the twisted normal bundle of the $K3$ carpets instead of computing coranks of Gaussian maps of the canonical curve sections. As a result of independent interest, we show such $K3$ carpets also appear as degenerations of smoothable simple normal crossings of two Hirzebruch surfaces embedded by arbitrary linear series intersecting along an anticanonical elliptic curve. Such type II degenerations constitute a smooth locus of codimension $6$ in the Hilbert scheme of $K3$ surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a smooth algebraic variety X with an action of a connected reductive linear algebraic group G, and an equivariant D-module M, we study the G-decompositions of the associated V-, Hodge, and weight filtrations.
  If M is the localization of a D-module S underlying a mixed twistor D-module (e.g. when S is simple) along a semi-invariant function, we determine the weight level of any element in an irreducible isotypic component of M in terms of multiplicities of roots of b-functions. If S underlies a pure Hodge module, we show that the Hodge level is governed by the degrees of another class of polynomials, also expressible in terms of b-functions.
  As an application, if X is an affine spherical variety, we describe these filtrations representation-theoretically in terms of roots of b-functions, and compute all higher multiplier and Hodge ideals associated with semi-invariant functions. Examples include the spaces of general, skew-symmetric, and symmetric matrices, as well as the Freudenthal cubic on the fundamental representation of E_6.</description>

Abstract: For a smooth projective variety X over an arbitrary field k, we discuss the surjectivity of the Albanese map from the Chow group of zero-cycles of degree zero on X to the group of rational points of the Albanese variety of X. Over arithmetic fields, we use Severi-Brauer fibrations to produce examples where the map is not surjective. For varieties X over the complex field, we discuss the question after extension of the complex field to function fields of varieties. This is related to C. Voisin's notion of universal zero-cycle and to rationality questions for rationally connected threefolds.</description>

Abstract: Moduli spaces of admissible covers and stable maps of target curves give rise to cycles on $\overline{M}_{g,n}$. We prove a formula relating these cycles. It recovers both the Ekedahl-Lando-Shapiro-Vainshtein formula and the Gromov-Witten/Hurwitz correspondence, providing a cycle-theoretic refinement thereof. The formula is verified computationally in low-genus cases with the help of Johannes Schmitt.</description>

      <title>Isotropic Torsors on Smooth Algebras over Pr\"ufer Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Grothendieck--Serre conjecture predicts that every generically trivial torsor under a reductive group over a regular semilocal ring is itself trivial. Extending the work of \v{C}esnavi\v{c}ius and Fedorov, we prove a non-noetherian analogue of this conjecture for rings $A$ that are semilocalisations of smooth schemes over valuation rings of rank one, and for reductive $A$-group schemes $G$ that are totally isotropic. Roughly speaking, such group schemes are characterised by the existence of a parabolic subgroup of their adjoint quotients. Since quasi-split groups are totally isotropic, our result, in particular, generalises the Grothendieck--Serre result of Guo--Liu and the author's thesis. Our proof relies on a new instance of Gabber's presentation lemma, obtained by extending techniques developed in the author's thesis.</description>

      <title>Quiver Schemes for Nongeneric Stability and Cornering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the Le Bruyn--Procesi theorem to prove several results on quiver schemes for nongeneric stability conditions: We show that the stability-zero finite-type Nakajima quiver schemes are reduced points and give an example of a closely related nonreduced quiver scheme. In broader generality, we prove that adding modules supported on stability-zero vertices induces closed embeddings of quiver schemes, and show how in many cases the quiver scheme associated with the cornered algebra defines a limit to this system of embeddings. As an application, we show that there is an isomorphism between the underlying reduced schemes of certain equivariant Quot schemes and Nakajima quiver varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $R$ be the field of real Puiseux series. It is a real closed field. We construct the first examples of smooth intersections of two quadrics in $\mathbb{P}_R^5$ and smooth cubic hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}_R^4$ which are not stably rational but for which the space $X(R)$ of $R$-points is semi-algebraically connected. The question of constructing such examples over the field of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ remains open.</description>

      <title>Bernstein-Sato functional equations for ideals in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an ideal of a regular $\cc$-algebra, its Bernstein-Sato polynomial is the monic polynomial of the lowest degree satisfying an Bernstein-Sato functional equation. We generalize the notion of Bernstein-Sato functional equations to the case of ideals in an $F$-finite ring of positive characteristic $p$, and show the relationship between these equations and Bernstein-Sato roots. By applying this theory, we provide an explicit description of Bernstein-Sato roots of a weighted homogeneous polynomial with an isolated singularity at the origin in characteristic $p$. Moreover, we give multiplicative and additive Thom-Sebastiani properties for the set of Bernstein-Sato roots, which prove the characteristic $p$ analogue of Budur and Popa's question.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we complete B\"{u}chi's proof that there is no decision algorithm for the solubility in integers of arbitrary systems of diagonal quadratic form equations, by proving the assertion that whenever $x_1^2, \cdots, x_5^2$ are five squares such that the second differences satisfy
  \[x_{k+2}^2 - 2 x_{k+1}^2 + x_k^2 = 2\]
  for $k = 1,2,3$, then they must be consecutive. This answers a question of J.~Richard~B\"{u}chi.</description>

      <title>Random matrix statistics and zeroes of $L$-functions via probability in $\lambda$-rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19295v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a theory of probability in $\lambda$-rings designed to efficiently describe random variables valued in multisets of complex numbers, varieties over a field, or other similar enriched settings. A key role is played by the $\sigma$-moment generating function based on the plethystic exponential, which allows us to describe distributions and argue with independence in a way that is as simple as classical probability theory. As a first application, we use this theory to obtain a concise description of the asymptotic $\sigma$-moment generating functions describing distributions of eigenvalues of Haar random matrices in compact classical groups. Beyond the theory of probability in $\lambda$-rings, the proof uses only classical invariant theory. Using our description we reprove the results of Diaconis and Shahshahani on the joint distributions of traces of powers of matrices, and we also treat symmetric groups. Next, we use Poonen's sieve to establish equidistribution results for the zeroes of $L$-functions in some natural families: simple Dirichlet characters for $\mathbb{F}_q(x)$ and the vanishing cohomology of smooth hypersurface sections. We give concise descriptions of the asymptotic $\sigma$-moment generating functions in these families, then compare them to the associated random matrix distributions. These equidistribution results are sideways in that we fix $q$ and take the degree $d$ to infinity, as opposed to Deligne equidistribution for fixed $d$ as $q \rightarrow \infty$, and the large $d$-limits are related to explicit descriptions of stable homology with twisted coefficients.</description>

      <title>Birational Transformations and 2d (0,2) Quiver Gauge Theories beyond Toric Fano 3-folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a family of birational transformations that relate toric Fano 3-folds defined by reflexive lattice polytopes can be identified with mass deformations of corresponding 2d (0,2) supersymmetric quiver gauge theories. These theories are realized by a Type IIA brane configuration known as brane brick models. We further show that the same family of birational transformations extends to more general toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds, including those defined by non-reflexive toric diagrams. Under these birational transformations, the mesonic moduli spaces of the associated abelian 2d (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories and brane brick models share the same number of generators and the same Hilbert series when refined only under the U(1)R symmetry. Since these transformations categorize toric Calabi-Yau 4-folds and their corresponding 2d (0,2) supersymmetric gauge theories into non-trivial equivalence classes, we anticipate that our findings will pave the way for a `Minimal Model Program' for quiver gauge theories corresponding to toric Calabi-Yau manifolds.</description>

      <title>The tangent cone to the real determinantal variety: various expressions and a proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The set of real matrices of upper-bounded rank is a real algebraic variety called the real generic determinantal variety. An explicit description of the tangent cone to that variety is given in Theorem 3.2 of Schneider and Uschmajew [SIAM J. Optim., 25 (2015), pp. 622-646]. The present paper shows that the proof therein is incomplete and provides a proof. It also reviews equivalent descriptions of the tangent cone to that variety. Moreover, it shows that the tangent cone and the algebraic tangent cone to that variety coincide, which is not true for all real algebraic varieties.</description>

      <title>Three Tone Networks and a Tessellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Eulerian tonnetz, which associates three minor chords to each major chord and three major chords to each minor chord, can be represented by a bipartite graph with twelve white vertices signifying major chords and twelve black vertices signifying minor chords. This so-called Levi graph uniquely determines the combinatorial geometry of a remarkable configuration of twelve points and twelve lines in the real projective plane with the property that three points lie on each line and three lines pass through each point. Interesting features of the tonnetz, such as the existence of the four principal hexacycles and the three principal octacycles, crucial for the understanding of nineteenth-century voice leading, can be read off rather directly as properties of the configuration. We show how analogous tone networks can be constructed for pentatonic music and twelve-tone music.</description>

      <title>Counting quadratic points on Fano varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17940v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper initiates the systematic study of the number of points of bounded height on symmetric squares of weak Fano varieties. We provide a general framework for establishing the point count on $\text{Sym}^2 X$. In the specific case of surfaces, we relate this to the Manin--Peyre conjecture for $\text{Hilb}^2 X$, and prove the conjecture for an infinite family of non-split quadric surfaces. In order to achieve the predicted asymptotic, we show that a type II thin set of a new flavour must be removed.
  To establish our counting result for the specific family of surfaces, we generalise existing lattice point counting techniques to lattices defined over rings of integers. This reduces the dimension of the problem and yields improved error terms. Another key tool we develop is a collection of results for summing Euler products over quadratic extensions. We use this to show moments of $L$-functions at $s=1$ are constant on average in quadratic twist families.</description>

      <title>The Hasse principle for homogeneous polynomials with random coefficients over thin sets II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $d$ and $n$ be natural numbers. Let $\nu_{d,n}: \mathbb{R}^n\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{N}$ denote the Veronese embedding with $N=N_{n,d}:=\binom{n+d-1}{d}$, defined by listing all the monomials of degree $d$ in $n$ variables using the lexicographical ordering. Let $\langle \boldsymbol{a}, \nu_{d,n}(\boldsymbol{x})\rangle\in \mathbb{Z}[\boldsymbol{x}]$ be a homogeneous polynomial in $n$ variables of degree $d$ with integer coefficients $\boldsymbol{a}$, where $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle$ denotes the inner product. For a non-singular form $P\in \mathbb{Z}[\boldsymbol{x}]$ of degree $k\ (\leq d)$ in $N$ variables, consider a set of integer vectors $\boldsymbol{a}\in \mathbb{Z}^N$, defined by $$\mathfrak{A}(A;P)=\{\boldsymbol{a}\in \mathbb{Z}^N:\ P(\boldsymbol{a})=0,\ \|\boldsymbol{a}\|_{\infty}\leq A\}.$$ By handling a new lattice problem via the geometry of numbers, we confirm that whenever $n&gt; 24d$ and $d\geq 17,$ the proportion of integer coefficients $\boldsymbol{a}\in \mathfrak{A}(A;P)$, whose associated equation $f_{\boldsymbol{a}}(\boldsymbol{x})=0$ satisfies the Hasse principle, converges to $1$ as $A\rightarrow\infty$. This improves on the recent work of the second author.</description>
