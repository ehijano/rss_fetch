      <title>Scaling Lifelong Multi-Agent Path Finding to More Realistic Settings: Research Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of moving multiple agents from starts to goals without collisions. Lifelong MAPF (LMAPF) extends MAPF by continuously assigning new goals to agents. We present our winning approach to the 2023 League of Robot Runners LMAPF competition, which leads us to several interesting research challenges and future directions. In this paper, we outline three main research challenges. The first challenge is to search for high-quality LMAPF solutions within a limited planning time (e.g., 1s per step) for a large number of agents (e.g., 10,000) or extremely high agent density (e.g., 97.7%). We present future directions such as developing more competitive rule-based and anytime MAPF algorithms and parallelizing state-of-the-art MAPF algorithms. The second challenge is to alleviate congestion and the effect of myopic behaviors in LMAPF algorithms. We present future directions, such as developing moving guidance and traffic rules to reduce congestion, incorporating future prediction and real-time search, and determining the optimal agent number. The third challenge is to bridge the gaps between the LMAPF models used in the literature and real-world applications. We present future directions, such as dealing with more realistic kinodynamic models, execution uncertainty, and evolving systems.</description>

      <title>Elicitron: An LLM Agent-Based Simulation Framework for Design Requirements Elicitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Requirements elicitation, a critical, yet time-consuming and challenging step in product development, often fails to capture the full spectrum of user needs. This may lead to products that fall short of expectations. This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the requirements elicitation process. LLMs are used to generate a vast array of simulated users (LLM agents), enabling the exploration of a much broader range of user needs and unforeseen use cases. These agents engage in product experience scenarios, through explaining their actions, observations, and challenges. Subsequent agent interviews and analysis uncover valuable user needs, including latent ones. We validate our framework with three experiments. First, we explore different methodologies for diverse agent generation, discussing their advantages and shortcomings. We measure the diversity of identified user needs and demonstrate that context-aware agent generation leads to greater diversity. Second, we show how our framework effectively mimics empathic lead user interviews, identifying a greater number of latent needs than conventional human interviews. Third, we showcase that LLMs can be used to analyze interviews, capture needs, and classify them as latent or not. Our work highlights the potential of using LLM agents to accelerate early-stage product development, reduce costs, and increase innovation.</description>

      <title>A communication protocol based on NK boolean networks for coordinating collective action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, I describe a digital social communication protocol (Gridt) based on Kauffman's NK boolean networks. The main assertion is that a communication network with this topology supports infinitely scalable self-organization of collective action without requiring hierarchy or central control. The paper presents the functionality of this protocol and substantiates the following propositions about its function and implications: (1) Communication via NK boolean networks facilitates coordination on collective action games for any variable number of users, and justifies the assumption that the game's payoff structure is common knowledge; (2) Use of this protocol increases its users' transfer empowerment, a form of intrinsic motivation that motivates coordinated action independent of the task or outcome; (3) Communication via this network can be considered 'cheap talk' and benefits the strategy of players with aligned interests, but not of players with conflicting interests; (4) Absence of significant barriers for its realization warrants a timely and continuing discussion on the ethics and implications of this technology; (5) Full realization of the technology's potential calls for a free-to-use service with maximal transparency of design and associated economic incentives.</description>

      <title>3D Guidance Law for Maximal Coverage and Target Enclosing with Inherent Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of enclosing an arbitrarily moving target in three dimensions by a single pursuer, which is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), for maximum coverage while also ensuring the pursuer's safety by preventing collisions with the target. The proposed guidance strategy steers the pursuer to a safe region of space surrounding the target, allowing it to maintain a certain distance from the latter while offering greater flexibility in positioning and converging to any orbit within this safe zone. Our approach is distinguished by the use of nonholonomic constraints to model vehicles with accelerations serving as control inputs and coupled engagement kinematics to craft the pursuer's guidance law meticulously. Furthermore, we leverage the concept of the Lyapunov Barrier Function as a powerful tool to constrain the distance between the pursuer and the target within asymmetric bounds, thereby ensuring the pursuer's safety within the predefined region. To validate the efficacy and robustness of our algorithm, we conduct experimental tests by implementing a high-fidelity quadrotor model within Software-in-the-loop (SITL) simulations, encompassing various challenging target maneuver scenarios. The results obtained showcase the resilience of the proposed guidance law, effectively handling arbitrarily maneuvering targets, vehicle/autopilot dynamics, and external disturbances. Our method consistently delivers stable global enclosing behaviors, even in response to aggressive target maneuvers, and requires only relative information for successful execution.</description>

      <title>A Hypergraph Approach to Distributed Broadcast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the distributed broadcast problem within the context of network communications, a critical challenge in decentralized information dissemination. We put forth a novel hypergraph-based approach to address this issue, focusing on minimizing the number of broadcasts to ensure comprehensive data sharing among all network users. A key contribution of our work is the establishment of a general lower bound for the problem using the min-cut capacity of hypergraphs. Additionally, we present the distributed broadcast for quasi-trees (DBQT) algorithm tailored for the unique structure of quasi-trees, which is proven to be optimal. This paper advances both network communication strategies and hypergraph theory, with implications for a wide range of real-world applications, from vehicular and sensor networks to distributed storage systems.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Bounded Suboptimal Any-Angle Multi-agent Pathfinding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) is the problem of finding a set of conflict-free paths for a set of agents. Typically, the agents' moves are limited to a pre-defined graph of possible locations and allowed transitions between them, e.g. a 4-neighborhood grid. We explore how to solve MAPF problems when each agent can move between any pair of possible locations as long as traversing the line segment connecting them does not lead to the collision with the obstacles. This is known as any-angle pathfinding. We present the first optimal any-angle multi-agent pathfinding algorithm. Our planner is based on the Continuous Conflict-based Search (CCBS) algorithm and an optimal any-angle variant of the Safe Interval Path Planning (TO-AA-SIPP). The straightforward combination of those, however, scales poorly since any-angle path finding induces search trees with a very large branching factor. To mitigate this, we adapt two techniques from classical MAPF to the any-angle setting, namely Disjoint Splitting and Multi-Constraints. Experimental results on different combinations of these techniques show they enable solving over 30% more problems than the vanilla combination of CCBS and TO-AA-SIPP. In addition, we present a bounded-suboptimal variant of our algorithm, that enables trading runtime for solution cost in a controlled manner.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces SwarmRL, a Python package designed to study intelligent active particles. SwarmRL provides an easy-to-use interface for developing models to control microscopic colloids using classical control and deep reinforcement learning approaches. These models may be deployed in simulations or real-world environments under a common framework. We explain the structure of the software and its key features and demonstrate how it can be used to accelerate research. With SwarmRL, we aim to streamline research into micro-robotic control while bridging the gap between experimental and simulation-driven sciences. SwarmRL is available open-source on GitHub at https://github.com/SwarmRL/SwarmRL.</description>

      <title>CleanAgent: Automating Data Standardization with LLM-based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data standardization is a crucial part in data science life cycle. While tools like Pandas offer robust functionalities, their complexity and the manual effort required for customizing code to diverse column types pose significant challenges. Although large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have shown promise in automating this process through natural language understanding and code generation, it still demands expert-level programming knowledge and continuous interaction for prompt refinement. To solve these challenges, our key idea is to propose a Python library with declarative, unified APIs for standardizing column types, simplifying the code generation of LLM with concise API calls. We first propose Dataprep.Clean which is written as a component of the Dataprep Library, offers a significant reduction in complexity by enabling the standardization of specific column types with a single line of code. Then we introduce the CleanAgent framework integrating Dataprep.Clean and LLM-based agents to automate the data standardization process. With CleanAgent, data scientists need only provide their requirements once, allowing for a hands-free, automatic standardization process.</description>

      <title>A Grassroots Architecture to Supplant Global Digital Platforms by a Global Digital Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an architectural alternative to global digital platforms termed grassroots, designed to serve the social, economic, civic, and political needs of local digital communities, as well as their federation. Grassroots platforms may offer local communities an alternative to global digital platforms while operating solely on the smartphones of their members, forsaking any global resources other than the network itself. Such communities may form digital economies without initial capital or external credit, exercise sovereign democratic governance, and federate, ultimately resulting in the grassroots formation of a global digital democracy.</description>
