      <title>Hidden Risks and Optionalities in American Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a practical framework for identifying and quantifying the hidden layers of risks and optionality embedded in American options by introducing stochasticity into one or more of their underlying determinants. The heuristic approach remedies the problems of conventional pricing systems, which treat some key inputs deterministically, hence systematically underestimate the flexibility and convexity inherent in early-exercise features.</description>

      <title>Pareto and Bowley Reinsurance Games in Peer-to-Peer Insurance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a peer-to-peer (P2P) insurance scheme comprising a risk-sharing pool and a reinsurer. A plan manager determines how risks are allocated among members and ceded to the reinsurer, while the reinsurer sets the reinsurance loading. Our work focuses on the strategic interaction between the plan manager and the reinsurer, and this focus leads to two game-theoretic contract designs: a Pareto design and a Bowley design, for which we derive closed-form optimal contracts. In the Pareto design, cooperation between the reinsurer and the plan manager leads to multiple Pareto-optimal contracts, which are further refined by introducing the notion of coalitional stability. In contrast, the Bowley design yields a unique optimal contract through a leader-follower framework, and we provide a rigorous verification of the individual rationality constraints via pointwise comparisons of payoff vectors. Comparing the two designs, we prove that the Bowley-optimal contract is never Pareto optimal and typically yields lower total welfare. In our numerical examples, the presence of reinsurance improves welfare, especially with Pareto designs and a less risk-averse reinsurer. We further analyze the impact of the single-loading restriction, which disproportionately favors members with riskier losses.</description>

      <title>Application of Quasi Monte Carlo and Global Sensitivity Analysis to Option Pricing and Greeks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.14354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasi Monte Carlo (QMC) and Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) techniques are applied for pricing and hedging representative financial instruments of increasing complexity. We compare standard Monte Carlo (MC) vs QMC results using Sobol' low discrepancy sequences, different sampling strategies, and various analyses of performance. We find that QMC outperforms MC in most cases, including the highest-dimensional simulations, showing faster and more stable convergence. Regarding greeks computation, we compare standard approaches, based on finite differences (FD) approximations, with adjoint methods (AAD) providing evidences that, when the number of greeks is small, the FD approach combined with QMC can lead to the same accuracy as AAD, thanks to increased convergence rate and stability, thus saving a lot of implementation effort while keeping low computational cost. Using GSA, we are able to fully explain our findings in terms of reduced effective dimension of QMC simulation, allowed in most cases, but not always, by Brownian Bridge discretization or PCA construction. We conclude that, beyond pricing, QMC is a very effcient technique also for computing risk measures, greeks in particular, as it allows to reduce the computational effort of high dimensional Monte Carlo simulations typical of modern risk management.</description>

      <title>Optimal Reinsurance under Endogenous Default and Background Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies an optimal reinsurance problem for a utility-maximizing insurer, subject to the reinsurer's endogenous default and background risk. An endogenous default occurs when the insurer's contractual indemnity exceeds the reinsurer's available reserve, which is random due to the background risk. We obtain an analytical solution to the optimal contract for two types of reinsurance contracts, differentiated by whether their indemnity functions depend on the reinsurer's background risk. The results shed light on the joint effect of the reinsurer's default and background risk on the insurer's reinsurance demand.</description>

      <title>ASRI: An Aggregated Systemic Risk Index for Cryptocurrency Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Aggregated Systemic Risk Index (ASRI), comprising four weighted sub-indices: Stablecoin Concentration Risk (30%), DeFi Liquidity Risk (25%), Contagion Risk (25%), and Regulatory Opacity Risk (20%). Using data from DeFi Llama, Federal Reserve FRED, and on-chain analytics, we validate against four historical crises (Terra/Luna, Celsius/3AC, FTX, SVB). Event study analysis detects significant abnormal signals for all four (t-statistics 5.47-32.64, p &lt; 0.01), with threshold-based detection achieving 30-day average lead time for three of four events. Walk-forward validation confirms 4/4 out-of-sample detection (18-day average lead), ruling out look-ahead bias. A three-regime HMM identifies distinct risk states with &gt;97% persistence; structural stability tests pass (Chow p = 0.993). Benchmarking against Diebold-Yilmaz connectedness shows equivalent detection (75%) with higher precision (33.5% vs. 22.4%). Out-of-sample specificity testing on 2024-2025 data confirms zero false positives, correctly classifying the $1.5B Bybit hack as non-systemic. ASRI captures DeFi-specific vulnerabilities -- composability risk, flash loan exposure, and tokenized RWA linkages -- that SRISK and CoVaR cannot accommodate.</description>
