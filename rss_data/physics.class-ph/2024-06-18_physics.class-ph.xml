      <title>Interacting Mathieu equation, synchronization dynamics and collision-induced velocity exchange in trapped ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, large-scale trapped ion systems have been realized in experiments for quantum simulation and quantum computation. They are the simplest systems for dynamical stability and parametric resonance. In this model, the Mathieu equation plays the most fundamental role for us to understand the stability and instability of a single ion. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of trapped ions with the Coulomb interaction based on the Hamiltonian equation. We show that the many-body interaction will not influence the phase diagram for instability. Then, the dynamics of this model in the large damping limit will also be analytically calculated using few trapped ions. Furthermore, we find that in the presence of modulation, synchronization dynamics can be observed, showing an exchange of velocities between distant ions on the left side and on the right side of the trap. These dynamics resemble to that of the exchange of velocities in Newton's cradle for the collision of balls at the same time. These dynamics are independent of their initial conditions and the number of ions. As a unique feature of the interacting Mathieu equation, we hope this behavior, which leads to a quasi-periodic solution, can be measured in current experimental systems. Finally, we have also discussed the effect of anharmonic trapping potential, showing the desynchronization during the collision process. It is hopped that the dynamics in this many-body Mathieu equation with damping may find applications in quantum simulations. This model may also find interesting applications in dynamics systems as a pure mathematical problem, which may be beyond the results in the Floquet theorem.</description>

      <title>A comparative study on the self-similarity hypothesis of regular and slow earthquake growth</title>

Abstract: Fault ruptures of regular earthquakes typically grow in a self-similar manner, where the radiated energy is proportional to the seismic moment. Their proportionality factor, termed as scaled energy, has been conventionally described as the ratio of stress drop to stiffness. By analyzing the self-similar circular crack model by Sato and Hirasawa (1973), Matsu'ura (2024) found a correction prefactor for this theoretical representation of the scaled energy, the cubed ratio of the rupture speed to the S-wave speed. The stress drop times the cubed rupture speed is the scaling prefactor of the self-similar seismic moment, and thus, Matsu'ura's solution tells that the seismic moment rate is determined by the scaled energy in the self-similar rupture growth. We rearrange the properties of the self-similar solution from this perspective, apply this Sato-Hirasawa-Matsu'ura relation to a series of seismic events thought to be self-similar, and estimate their source parameters and scaled energies. According to our estimation using the above self-similarity model, seismologically detected low-frequency and very-low-frequency earthquakes have a common scaled energy, while geodetically detectable slow slip events indicate multiple modes with different scaled energies. Meanwhile, for very-low-frequency earthquakes and tectonic tremors, the seismic moments were significantly smaller than expected for self-similar ruptures despite their moments being proportional to cubed duration values. It keeps alive a hitherto less contemplated possibility: the proportionality of the moment to cubed duration may not be a manifestation of the self-similarity for slow earthquake rupture growth.</description>

      <title>PVDF transducer shape optimization for the characterization of anisotropic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of the ultrasonic determination of mechanical properties, it is common to use oblique incident waves to characterize fluid-immersed anisotropic samples. The lateral displacement of the ultrasonic field owing to leaky guided wave phenomena poses a challenge for data inversion because beam spreading is rarely well represented by plane-wave models. In this study, a finite beam model based on the angular spectrum method was developed to estimate the influence of the transducer shape and position on the transmitted signals. Additionally, anisotropic solids were considered so that the beam skewing effect was contemplated. A small-emitter large-receiver configuration was chosen, and the ideal shape and position of the receiving transducer were obtained through a meta-heuristic optimization approach with the goal of achieving a measurement system that sufficiently resembles plane-wave propagation. A polyvinylidene fluoride receiver was fabricated and tested in three cases: a single-crystal silicon wafer, a lightly anisotropic stainless-steel plate, and a highly anisotropic composite plate. Good agreement was found between the measurements and the plane-wave model.</description>
