      <title>From bare two-nucleon interaction to nuclear matter and finite nuclei in a relativistic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding nuclear forces, infinite nuclear matter, and finite nuclei within a unified framework has remained a central challenge in nuclear physics for decades. While most \textit{ab initio} studies employ nonrelativistic Schr\"odinger-equation frameworks, this work offers a relativistic perspective. Using a leading-order (LO) relativistic chiral interaction, we describe two-nucleon scattering via the Thompson equation, symmetric nuclear matter, and medium-mass nuclei (Ca, Ni, Zr, Sn) via the relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory. Systematic uncertainties from regulator cutoffs and interaction parameters are analyzed. The empirical saturation region of nuclear matter is reproduced, and the binding energies and charge radii of medium-mass nuclei agree reasonably well with experimental data, significantly improving the ``Coester line". These results highlight that the relativistic approach, employing a leading-order chiral force with only four low-energy constants and no three-nucleon forces, can capture the most important dynamics and offer a complementary pathway to address longstanding challenges in nuclear \textit{ab initio} studies.</description>

      <title>Effects of beyond-mean-field correlations on nuclear Schiff moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the nuclear Schiff moments of the diamagnetic atoms $^{129}$Xe, $^{199}$Hg, and $^{225}$Ra in multireference covariant density functional theory. Beyond-mean-field correlations, arising from symmetry restoration and shape mixing, are incorporated via the generator coordinate method with projection onto states with well-defined parity, particle number, and angular momentum. Our results reveal a correlation between the contributions of nuclear intermediate states to Schiff moments and the electric dipole transition strengths from these states to the ground state. The new beyond-mean-field effects can either enhance or suppress the Schiff moments. In $^{225}$Ra, they do the latter, reducing the enhancement from octupole deformation somewhat.</description>

      <title>Pion properties in isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter using in-medium chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the density dependence of in-medium pion properties, such as mass, wave function renormalization, and decay constant in the correlation function approach, and how they change under the influence of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter. To this end, we use in-medium chiral perturbation theory to compute the relevant Feynman diagrams up to two-loop diagrams. Our results show that the isospin asymmetry of the nuclear matter splits these quantities into three separate values, corresponding to the three pions. Consequently, the tendency of each in-medium pion mass, wave function renormalization, and decay constant is dependent on the density and the neutron-to-proton ratio $\rho_n/\rho_p$ of nuclear matter. We also derive an in-medium Gell-Mann--Oakes--Renner relation which is valid for isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter and investigate to what extent it holds within our calculations.</description>

      <title>Bremsstrahlung emission accompanying ternary fission of \isotope[252]{Cf}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \textbf{Background} In ternary fission, bremsstrahlung photons are emitted but those have never been studied yet theoretically and experimentally. In other reactions, bremsstrahlung has been studied for a long time.
  \textbf{Purpose} To clarify which new information about ternary fission can be obtained from study of bremsstrahlung emission accompanying the ternary fission of \isotope[252]{Cf}.
  \textbf{Methods} A new quantum model of emission of bremsstrahlung photons accompanying ternary fission of heavy nuclei with $\alpha$-particle as light charged particle is developed. The model takes into account geometry and dynamics of ternary fission.
  \textbf{Results} We present the theoretical results on the bremsstrahlung emission in the ternary fission of the \isotope[252]{Cf} nucleus. High sensitivity of the bremsstrahlung spectra is established by the model concerning to the following aspects of the ternary fission, and the theoretical calcualtions are in agreement with the preliminary experimental data. It is found that: (a) Photons are emitted with highest intensity in case of perpendicular motion of the $\alpha$\,particle concerning to fission axis; (b) Relative motion between heavy fragments reinforces significantly bremsstrahlung, leaving of $\alpha$-particle concerning to system of heavy fragments is less important; (c) Relative motion between two heavy fragments is faster, bremsstrahlung is more intensive.
  \textbf{Conclusions} Theoretical study of bremsstrahlung in ternary fission of the \isotope[252]{Cf} nucleus shows high sensitivity of bremsstrahlung spectra on the geometry and dynamics of ternary fission process. It is expected that new information can be obtained by the model when new experimental measurements of bremsstrahlung in ternary fission of the \isotope[252]{Cf} nucleus are available.</description>

      <title>Probing the tetrahedral $\alpha$ clusters in relativistic $^{16}$O + $^{16}$O collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic $^{16}$O +$^{16}$O collisions probe the Quark-Gluon Plasma formed in small systems, while their collective phenomena illuminate the structure of $^{16}$O. Recently, various configurations of $^{16}$O from \textit{ab initio} calculations were implemented in heavy-ion models, such as the hydrodynamic model and a multiphase transport model (AMPT) to study cluster effects in relativistic $^{16}$O +$^{16}$O collisions. However, divergent predictions across configurations and models complicate interpretations. In this Letter, we isolate the impact of multi-nucleon correlations in relativistic $^{16}$O +$^{16}$O collisions while fixing the one-body density distribution of $^{16}$O. Our results show that the normalized ratios ${\rm Norm}(v_{2}\{2\}/v_{2}\{4\})$ and ${\rm Norm}(v_{2}\{2\}/v_{3}\{2\})$ effectively probe the effects of one-body density (e.g., tetrahedral symmetry) and multi-nucleon correlations (e.g., $\alpha$ clusters). These observables provide critical constraints for refining heavy-ion models, essential for investigating cluster configurations in light nuclei through relativistic heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Complex Scaling and Similarity Renormalization Group for Continuum Properties of Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel \abinitio many-body method designed to compute the properties of nuclei in the continuum. This approach combines well-established techniques, namely the Complex Scaling (CS) and Similarity Renormalization Group (SRG) methods while employing the translationally invariant No-Core Shell Model (NCSM) as a few-body solver. We demonstrate that this combination effectively overcomes numerical limitations previously encountered in exploring continuum properties of light nuclei with standard many-body techniques, and at the same time makes less imperative the need for a continuous set of basis states for the continuum. To benchmark the method for applications in the many-body sector, we apply it to the \textsuperscript{4}He system, where semi-exact calculations within a finite basis are feasible. Our extrapolated results agree with exact calculations already published in the literature. We argue that different NN parametrizations of chiral EFT Hamiltonians will not permit to reproduce evaluated resonance properties of \textsuperscript{4}He. As an application, we showcase the case of the tetraneutron. This work enables the application of the method to $A&gt;4$-mass systems, providing a reliable representation of the initial Hamiltonian and its continuum properties.</description>

      <title>Transmutation of $^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne at the Large Hadron Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In July 2025 the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will collide $^{16}$O$^{16}$O and $^{20}$Ne$^{20}$Ne isotopes in a quest to understand the physics of ultrarelativistic light ion collisions. One particular feature is that there are many smaller isotopes with the exact same charge over mass ratio that potentially can be produced and contaminate the beam composition. Using the Trajectum framework together with the GEMINI code we provide an estimate of the production cross-section and its consequences. A potential benefit could be the interesting measurement of the multiplicity and mean transverse momentum of $^{16}$O$^{4}$He collisions.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Simulation of QED in Coulomb Gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent work (Li, 2406.01204) considered quantum simulation of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) on a lattice in the Coulomb gauge with gauge degrees of freedom represented in the occupation basis in momentum space. Here we consider representing the gauge degrees of freedom in field basis in position space and develop a quantum algorithm for real-time simulation. We show that the Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian is equivalent to the temporal gauge Hamiltonian when acting on physical states consisting of fermion and transverse gauge fields. The Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian guarantees that the unphysical longitudinal gauge fields do not propagate and thus there is no need to impose any constraint. The local gauge field basis and the canonically conjugate variable basis are swapped efficiently using the quantum Fourier transform. We prove that the qubit cost to represent physical states and the gate depth for real-time simulation scale polynomially with the lattice size, energy, time, accuracy and Hamiltonian parameters. We focus on the lattice theory without discussing the continuum limit or the UV completion of QED.</description>

      <title>Effect of symmetry energy on properties of rapidly rotating neutron stars and universal relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated universal relations for compact stars rotating at the Keplerian (mass-shedding) limit, which is
  highly relevant for understanding the rapidly rotating objects formed in the aftermath of a neutron star-neutron
  star merger. Our analysis is based on a set of nucleonic EoS featuring systematic variations in the symmetry
  energy slope parameter $L_{\rm sym}$ and the isoscalar skewness parameter $Q_{\rm sat}$, varied within ranges
  that are broadly consistent with current laboratory and astrophysical constraints. The global observable
  properties of isolated maximally rotating stars are examined, focusing on the mass-radius relation,
  moment of inertia, quadrupole moment, and the Keplerian (maximum) rotation frequency, as well as their
  variations in the $L_{\rm sym}$-$Q_{\rm sat}$ parameter space. Next, we demonstrate that, in the limit of Keplerian
  rotation, universal relations remain valid across the same set of EoSs characterized by varying $L_{\rm sym}$ and $Q_{\rm sat}$.
  In particular, we present explicit results for the moment of inertia and quadrupole moment as functions of compactness,
  as well as for the moment of inertia - quadrupole moment relation. All of these relations exhibit excellent universality,
  with deviations typically within a few percent and rarely exceeding 10\% across a wide range of parameters.
  These findings support the applicability of $I$-Love-$Q$-type universal relations in observational modeling
  of maximally rotating compact stars and the gravitational wave emitted by them, when accounting for significant
  variation in the symmetry energy and high-density behavior of the nuclear EoS.</description>

      <title>Slow Stable Self-bound Hybrid Star Can Relieve All Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Some recent pulsar observations cannot naturally fit into the conventional picture of neutron stars: the compact objects associated with HESS J1731-347 and XTE J1814-338 have too small radii at the low-mass regime, while the secondary component of GW190814 is too massive for neutron stars to be compatible with constraints from the GW170817 event. In this study, we demonstrate that all these anomalous observations and tensions, together with other conventional ones such as recent NICER observations of PSR J0740+6620, J0030+0451, and PSR J0437-4715, can be naturally explained simultaneously by a new general type of hybrid stars that are self-bound and radially stable in the slow phase transition context, and by some subsets even in the rapid phase transition context also. As a proof of concept, we use hybrid quark stars, inverted hybrid stars, and hybrid strangeon stars as benchmark examples to explicitly demonstrate the advantage and feasibility of slow stable self-bound hybrid stars in relieving all tensions related to compact stars' masses, radii, and tidal deformabilities.</description>

      <title>Nuclear Physics Confronts Relativistic Collisions Of Isobars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-energy collisions involving the $A=96$ isobars $^{96}$Zr and $^{96}$Ru have been performed in 2018 at Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) as a means to search for the chiral magnetic effect in QCD. This would manifest itself as specific deviations from unity in the ratio of observables taken between $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr and $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru collisions. Measurements of such ratios (released at the end of 2021) indeed reveal deviations from unity, but these are primarily caused by the two collided isobars having different radial profiles and intrinsic deformations. To make progress in understanding RHIC data, nuclear physicists across the energy spectrum gathered in Heidelberg in 2022 as part of an EMMI Rapid Reaction Task Force (RRTF) to address the following question. Does the combined effort of low-energy nuclear structure physics and high-energy heavy-ion physics enable us to understand the observations made in isobar collisions at RHIC?</description>

      <title>Pentaquarks made of light quarks and their admixture to baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is a continuation of our studies of multiquark hadrons. The anti-symmetrization of their wavefunctions required by Fermi statistics is nontivial, as it mixes orbital, color, spin and flavor structures. In our previous papers we developed a method to find them based on the representations of the permutation group, and derived the explicit wave functions for baryons excited to the first and second shells $(L=1,2)$, tetraquarks $qq\bar q\bar q$ and hexaquarks ($6q$). Now we apply it
  to light pentaquarks ($qqqq\bar q$), in the S- and P-shells ($L=0,1$). Using Jacobi coordinates, one can use the hyperdistance approximation in
  12-dimensional space. We further address the issue of ``unquenching" of baryons, by considering their mixing with pentaquarks, via two channels, through the addition of $\sigma$-like or $\pi$-like $\bar q q$ pairs. This mixing is central for understanding of the observed flavor asymmetry of the antiquark sea, the amount of orbital motion issue as well as other nucleon properties.</description>

Abstract: After briefly touching on relativistic hydrodynamics, we provide a detailed description of recent developments in spin hydrodynamics. We discuss the theory of perfect spin hydrodynamics within two different approaches, which lead to identical generalized thermodynamic relations. We also indicate the applicability range of the theory, finding it compatible with the conditions existing in the late stages of heavy-ion collisions. Finally, we discuss the near-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Roper Resonance $N^*(1440)$ in Nucleon-Nucleon Collisions and the Issue of Dibaryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01937v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many reactions leading to excitations of the nucleon the Roper resonance $N^*(1440)$ can be sensed only by complex partial-wave analyses. In nucleon-nucleon collisions the isoscalar single-pion production as well as specific two-pion production channels present the Roper excitation free of competing resonance processes at a mass of 1370 MeV and a width of 150 MeV. A detailed analysis points to the formation of $N^*(1440)N$ dibaryonic systems during the nucleon-nucleon collision process similar to what is known from the $\Delta(1232)N$ threshold.</description>

      <title>Towards shell model interactions with credible uncertainties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11889v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: The nuclear shell model is a powerful framework for predicting nuclear structure observables, but relies on interaction matrix elements fit to experimental data as its inputs. Extending the shell model's applicability, particularly toward dripline nuclei, requires efficient fitting methods and credible uncertainty quantification. Traditional approaches face computational challenges and may underestimate uncertainties.
  Purpose: We develop and test a framework combining eigenvector continuation and Markov chain Monte Carlo to efficiently fit shell model interaction matrix elements and quantify their uncertainties.
  Methods: Eigenvector continuation is used to emulate shell model calculations, reducing computational costs. The emulator enables Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling to optimize interaction matrix elements and rigorously assess parametric uncertainties. The framework is benchmarked using the USDB interaction in the sd shell.
  Results: The emulator reproduces the USDB interaction with negligible error, validating its use in shell model fitting applications. However, we find that to obtain credible predictive intervals, the model defect of the shell model itself, rather than experimental or emulator error, must be taken into account in order to obtain credible uncertainties.
  Conclusions: The proposed framework provides an efficient and rigorous approach for fitting shell model interactions and quantifying uncertainties. Further, the normality assumption used in the past appears sufficient to describe the distribution of interaction matrix elements. However, it is crucial to account for model correlations to avoid underestimating uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Exact solutions for the moments of the binary collision integral and its relation to the relaxation-time approximation in leading-order anisotropic fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the moments of the nonlinear binary collision integral in the ultrarelativistic hard-sphere approximation for an arbitrary anisotropic distribution function in the local rest frame. This anisotropic distribution function has an angular asymmetry controlled by the parameter of anisotropy $\xi$, such that in the limit of a vanishing anisotropy $\lim_{\xi \rightarrow 0} \hat{f}_{0 \mathbf{k}} = f_{0 \mathbf{k}}$, approaches the spherically symmetric local equilibrium distribution function. The corresponding moments of the binary collision integral are obtained in terms of quadratic products of different moments of the anisotropic distribution function and couple to a well defined set of lower-order moments. To illustrate these results we compare the moments of the binary collision integral to the moments of the widely used relaxation-time approximation of Anderson and Witting in case of a spheroidal distribution function. We found that in an expanding system the nonlinear Boltzmann collision term leads to twice slower equilibration than the relaxation-time approximation. Furthermore we also show that including two dynamical moments helps to resolve the ambiguity which additional moment of the Boltzmann equation to choose to close the conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the strength of first-order phase transition and its relation to nucleon mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the constraints on the strength of first-order phase transitions in neutron star matter and its relation to the origin of nucleon mass. By combining the parity doublet model for the hadronic phase, the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model for quark matter, and the integral constraint framework for intermediate densities, we construct equation of states spanning the full density range relevant to neutron stars. Our approach systematically explores how the chiral invariant mass $m_0$ affects the allowable properties of first-order quark-hadron phase transitions. Through comparison with recent neutron star observations, we establish a inverse correlation between the allowed phase transition strength and the chiral invariant mass. Our results demonstrate a direct connection between fundamental questions about the microscopic origin of nucleon mass and macroscopic neutron star observables, providing a novel astrophysical probe of chiral dynamics and QCD physics under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>A modular perspective to the jet suppression from a small to large radius in very high transverse momentum jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11908v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we expand the scope of the JETSCAPE framework to investigate the dependence of the jet nuclear modification factor, ${R_{AA}}$, on the jet radius parameter ($R$) for broader area jet cones, going all the way up to $R$ = 1.0. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of high-${p_{T}}$ inclusive jets extending up to 1 TeV to probe the quark-gluon plasma medium at much shorter distance scales. It focuses on quenching effects observed in the quark-gluon plasma formed during Pb-Pb collisions at ${\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}}$ = 5.02 TeV, particularly for the most-central (0-10\%) collisions. Jet-medium interactions represent a pivotal domain of both theoretical and experimental QGP studies, with various models offering different assumptions to describe these phenomena. To illustrate this modular approach, this work computes the nuclear modification factor for inclusive jets via coupling of the MATTER model (which simulates the high virtuality phase of the parton evolution) with the LBT model (which simulates the low virtuality phase of the parton evolution). Additionally, the two successful energy loss models: MARTINI and AdS/CFT are employed to characterize the jet-suppression effectively within the JETSCAPE framework. The results are compared with the experimental data from the ATLAS and CMS detectors, covering jet transverse momentum (${p_{T}}$) ranging from 100 GeV to 1 TeV for ATLAS and 300 GeV to 1 TeV for CMS. The predictions made by the JETSCAPE are consistent in the high ${p_{T}}$ range as well as for extreme jet cone sizes, showing deviation within 10-25\%. Our major focus is on calculating the double ratio (${R^{\mathrm{R}}_{\mathrm{AA}}/R^{\mathrm{R=small}}_{\mathrm{AA}}}$) as a function of jet-R and jet-${p_{T}}$, where the experimental results align well with predictions from the JETSCAPE framework.</description>

      <title>A new approach to handling factorial moment correlations through principal component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intermittency analysis of factorial moments is a promising method used for the detection of power-law scaling in high-energy collision data. In particular, it has been employed in the search of fluctuations characteristic of the critical point (CP) of strongly interacting matter. However, intermittency analysis has been hindered by the fact that factorial moments measurements corresponding to different scales are correlated, since the same data are conventionally used to calculate them. This invalidates many assumptions involved in fitting data sets and determining the best fit values of power-law exponents. We present a novel approach to intermittency analysis, employing the well-established statistical and data science tool of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This technique allows for the proper handling of correlations between scales without the need for subdividing the data sets available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali (ADD) model with n extra compactified dimensions, the gravitational potential scales as 1/r^{n+1} and becomes significantly stronger at short distances. We investigate the possibility of forming small-sized composite systems of Standard Model particles bound by this potential. Such bound states, composed of quarks, neutrinos, axions, or other particles, exhibit a small cross-section-to-mass ratio, making them viable candidates for dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) soft function for a generic hadroproduction process involving massive colored particles is analytically calculated at the one-loop level, extended to higher orders in the dimensional regulator $\epsilon$. We present both the azimuthal-angle-averaged and azimuthal-angle-dependent soft functions in impact-parameter space, making them suitable for small $q_T$ resummation calculations. Their analytic expressions are provided in terms of multiple polylogarithms. Our results offer essential ingredients for a complete higher-order perturbative calculation of the TMD soft function.</description>

      <title>Precise Measurement of Short-Range Correlations in Nuclei from Bremsstrahlung Gamma Ray Emission in Low-Energy Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomic nuclei and dense nucleonic matter in neutron stars exhibit short-range correlations (SRCs), where nucleons form temporally correlated pairs in proximity beyond mean-field approximation. It is essential to make precision measurement of the fraction of SRC since it carries the signature of underlying quark dynamics in nuclear medium. In this letter, we present the first high-precision measurement of neutron-proton bremsstrahlung $\gamma$-ray emission from the symmetric $\rm ^{124}Sn$+$\rm ^{124}Sn$ reactions at 25 MeV/u. From the observed spectral hardening, the precise SRC fraction in the $\rm ^{124}Sn$ nucleus is extracted to be $(20 \pm 3)\%$. This result provides a novel, direct and unambiguous evidence of SRCs, and demonstrates that low-energy heavy-ion collisions offers a new approach to studying nuclear structure in connection with quark-level dynamics.</description>

      <title>Different scenarios of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking in the interacting instanton liquid model via flavor symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a type of dynamical chiral symmetry breaking (D$\chi$SB) for various current quark masses using the interacting instanton liquid model. The type of D$\chi$SB is classified based on the sign of the second derivative of the free energy density with respect to the quark condensate at the origin. We perform numerical simulations of the interacting instanton liquid model with the flavor SU(2) symmetric and (2+1)-flavor quarks. We find that the curvature is negative in the SU(2) case. This means the ordinary type of D$\chi$SB. In contrast, in the (2+1)-flavor case, a positive curvature is observed when the strange quark mass is as small as those of the up and down quarks. This suggests that the anomaly-driven type of D$\chi$SB can occur under the approximate flavor SU(3) symmetry. As the strange quark mass increases, the curvature gradually decreases and becomes negative when the strange quark mass is approximately three times larger than those of the light quarks. This difference can be understood in terms of the 't Hooft vertex which induces a six-quark interaction in the $N_f=3$ case and does a four-quark interaction in the $N_f=2$ case. Our results might indicate that the ratio between the strange and light quark masses plays a crucial role in understanding the microscopic relationship between D$\chi$SB and the anomaly effect.</description>

Abstract: In the paper, the off-shell electromagnetic pion form factors in the Bethe-Salpeter formalism are considered. The separable kernel of the first rank quark-antiquark interaction is used to solve the equation analytically. The semi-off-shell pion form factors \( F_1 \) and \( F_2 \), which are related to each other by the Ward-Takahashi identity, are calculated. The obtained off-shell form factors as well as static properties of the pion are compared with the results of other authors.</description>
