      <title>Geometry of Almost-Conserved Quantities in Symplectic Maps. Part I: Perturbation Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noether's theorem, which connects continuous symmetries to exact conservation laws, remains one of the most fundamental principles in physics and dynamical systems. In this work, we draw a conceptual parallel between two paradigms: the emergence of exact invariants from continuous symmetries, and the appearance of approximate invariants from discrete symmetries associated with reversibility in symplectic maps. We demonstrate that by constructing approximating functions that preserve these discrete symmetries order by order, one can systematically uncover hidden structures, closely echoing Noether's framework. The resulting functions serve not only as diagnostic tools but also as compact representations of near-integrable behavior.
  The first article establishes the formal foundations of the method. Using the symmetric form of the map as a flexible test case, we benchmark the perturbative construction against established techniques, including the Lie algebra method for twist coefficients. To resolve the inherent ambiguity in the perturbation series, we introduce an averaging procedure that naturally leads to a resonant theory -- capable of treating rational rotation numbers and small-denominator divergences. This enables an accurate and structured description of low-order resonances, including singular and non-singular features in the quadratic and cubic H\'enon maps. The approach is systematic, requiring only linear algebra and integrals of elementary functions, yet it yields results in striking agreement with both theory and numerical experiment. We conclude by outlining extensions to more general maps and discussing implications for stability estimates in practical systems such as particle accelerators.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Almost-Conserved Quantities in Symplectic Maps. Part II: Recovery of approximate invariant</title>

Abstract: Noether's theorem, which connects continuous symmetries to exact conservation laws, remains one of the most fundamental principles in physics and dynamical systems. In this work, we draw a conceptual parallel between two paradigms: the emergence of exact invariants from continuous symmetries, and the appearance of approximate invariants from discrete symmetries associated with reversibility in symplectic maps. We demonstrate that by constructing approximating functions that preserve these discrete symmetries order by order, one can systematically uncover hidden structures, closely echoing Noether's framework. The resulting functions serve not only as diagnostic tools but also as compact representations of near-integrable behavior.
  The second article applies the method to global dynamics, with a focus on large-amplitude motion and chaotic systems. We demonstrate that the approximate invariants, once averaged, accurately capture the structure of resonances and the boundaries of stability regions. We also explore the recovery of exact invariants in integrable cases, showing that the method reproduces the correct behavior when such structure is present. A single unified function, derived from the map coefficients, yields phase portraits, rotation numbers, and tune footprints that closely match numerical tracking across wide parameter ranges. Comparisons with the Square Matrix method reveal that while both approaches satisfy local constraints, our technique provides greater accuracy and robustness in resonant and strongly nonlinear regimes. These results highlight the method's practical power and broad relevance, offering a compact, analytic framework for organizing nonlinear dynamics in symplectic maps with direct applications to beam physics and beyond.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Almost-Conserved Quantities in Symplectic Maps. Part III: Approximate Invariants in Nonlinear Accelerator Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a perturbative method for constructing approximate invariants of motion directly from the equations of discrete-time symplectic systems. This framework offers a natural nonlinear extension of the classic Courant-Snyder (CS) theory -- a foundational cornerstone in accelerator physics now spanning seven decades and historically focused on linear phenomena. The original CS formalism emerged under conditions where nonlinearities were weak, design goals favored linear motion, and analytical tools -- such as the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theory -- had not yet been fully developed. While various normal form methods have been proposed to treat near-integrable dynamics, the approach introduced here stands out for its conceptual transparency, minimal computational overhead, and direct applicability to realistic systems. We demonstrate its power and versatility by applying it to several operational accelerator configurations at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FermiLab), illustrating how the method enables fast, interpretable diagnostics of nonlinear behavior across a broad range of machine conditions.</description>

      <title>Measurement of directional muon beams generated at the Berkeley Lab Laser Accelerator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02321v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the detection of directional muon beams produced using a PW laser at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. The muon source is a multi-GeV electron beam generated in a 30 cm laser plasma accelerator interacting with a high-Z converter target. The GeV photons resulting from the interaction are converted into a high-flux, directional muon beam via pair production. By employing scintillators to capture delayed events, we were able to identify the produced muons and characterize the source. Using theoretical knowledge of the muon production process combined with simulations that are in excellent agreement with the experiments, we demonstrate that the multi-GeV electron beams produce GeV-scale muons in numbers far exceeding those from cosmic background. Laser-plasma-accelerator-based muon sources can therefore enhance muon imaging applications thanks to their compactness, directionality, and high yields, which reduce the exposure time by orders of magnitude compared to cosmic ray muons. Using the Geant4-based simulation code we developed to gain insight into the experimental results, we can design future experiments and applications based on LPA-generated muons.</description>

      <title>Deployment and validation of predictive 6-dimensional beam diagnostics through generative reconstruction with standard accelerator elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the 6-dimensional phase space distribution of particle beams is essential for optimizing accelerator performance. Conventional diagnostics such as use of transverse deflecting cavities offer detailed characterization but require dedicated hardware and space. Generative phase space reconstruction (GPSR) methods have shown promise in beam diagnostics, yet prior implementations still rely on such components. Here we present the first experimental implementation and validation of the GPSR methodology, realized by the use of standard accelerator elements including accelerating cavities and dipole magnets, to achieve complete 6-dimensional phase space reconstruction. Through simulations and experiments at the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory X-ray Free Electron Laser facility, we successfully reconstruct complex, nonlinear beam structures. Furthermore, we validate the methodology by predicting independent downstream measurements excluded from training, revealing near-unique reconstruction closely resembling ground truth. This advancement establishes a pathway for predictive diagnostics across beamline segments while reducing hardware requirements and expanding applicability to various accelerator facilities.</description>

      <title>Attosecond physics hidden in Cherenkov radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cherenkov radiation of charged particles moving with superluminal velocities in transparent media is a well-studied phenomenon with a plethora of applications. Its microscopic origins can be traced to the polarization of atomic shells, characterized by time scales in the subfemtosecond range - dynamics that eludes conventional macroscopic treatment. Here we present a theoretical framework for probing the intrinsic dynamics of Cherenkov radiation, unveiling quantum features absent in classical realm and even in a fully quantum theory in momentum space. These features include a finite formation length and spreading time of the photon, the latter becoming negative nearby the Cherenkov angle, a finite flash duration tied to the size of the electron packet, along with a shift in the photon arrival time that can be either positive or negative and necessitates going beyond the far-field approximation. The calculated time scales lie in the attosecond range for the relevant parameters, thus linking this macroscopic phenomenon back to its atomic origins. Finally, we propose that by measuring the duration of the Cherenkov flash one can in principle retrieve the length of the emitting packet, deepening our understanding of quantum coherence effects in photon emission.</description>
