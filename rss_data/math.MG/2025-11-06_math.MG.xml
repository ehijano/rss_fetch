      <title>Sections and projections of the outer and inner regularizations of a convex body</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish new geometric inequalities comparing the volumes of sections and projections of a convex body, whose barycenter or Santal\'o point is at the origin, with those of its inner and outer regularizations. We also provide functional extensions of these inequalities to the setting of log-concave functions. Our approach relies on the recent optimal $M$-estimate of Bizeul and Klartag for isotropic convex bodies.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Rigidity over $\mathbb{R}^n$ with smooth norms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $p-$Wasserstein spaces $ \mathcal{W}_p(\mathbb{R}^n, d_N)$ over $\mathbb{R}^n$ equipped with a norm metric $d_N$. We show that, if the norm is smooth enough, then the Wasserstein space is isometrically rigid whenever $p \neq 2$. We also show that, even when $p=2$, we can recover the isometric rigidity of the Wasserstein space $\mathcal{W}_2(\mathbb{R}^n, d_N)$ when $N$ is an $l_q-$norm and $q&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Uncountably many homogeneous real trees with the same valence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any cardinal $\kappa \geq 2$, there is a unique complete real tree whose points all have valence $\kappa$. In this note, we show that, when $\kappa \geq 3$, it is necessary to assume completeness. More precisely, we show that there exist uncountably many homogeneous incomplete real trees whose points all have valence $\kappa$.</description>

      <title>Mathematical exploration and discovery at scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AlphaEvolve is a generic evolutionary coding agent that combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with automated evaluation in an iterative evolutionary framework that proposes, tests, and refines algorithmic solutions to challenging scientific and practical problems. In this paper we showcase AlphaEvolve as a tool for autonomously discovering novel mathematical constructions and advancing our understanding of long-standing open problems.
  To demonstrate its breadth, we considered a list of 67 problems spanning mathematical analysis, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory. The system rediscovered the best known solutions in most of the cases and discovered improved solutions in several. In some instances, AlphaEvolve is also able to generalize results for a finite number of input values into a formula valid for all input values. Furthermore, we are able to combine this methodology with Deep Think and AlphaProof in a broader framework where the additional proof-assistants and reasoning systems provide automated proof generation and further mathematical insights.
  These results demonstrate that large language model-guided evolutionary search can autonomously discover mathematical constructions that complement human intuition, at times matching or even improving the best known results, highlighting the potential for significant new ways of interaction between mathematicians and AI systems. We present AlphaEvolve as a powerful new tool for mathematical discovery, capable of exploring vast search spaces to solve complex optimization problems at scale, often with significantly reduced requirements on preparation and computation time.</description>

      <title>A new proof of the Lemmens-Seidel conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a new proof of the Lemmens-Seidel conjecture on the maximum number of equiangular lines with a common angle $\arccos(1/5)$. This conjecture was previously resolved by Cao, Koolen, Lin, and Yu in 2022 through an analysis involving forbidden subgraphs for the smallest Seidel eigenvalue $-5$. Our new proof is based on bounds on eigenvalue multiplicities of graphs with degree no larger than $14$. To control the maximum degree of the graph associated with equiangular lines, we employ a recent inequality of Balla derived by matrix projection techniques. Our strategy also leads to a new proof for the classical result obtained by Lemmens and Seidel in 1973 for the case where the common angle is $\arccos(1/3)$.</description>

      <title>Borsuk's conjecture for two-distance sets and its equivalent formulation for graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Every graph G can be embedded in a Euclidean space as a two-distance set. This allows us to reformulate the analogue of Borsuk's conjecture for two-distance sets in terms of graphs. This conjecture remains open for dimensions from 4 to 63. This short note also discusses an approach for finding counterexamples using graphs, as well as its generalization for s-distance sets.</description>

      <title>On CAT($\kappa$) surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of $\text{CAT}(\kappa)$ surfaces: length metric spaces homeomorphic to a surface having curvature bounded above in the sense of satisfying the $\text{CAT}(\kappa)$ condition locally. The main facts about $\text{CAT}(\kappa)$ surfaces seem to be largely a part of mathematical folklore, and this paper is intended to rectify the situation. We provide a complete proof that $\text{CAT}(\kappa)$ surfaces have bounded (integral) curvature. This fact allows one to apply the established theory of surfaces of bounded curvature to derive further properties of $\text{CAT}(\kappa)$ surfaces. We also show that $\text{CAT}(\kappa)$ surfaces can be approximated by smooth Riemannian surfaces of Gaussian curvature at most $\kappa$. We do this by giving explicit formulas for smoothing the vertices of model polyhedral surfaces.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Reverse Isoperimetric Inequalities for Log-concave Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05712v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Rogers-Shephard and Zhang's projection inequalities are two reverse, affine isoperimetric-type inequalities for convex bodies. Following a classical work by Schneider, both inequalities have been extended to the so-called $m$th-order setting. In this work, we establish the $m$th-order analogues for these inequalities in the setting of log-concave functions. Our proof of the functional Zhang's projection inequality employs properties of the asymmetric LYZ body, significantly streamlining the argument and producing a novel approach for the case $m=1$. Furthermore, we introduce and analyze the radial mean bodies of a log-concave function, thereby providing a functional generalization of Gardner and Zhang's radial mean bodies. These are new even in the case $m=1$. Our development leverages an extension of Ball bodies, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Bi-Lipschitz embedding metric triangles in the plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A metric polygon is a metric space comprised of a finite number of closed intervals joined cyclically. The second-named author and Ntalampekos recently found a method to bi-Lipschitz embed an arbitrary metric triangle in the Euclidean plane with uniformly bounded distortion, which we call here the tripodal embedding. In this paper, we prove the sharp distortion bound $4\sqrt{7/3}$ for the tripodal embedding. We also give a detailed analysis of four representative examples of metric triangles: the intrinsic circle, the three-petal rose, tripods and the twisted heart. In particular, our examples show the sharpness of the tripodal embedding distortion bound and give a lower bound for the optimal distortion bound in general. Finally, we show the triangle embedding theorem does not generalize to metric quadrilaterals by giving a family of examples of metric quadrilaterals that are not bi-Lipschitz embeddable in the plane with uniform distortion.</description>

      <title>Distances between non-symmetric convex bodies: optimal bounds up to polylog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the non-symmetric Banach-Mazur distance between two convex bodies $K_1, K_2 \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ satisfies $$ d_{BM}(K_1, K_2) \leq C n \cdot \log^{\alpha} (n+1), $$ for universal constants $C, \alpha &gt; 0$. This improves upon the earlier bound $C n^{4/3} \log^{\alpha} (n+1)$ due to Rudelson. Up to polylogarithmic factors, our estimate is optimal and it also matches the optimal bound in the centrally-symmetric case which is realized in the John position, as proven by Gluskin. The bound above for the Banach-Mazur distance is attained when both bodies are in a ``random isotropic position'', that is, in isotropic position after a random rotation. Our proof is based on an $M$-bound in the isotropic position, which complements E. Milman's $M^*$-bound. In addition, we consider the partial containment distance $d_{PC}(K_1, K_2)$ between two convex bodies $K_1, K_2 \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, where the Banach-Mazur requirement to contain $100\%$ of the other body is relaxed to $99\%$-containment. We prove that for any pair of convex bodies $K_1, K_2 \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, $$ d_{PC}(K_1, K_2) \leq C \log^{\alpha} (n+1), $$ and that any isotropic position of $K_1$ and $K_2$ yields this polylogarithmic bound for $d_{PC}$.</description>

      <title>Detecting virtual homomorphisms via Banach metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of "Banach metrics" on finitely generated infinite groups. This extends the notion of a Cayley graph (as a metric space). Our motivation comes from trying to detect the existence of virtual homomorphisms into Z, the additive group of integers. We show that detection of such homomorphisms through metric functional boundaries of Cayley graphs isn't always possible. However, we prove that it is always possible to do so through a metric functional boundary of some Banach metric on the group.</description>
