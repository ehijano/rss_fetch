      <title>Polynomial-Time Approximation Schemes via Utility Alignment: Unit-Demand Pricing and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper derives polynomial-time approximation schemes for several NP-hard stochastic optimization problems from the algorithmic mechanism design and operations research literatures. The problems we consider involve a principal or seller optimizing with respect to a subsequent choice by an agent or buyer. These include posted pricing for a unit-demand buyer with independent values (Chawla et al., 2007, Cai and Daskalakis, 2011), assortment optimization with independent utilities (Talluri and van Ryzin, 2004), and delegated choice (Khodabakhsh et al., 2024). Our results advance the state of the art for each of these problems. For unit-demand pricing with discrete distributions, our multiplicative PTAS improves on the additive PTAS of Cai and Daskalakis, and we additionally give a PTAS for the unbounded regular case, improving on the latter paper's QPTAS. For assortment optimization, no constant approximation was previously known. For delegated choice, we improve on both the $3$-approximation for the case with no outside option and the super-constant-approximation with an outside option.
  A key technical insight driving our results is an economically meaningful property we term utility alignment. Informally, a problem is utility aligned if, at optimality, the principal derives most of their utility from realizations where the agent's utility is also high. Utility alignment allows the algorithm designer to focus on maximizing performance on realizations with high agent utility, which is often an algorithmically simpler task. We prove utility alignment results for all the problems mentioned above, including strong results for unit-demand pricing and delegation, as well as a weaker but very broad guarantee that holds for many other problems under very mild conditions.</description>

      <title>Exact and approximate maximin share allocations in multi-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of (approximate) maximin share (MMS) allocation of indivisible items among a set of agents. We focus on the graphical valuation model, previously studied by Christodolou, Fiat, Koutsoupias, and Sgouritsa ("Fair allocation in graphs", EC 2023), where the input is given by a graph where edges correspond to items, and vertices correspond to agents. An edge may have non-zero marginal value only for its incident vertices. We study additive, XOS and subadditive valuations and we present positive and negative results for (approximate) MMS fairness, and also for (approximate) pair-wise maximin share (PMMS) fairness.</description>

      <title>Learning Bilateral Team Formation in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Team formation and the dynamics of team-based learning have drawn significant interest in the context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, existing studies primarily focus on unilateral groupings, predefined teams, or fixed-population settings, leaving the effects of algorithmic bilateral grouping choices in dynamic populations underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a framework for learning two-sided team formation in dynamic multi-agent systems. Through this study, we gain insight into what algorithmic properties in bilateral team formation influence policy performance and generalization. We validate our approach using widely adopted multi-agent scenarios, demonstrating competitive performance and improved generalization in most scenarios.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Impact of Strategic Bidding on the Reserve Capacity via a Bi-Level Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing integration of renewable energy sources necessitates adequate reserve capacity to maintain power balance. However, in market clearing, power companies with flexible resources may submit strategic bids to maximize profits, potentially compromising system reserves. This paper examines the effects of such strategic behavior by modeling the market as a bi-level problem. The upper level represents a strategic company aiming to maximize profit, while the lower level simulates the system operator clearing the market based on submitted offers. To enable duality-based solution methods, we approximate unit commitments with a continuous reserve capacity calculation. Case studies indicate that, in an imperfectly competitive market, more units are incentivized to operate,enhancing system reserves. However, some units go online mainly for profit, ultimately raising electricity costs for consumers. These findings highlight the importance of market design in managing the trade-off between reserve adequacy and economic efficiency in the presence of strategic bidding behavior.</description>

      <title>Budget-Feasible Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of computing near-optimal contracts in combinatorial settings has recently attracted significant interest in the computer science community. Previous work has provided a rich body of structural and algorithmic insights into this problem. However, most of these results rely on the assumption that the principal has an unlimited budget for incentivizing agents, an assumption that is often unrealistic in practice. This motivates the study of the optimal contract problem under budget constraints.
  In this work, we study multi-agent contracts with binary actions under budget constraints. Our contribution is threefold. First, we show that all previously known approximation guarantees on the principal's utility extend (asymptotically) to budgeted settings. Second, through the lens of budget constraints, we uncover insightful connections between the standard objective of maximizing the principal's utility and other relevant objectives. Specifically, we identify a broad class of objectives, which we term BEST (BEyond STandard) objectives, including reward, social welfare, and principal's utility, and show that they are all equivalent (up to a constant factor), leading to approximation guarantees for all BEST objectives. Third, we introduce the price of frugality, which quantifies the loss due to budget constraints, and establish near-tight bounds on this measure, providing deeper insights into the tradeoffs between budgets and incentives.</description>
