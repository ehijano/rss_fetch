      <title>The influence of pixel cell layout on the timing performance of 3D sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) pixel sensors are a promising technology for implementing the 4D-tracking paradigm in high-radiation environments. Despite their advantages in radiation tolerance, 3D pixel sensors exhibit non-uniform electric and weighting fields that can degrade timing performance. This study explores the impact of pixel cell geometry on the timing characteristics of 3D columnar-electrode sensors fabricated by IMB-CNM, comparing square and hexagonal layouts. The sensors were characterized using the Two-Photon Absorption Transient Current Technique (TPA-TCT), providing high-resolution three-dimensional maps of the Time-of-Arrival (ToA) of charge carriers. Measurements at multiple depths and bias voltages reveal that the square geometry yields a more uniform temporal response compared to the hexagonal configuration. Additionally, a novel TPA-TCT-based method was introduced to determine the sensor jitter, relying on the analysis of the time difference between consecutive pulses in the TPA-TCT pulse train acquired under identical conditions. These findings underline the importance of pixel design optimization for future 4D-tracking detectors and confirm the TPA-TCT method as a powerful tool for detailed timing characterization.</description>

      <title>Optimization of 3D diamond detectors with graphitized electrodes based on an innovative numerical simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future experiments at hadron colliders require an evolution of the tracking sensors to ensure sufficient radiation hardness and timing resolution to handle unprecedented particle fluxes. 3D diamond sensors with laser-graphitized electrodes are promising due to their strong binding energy, small atomic number, and high carrier mobility, but the high resistance of the engraved electrodes delays the propagation of the induced signals towards the readout, deteriorating the precision of the timing measurements. This effect has been so far the dominant contribution to the time resolution of these devices, such that other contributions, for example, those due to electric field inhomogeneities or electronic noise, could be neglected. However, recent advancements in graphitization technology call for a renewed effort in modeling signal generation in 3D diamond detectors, to achieve more general and reliable predictions. To this purpose, we apply an extended version of the Ramo-Shockley theorem representing the effect of signal propagation as a time-dependent weighting potential, obtained by solving numerically the Maxwell's equations in a quasi-static approximation. We developed a custom spectral method solver and validated it against COMSOL Multiphysics. The response of the modeled sensor to a beam of particles is then simulated using Garfield++ and compared to the data acquired in a beam test carried on in 2021 by the TimeSPOT Collaboration at the SPS, at CERN. Based on the results obtained with this novel simulation pipeline, we conclude that reducing the resistivity of the graphitic columns remains the first priority to significantly improve the time resolution of 3D diamond detectors. Once this is achieved, optimization of the detector geometry and of the readout electronics design will represent equally important steps to further improve the timing performance of these devices.</description>

      <title>GIGAPYX sensor performance in space environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of the GIGAPYX-4600 image sensor in space environment, more specifically under different types of irradiations (protons and heavy ions). The GIGAPYX-4600 is a state-of-the-art 46M pixel multi-purpose, backside illuminated CMOS image sensor. The sensor features high-speed (200 fps), low-noise (&lt; 2e-rms), rolling shutter readout. It has been fabricated using 65 nm node CMOS technology, making use of capacitive deep trench isolation, thus exhibiting good MTF as well as excellent dark current characteristics. The GIGAPYX image sensor family is meant to be easily scalable thanks to a novel use of stitching technology. The assessed sensor features an impressive 46 Mpixels, but the sensor family is meant to be scaled up to 220 M pixels. The idea of this study was to investigate the radiation hardness of a commercially available off-the-shelf (COTS) image sensor that could be suitable for space-borne applications, such as earth observation or satellite vicinity surveillance. In the near future a radiation hard readout electronic for this sensor family will be made available off-the-shelf by Pyxalis. This presentation will overview the different sensor key performances evolutions after proton irradiation up to a total fluence of 2.3e11 p+/cm${}^2$ (62 MeV): dark current, dark current non-uniformity (DCNU), noise, non-linearity, saturation charge and photo-response non-uniformity (PRNU). As expected, degradations mostly occur on the dark current, DCNU and temporal noise. The orders of magnitude of the degradation are in the range of the already published high performance CIS technologies. Results obtained from heavy ions irradiations will demonstrate that the GIGAPYX is not only latch-up free at least up to 57 Mev.cm2/mg, but resistant to the blooming effects induced by a SET at pixel level thanks to its capacitive deep trench isolations. Various SEE effects have been studied, demonstrating encouraging results for such COTS device in order to fly, in particular in GEO orbit. All these radiations results will be used as inputs in designing space camera based on the GIGAPYX sensors, compatible with multiple-mission types.</description>

      <title>Towards Navigation-Grade and Deployable Optomechanical Accelerometery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We design and experimentally demonstrate an architecture for achieving navigation-grade, fiber-packaged optomechanical accelerometers that can operate with a large dynamic range, over a wide temperature range, and without sophisticated laser sources. Our accelerometer architecture is based on a novel set of design principles that take advantage of the strengths of optomechanical accelerometry while eliminating many of its historical weaknesses. Displacement readout is provided by an integrated, differential strain-sensing Mach-Zehnder interferometer (DSMZI) attached to an ultra-rigid, bulk-micromachined proof mass having a 93.4 kHz fundamental resonance frequency (22.5 pm/g displacement). Despite the extreme rigidity, the high displacement sensitivity provides an insertion loss limited 4.2 $\mu g/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ acceleration resolution, with a straight-forward path to achieving 330 $n g/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ by improving the fiber-to-chip coupling. Further, we show that the combination of high rigidity and intrinsic differential optical readout makes the device insensitive to the common causes of bias instability, and we measure a bias instability of 6.3 $\mu g$ at 243 seconds. The DSMZI provides a 17 nm optical bandwidth and a temperature operating range of greater than 20 $^\circ\mathrm{C}$, both orders of magnitude larger than previous demonstrations of optomechanical accelerometers. The high rigidity and large optical bandwidth yield an expected dynamic range of 165.4 dB. The combination of high acceleration resolution, high dynamic range, low bias instability, and intrinsic insensitivity to wavelength, temperature, and package stresses makes our device well suited for deployment in realistic environments demanded by real-world applications and demonstrates a path for optomechanical accelerometers to ultimately exceed the performance of all other chip-based accelerometers.</description>

      <title>Seismic Isolation of Optical Tables Using Piezo Actuators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13083v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Seismic isolation is crucial for gravitational wave detectors as it minimizes ground vibrations, enabling the detection of faint gravitational wave signals. An active seismic isolation platform for precision measurement experiments is described. The table features piezo actuation along five degrees of freedom: three translational actuations and two tip-tilt degrees of freedom along the horizontal axes. It is stiff in rotation about the vertical axes. A seismometer is used to sense table motion. Piezo actuators are used to suppress seismic noise with feedback control bandwidth of 0.3 to 3 Hz. Suppression levels ranging from 21 to 36 dB of seismic noise within the frequency range of 0.5 to 1.3 Hz are demonstrated, as measured by a witness seismometer on the table, with the suppression direction along the axis of the longitudinal translation of the suspended mirror on the table. The suppression results in 1 $\mathrm{\mathrm{nm/\sqrt{Hz}}}$ residual horizontal motion at 1 Hz. Limitations such as tilt-to-translation coupling that prevent actuation over the desired range of 0.03 to 3 Hz are discussed.</description>

      <title>HydroX, a light dark matter search with hydrogen-doped liquid xenon time projection chambers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental efforts searching for dark matter particles over the last few decades have ruled out many candidates led by the new generation of tonne-scale liquid xenon. For light dark matter, hydrogen could be a better target than xenon as it would offer a better kinematic match to the low mass particles. This article describes the HydroX concept, an idea to expand the dark matter sensitivity reach of large liquid xenon detectors by adding hydrogen to the liquid xenon. We discuss the nature of signal generation in liquid xenon to argue that the signal produced at the interaction site by a dark matter-hydrogen interaction could be significantly enhanced over the same interaction on xenon, increasing the sensitivity to the lightest particles. We discuss the technical implications of adding hydrogen to a xenon detector, as well as some background considerations. Finally, we make projections as to the potential sensitivity of a HydroX implementation and discuss next steps.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.09965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SiD Detector is one of two detector designs for the future International Linear Collider (ILC) that were validated in 2012 SiD features a compact, cost-constrained design for precision Higgs and other measurements, and sensitivity to a wide range of possible new phenomena. A robust silicon vertex and tracking system, combined with a five Tesla central solenoidal field, provides excellent momentum resolution. The highly granular calorimeter system is optimized for Particle Flow application to achieve very good jet energy resolution over a wide range of energies. With a potential construction date of the ILC moving closer, it is now the time to review the design and technology decision that have been made during the DBD phase and reconsider them in the light of the recent technological advances. For each area of SiD development R&amp;D topics and opportunities for participation will be discussed.</description>

      <title>Characterization of a gaseous time projection chamber with an internal \ce{^{37}Ar} source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11734v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a novel calibration method of gaseous detectors using an internal \ce{^{37}Ar} source. The \ce{^{37}Ar} is a fast-decaying and low-energy calibration source that provides a mono-energetic peak of 2.82 keV. A gaseous \ce{^{37}Ar} source is injected and uniformly distributed in a Micromegas-based gaseous time projection chamber (TPC). Key performance parameters of the detector, such as electron transmission, gain, energy resolution, gain uniformity, and drift field evolution, are effectively and quickly calibrated. The gain uniformity, related to the homogeneity of the avalanche gap of Micromegas, is calibrated quickly thanks to the event-by-event position reconstruction and quasi-point energy deposition of \ce{^{37}Ar}. The energy resolution is improved with the obtained gain uniformity map. The most noticeable improvement in energy resolution, from 44.9\% to 35.4\%, is observed at a working pressure of 7 bar. The internal calibration source is also used to characterize the dependence of the detector's electric field distortion on the drift field.</description>

      <title>Primary measurement of massic activity of Am-241 by cryogenic decay energy spectrometery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method for radionuclide assay that is spectroscopic with 100 % counting efficiency for alpha decay. Advancing both cryogenic decay energy spectrometry (DES) and drop-on-demand inkjet metrology, a solution of Am-241 was assayed for massic activity (Bq/g) with a relative combined standard uncertainty less than 1 %. We implement live-timed counting, spectroscopic analysis, validation by liquid scintillation (LS) counting, and confirmation of quantitative solution transfer. Experimental DES spectra are well modeled with a Monte Carlo simulation. The model was further used to simulate Pu-238 and Pu-240 impurities, calculate detection limits, and demonstrate the potential for tracer-free multi-nuclide analysis, which will be valuable for new cancer therapeutics based on decay chains, Standard Reference Materials (SRMs) containing impurities, and more widely in nuclear energy, environmental monitoring, security, and forensics.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray background from rock: studies for a next-generation dark matter experiment based on liquid xenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rare event experiments, such as those targeting dark matter interactions and neutrinoless double beta (0$\nu\beta\beta$) decay, should be shielded from gamma-rays that originated in rock. This paper describes the simulation of gamma-ray transport through the water shielding and assessment of the thickness needed to suppress the background from rock down to a negligible level. This study focuses on a next-generation xenon observatory with a wide range of measurements including the search for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay of $^{136}$Xe. Our findings indicate that the gamma-ray background is unlikely to persist through analysis cuts in the WIMP energy range (0 - 20 keV) after 3.5 m of water, complemented by 0.5 m of liquid scintillator. For 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay, a background below 1 event in 10 years of running can be achieved with a fiducial mass of 39.3 tonnes. Furthermore, for typical radioactivity levels of 1 Bq kg$^{-1}$ of $^{232}$Th and $^{238}$U we have studied the effect of reducing the water shielding by 1 m, resulting in a reduced fiducial mass of 19.1 tonnes for 0$\nu\beta\beta$ decay and still a negligible background for WIMP search. The paper also presents the measurements of radioactivity in rock in the Boulby mine, which hosted several dark matter experiments in the past and is also a potential site for a future dual-phase xenon experiment. The measurements are used to normalise simulation results and assess the required shielding at Boulby.</description>

Abstract: We present a study of the oil-proof base Hamamatsu R5912 photomultiplier tubes that will be used in the SABRE South linear-alkylbenzene liquid scintillator veto. SABRE South is a dark matter direct detection experiment at the Stawell Underground Physics Laboratory, aiming to test the DAMA/LIBRA dark matter annual modulation signal. We discuss the requirements of the liquid scintillator system and its photomultipliers, outline the methods and analysis used for the characterisation measurements, and results from initial tests. We discuss the impact of these measurements on the performance of the active veto system and explore analysis methods to allow for low threshold operation. Finally, we include results from a small scale liquid scintillator detector prototype used to assess the future performance of pulse shape discrimination in the liquid scintillator veto, and how well accommodated it is by the R5912 PMTs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent direct detection of neutrinos at the LHC has opened a new window on high-energy particle physics and highlighted the potential of forward physics for groundbreaking discoveries. In the last year, the physics case for forward physics has continued to grow, and there has been extensive work on defining the Forward Physics Facility and its experiments to realize this physics potential in a timely and cost-effective manner. Following a 2-page Executive Summary, we present the status of the FPF, beginning with the FPF's unique potential to shed light on dark matter, new particles, neutrino physics, QCD, and astroparticle physics. We summarize the current designs for the Facility and its experiments, FASER2, FASER$\nu$2, FORMOSA, and FLArE, and conclude by discussing international partnerships and organization, and the FPF's schedule, budget, and technical coordination.</description>

Abstract: In recent literature, the output correction factor in a 1.5T magnetic field, kB,Q,Clin, were determined only for the central axis (CAX), including our last work. At an MR-linac, the determination of the CAX position relies on e.g. MV-imaging and is at small field sizes located at the penumbra, whereas the maximum of the lateral profile (MAX) position is directly measurable. This study determined kB,Q,Ratio - the influence of the magnetic field on the output correction factor without a magnetic field, kQ,Clin - and kB,Q,Clin for both CAX and MAX fully experimentally for two MR-optimized ionization chambers, their conventional counterparts, and a solid-state detector. Additionally, the uncertainty due to intra-type variation for tabulated kB,Q,Clin was estimated. Measurements were conducted using an experimental setup consisting of a mobile electromagnet positioned in front of a standard clinical linac (6MV, 1.5T). Intra-type variation for the solid-state detector was assessed using 4 detectors. The change of absorbed dose to water was determined with alanine. Within the uncertainty, no difference in kB,Q,Ratio was observed between the MR-optimized chambers and their conventional counterparts. For the solid-state detector, no difference between CAX and MAX was observed. For all detectors, kB,Q,Clin remained constant down to a field size of 2.5x2.5cm2. At smaller field sizes, for MAX and for all detectors, kB,Q,Ratio decreased linearly. The maximum intra-type variation standard uncertainty was 0.009 for the smallest field size, with and without a magnetic field. In summary, kB,Q,Ratio and kB,Q,Clin, including its uncertainty, was successfully determined for five detectors at both CAX and MAX. For ionization chambers, kB,Q,Clin is lower at MAX, whereas for the solid-state detector, it remains the same. For the tabulated correction factors uncertainty, intra-type variation must be considered.</description>
