      <title>4K_1 free graphs on 13 vertices have cop number at most 2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The game of cops and robber has been studied for many years. Denoting $\mathsf{Forb}(4K_1)$ to be the family of all graphs that contain no induced subgraph isomorphic to $4K_1$ (e.g., with independence number less than $4$), we prove that for any $G\in\mathsf{Forb}(4K_1)$, we have $c(G)\leq 2$, where $c(\cdot)$ is the cop number. This improves a lower bound of a question proposed by Char et al. in a recent paper (arxiv, 2025).</description>

      <title>Algorithmic Applications of Tyshkevich's Graph Decomposition: A Primer and a Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph that is completely determined by its degree sequence is called a unigraph. In 2000, Regina Tyshkevich published one of the most important papers on unigraphs. There are two parts to the paper: a decomposition theorem that describes how every graph can be broken into a sequence of basic graphs and a complete classification of all basic unigraphs. Together, they reveal how every unigraph is constructed. We provide an informal overview of Tyshkevich's results and show how they enable the computation of various graph parameters of unigraphs in linear time. We also created a toolkit (https://chelseal11.github.io/tyshkevich_decomposition_toolkit/) that implements the algorithms described in this write-up.</description>

      <title>On counting polygons in a crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How many $n$-step polygons exist that contain a given vertex of an infinite quasi-transitive graph $G$? The exponential growth rate of such polygons is identified as the connective constant when $G$ has sub-exponential growth and possesses a so-called square graph height function. The last condition amounts to the requirement that $G$ has a certain ${\Bbb Z}^2$ action of automorphisms. The main theorem extends a result of Hammersley (Proc. Cambridge Philos. Soc. 57 (1961) 516--523) and others for the hypercubic lattice, and responds to Hammersley's challenge to prove such a result for more general "crystals''.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Outerplanar Tur\'an problem has received considerable attention recently. We study the spectral version via $Q$-index. We determine the unique graph that maximizes the $Q$-index among all $n$-vertex connected outerplanar graphs which are respectively forbidden to contain: (i) a fixed cycle; and (ii) the disjoint union of paths of a given order.</description>

      <title>Adjacency-diametrical matrix of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adjacency-diametrical matrix (AD matrix) of a connected graph $G$ with diameter $d$, denoted by $AD(G)$, is the matrix indexed by the vertices of $G$ in which the $(i,j)$-entry of $AD(G)$ is $1$ if $d_G(v_i,v_j)=1$, is $d$ if $d_G(v_i,v_j)=d$, and $0$ otherwise, where $d_G(v_i,v_j)$ denotes the distance between the vertices $v_i$ and $v_j$ in $G$. We determine the spectrum of the AD matrix for paths, cycles, and double star graphs and obtain its determinant for a connected graph. We characterize a class of bipartite graphs using the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial and the eigenvalues of the AD matrix. We establish bounds relating the eigenvalues of the AD matrix to various graph invariants, and we determine the spectrum of the AD matrix for graphs formed by the join, lexicographic product, and Cartesian product operations under certain conditions on the constituent graphs.</description>

      <title>The Delta Theorem: a dimension bound for faithful orthogonal graph representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1987 Hiroshi Maehara conjectured that a graph can be represented by vectors considered adjacent when not orthogonal (a faithful orthogonal representation) in codimension the minimum degree of the graph. Without settling the conjecture, L\`asl\`o Lov\`asz, Michael Saks, and Alexander Schrijver (LSS) showed that a codimension of vertex connectivity both suffices and is best possible under the additional assumption of general position, and gave a probabilistic construction for producing such representations. The present work proves the conjecture of Maehara as well as related conjectures, variants of the Delta Conjecture, that have arisen independently in combinatorial matrix theory. The strongest of these is that minimum degree of G gives a lower bound for the maximum nullity of a positive definite matrix with pattern G that has the Strong Arnold Property (SAP). Such nullity questions are an important subcase of the Inverse Eigenvalue Problem for a Graph (IEPG).
  The name greedegree is introduced for the largest possible final degree of a maximum cardinality search (MSC) ordering, which is to say an ordering that greedily maximizes adjacencies to previous chosen vertices. The name upper-zero generic is introduced to describe symmetric matrices with nonzero diagonal such that the zeros above the diagonal in any column belong to an independent set of rows, which matrices necessarily have the SAP.
  The proof technique takes the probabilistic construction of LSS and parametrizes it completely in terms of independent variables, producing large polynomials that are reasoned about using an introduced operad of hanging garden diagrams. In the case of an MSC ordering in codimension greedegree, it is shown that the leading monomial in an appropriate term order has no canceling term, giving a nonzero polynomial. The resulting representation is faithful with upper-zero generic Gram matrix.</description>

      <title>Bruhat intervals that are large hypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the question of finding big Bruhat intervals that are poset hypercubes in the symmetric group $S_n$. Using permutations suggested by AlphaEvolve (an evolutionary coding agent developed by Google DeepMind), we were led to an unusual situation in which the agent produced a pattern which performed well for the $n$ tested, and which we show works well for general $n$. When $n$ is a power of 2 we exhibit a hypercube of dimension $O(n\log n)$, matching the largest possible dimension up to a constant multiple. Furthermore, we give an exact characterization of the vertices of this hypercube: they are precisely the \emph{dyadically well-distributed} permutations -- a simple digitwise property that already appeared in connection with Monte Carlo integration and mathematical finance. The maximal dimension of a Bruhat interval that is an hypercube in $S_n$ gives a lower bound (and possibly is equal to) the maximal possible coefficient of the second-highest degree term in the Kazhdan--Lusztig $R$-polynomial in $S_n$. As a surprising consequence, we obtain a new lower bound of order $n\log n$ for the maximal number of frozen variables appearing in the cluster algebras attached to the open Richardson varieties in $S_n$, and a similar result for moduli spaces of embeddings of Bruhat graphs.</description>

      <title>A Blueprint for the Formalization of Seymour's Matroid Decomposition Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document is a blueprint for the formalization in Lean of the structural theory of regular matroids underlying Seymour's decomposition theorem. We present a modular account of regularity via totally unimodular representations, show that regularity is preserved under $1$-, $2$-, and $3$-sums, and establish regularity for several special classes of matroids, including graphic, cographic, and the matroid $R_{10}$. The blueprint records the logical structure of the proof, the precise dependencies between results, and their correspondence with Lean declarations. It is intended both as a guide for the ongoing formalization effort and as a human-readable reference for the organization of the proof.</description>

      <title>New discretized polynomial expander and incidence estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two applications of recent developments in incidence geometry. One is a $\delta$-discretized version of a particular `Elekes--R\'onyai' expander problem. For the polynomial we consider, our exponent matches the best known exponent from the discrete case. The second application is an incidence estimate addressing the scenario when both tubes, squares and their shadings satisfy non-concentration assumptions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Enumeration of Cliques in Graphs with Bounded Maximum Degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in extremal problems concerning the enumeration of independent sets or cliques in graphs with specific constraints. For instance, the Kahn-Zhao theorem establishes an upper bound on the number of independent sets in a $d$-regular graph. Building on this, Cutler and Radcliffe extended the result by identifying the graph that maximizes the number of cliques among graphs with bounded order and maximum degree.
  In this paper, we introduce an innovative approach for counting cliques in graphs with a bounded maximum degree. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, we provide a new proof for the above Cutler-Radcliffe theorem and the Kahn-Zhao theorem.</description>

      <title>Subcubic graphs without eigenvalues in $(-1, 1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guo and Royle recently classified the connected cubic graphs without eigenvalues in the open interval $(-1, 1)$, and raised the question of extending their classification to graphs of maximum degree at most $3$. They carried out a preliminary investigation of the subcubic case, exhibiting both infinite families and sporadic examples. In this paper, we complete this investigation by determining all connected subcubic graphs that are not cubic and have no eigenvalues in $(-1,1)$. We show that exactly two infinite families and eight sporadic examples occur, and that every sporadic graph has at most $18$ vertices.
  As a consequence, we prove that $(-1,1)$ is a maximal spectral gap set for the class connected subcubic graphs. Guo and Royle, answering a question of Koll\'ar and Sanark, proved that $(-1,1)$ is a maximal spectral get set for the class of connected cubic graphs. Our result strictly extends theirs.</description>

      <title>A general formula for walk determinants of rooted products with applications to DGS-graph constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an $n$-vertex graph $G$, and a rooted graph $H^{(v)}$ with $v$ as the root, the rooted product graph $G\circ H^{(v)}$ is obtained from $G$ and $n$ copies of $H$ by identifying the root of the $i$th copy of $H$ with the $i$th vertex of $G$ for each $i$. As a refinement of the controllability criterion of $G\circ H^{(v)}$ obtained recently by Shan and Liu (2025), we obtain an explicit formula for the determinant of the walk matrix of $G\circ H^{(v)}$. Furthermore, for an important family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$ that are determined by their generalized spectrum (DGS), we introduce the concept of $\mathcal{F}$-preservers and provide a sufficient condition for a rooted graph to be an $\mathcal{F}$-preserver. A list of $\mathcal{F}$-preservers of small order is provided, which leads to many new infinite families of DGS-graphs using rooted products.</description>

      <title>General inverse theory for the $\mathsf{U}^4$ norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a quantitative inverse theory for the Gowers uniformity norm $\|\cdot\|_{\mathsf{U}^4}$ in general finite abelian groups. We identify a new type of obstructions to uniformity, which we call almost-cubic polynomials. An almost-cubic polynomial $q$ on a Bohr set $B(\Gamma, \rho_0)$ is a function such that, for each $\rho \leq \min\{\rho_0, 1/8\}$, we have \[\|\Delta_{a,b,c,d} q(x)\|_{\mathbb{T}} \leq 2^{10} \rho\] for all $x, a,b,c,d \in B(\Gamma, \rho)$.
  Let $f : G \to \mathbb{D}$ be a function with $\|f\|_{\mathsf{U}^4} \geq c$. We prove quasipolynomial inverse theorems:
  $\bullet$ when $(|G|, 6) = 1$, there exists an almost-cubic $q : B(\Gamma, \rho)$ for $|\Gamma| \leq \log^{O(1)} c^{-1}$ and $\rho \geq \exp(-\log^{O(1)} c^{-1})$, and an element $t \in G$ such that $$\Big|\sum_{x \in G} 1_{B}(x) f(x + t) \operatorname{e}(q(x))\Big| \geq \exp(-\log^{O(1)} c^{-1})|G|,$$ $\bullet$ when $G = (\mathbb{Z}/2^d\mathbb{Z})^n$, there exists a cubic polynomial $q : G \to \mathbb{T}$ such that $$\Big|\sum_{x \in G} f(x)\operatorname{e}(q(x))\Big| \geq \exp(-\log^{O_d(1)} c^{-1})|G|.$$ Almost-cubic polynomials are rather rigid and we exhibit a strong connection with generalized polynomials in the case of cyclic groups, as well as with polynomials in the classical sense in the case of finite vector spaces. We also answer a question of Jamneshan, Shalom and Tao concerning the inverse theory in groups of bounded torsion.
  The central result from which the inverse theorems follow is a structural result for Freiman bihomomorphisms in general finite abelian groups. In our proof, we generalize methods of our previous work in the case of finite vector spaces and introduce novel ideas concerning extensions of Freiman bihomomorphisms. In the problem of extension of Freiman bihomomorphisms, genuinely new phenomena appear in general finite abelian groups.</description>

      <title>A Faber--Krahn inequality for trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known Faber-Krahn theorem states that the ball has the lowest first Dirichlet eigenvalue among all domains of the same volume in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Leydold (Geom. Funct. Anal, 1997) gave the discrete version of Faber-Krahn inequality for regular trees with boundary. B{\i}y{\i}ko{\u{g}}lu and Leydold (J. Combin. Theory Ser. B, 2007) demonstrated that the Faber--Krahn inequality holds for the class of trees with boundary with the same degree sequence. They further posed the following question: Give a characterization of all graphs in a given class \(\mathcal{C}\) with the Faber-Krahn property. In this paper, we show the Faber-Krahn property for trees with given matching number. Our result can imply the Klob\"ur\v{s}tel theorem, i.e., the Faber-Krahn inequality for trees with given number of interior vertices and boundary vertices.</description>

      <title>Some classes of connected signed graphs with girth $g$ and negative inertia index $\lceil\frac{g}{2}\rceil+1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a signed graph. The number of negative eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of $\Gamma$ is called the negative inertia index of $\Gamma$, which is denoted by $i_-(\Gamma)$. The length of the shortest cycle contained in $\Gamma$ is called the girth of $\Gamma$, and it is denoted by $g$. In this paper, we give some classes of connected signed graphs $\Gamma$ which satisfy the condition $i_-(\Gamma)=\lceil\frac{g}{2}\rceil+1$.</description>

      <title>Complete Characterization on Maximum Pairwise Cross Intersecting Families (I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The families $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$ are cross intersecting if $A\cap B\ne \emptyset$ for any $A\in \mathcal{A}$ and $B\in \mathcal{B}$. Let $t\geq 2$ and $k_1\geq k_2\geq \cdots \geq k_t$. We say that $(\mathcal{F}_1, \dots, \mathcal{F}_t)$ is an $(n, k_1, \dots, k_t)$-cross intersecting system if $\mathcal{F}_1 \subseteq{[n]\choose k_1}, \ldots ,\mathcal{F}_t \subseteq{[n]\choose k_t}$ are non-empty pairwise cross intersecting families. Let $M(n,k_1,\ldots ,k_t)$ denote the maximum sum of sizes of families of an $(n,k_1,\ldots ,k_t)$-cross intersecting system. The case $t=2$ was studied by Frankl--Tokushige. Solving a problem of Shi-Frankl-Qian, Huang-Peng-Wang and Zhang-Feng independently determined $M(n, k_1, \dots, k_t)$ for all $n\geq k_1+k_2$.</description>

      <title>Efficient spectral bounds on the chromatic number of Hamming, Johnson, and Kneser graph powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate spectral lower bounds on the chromatic number $\chi$ of Hamming graph powers $H(n, q)^p$, Johnson graph powers $J(n, k)^p$, and Kneser graph powers $K(n, k)^p$ providing the first computationally feasible nontrivial results. While the classical Hoffman bound on $\chi$ can, in principle, be applied to any graph, na\"ive computation requires $O(q^{3n})$ time for $H(n, q)^p$ and $O(({}_nC_k)^3)$ time for both $J(n, k)^p$ and $K(n, k)^p$. We thus express the adjacency eigenvalues of these graphs in terms of hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials, exploiting recurrence relations that arise to efficiently compute the entire spectra. We then apply dynamic programming to compute the Hoffman bounds for $H(n, q)^p$, $J(n, k)^p$, and $K(n, k)^p$ in $O(np)$, $O(kp)$, and $O(k^2)$ time, respectively.</description>

      <title>Harmony in 10-TET: From Parallel Universes to the Desargues Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 10-tone equal temperament (10-TET) constitutes a distinct harmonic environment with step sizes exceeding the standard semitone, yet it has historically remained on the fringes of music theory. This paper proposes a radical shift in perspective, treating $\mathbb{Z}_{10}$ not as an imperfect imitation of 12-TET, but as an independent harmonic universe with its own rigorous logic. We classify all possible harmonic systems in 10-TET using a single structural parameter $\Delta$, representing the difference between the harmonic mediants (the major and minor ``thirds'') which sum to the generator (the ``fifth'').
  Our analysis reveals a rich landscape of possibilities. The system defined by $\Delta=1$, which is naturally the first to consider, initially appears to suffer from a fundamental structural flaw: its harmonic space fractures into two disjoint universes. Conversely, the ``Wide'' system ($\Delta=5$) emerges as a geometrically superior structure, isomorphic to the \textbf{Desargues Configuration} $(10_3)_1$ and forming a fully connected, vertex-transitive graph. Between these extremes lies the ``Tritone'' system ($\Delta=3$), which forms a connected Decagonal Prism. Our main result is the discovery of a topological isomorphism between the ``restored'' Acoustic system ($\Delta=1$) and the Tritone system ($\Delta=3$): despite disjoint intervallic definitions, both generate the Generalized Petersen graph $GP(10,1)$. These results suggest that in 10-TET, the path to harmonic symmetry lies in the geometry of the projective plane and prism graphs rather than pure acoustics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize known results on how to generate an infinite family of integer sequences from the root lattices of rank 2 Kac--Moody algebras. We compute and tabulate the first twenty entries of a number of these sequences. This provides an overarching framework for a large class of Fibonacci-type integer sequences, evaluations of Chebyshev S and U-polynomials and others.</description>

      <title>Polynomial towers and inverse Gowers theory for bounded-exponent groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we develop Host--Kra and inverse Gowers theory for abelian groups of bounded exponent. We show that the Host--Kra factors $Z^{\leq k}(\mathrm{X})$ associated with actions of such groups admit extensions with the structure of \emph{polynomial towers}. This new notion is a system obtained as a finite iteration of abelian extensions of the trivial system by polynomial cocycles; crucially, the intermediate extensions in this system are not required to agree with the Host--Kra factors. We prove that all such extensions are Abramov (generalizing a recent result of Candela, Gonz\'alez-S\'anchez, and Szegedy), but not necessarily Weyl, and have the structure of k-step translational systems.
  Combining this structure theorem with a correspondence principle due to the first and third authors, we derive an inverse theorem for the Gowers norms on finite abelian groups of bounded exponent: large $U^{k+1}$-norm implies large correlation with a polynomial of degree $\le k$ (on the same group), even when the exponent is not square-free or is divisible by small primes. This resolves a conjecture of the first and third authors for such groups, and also answers a question of Candela, Gonz\'alez-S\'anchez, and Szegedy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly study the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of the generalized binomial edge ideals of graphs. We show that this number can be any integer number from $2$ to $n-1$ where $n$ is the number of vertices in the underlying graph. We are able to show this, after giving some tight lower and upper bounds for the regularity of generalized binomial edge ideals of the join product of graphs. In particular, we characterize all generalized binomial edge ideals with the regularity equal to~$2$ as well as extremal Gorenstein ideals. For this purpose, we give a new combinatorial characterization for the class of $P_4$-free graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finite group $G$, the difference graph of $G$, denoted by $\mathcal{D}(G)$, is the difference of the enhanced power graph of $G$ and the power graph of $G$, with all isolated vertices removed. This paper mainly studies the dominating sets of the difference graph of a finite group. In particular, we prove that the diameter of the difference graph of a nilpotent group has an upper bound of $4$. Furthermore, we generalize and refine the result by Biswas et al. by classifying all nilpotent groups whose difference graph has diameter $k$, for each $k\le 4$.</description>

      <title>From Historical Puzzles to Grammatical Constraints: Circular Partitions, Generalized Run-Length Encodings, and Polynomial-Time Decidability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by a historical combinatorial problem that resembles the well-known Josephus problem, we investigate circular partition algorithms and formulate problems in deterministic finite automata with practical algorithms. The historical problem involves arranging individuals on a circle and eliminating every k-th person until a desired group remains. We analyze both removal and non-removal approaches to circular partitioning, establishing conditions for balanced partitions and providing explicit algorithms. We introduce generalized run-length encodings over partitioned alphabets to capture alternating letter patterns, computing their cardinalities using Stirling numbers of the second kind. Connecting these combinatorial structures to formal language theory, we formulate an existence problem: given a context-free grammar over a dictionary and block-pattern constraints on letters, does a valid sentence exist? We prove decidability in polynomial time by showing block languages are regular and applying standard parsing techniques. Complete algorithms with complexity analysis are provided and validated through implementation on both historical and synthetic instances.</description>

      <title>Quantum Talagrand-type Inequalities via Variance Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish dimension-free Talagrand-type variance inequalities on the quantum Boolean cube $M_{2}(\mathbb C)^{\otimes n}$. Motivated by the splitting of the local carr\'e du champ into a conditional-variance term and a pointwise-derivative term, we introduce an $\alpha$-interpolated local gradient $|\nabla_j^{\alpha}A|$ that bridges $\mathrm{Var}_j(A)$ and $|d_jA|^{2}$. For $p\in[1,2],q\in[1,2)$ and $\alpha\in[0,1]$, we prove a Talagrand-type inequality of the form $$\|A\|_\infty^{2-p}\,\bigl\||\nabla^{\alpha}A|\bigr\|_{p}^{p}\ \gtrsim\mathrm{Var}(A)\cdot \max\left\{1, \mathcal{R}(A,q)^{p/2}\right\},$$ where $\mathcal{R}(A,q)$ is a logarithmic ratio quantifying how small either $A-\tau(A)$ or the gradient vector $(d_jA)_j$ is in $L^{q}$ compared to $\mathrm{Var}(A)^{1/2}$. As consequences we derive a quantum Eldan--Gross inequality in terms of the squared $\ell_2$-mass of geometric influences, a quantum Cordero-Erausquin--Eskenazis $L^{p}$-$L^{q}$ inequality, and Talagrand-type $L^{p}$-isoperimetric bounds.
  We further develop a high-order theory by introducing the local variance functional $$V_J(A)=\int_0^\infty 2\mathrm{Inf}^{2}_{J}(P_tA) dt.$$ For $|J|=k$ we prove a local high-order Talagrand inequality relating $\mathrm{Inf}^{p}_{J}[A]$ to $V_J(A)$, with a Talagrand-type logarithmic term when $\mathrm{Inf}^{q}_{J}[A]$ is small. This yields $L^{p}$-$L^{q}$ influence inequalities and partial isoperimetric bounds for high-order influences. Our proofs are purely semigroup-based, relying on an improved Lipschitz smoothing estimate for $|\nabla^{\alpha}P_tA|$ obtained from a sharp noncommutative Khintchine inequality and hypercontractivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computing the Jones polynomial of general link diagrams is known to be $\#$P-hard, while restricting the computation to braid closures on fixed number of strands allows for a polynomial time algorithm. We investigate polynomial time algorithms for Khovanov homology of braids and show that for $3$-braids there is one. In contrast, we show that Bar-Natan's scanning algorithm runs in exponential time when restricted to simple classes of $3$-braids. For more general braids, we obtain that a variation of the scanning algorithm computes the Khovanov homology for a bounded set of homological degrees in polynomial time. We also prove upper and lower bounds on the ranks of Khovanov homology groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02176v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the Hilbert polynomial of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface $Z$ in a smooth toric variety $M$ associated to a convex polytope $\Delta$ is given by a lattice point count in the polytope boundary $\partial \Delta,$ just as the Hilbert polynomial of $M$ is known to be given by a lattice point count in the convex polytope $\Delta.$ Our main tool is a computation of the Euler class in $K$-theory of the normal line bundle to the hypersurface $Z,$ in terms of the Euler classes of the divisors corresponding to the facets of the moment polytope. We observe a remarkable parallel between our expression for the Euler class and the inclusion-exclusion principle in combinatorics. To obtain our result we combine these facts with the known relation between lattice point counts in the facets of $\Delta$ and the Hilbert polynomials of the smooth toric varieties corresponding to these facets.</description>

Abstract: In 1980, Akiyama, Exoo, and Harary conjectured that any graph $G$ can be decomposed into at most $\lceil(\Delta(G)+1)/2\rceil$ linear forests. We confirm the conjecture for robust expanders of linear minimum degree.
  As a consequence, the conjecture holds for dense quasirandom graphs of linear minimum degree
  as well as for large $n$-vertex graphs with minimum degree arbitrarily close to $n/2$ from above.</description>

Abstract: This article focuses on the study of zero-sum invariants of finite non-abelian groups. We address two main problems: the first centers on the ordered Davenport constant and the second on Gao's constant. We establish a connection between the ordered Davenport constant and the small Davenport constant for a finite non-abelian group of even order, which in turn gives a relation with the Noether number. Additionally, we confirm a conjecture of Gao and Li for a non-abelian group of order $2p^{\alpha}$, where $p$ is a prime. Furthermore, we prove a conjecture that connects the ordered Davenport constant to the Loewy length for certain classes of finite $2$-groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a random permutation of $kn$ objects that permutes $n$ disjoint blocks of size $k$ and then permutes elements within each block. Normalizing its cycle lengths by $kn$ gives a random partition of unity, and we derive the limit law of this partition as $k,n \to \infty$. The limit may be constructed via a simple square cutting procedure that generalizes stick breaking in the classical case of random permutations ($k=1$). The expected size of the largest part of this square cutting distribution is approximated to be $0.40$, in contrast with the Golomb-Dickman constant around $0.624$ describing the longest cycle of a uniform random permutation as well as the largest prime factor of a random integer. The distribution function of this largest part is shown to also be the mean of a certain multiplicative function. Along the way we give the first extension of the Erd\H{o}s-Tur\'an law to a proper permutation subgroup.</description>

      <title>An improved bound for strongly regular graphs with smallest eigenvalue $-m$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1979, Neumaier gave a bound on $\lambda$ in terms of $m$ and $\mu$, where $-m$ is the smallest eigenvalue of a primitive strongly regular graph, unless the graph in question belongs to one of the two infinite families of strongly regular graphs. We improve this result. We also indicate how our methods can be used to give an alternate derivation of Bruck's Completion Theorem for orthogonal arrays.</description>

      <title>Some short notes on oriented line graphs and related matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13821v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Oriented line graph, introduced by Kotani and Sunada (2000), is closely related to Hashimato's non-backtracking matrix (1989). It is known that for regular graphs $G$, the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the oriented line graph $\vec{L}(G)$ of $G$ are the reciprocals of the poles of the Ihara zeta function of $G$. We determine the characteristic polynomial of the $z$-Hermitian adjacency matrix of $\vec{L}(G)$ for each $z\in \mathbb{C}$ and $d$-regular graph $G$ with $d\geq 3$. Special cases of this matrix include the Hermitian adjacency matrix of $\vec{L}(G)$ and the adjacency matrix of the underlying undirected graph of $\vec{L}(G)$. We also exhibit an application to star coloring of graphs.</description>

      <title>General Strong Bound on the Uncrossed Number which is Tight for the Edge Crossing Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a very recent concept for visualizing various aspects of a graph in the plane using a collection of drawings introduced by Hlin\v{e}n\'y and Masa\v{r}\'ik [GD 2023]. Formally, given a graph $G$, we aim to find an uncrossed collection containing drawings of $G$ in the plane such that each edge of $G$ is not crossed in at least one drawing in the collection. The uncrossed number of $G$ ($unc(G)$) is the smallest integer $k$ such that an uncrossed collection for $G$ of size $k$ exists. The uncrossed number is lower-bounded by the well-known thickness, which is an edge-decomposition of $G$ into planar graphs. This connection gives a trivial lower-bound $\lceil\frac{|E(G)|}{3|V(G)|-6}\rceil \le unc(G)$. In a recent paper, Balko, Hlin\v{e}n\'y, Masa\v{r}\'ik, Orthaber, Vogtenhuber, and Wagner [GD 2024] presented the first non-trivial and general lower-bound on the uncrossed number. We summarize it in terms of dense graphs (where $|E(G)|=\epsilon(|V(G)|)^2$ for some $\epsilon&gt;0$): $\lceil\frac{|E(G)|}{c_\epsilon|V(G)|}\rceil \le unc(G)$, where $c_\epsilon\ge 2.82$ is a constant depending on $\epsilon$.
  We improve the lower-bound to state that $\lceil\frac{|E(G)|}{3|V(G)|-6-\sqrt{2|E(G)|}+\sqrt{6(|V(G)|-2)}}\rceil \le unc(G)$. Translated to dense graphs regime, the bound yields a multiplicative constant $c'_\epsilon=3-\sqrt{(2-\epsilon)}$ in the expression $\lceil\frac{|E(G)|}{c'_\epsilon|V(G)|+o(|V(G)|)}\rceil \le unc(G)$. Hence, it is tight (up to low-order terms) for $\epsilon \approx \frac{1}{2}$ as warranted by complete graphs.
  In fact, we formulate our result in the language of the maximum uncrossed subgraph number, that is, the maximum number of edges of $G$ that are not crossed in a drawing of $G$ in the plane. In that case, we also provide a construction certifying that our bound is asymptotically tight (up to low-order terms) on dense graphs for all $\epsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>A bijection between symmetric plane partitions and quasi transpose complementary plane partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We resolve the explicit bijection problem between symmetric plane partitions (SPPs) and quasi transpose complementary plane partitions (QTCPPs), introduced by Schreier-Aigner, who proved their equinumerosity. First, we relate this problem to Proctor's parallel equinumerosities for SPPs, even SPPs, staircase plane partitions, and parity staircase plane partitions, by constructing several bijections. As a result, we reduce the task to constructing a compatible bijection between even SPPs and staircase plane partitions. We then provide non-intersecting lattice path configurations for these objects, apply the LGV lemma, and transform the resulting path configurations. This process leads us to new combinatorial objects, $I_m$ and $J_m$, and the task is further reduced to constructing a compatible sijection (signed bijection) between $I_m$ and $J_m$, which is carried out in the final part of this paper. Our construction also answers the 35-year-old open problem posed by Proctor: constructing an explicit bijection between even SPPs and staircase plane partitions.</description>

      <title>Automorphism Groups and Structure of 4-Valent Cayley Graphs on Dihedral Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and let $S$ be an inverse-closed subset of $G$ not containing the identity. The Cayley graph $\mathrm{Cay}(G,S)$ has vertex set $G$, where two vertices $x$ and $y$ are adjacent if and only if $x^{-1}y \in S$.
  Kaseasbeh and Erfanian (2021) determined the structure of all Cayley graphs on the dihedral group of order $2n$ for subsets $S$ of size at most three. We extend their work by analyzing the structure of such Cayley graphs for subsets $S$ of size at least four.
  Our main results are as follows:
  1. using a classical result of Burnside and Schur, we determine the automorphism groups of Cayley graphs on dihedral groups of order $2p$, where $p$ ranges over infinitely many primes and $S$ consists only of rotations;
  2. if $S$ consists of $4 \le 2k &lt; n$ distinct rotations, then the Cayley graph $\mathrm{Cay}(D_{2n},S)$ is the disjoint union of two isomorphic circulant graphs on $n$ vertices, and
  3. if $S$ is a generating set of $4\leq k\leq n$ reflections, then the Cayley graph $\mathrm{Cay}(D_{2n},S)$ is bipartite, forming the disjoint union of $k$ perfect matchings.</description>

      <title>Bounding signed bipartite partial t-trees and application to edge-coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a signed bipartite graph $(B, \pi)$ of negative girth $2k$, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for it to have the following property: each signed bipartite graph $(G, \sigma)$ whose negative girth is at least $2k$ and whose underlying graph has treewidth at most $t$ admits a homomorphism to $(B, \pi)$.
  Applying the result on the signed projective cube $SPC(2k-1)$, we conclude that every signed bipartite graph of negative girth at least $2k$ whose underlying graph is a partial 3-tree admits a homomorphism to $SPC(2k-1)$. For planar partial 3-trees, applying duality we conclude that if $G$ is a planar $2k$-regular multigraph whose dual has treewidth at most 3 and such that every edge-cut $(X, V\backslash X)$, where $|X|$ is odd, has size at least $2k$, then $G$ is $2k$-edge-colorable. This supports a conjecture of Seymour which, in full generality, largely extends Tait's reformulation of the four-color theorem, claiming that the fractional edge-chromatic number of a planar multigraph determines its edge-chromatic number.
  Finally, noting the contrast between fractional isomorphism and quantum isomorphism, where the former admits a polynomial time algorithm while the latter is proved to be undecidable, and observing the similarities of these notions to the subject of our study, we ask if there is an algorithm to decide if an input signed graph $\widehat{B}$ has the following property: if a signed planar graph $\widehat{G}$ does not map to $\widehat{B}$, it would be because a cycle in $\widehat{G}$ does not map to $\widehat{B}$. In other words, minimal planar graphs that do not map to $\widehat{B}$ are signed cycles.</description>

      <title>Extremal diameters of 3-coloring graphs of trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a tree $T$, its 3-coloring graph $\mathcal{C}_3(T)$ has as vertices the proper 3-colorings of $T$, with edges joining colorings that differ at exactly one vertex. We call the diameter of $\mathcal{C}_3(T)$ the 3-coloring diameter of $T$. We introduce the notion of balanced labelings of $T$ and show that the 3-coloring diameter equals the maximum $L_1$-norm of a balanced labeling. Using this equivalence, we determine the maximum and minimum values of the 3-coloring diameter over all trees on $n$ vertices and characterize the extremal trees.</description>

      <title>On Weighted Arboricity: Conductance-Resistance Bounds and Monoid Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09096v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a conductance-weighted arboricity for a finite simple undirected graph $G=(V,E,c)$ with a conductance assignment $c:E\to[0,\infty)$: \[ A_c(G):=\max\bigl\{ D_c(H): H\subseteq G\text{ connected}, |V(H)|\ge 2 \bigr\},\qquad D_c(H):=\frac{\sum_{e\in E(H)}c(e)}{|V(H)|-1}. \] This functional reduces to the classical Nash--Williams identity when $c\equiv 1$, is isomorphism invariant, monotone under subgraphs and edge additions, positively homogeneous, and convex. We prove sharp global bounds \[ \max_{e\in E}c(e)\le A_c(G)\le\sum_{e\in E}c(e), \] with attainment by some connected subgraph. On the analytic side, we introduce a local variant and derive conductance--resistance inequalities using effective resistances in the ambient network. If $R^{G}_{\mathrm{eff}}(e)$ denotes the effective resistance between the endpoints of $e$ in $G$, we show that every connected $H\subseteq G$ satisfies \[ \sum_{e\in E(H)}c(e)\,R^{G}_{\mathrm{eff}}(e)\le |V(H)|-1, \] which in turn yields the upper bound \[ D_c(H)\le\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{e\in E(H)}c(e)/R^{G}_{\mathrm{eff}}(e)}{|V(H)|-1}} \] and hence an explicit effective resistance-based upper bound on $A_c(G)$. On the structural side, we describe the algebraic behavior of $A_c(G)$. We show that under edge-disjoint union, $A_c(G)$ behaves as a max invariant: for a finite disjoint union of weighted graphs one has $A_c(G)= \max_i A_{c_i}(G_i)$. In particular, disjoint union induces a commutative idempotent monoid structure at the level of isomorphism classes, with $A_c(G)$ idempotent with respect to this operation. We also provide a computational exhibit on the hypercube family $Q_d$, including random conductance sampling, illustrating numerical evaluation of the resulting resistance-based bound.</description>

Abstract: For a non-negative integer $k$, a vertex cut in a graph is $k$-degenerate if it induces a $k$-degenerate subgraph. We show that a graph of order $n$ at least $2k+2$ without a $k$-degenerate cut has the size at least $\frac{1}{2}\left(k+\Omega\left(\sqrt{k}\right)\right)n$ and that a graph of order $n$ at least $5$ without a $2$-degenerate cut has the size at least $\frac{27n-35}{10}$. For $k\geq 2$, we show that a connected graph $G$ of order $n$ at least $k+6$ and size $m$ at most $\frac{k+3}{2}n+\frac{k-1}{2}$ has a minimum $k$-degenerate cut.</description>

Abstract: We study a specific line arrangement obtained from a generic $2$-section of the braid arrangement, and compute the fundamental group of its complement via braid monodromy. We show that the resulting presentation of the fundamental group coincides, under the identification of generators, with the modified Artin presentation introduced by Margalit and McCammond. Moreover, we extend the construction to the Manin--Schechtman arrangements $MS(n, k)$, which are higher analogues of the braid arrangement. Focusing on the case $k = 2$, we obtain an explicit presentation of $\pi_1(\mathbb{C}^n \setminus MS(n, 2))$.</description>

      <title>On the global linear Zarankiewicz problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The `global' Zarankiewicz problem for hypergraphs asks for an upper bound on the number of edges of a finite $r$-hypergraph $V$ in terms of the number $|V|$ of its vertices, assuming the edge relation is induced by a fixed $K_{k, \dots, k}$-free $r$-hypergraph $E$, for some $k\in\mathbb N$. In [4], such bounds of size $O(|V|^{r-1})$ were achieved for a semilinear $E$, namely, definable in a linear o-minimal structure. We establish the same bounds in five new settings: when $E$ is definable in (a) a semibounded o-minimal structure and the vertex set of $V$ is `sufficiently distant', (b) a model of Presburger arithmetic, (c) the expansion $\langle\mathbb R,&lt;,+, \mathbb Z\rangle$ of the real ordered group by the set of integers, (d) a stable 1-based structure without the finite cover property, and (e) a locally modular regular type in a stable theory, such as the generic type of the solution set of the Heat differential equation.
  Our methods include techniques for reducing Zarankiewicz's problem to the setting of arbitrary subgroups of powers of groups, used in geometric cases (a)--(c). They also include an abstract version of Zarankiewicz's problem for general saturated `linear structures' that yields the desired bounds in the model-theoretic settings (d)--(e), as well as a parametric version in (b). Furthermore, the bounds in (a) characterise those o-minimal structures that do not recover a global field, and in (c) they yield new versions of Zarankiewicz's problem for certain ordered abelian groups.</description>

      <title>On the Martin boundary for discrete TASEP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a problem with three equivalent formulations: describing Gibbs measures for five-vertex model in quadrant; classifying coherent systems on a p-deformation of the Gelfand-Tsetlin graph related to Grothendieck polynomials; finding the Martin boundary for discrete time TASEP with p-geometric jumps. We find a wide family of the Gibbs measures, parameterized by certain analytic functions. A subset of our measures have probabilistic interpretation as interacting particle systems with fixed particles speeds. In contrast to previous related boundary problems, we find that admissible speeds are not arbitrary, but must be larger than $\frac{p}{1-p}$. For this subset we further establish Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem, connecting the fluctuations to families of independent GUE eigenvalues. As a consequence, the measures from the subset are extreme points of the Martin boundary. It remains open whether our list of measures is exhaustive.</description>

Abstract: The positive part $U_q^+$ of the quantized enveloping algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}_2)$ has a reflection equation presentation of Freidel-Maillet type, due to Baseilhac 2021. This presentation involves a K-matrix of dimension $2 \times 2$. Under an embedding of $U_q^+$ into a $q$-shuffle algebra due to Rosso 1995, this K-matrix can be written in closed form using a PBW basis for $U_q^+$ due to Terwilliger 2019. This PBW basis, together with two PBW bases due to Damiani 1993 and Beck 1994, can be obtain from a uniform approach by Ruan 2025. Following a natural fusion technique, we will construct fused K-matrices of arbitary meaningful dimension in closed form using the uniform approach. We will also show that any pair of these fused K-matrices satisfy Freidel-Maillet type equations.</description>
