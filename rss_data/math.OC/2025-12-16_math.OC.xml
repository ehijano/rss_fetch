      <title>Fractional Calculus in Optimal Control and Game Theory: Theory, Numerics, and Applications -- A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many physical, biological, and engineered systems exhibit memory effects that challenge Markovian models. Fractional calculus provides nonlocal operators to capture hereditary dynamics. This survey connects modeling, analysis, and controller/game design for systems with memory. We unify notation for Caputo, Riemann-Liouville, and Grunwald-Letnikov derivatives and relate them to practical approximations, including diffusive (sum-of-exponentials) state augmentation and frequency-domain realizations (e.g., Oustaloup). We review fractional extensions of the calculus of variations and the Pontryagin maximum principle, and dynamic-programming formulations with memory, including path-dependent HJB for optimal control and HJI for zero-sum games. We cover design tools such as LQR, MPC, and fractional-order PID, as well as fractional differential games with Nash, Stackelberg, and minimax equilibria. Computational approaches are compared across time-domain schemes, frequency-domain approximations, and diffusive augmentations, highlighting accuracy-complexity trade-offs and remedies for the curse of history (windowing and sum-of-exponentials). We conclude with applications and open problems on equilibria with memory, Isaacs-type conditions, constraint handling, and scalable solvers.</description>

      <title>A decentralised forward-backward-type algorithm with network-independent heterogenous agent step sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the problem of finding a zero of a finite sum of maximally monotone operators, where some operators are Lipschitz continuous and the rest are potentially set-valued. We propose a forward-backward-type algorithm for this problem suitable for decentralised implementation. In each iteration, agents evaluate a Lipschitz continuous operator and the resolvent of a potentially set-valued operator, and then communicate with neighbouring agents. Agents choose their step sizes independently using only local information, and the step size upper bound has no dependence on the communication graph. We demonstrate the potential advantages of the proposed algorithm with numerical results for min-max problems and aggregative games.</description>

      <title>Finite Element Analysis of Nash Equilibrium of Bi-objective Optimal Control Problem Governed by Stokes Equation with $L^2$-norm State-Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the Nash equilibrium of a bi-objective optimal control problem governed by the Stokes equations. A multi-objective Nash strategy is formulated, and fundamental theoretical results are established, including the existence, uniqueness, and analytical characterization of the equilibrium. A finite element framework is developed to approximate the coupled optimal control system, and the corresponding optimality conditions for both the continuous and discrete formulations are rigorously derived and analyzed. Furthermore, \textit{a priori} finite element error estimates are obtained for the discrete problem, ensuring convergence and stability of the proposed method. The theoretical results are corroborated by numerical experiments, which demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of the finite element approach.</description>

      <title>Structure versus regularity of set-valued maps in convex generalized Nash equilibrium problems in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalized Nash equilibrium problem (GNEP) in Banach space consists of $N&gt;1$ optimal control problems with couplings in both the objective functions and, most importantly, in the feasible sets. We address the existence of equilibria for convex GNEPs in Banach space. We show that the standard assumption of lower semicontinuity of the set-valued constraint maps - foundational in the current literature on GNEPs - can be replaced by graph convexity or the so-called Knaster-Kuratowski-Mazurkiewicz (KKM) property. Lower semicontinuity is often essential for obtaining upper semicontinuity of best response maps, crucial for the existence theory based on Kakutani-Fan fixed-point arguments. However, in function spaces or PDE-constrained settings, verifying lower semicontinuity becomes much more challenging (even in convex cases), whereas graph convexity, for example, is often straightforward to check. Our results unify several existence theorems in the literature and clarify the structural role of constraint maps. We also extend Rosen's uniqueness condition to Banach spaces using a multiplier bias framework. Additionally, we present a geometric counterpart to our analytic framework using preference maps. This geometric is intended as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, the analytic theory developed in the main body of the paper.</description>

      <title>A bilinear pointwise tracking optimal control problem for a semilinear elliptic PDE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a bilinear optimal control problem with pointwise tracking for a semilinear elliptic PDE in two and three dimensions. The control variable enters the PDE as a (reaction) coefficient and the cost functional contains point evaluations of the state variable. These point evaluations lead to an adjoint problem with a linear combination of Dirac measures as a forcing term. In Lipschitz domains, we derive the existence of optimal solutions and analyze first and necessary and sufficient second order optimality conditions. We also prove that every locally optimal control $\bar u$ belongs to $H^1(\Omega)$. Finally, assuming that the domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is a convex polygon, we prove that $\bar u \in C^{0,1}(\bar \Omega)$.</description>

      <title>Linear convergence of relocated fixed-point iterations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish linear convergence of relocated fixed-point iterations as introduced by Atenas et al. (2025) assuming the algorithmic operator satisfies a linear error bound. In particular, this framework applies to the setting where the algorithmic operator is a contraction. As a key application of our framework, we obtain linear convergence of the relocated Douglas--Rachford algorithm for finding a zero in the sum of two monotone operators in a setting with Lipschitz continuity and strong monotonicity assumptions. We also apply the framework to deduce linear convergence of variable stepsize resolvent splitting algorithms for multioperator monotone inclusions.</description>

      <title>Hinge-Proximal Stochastic Gradient Methods for Convex Optimization with Functional Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers stochastic convex optimization problems with smooth functional constraints arising in constrained estimation and robust signal recovery. We operate in the high-dimensional and highly-constrained setting, where oracle access is restricted to one or a few objective and constraint gradients per-iteration, as in streaming or online estimation. Existing approaches to solve such problems are based on either the stochastic primal-dual or stochastic subgradient methods, and require globally Lipschitz continuous constraint functions. In this work, we develop a hinge-proximal framework that utilizes an exact penalty reformulation to yield updates involving only one linearized constraint (and hence accessing one constraint gradient) per-iteration. The updates also admit a novel hinge-proximal three-point inequality relying on smoothness rather than global Lipschitz continuity of the constraint functions. The framework leads to three algorithms: a baseline hinge-proximal SGD (HPS), a variance-reduced HPS version for finite-sum settings, and a nested HPS version whose performance depends on a geometric regularity constant of the constraint region rather than explicitly on the number of constraints, while achieving near-SGD sample complexity. The superior empirical performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated on a robust regression problem with noisy features, representative of errors-in-variables estimation.</description>

      <title>A Random Batch Method for the Efficient Simulation and Optimal Control of Networked 1-D Wave Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a stochastic algorithm for the efficient simulation and optimal control of networked wave equations based on the random batch method is proposed and analyzed. The random approximation is constructed by dividing the time interval into subintervals and restricting the dynamics to a randomly chosen subnetwork during each of these subintervals. It is proven that the solution for this randomized system converges in expectation to the solution on the original network when the length of the subintervals approaches zero. Furthermore, the optimal controls for the randomized system converge (in $H^2$ and in expectation) to the optimal controls for the original system. The computational advantage of the proposed method is demonstrated in two numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Local controllability in finite time and the controllable time of the Korteweg-De Vries equation using the right Neumann controls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the local boundary controllability of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation with right Neumann boundary controls at critical lengths. We show that the KdV system is not locally null-controllable in small time for all critical lengths for which the unreachable subspace of the linearized system has dimension at least two. This result extends the work of Coron, Koenig, and Nguyen, who established it for a subclass of these lengths. We also obtain a new controllability time for such systems for all but two critical lengths. It is worth noting that the latest results on the controllability time prior to this work date back to the work of Cerpa (2007) and Cerpa and Crepeau (2009).</description>

      <title>Stopping Rules for Stochastic Gradient Descent via Anytime-Valid Confidence Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stopping rules for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for convex optimization from the perspective of anytime-valid confidence sequences. Classical analyses of SGD provide convergence guarantees in expectation or at a fixed horizon, but offer no statistically valid way to assess, at an arbitrary time, how close the current iterate is to the optimum. We develop an anytime-valid, data-dependent upper confidence sequence for the weighted average suboptimality of projected SGD, constructed via nonnegative supermartingales and requiring no smoothness or strong convexity. This confidence sequence yields a simple stopping rule that is provably $\varepsilon$-optimal with probability at least $1-\alpha$ and is almost surely finite under standard stochastic approximation stepsizes. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first rigorous, time-uniform performance guarantees and finite-time $\varepsilon$-optimality certificates for projected SGD with general convex objectives, based solely on observable trajectory quantities.</description>

      <title>A Spectral Exponential Stability Criterion for Integral Difference Equations and Delay Differential Equations in various state spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well-known that the exponential stability of Integral Difference Equations and Delay Difference Equations, in the usual state space of continuous functions, is equivalent to the location of the roots of its associated characteristic equation strictly in the open left half-plane (see e.g. [16, Chapter 9]). In this paper, we use results from [15, Chapter 4] to show that this characterization still holds for other functional state spaces: Lebesgue spaces, the space of Borel measurable bounded functions, and the space of functions with bounded variation.</description>

      <title>Integrating ethical, societal and environmental issues into algorithm design courses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This document, intended for computer science teachers, describes a case study that puts into practice a questioning of ethical, societal and environmental issues when designing or implementing a decision support system. This study is based on a very popular application, namely road navigation software that informs users of real-time traffic conditions and suggests routes between a starting point and a destination, taking these conditions into account (such as Waze). The approach proposes to intertwine technical considerations (optimal path algorithms, data needed for location, etc.) with a broader view of the ethical, environmental and societal issues raised by the tools studied. Based on the authors' experience conducting sessions with students over several years, this document discusses the context of such a study, suggests teaching resources for implementing it, describes ways to structure discussions, and shares scenarios in different teaching contexts.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of physics-informed regression, and propose a method that directly computes the state at the prediction point, simultaneously with the derivative and curvature information of the existing samples. We frame each prediction as a constrained optimisation problem, leveraging multivariate Taylor series expansions and explicitly enforcing physical laws. Each individual query can be processed with low computational cost without any pre- or re-training, in contrast to global function approximator-based solutions such as neural networks. Our comparative benchmarks on a reaction-diffusion system show competitive predictive accuracy relative to a neural network-based solution, while completely eliminating the need for long training loops, and remaining robust to changes in the sampling layout.</description>

      <title>Better LMO-based Momentum Methods with Second-Order Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of momentum in stochastic optimization algorithms has shown empirical success across a range of machine learning tasks. Recently, a new class of stochastic momentum algorithms has emerged within the Linear Minimization Oracle (LMO) framework--leading to state-of-the-art methods, such as Muon, Scion, and Gluon, that effectively solve deep neural network training problems. However, traditional stochastic momentum methods offer convergence guarantees no better than the ${O}(1/K^{1/4})$ rate. While several approaches--such as Hessian-Corrected Momentum (HCM)--have aimed to improve this rate, their theoretical results are generally restricted to the Euclidean norm setting. This limitation hinders their applicability in problems, where arbitrary norms are often required. In this paper, we extend the LMO-based framework by integrating HCM, and provide convergence guarantees under relaxed smoothness and arbitrary norm settings. We establish improved convergence rates of ${O}(1/K^{1/3})$ for HCM, which can adapt to the geometry of the problem and achieve a faster rate than traditional momentum. Experimental results on training Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks verify our theoretical observations.</description>

      <title>A Voronoi Diagram-Based Approach for AC Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary goal of Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is to optimize the operation of a power system while meeting the demand and adhering to operational constraints. This paper presents a new approach for AC OPF. First, the approach constructs a Voronoi diagram by distributing multiple sample points representing potential solutions throughout the search space. Then, it recursively adds new sample points including a tentative optimal point from the continuous gradient-projection method, a point in the most sparsely populated region to ensure high fidelity, and the connecting point, until the stopping criterion is met. The proposed approach is illustrated in detail using the IEEE 9-bus system and then validated on the IEEE 39-bus and 118-bus systems to verify the quality of the obtained solution.</description>

      <title>Optimal strategies for the growth of dual-seeded lattice structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal growth of structures governed by spatially stochastic dynamics arises in many scientific settings, for example in processes such as solution-based crystallization and the formation of microbial biofilms on patterned substrates or microfluidic networks. In this work, we investigate lattice growth using a two-dimensional, zero-temperature stochastic model of short-range spin interactions. Our goal is to determine how external perturbations can be optimized to steer the system efficiently toward the uniformly positive state, starting from two initial clusters of positive sites. To achieve this, we cast the problem as a Markov decision process adapted for a two-dimensional Ising model with zero-temperature dynamics. Within this framework, we compare alternative growth geometries and identify the structure of optimal strategies across three representative regimes.</description>

      <title>Collective Annealing by Switching Temperatures: a Boltzmann-type description</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of effective cooling strategies is a crucial component in simulated annealing algorithms based on the Metropolis method. Traditionally, this is achieved through inverse logarithmic decays of the temperature to ensure convergence to global minima. In this work, we propose Collective Annealing by Switching Temperatures (CAST), a novel collective simulated annealing dynamic in which agents interact to learn an adaptive cooling schedule. Inspired by the particle-swapping mechanism of parallel tempering, we introduce a Boltzmann-type framework in which particles exchange temperatures through stochastic binary interactions. This process leads to a gradual decrease of the average temperature in the system. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach consistently outperforms classical simulated annealing with both logarithmic and geometric cooling schedules, particularly in terms of convergence speed.</description>

      <title>A Generalized Energy-Based Adaptive Gradient Method for Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive Gradient Descent with Energy (AEGD) is a variant of gradient descent (GD) designed to mitigate step-size sensitivity through an energy-based formulation. AEGD is notable for its unconditional energy stability, which guarantees monotonic energy decay and convergence independently of the initial step size. In this work, we propose the Generalized Energy-Based Adaptive Gradient (gAEGD) method, which extends AEGD by replacing the square-root energy with a broader class of admissible energy functions. We show that gAEGD preserves unconditional energy stability, remains robust to step-size selection, and exhibits a two-phase adaptive dynamic: the effective step size first adjusts automatically and then stabilizes within a regime that ensures decay of the objective function values. We establish an optimal convergence rate of $O(\frac{1}{k})$ for attaining an $\epsilon$-stationary point, and further derive improved convergence rates for the objective gap under a local Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (KL) condition. Extensive numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical results and demonstrate that a particular instance of gAEGD-ALEGD, which employs a logarithmic energy function-often outperforms AEGD across a range of benchmark optimization problems.</description>

      <title>A Class of Accelerated Fixed-Point-Based Methods with Delayed Inexact Oracles and Its Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel accelerated fixed-point-based framework using delayed inexact oracles to approximate a fixed point of a nonexpansive operator (or equivalently, a root of a co-coercive operator), a central problem in scientific computing. Our approach leverages both Nesterov's acceleration technique and the Krasnosel'skii-Mann (KM) iteration, while accounting for delayed inexact oracles, a key mechanism in asynchronous algorithms. We also introduce a unified approximate error condition for delayed inexact oracles, which can cover various practical scenarios. Under mild conditions and appropriate parameter updates, we establish both $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ non-asymptotic and $o(1/k^2)$ asymptotic convergence rates in expectation for the squared norm of residual. Our rate significantly improves the $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ rates in classical KM-type methods, including their asynchronous variants. We also establish $o(1/k^2)$ almost sure convergence rates and the almost sure convergence of iterates to a solution of the problem. Within our framework, we instantiate three settings for the underlying operator: (i) a deterministic universal delayed oracle; (ii) a stochastic delayed oracle; and (iii) a finite-sum structure with asynchronous updates. For each case, we instantiate our framework to obtain a concrete algorithmic variant for which our convergence results still apply, and whose iteration complexity depends linearly on the maximum delay. Finally, we verify our algorithms and theoretical results through two numerical examples on both matrix game and shallow neural network training problems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Efficiency Optimization in SDLC: An MILP Approach for Balanced and Cost-Effective Resource Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficient allocation of human resources is a critical concern in software development and other industries. This paper introduces a rigorous mathematical methodology for task assignment, employing Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to ensure both balanced workloads and cost minimization. The proposed model systematically integrates individual employee efficiency, task complexity, and performance metrics to reflect real organizational dynamics. The formulation is guided by two principal objectives: firstly, to achieve equitable work load distribution commensurate with employee efficiency, and secondly, to minimize overall project costs by accounting for task difficulty and individual proficiency. Furthermore, the approach incorporates adaptive updates to efficiency parameters based on observed performance, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. Empirical evaluation using simulated datasets demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over conventional assignment strategies in terms of both workload fairness and cost reduction. The findings underscore the potential of this MILP based framework as a robust, scalable, and adaptable solution for contemporary human resource allocation challenges in project management contexts.</description>

      <title>Reciprocal relationship between detectability and observability in a non-uniform setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the recent notion of non-uniform complete observability, and on the fact that this property ensures non-uniform exponential detectability, this paper establishes the converse implication under suitable additional assumptions. Specifically, we investigate conditions under which non-uniform exponential detectability guarantees non-uniform complete observability. Our approach is based on a refined analysis of the associated output feedback systems and on the preservation of non-uniform observability properties under such feedback transformations. These results extend the classical equivalence between observability and detectability beyond the uniform framework and provide new tools for the qualitative analysis of time-varying control systems.</description>

      <title>Memory-Type Null Controllability of Parabolic Equations with Moving Controls: A Geometric Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study memory-type null controllability for linear parabolic equations with hereditary terms and time-dependent control regions. In contrast with classical null controllability, systems with memory require the simultaneous annihilation of both the state and the accumulated memory at the terminal time in order to prevent post-control reactivation of the dynamics.
  Assuming that the memory kernel is a finite sum of exponentials, we reformulate the problem as a coupled parabolic--ODE system. Within this framework, we introduce a geometric condition on moving control regions, referred to as the Memory Geometric Control Condition (MGCC), which requires that every spatial point be visited by the control region during the control horizon.
  Under MGCC, we establish an augmented observability inequality for the adjoint system by means of a flow-adapted Carleman estimate. This observability result, which explicitly accounts for the memory variables, allows us to derive memory-type null controllability via the Hilbert Uniqueness Method. We also discuss the limitations of the approach and explain why full geometric necessity results remain out of reach in the presence of memory effects.
  The analysis provides a rigorous sufficient geometric condition for memory-type null controllability of parabolic equations with exponential memory kernels and moving controls.</description>

      <title>Solving Parallel Machine Scheduling With Precedences and Cumulative Resource Constraints With Calendars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The task of finding efficient production schedules for parallel machines is a challenge that arises in most industrial manufacturing domains. There is a large potential to minimize production costs through automated scheduling techniques, due to the large-scale requirements of modern factories. In the past, solution approaches have been studied for many machine scheduling variations, where even basic variants have been shown to be NP-hard. However, in today's real-life production environments, additional complex precedence constraints and resource restrictions with calendars arise that must be fulfilled. These additional constraints cannot be tackled efficiently by existing solution techniques. Thus, there is a strong need to develop and analyze automated methods that can solve such real-life parallel machine scheduling scenarios. In this work, we introduce a novel variant of parallel machine scheduling with job precedences and calendar-based cumulative resource constraints that arises in real-life industrial use cases. A constraint modeling approach is proposed as an exact solution method for small scheduling scenarios together with state-of-the-art constraint-solving technology. Further, we propose a construction heuristic as well as a tailored metaheuristic using local search to efficiently tackle large-scale problem instances. This metaheuristic approach has been deployed and is currently being used in an industrial setting.</description>

      <title>Congestion Reduction in EV Charger Placement Using Traffic Equilibrium Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Growing EV adoption can worsen traffic conditions if chargers are sited without regard to their impact on congestion. We study how to strategically place EV chargers to reduce congestion using two equilibrium models: one based on congestion games and one based on an atomic queueing simulation. We apply both models within a scalable greedy station-placement algorithm. Experiments show that this greedy scheme yields optimal or near-optimal congestion outcomes in realistic networks, even though global optimality is not guaranteed as we show with a counterexample. We also show that the queueing-based approach yields more realistic results than the congestion-game model, and we present a unified methodology that calibrates congestion delays from queue simulation and solves equilibrium in link-space.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Online Distributed Aggregative Games With Time-Varying and Non-Identical Communication and Feedback Delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates online distributed aggregative games with time-varying cost functions, where agents are interconnected through an unbalanced communication graph. Due to the distributed and noncooperative nature of the game, some curious agents may wish to steal sensitive information from neighboring agents during parameter exchanges. Additionally, communication delays arising from network congestion, particularly in wireless settings, as well as feedback delays, can hinder the convergence of agents to a Nash equilibrium. Although a recent work addressed both communication and feedback delays in aggregative games, it is based on the unrealistic assumption that the delays are fixed over time and identical across agents. Hence, the case of time-varying and non-identical delays across agents has never been considered in aggregative games. In this work, we address the combined challenges of privacy leakage with time-varying and non-identical communication and feedback delays for the first time. We propose an online distributed dual averaging algorithm that simultaneously tackles these challenges while achieving a provably low regret bound. Our simulation result shows that the running average of each client's local action converges over time.</description>

      <title>Feasible-Set Reshaping for Constraint Qualification in Optimization-Based Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel feasible-set reshaping technique to optimization-based control with ensured constraint qualification. In our problem setting, the feasible set of admissible control inputs depends on the real-time state of the plant, and the linear independence constraint qualification (LICQ) may not be satisfied in some regions of interest. By feasible-set reshaping, we project the constraints of the original feasible set onto an appropriately chosen constant matrix with its rows forming a positive span of the space of the optimization variable. It is proved that the reshaped feasible set is nonempty and satisfies LICQ, as long as the original feasible set is nonempty. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by constructing Lipschitz continuous quadratic-program-based (QP-based) controllers based on the reshaped feasible sets.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study optimal trade execution with a hard-zero terminal inventory constraint, modeled via Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. Vanilla PINNs often under-enforce this constraint and produce unstable controls. We propose a Multi-Trajectory PINN (MT-PINN) that adds a rollout-based trajectory loss and propagates a terminal penalty on terminal inventory via backpropagation-through-time, directly enforcing zero terminal inventory. A lightweight lambda-curriculum is adopted to stabilize training as the state expands from a risk-neutral reduced HJB to a risk-averse HJB. On the Gatheral-Schied single-asset model, MT-PINN aligns closely with their derived closed-form solutions and concentrates terminal inventory tightly around zero while reducing errors along optimal paths. We apply MT-PINNs on SPY intraday data, matching TWAP when risk-neutral, and achieving lower exposure and competitive costs, especially in falling windows, for higher risk-aversion.</description>

      <title>Optimal Labeler Assignment and Sampling for Active Learning in the Presence of Imperfect Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active Learning (AL) has garnered significant interest across various application domains where labeling training data is costly. AL provides a framework that helps practitioners query informative samples for annotation by oracles (labelers). However, these labels often contain noise due to varying levels of labeler accuracy. Additionally, uncertain samples are more prone to receiving incorrect labels because of their complexity. Learning from imperfectly labeled data leads to an inaccurate classifier. We propose a novel AL framework to construct a robust classification model by minimizing noise levels. Our approach includes an assignment model that optimally assigns query points to labelers, aiming to minimize the maximum possible noise within each cycle. Additionally, we introduce a new sampling method to identify the best query points, reducing the impact of label noise on classifier performance. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves classification performance compared to several benchmark methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of base states on the consistency of the dual variational formulation for quadratic systems of PDEs, which are not necessarily conservative (typical examples include the noise-free Nash system with a quadratic Hamiltonian and multiple players). We identify a sufficient condition under which consistency holds over large time intervals. In particular, in the single-player case, there exists a sequence of base states (each exhibiting full consistency) that converges in mean to zero. We also prove existence of variational dual solutions to the noise-free Nash system for arbitrary base states. Furthermore, we propose a scheme based on Hilbertian gradient flows that, starting from an arbitrary base state, generates a sequence of new base states that is expected to converge to a solution of the original PDE.</description>

      <title>On the embedding transformation for optimal control of multi-mode switched systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops an embedding-based approach to solve switched optimal control problems (SOCPs) with an arbitrary number of subsystems. Initially, the discrete switching signal is represented by a set of binary variables, encoding each mode in binary format. An embedded optimal control problem (EOCP) is then formulated by replacing these binary variables with continuous embedded variables that can take intermediate values between zero and one. Although embedding allows SOCPs to be addressed using conventional techniques, the optimal solutions of EOCPs often yield intermediate values for binary variables, which may not be feasible for the original SOCP. To address this challenge, a modified EOCP (MEOCP) is introduced by adding a concave auxiliary cost function of appropriate dimensionality to the main cost function. This addition ensures that the optimal solution of the EOCP is bang-bang, and as a result, feasible for the original SOCP.</description>

To do so, we construct a Douglas-Rachford-style splitting formulation, which we then solve with a semi-smooth Newton (SSN) method. We show that our algorithm enjoys local superlinear convergence. In order to augment the fast local behavior of our SSN method with global efficiency guarantees, we develop a hybrid method that combines our SSN method with the state-of-the-art first-order method for game solving, Predictive Regret Matching$^+$ (PRM$^+$). Our hybrid algorithm leverages the global progress provided by PRM$^+$, while achieving a local superlinear convergence rate once it switches to SSN near a Nash equilibrium. Numerical experiments on matrix games demonstrate order-of-magnitude speedups over PRM$^+$ for high-precision solutions.</description>

      <title>A Regime-Switching Approach to the Unbalanced Schr\"odinger Bridge Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unbalanced Schr\"odinger bridge problem (uSBP) seeks to interpolate between a probability measure $\rho_0$ and a sub-probability measure $\rho_T$ while minimizing KL divergence to a reference measure $\mathbf{R}$ on a path space. In this work, we investigate the case where $\mathbf{R}$ is the path measure of a diffusion process with killing, which we interpret as a regime-switching diffusion. In addition to matching the initial and terminal distributions of trajectories that survive up to time $T$, we consider a general constraint $\psi(t,x)$ on the distribution of killing times and/or killing locations.
  We investigate the uSBPs corresponding to four choices of $\psi$ in detail which reflect different levels of information available to an observer. We also provide a rigorous analysis of the connections and the comparisons among the outcomes of these four cases. Our results are novel in the field of uSBP. The regime-switching approach proposed in this work provides a unified framework for tackling different uSBP scenarios, which not only reconciles but also extends the existing literature on uSBP.</description>

      <title>VoroLight: Learning Quality Volumetric Voronoi Meshes from General Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present VoroLight, a differentiable framework for 3D shape reconstruction based on Voronoi meshing. Our approach generates smooth, watertight surfaces and topologically consistent volumetric meshes directly from diverse inputs, including images, implicit shape level-set fields, point clouds and meshes. VoroLight operates in three stages: it first initializes a surface using a differentiable Voronoi formulation, then refines surface quality through a polygon-face sphere training stage, and finally reuses the differentiable Voronoi formulation for volumetric optimization with additional interior generator points.

      <title>Convection Effects and Optimal Insulation: Modelling and Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study an insulation problem that seeks to determine the optimal distribution of a given amount $m&gt;0$ of insulating material coating an insulated boundary part $\Gamma_I\subseteq \partial\Omega$ of a thermally conducting body $\Omega\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$, $d\in \mathbb{N}$, subject to convective heat transfer. The `$\textit{thickness}$' of the insulating layer $\Sigma_{I}^{\varepsilon}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ is given locally via $\varepsilon \mathtt{d}$, where $\varepsilon&gt;0$ denotes the (arbitrarily small) conductivity and $\mathtt{d}\colon \Gamma_{I}\to [0,+\infty)$ the (to be determined) distribution of the insulating material. Then, the physical process is modelled by the stationary heat equation in the insulated thermally conducting body $\Omega_{I}^{\varepsilon}:= \Omega\cup\Sigma_{I}^{\varepsilon}$ with Robin-type boundary conditions on the interacting insulation boundary $\Gamma_I^{\varepsilon}\subseteq \partial\Omega_{I}^{\varepsilon}$ (reflecting convective heat transfer between the thermally conducting body $\Omega$ and its surrounding medium) as well as Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions at the remaining boundary parts, $\textit{i.e.}$, $\partial\Omega_{I}^{\varepsilon}\setminus \Gamma_I^{\varepsilon}$.
  More precisely, we establish $\Gamma(L^2(\mathbb{R}^d))$-convergence of the heat loss formulation (as ${\varepsilon \to 0^+}$), in the case that the thermally conducting body $\Omega$ is a bounded Lipschitz domain having a $C^{1,1}$-regular or piece-wise flat insulated boundary $\Gamma_I$.</description>

      <title>Iterative Tuning of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Robotic Manufacturing Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manufacturing processes are often perturbed by drifts in the environment and wear in the system, requiring control re-tuning even in the presence of repetitive operations. This paper presents an iterative learning framework for automatic tuning of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) weighting matrices based on task-level performance feedback. Inspired by norm-optimal Iterative Learning Control (ILC), the proposed method adaptively adjusts NMPC weights Q and R across task repetitions to minimize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to tracking accuracy, control effort, and saturation. Unlike gradient-based approaches that require differentiating through the NMPC solver, we construct an empirical sensitivity matrix, enabling structured weight updates without analytic derivatives. The framework is validated through simulation on a UR10e robot performing carbon fiber winding on a tetrahedral core. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach converges to near-optimal tracking performance (RMSE within 0.3% of offline Bayesian Optimization (BO)) in just 4 online repetitions, compared to 100 offline evaluations required by BO algorithm. The method offers a practical solution for adaptive NMPC tuning in repetitive robotic tasks, combining the precision of carefully optimized controllers with the flexibility of online adaptation.</description>

      <title>Deployable Prototype Testing and Control Allocation of the CABLESSail Concept for Solar Sail Shape Control and Momentum Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents prototype testing and a control allocation algorithm for the Cable-Actuated Bio-inspired Lightweight Elastic Solar Sail (CABLESSail) concept aimed at performing momentum management of a solar sail. CABLESSail uses actuated cables routed along the structural booms of the solar sail to control the shape of the solar sail and changes the solar radiation pressure disturbance torques acting on it. Small-scale prototype tests of CABLESSail are presented in this paper, which demonstrate the effectiveness of cable actuation on deployable booms. A novel control allocation method is also presented in this paper that provides a computationally-efficient manner to determine the deformations required in each of the structural booms to impart the desired momentum management torque on the solar sail. Numerical simulation results with the proposed algorithm demonstrate robustness to uncertainty in the shape of the sail membrane, resulting in reliable generation of momentum management torques that exceed or meet the capabilities of state-of-the-art solar sail actuators. Both the prototype tests and control allocation methods presented in this paper represent key steps in raising the technology readiness level of the CABLESSail concept.</description>

      <title>Pontryagin Maximum Principle for Rydberg-blockaded state-to-state transfers: A semi-analytic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study time-optimal state-to-state control for two- and multi-qubit operations motivated by neutral-atom quantum processors within the Rydberg blockade regime. Block-diagonalization of the Hamiltonian simplifies the dynamics and enables the application of a semi-analytic approach to the Pontryagin Maximum Principle to derive optimal laser controls. We provide a general formalism for $N$ qubits. For $N=2$ qubits, we classify normal and abnormal extremals, showcasing examples where abnormal solutions are either absent or suboptimal. For normal extremals, we establish a correspondence between the laser detuning from atomic transitions and the motion of a classical particle in a quartic potential, yielding a reduced, semi-analytic formulation of the control problem. Combining PMP-based insights with numerical optimization, our approach bridges analytic and computational methods for high-fidelity, time-optimal control.</description>

      <title>Exponential Absolute Minimizing extension and biased infinity Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the variational structure of the biased infinity Laplacian by introducing a notion of the $\beta$\textit{-Exponential Absolute Minimizing Extension} ($\beta$--AM) on arbitrary length space, which absolutely minimizing the exponential slope
  $$ L^{\beta}_u (E) := \beta \sup_{x,y \in E} \frac{u(y) - e^{-\beta |x-y|} u(x)}{1- e^{-\beta |x-y|}}. $$We also define the corresponding Exponential McShane-Whitney-type extension, and $\beta$-biased convexity, which equivalently characterize $\beta$-AM and may be of independent interest. These generalize the classical Absolute Minimizing Lipschitz Extension as a special case when $\beta = 0$. In Euclidean space with Euclidean norm, this corresponds to the Aronsson equation with Hamiltonian \[ H(u, \nabla u) = |\nabla u| + \beta u, \] equivalently viscosity solutions of $\Delta_{\infty}^{\beta} u = 0$. We show that $\beta$-AM arises as the continuum value of a biased tug-of-war game. Analogous to the unbiased case, we derive various properties of this extension. As an application, we further show that the linear blow-up property holds for biased infinity harmonic functions.</description>

Abstract: Numerical methods for developing port-Hamiltonian representations of general linear time-invariant systems are studied. The approach extends previous port-Hamiltonian characterizations to include the general non-minimal case and the case where the feedthrough term fails to have an invertible symmetric part. The resulting construction is able to identify infeasibility when the system fails to be port-Hamiltonian, and allows for the incorporation of perturbations in order to arrive at a nearby port-Hamiltonian system. Results are illustrated via numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Augmenting Iterative Trajectory for Bilevel Optimization: Methodology, Analysis and Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge of machine learning applications developed with hierarchical structure, which can be approached from Bi-Level Optimization (BLO) perspective. However, most existing gradient-based methods overlook the interdependence between hyper-gradient calculation and Lower-Level (LL) iterative trajectory, focusing solely on the former. Consequently, convergence theory is constructed with restrictive LL assumptions, which are often challenging to satisfy in real-world scenarios. In this work, we thoroughly analyze the constructed iterative trajectory, and highlight two deficiencies, including empirically chosen initialization and default use of entire trajectory for hyper-gradient calculation. To address these issues, we introduce two augmentation techniques including Initialization Auxiliary (IA) and Pessimistic Trajectory Truncation (PTT), and investigate various extension strategies such as prior regularization, different iterative mapping schemes and acceleration dynamics to construct Augmented Iterative Trajectory (AIT) for corresponding BLO scenarios (e.g., LL convexity and LL non-convexity). Theoretically, we provide convergence analysis for AIT and its variations under different LL assumptions, and establish the convergence analysis for BLOs with non-convex LL subproblem. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of AIT through three numerical examples, typical learning and vision applications (e.g., data hyper-cleaning and few-shot learning) and more challenging tasks such as neural architecture search.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04531v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SeDuMi and SDPT3 are two solvers for solving Semi-definite Programming (SDP) or Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problems. A computational performance comparison of these two are undertaken in this paper regarding the Stability of Continuous-time Linear Systems. The comparison mainly focuses on computational times and memory requirements for different scales of problems. To implement and compare the two solvers on a set of well-posed problems, we employ YALMIP, a widely used toolbox for modeling and optimization in MATLAB. The primary goal of this study is to provide an empirical assessment of the relative computational efficiency of SeDuMi and SDPT3 under varying problem conditions. Our evaluation indicates that SDPT3 performs much better in large-scale, high-precision calculations.</description>

      <title>Optimal Rates of Convergence for Entropy Regularization in Discounted Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04163v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the error introduced by entropy regularization in infinite-horizon discrete discounted Markov decision processes. We show that this error decreases exponentially in the inverse regularization strength, both in a weighted KL-divergence and in value with a problem-specific exponent. This is in contrast to previously known estimates, of the order $O(\tau)$, where $\tau$ is the regularization strength. We provide a lower bound that matches our upper bound up to a polynomial term, thereby characterizing the exponential convergence rate for entropy regularization. Our proof relies on the observation that the solutions of entropy-regularized Markov decision processes solve a gradient flow of the unregularized reward with respect to a Riemannian metric common in natural policy gradient methods. This correspondence allows us to identify the limit of this gradient flow as the generalized maximum entropy optimal policy, thereby characterizing the implicit bias of this gradient flow, which corresponds to a time-continuous version of the natural policy gradient method. We use our improved error estimates to show that for entropy-regularized natural policy gradient methods, the overall error decays exponentially in the square root of the number of iterations, improving over existing sublinear guarantees. Finally, we extend our analysis to settings beyond the entropy. In particular, we characterize the implicit bias regarding general convex potentials and their resulting generalized natural policy gradients.</description>

      <title>A gradient flow on control space with rough initial condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11817v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the (sub-Riemannian type) control problem of finding a path going from an initial point $x$ to a target point $y$, by only moving in certain admissible directions. We assume that the corresponding vector fields satisfy the bracket-generating (H\"ormander) condition, so that the classical Chow-Rashevskii theorem guarantees the existence of such a path. One natural way to try to solve this problem is via a gradient flow on control space. However, since the corresponding dynamics may have saddle points, any convergence result must rely on suitable (e.g. random) initialisation. We consider the case when this initialisation is irregular, which is conveniently formulated via Lyons' rough path theory. We show that one advantage of this initialisation is that the saddle points are moved to infinity, while minima remain at a finite distance from the starting point. In the step $2$-nilpotent case, we further manage to prove that the gradient flow converges to a solution, if the initial condition is the path of a Brownian motion (or rougher). The proof is based on combining ideas from Malliavin calculus with {\L}ojasiewicz inequalities. A possible motivation for our study comes from the training of deep Residual Neural Nets, in the regime when the number of trainable parameters per layer is smaller than the dimension of the data vector.</description>

Abstract: We propose and study a variant of the Dai-Liao spectral conjugate gradient method, developed through an analysis of eigenvalues and inspired by a modified secant condition. We show that our proposed method is globally convergent for general nonlinear functions under standard assumptions. By incorporating the new secant condition and a quasi-Newton direction, we introduce updated spectral parameters. These changes ensure that the resulting search direction satisfies the sufficient descent property without relying on any line search. Numerical experiments show that the proposed algorithm performs better than several existing methods in terms of convergence speed and computational efficiency. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated through an application to signal processing.</description>

      <title>Young measure relaxation gaps for controllable systems with smooth state constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we tackle the problem of the existence of a gap corresponding to Young measure relaxations for state-constrained optimal control problems. We provide a counterexample proving that a gap may occur in a very regular setting, namely for a smooth controllable system state-constrained to the closed unit ball, provided that the Lagrangian density (i.e., the running cost) is non-convex in the control variables. The example is constructed in the setting of sub-Riemannian geometry with the core ingredient being an unusual admissible curve that exhibits a certain form of resistance to state-constrained approximation. Specifically, this curve cannot be approximated by neighboring admissible curves while obeying the state constraint due to the intricate nature of the dynamics near the boundary of the constraint set. This example therefore demonstrates the impossibility of Filippov-Wazewski type approximation in the presence of state constraints. Our example also presents an occupation measure relaxation gap.</description>

Abstract: We study a stochastic control problem for nonlinear systems governed by
  stochastic differential equations with irregular drift. The drift
  coefficient is assumed to decompose as $b(t,x,a)=b_1(t,x)+b_2(x)b_3(t,a)$, where $b_1$ is bounded and Borel
  measurable, $b_2$ has bounded variation, and $b_3$ is bounded and
  smooth.
  Under these minimal regularity assumptions, we establish a
  Pontryagin-type stochastic maximum principle. The analysis relies on
  new results for SDEs with random drift of bounded variation, including
  existence, uniqueness, and Malliavin-Sobolev differentiability of the
  state process. A key ingredient is an explicit representation of the
  first variation process obtained via integration with respect to the
  space-time local time of bounded variation processes. By combining a
  suitable approximation scheme with Ekeland's variational principle, and
  using a Garcia-Rodemich-Rumsey inequality to obtain a uniform control
  of the first variation, we derive the maximum principle. As an application, we derive an optimal corridor-type capital adjustment policy for an insurance surplus model.</description>

      <title>Nonstationary Distribution Estimation via Wasserstein Probability Flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating a sequence of evolving probability distributions from historical data, where the underlying distribution changes over time in a nonstationary and nonparametric manner. To capture gradual changes, we introduce a model that penalises large deviations between consecutive distributions using the Wasserstein distance. This leads to a method in which we estimate the underlying series of distributions by maximizing the log-likelihood of the observations with a penalty applied to the sum of the Wasserstein distances between consecutive distributions. We show how this can be reduced to a simple network-flow problem enabling efficient computation. We call this the Wasserstein Probability Flow method. We derive some properties of the optimal solutions and carry out numerical tests in different settings. Our results suggest that the Wasserstein Probability Flow method is a promising tool for applications such as nonstationary stochastic optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the degree to which an evader seeking a safe and efficient path to a target location can benefit from increasing levels of knowledge regarding one or more range-limited pursuers seeking to intercept it. Unlike previous work, this research considers the time of flight of the pursuers actively attempting interception. It is shown that additional knowledge allows the evader to safely steer closer to the threats, shortening paths without accepting additional risk of capture. A control heuristic is presented, suitable for real-time implementation, which capitalizes on all knowledge available to the evader.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of additive and parametric pinning control protocols for systems of weakly coupled oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Controlling the behavior of nonlinear systems on networks is a paramount task in control theory, in particular the control of synchronization, given its vast applicability. In this work, we focus on pinning control and we examine two different approaches: the first, more common in engineering applications, where the control is implemented through an external input (additive pinning); the other, where the parameters of the pinned nodes are varied (parametric pinning). By means of the phase reduction technique, we show that the two pinning approaches are equivalent for weakly coupled systems exhibiting periodic oscillatory behaviors. Through numerical simulations, we validate the claim for a system of coupled Stuart--Landau oscillators. Our results pave the way for further applications of pinning control in real-world systems.</description>

      <title>Fixed Horizon Linear Quadratic Covariance Steering in Continuous Time with Hilbert-Schmidt Terminal Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate and solve the fixed horizon linear quadratic covariance steering problem in continuous time with a terminal cost measured in Hilbert-Schmidt (i.e., Frobenius) norm error between the desired and the controlled terminal covariances. For this problem, the necessary conditions of optimality become a coupled matrix ODE two-point boundary value problem. To solve this system of equations, we design a matricial recursive algorithm and prove its convergence. The proposed algorithm and its analysis make use of the linear fractional transforms parameterized by the state transition matrix of the associated Hamiltonian matrix. To illustrate the results, we provide two numerical examples: one with a two dimensional and another with a six dimensional state space.</description>

      <title>Model-Free Optimization and Control of Rigid Body Dynamics: An Extremum Seeking for Vibrational Stabilization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22402v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a model-free, real-time, dynamic optimization and control method for a class of rigid body dynamics. Our method is based on a recent extremum seeking control for vibrational stabilization (ESC-VS) approach that is applicable to a class of second-order mechanical systems. The new ESC-VS method is able to stabilize a rigid body dynamic system about the optimal state of an objective function that can be unknown expression-wise, but assessable through measurements; the ESC-VS is operable by using only one perturbation/vibrational signal. We demonstrate the effectiveness and the applicability of our ESC-VS approach via three rigid-body systems: (1) satellite attitude dynamics, (2) quadcopter attitude dynamics, and (3) acceleration-controlled unicycle dynamics. The results, including simulations with and without measurement delays/noise, illustrate the ability of our ESC-VS to operate successfully as a new methodology of optimization and control for rigid body dynamics.</description>

      <title>S-D-RSM: Stochastic Distributed Regularized Splitting Method for Large-Scale Convex Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problems large-scale distributed composite convex optimization, with motivations from a broad range of applications, including multi-agent systems, federated learning, smart grids, wireless sensor networks, compressed sensing, and so on. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants are commonly employed to solve such problems. However, existing algorithms often rely on vanishing step sizes, strong convexity assumptions, or entail substantial computational overhead to ensure convergence or obtain favorable complexity. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we integrate consensus optimization and operator splitting techniques (see Problem Reformulation) to develop a novel stochastic splitting algorithm, termed the \emph{stochastic distributed regularized splitting method} (S-D-RSM). In practice, S-D-RSM performs parallel updates of proximal mappings and gradient information for only a randomly selected subset of agents at each iteration. By introducing regularization terms, it effectively mitigates consensus discrepancies among distributed nodes. In contrast to conventional stochastic methods, our theoretical analysis establishes that S-D-RSM achieves global convergence without requiring diminishing step sizes or strong convexity assumptions. Furthermore, it achieves an iteration complexity of $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$ with respect to both the objective function value and the consensus error. Numerical experiments show that S-D-RSM achieves up to 2--3$\times$ speedup compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while maintaining comparable or better accuracy. These results not only validate the algorithm's theoretical guarantees but also demonstrate its effectiveness in practical tasks such as compressed sensing and empirical risk minimization.</description>

      <title>Distributed Optimization of Bivariate Polynomial Graph Spectral Functions via Subgraph Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study distributed optimization of finite-degree polynomial Laplacian spectral objectives under fixed topology and a global weight budget, targeting the collective behavior of the entire spectrum rather than a few extremal eigenvalues. By re-formulating the global cost in a bilinear form, we derive local subgraph problems whose gradients approximately align with the global descent direction via an SVD-based test on the \(ZC\) matrix. This leads to an iterate-and-embed scheme over disjoint 1-hop neighborhoods that preserves feasibility by construction (positivity and budget) and scales to large geometric graphs. For objectives that depend on pairwise eigenvalue differences \(h(\lambda_i-\lambda_j)\), we obtain a quadratic upper bound in the degree vector, which motivates a ``warm-start'' by degree-regularization. The warm start uses randomized gossip to estimate global average degree, accelerating subsequent local descent while maintaining decentralization, and realizing $\sim95\%{}$ of the performance with respect to centralized optimization. We further introduce a learning-based proposer that predicts one-shot edge updates on maximal 1-hop embeddings, yielding immediate objective reductions. Together, these components form a practical, modular pipeline for spectrum-aware weight tuning that preserves constraints and applies across a broader class of whole-spectrum costs.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming for Optimization with Functional Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic convex optimization problems with nonlinear functional constraints are ubiquitous in signal processing applications including constrained least-squares, set-membership adaptive filtering, and trajectory optimization under uncertain fields. The presence of nonlinear functional constraints renders traditional projected stochastic gradient descent and related projection-based methods inefficient, and motivates the use of first-order methods. However, existing first-order methods, including primal and primal-dual algorithms, typically rely on a bounded (sub-)gradient assumption, which may be too restrictive in high-dimensional settings. We propose a stochastic sequential quadratic programming (SSQP) algorithm that works entirely in the primal domain, avoids projecting onto the feasible region, obviates the need for bounded gradients, and achieves state-of-the-art oracle complexity under standard smoothness and convexity assumptions. A faster version, namely SSQP-Skip, is also proposed, where the quadratic sub-problems can be skipped in most iterations. Finally, we develop an accelerated variance-reduced version of SSQP (VARAS), whose oracle complexity bounds match those for solving unconstrained finite-sum convex optimization problems. The superior performance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated via numerical experiments on real datasets.</description>

      <title>Residual subspace evolution strategies for nonlinear inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear inverse problems pervade engineering and science, yet noisy, non-differentiable, or expensive residual evaluations routinely defeat Jacobian-based solvers. Derivative-free alternatives either demand smoothness, require large populations to stabilise covariance estimates, or stall on flat regions where gradient information fades. This paper introduces residual subspace evolution strategies (RSES), a derivative-free solver that draws Gaussian probes around the current iterate, records how residuals change along those directions, and recombines the probes through a least-squares solve to produce an optimal update. The method builds a residual-only surrogate without forming Jacobians or empirical covariances, and each iteration costs just $k+1$ residual evaluations with $O(k^3)$ linear algebra overhead, where $k$ remains far smaller than the parameter dimension. Benchmarks on calibration, regression, and deconvolution tasks show that RSES reduces misfit consistently across deterministic and stochastic settings, matching or exceeding xNES, NEWUOA, Adam, and ensemble Kalman inversion under matched evaluation budgets. The gains are most pronounced when smoothness or covariance assumptions break, suggesting that lightweight residual-difference surrogates can reliably guide descent where heavier machinery struggles.</description>

      <title>Finite Convergence of the Moment-SOS Hierarchy on the Product of Spheres</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the polynomial optimization problem of minimizing a multihomogeneous polynomial over the product of spheres. This polynomial optimization problem models the tensor optimization problem of finding the best rank one approximation of an arbitrary tensor. We show that the moment-SOS hierarchy has finite convergence in this case, for a generic multihomogeneous objective function. To show finite convergence of the hierarchy, we use a result of Huang et al. [SIAM J. Optim. 34(4) (2024), pp 3399-3428], which relies on local optimality conditions. To prove that the local optimality conditions hold generically, we use techniques from differential geometry and Morse theory. This work generalizes the main result of Huang [Optim. Lett. 17(5) (2023), pp 1263-1270], which shows finite convergence for the case of a homogeneous polynomial over a single sphere.</description>

Abstract: Deep learning approaches, known for their ability to model complex relationships and fast execution, are increasingly being applied to solve large optimization problems. However, existing methods often face challenges in simultaneously ensuring feasibility and achieving an optimal objective value. To address this issue, we propose Descent-Net, a neural network designed to learn an effective descent direction from a feasible solution. By updating the solution along this learned direction, Descent-Net improves the objective value while preserving feasibility. Our method demonstrates strong performance on both synthetic optimization tasks and the real-world AC optimal power flow problem, while also exhibiting effective scalability to large problems, as shown by portfolio optimization experiments with thousands of assets.</description>

      <title>Inverse Optimal Control for Linear Quadratic Tracking with Unknown Target States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17247v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the inverse optimal control for the linear quadratic tracking problem with a fixed but unknown target state, which aims to estimate the possible triplets comprising the target state, the state weight matrix, and the input weight matrix from observed optimal control input and the corresponding state trajectories. Sufficient conditions have been provided for the unique determination of both the linear quadratic cost function as well as the target state. A computationally efficient and numerically reliable parameter identification algorithm is proposed by equating optimal control strategies with a system of linear equations, and the associated relative error upper bound is derived in terms of data volume and signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the proposed inverse optimal control algorithm is applied for the joint cluster coordination and intent identification of a multi-agent system. By incorporating the structural constraint of the Laplace matrix, the relative error upper bound can be reduced accordingly. Finally, the algorithm's efficiency and accuracy are validated by a vehicle-on-a-lever example and a multi-agent formation control example.</description>

Our analysis considers the broadest class to date of payoff mechanisms with first-order modifications, capable of modeling bounded rationality and anticipatory effects, averaging, or Pad\'{e} delay approximations. We propose a framework that, for the first time, combines two nonstandard system-theoretic passivity notions. Our results hold for discontinuous best response dynamics alongside continuous learning rules, significantly extending prior work.</description>

      <title>RGNMR: A Gauss-Newton method for robust matrix completion with theoretical guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12919v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recovering a low rank matrix from a subset of its entries, some of which may be corrupted, is known as the robust matrix completion (RMC) problem. Existing RMC methods have several limitations: they require a relatively large number of observed entries; they may fail under overparametrization, when their assumed rank is higher than the correct one; and many of them fail to recover even mildly ill-conditioned matrices. In this paper we propose a novel RMC method, denoted $\texttt{RGNMR}$, which overcomes these limitations. $\texttt{RGNMR}$ is a simple factorization-based iterative algorithm, which combines a Gauss-Newton linearization with removal of entries suspected to be outliers. On the theoretical front, we prove that under suitable assumptions, $\texttt{RGNMR}$ is guaranteed exact recovery of the underlying low rank matrix. Our theoretical results improve upon the best currently known for factorization-based methods. On the empirical front, we show via several simulations the advantages of $\texttt{RGNMR}$ over existing RMC methods, and in particular its ability to handle a small number of observed entries, overparameterization of the rank and ill-conditioned matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Minimum attention applies the least action principle in the changes of control concerning state and time, first proposed by Brockett. The involved regularization is highly relevant in emulating biological control, such as motor learning. We apply minimum attention in reinforcement learning (RL) as part of the rewards and investigate its connection to meta-learning and stabilization. Specifically, model-based meta-learning with minimum attention is explored in high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics. Ensemble-based model learning and gradient-based meta-policy learning are alternately performed. Empirically, the minimum attention does show outperforming competence in comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms of model-free and model-based RL, i.e., fast adaptation in few shots and variance reduction from the perturbations of the model and environment. Furthermore, the minimum attention demonstrates an improvement in energy efficiency.</description>

Abstract: A recent survey, nicknamed "Hitchhiker's Guide", J.J. Arias-Garc{\i}a, R. Mesiar, and B. De Baets, A hitchhiker's guide to quasi-copulas, Fuzzy Sets and Systems 393 (2020) 1-28, has raised the rating of quasi-copula problems in the dependence modeling community in spite of the lack of statistical interpretation of quasi-copulas. In our previous work (Fuzzy Sets and Systems 517 (2025) 109457), we addressed the question of extreme values of the mass distribution associated with multivariate quasi-copulas. Using a linear programming approach, we were able to solve Open Problem 5 of the "Guide" up to dimension d = 17 and disprove a recent conjecture on the solution to that problem. In this paper, we use an analytical approach to provide a complete answer to the original question.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Federated Learning to Optimize Integrated Flows in Cyber-Physical Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data centers play an increasingly critical role in societal digitalization, yet their rapidly growing energy demand poses significant challenges for sustainable operation. To enhance the energy efficiency of geographically distributed data centers, this paper formulates a multi-period optimization model that captures the interdependence of electricity, heat, and data flows. The optimization of such integrated multi-domain flows inherently involves mixed-integer formulations and the access to proprietary or sensitive datasets, which correspondingly exacerbate computational complexity and raise data-privacy concerns. To address these challenges, an adaptive federated learning-to-optimization approach is proposed, accounting for the heterogeneity of datasets across distributed data centers. To safeguard privacy, cryptography techniques are leveraged in both the learning and optimization processes. A model acceptance criterion with convergence guarantee is developed to improve learning performance and filter out potentially contaminated data, while a verifiable double aggregation mechanism is further proposed to simultaneously ensure privacy and integrity of shared data during optimization. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach preserves the privacy and integrity of shared data, achieves near-optimal performance, and exhibits high computational efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale data center optimization under privacy constraints.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Reinforcement Learning of Koopman Models for eNMPC of an Air Separation Unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With our recently proposed method based on reinforcement learning (Mayfrank et al. (2024), Comput. Chem. Eng. 190), Koopman surrogate models can be trained for optimal performance in specific (economic) nonlinear model predictive control ((e)NMPC) applications. So far, our method has exclusively been demonstrated on a small-scale case study. Herein, we show that our method scales well to a more challenging demand response case study built on a large-scale model of a single-product (nitrogen) air separation unit. Across all numerical experiments, we assume observability of only a few realistically measurable plant variables. Compared to a purely system identification-based Koopman eNMPC, which generates small economic savings but frequently violates constraints, our method delivers similar economic performance while avoiding constraint violations.</description>

      <title>Threshold Graphs Are Globally Synchronizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model describes phase oscillators on the unit circle whose interactions are encoded by a graph. Each edge acts like a spring that pulls the two adjacent oscillators toward each other whenever their phases differ. A central question is to determine which graphs are globally synchronizing, meaning that trajectories of the Kuramoto dynamics converge to the fully synchronized state from almost all initial conditions. This property is tightly linked to the benign nonconvexity of the model's energy landscape. Existing guarantees for global synchronization rely on minimum-degree thresholds, which require the graph to be highly dense. In this work, we show that connected threshold graphs, whose density may vary from $2/n$ to $1$, are globally synchronizing. Our proof relies on a phasor-geometric analysis of the stationary points of the associated energy landscape.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Game Management Decisions: A Fuzzy Logic Approach to Real-Time Soccer Substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In elite soccer, substitution decisions entail significant financial and sporting consequences yet remain heavily reliant on intuition or predictive models that merely mimic historical biases. This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the "FAGNER Paradox" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the "Lukaku Paradox", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Intelligence: Deterministic Functional Topology as a Foundation for Real-World Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world physical processes do not generate arbitrary variability: their signals concentrate on compact and low-variability subsets of functional space. This geometric structure enables rapid generalization from a few examples in both biological and artificial systems.
  This work develops a deterministic functional-topological framework in which the set of valid realizations of a physical phenomenon forms a compact perceptual manifold with stable invariants and a finite Hausdorff radius. We show that the boundaries of this manifold can be discovered in a fully self-supervised manner through Monte Carlo sampling, even when the governing equations of the system are unknown.
  We provide theoretical guarantees, practical estimators of knowledge boundaries, and empirical validations across three domains: electromechanical railway point machines, electrochemical battery discharge curves, and physiological ECG signals.
  Our results demonstrate that deterministic functional topology offers a unified mathematical foundation for perception, representation, and world-model construction, explaining why biological learners and self-supervised AI models can generalize from limited observations.</description>

      <title>Social welfare optimisation in well-mixed and structured populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Research on promoting cooperation among autonomous, self-regarding agents has often focused on the bi-objective optimisation problem: minimising the total incentive cost while maximising the frequency of cooperation. However, the optimal value of social welfare under such constraints remains largely unexplored. In this work, we hypothesise that achieving maximal social welfare is not guaranteed at the minimal incentive cost required to drive agents to a desired cooperative state. To address this gap, we adopt to a single-objective approach focused on maximising social welfare, building upon foundational evolutionary game theory models that examined cost efficiency in finite populations, in both well-mixed and structured population settings. Our analytical model and agent-based simulations show how different interference strategies, including rewarding local versus global behavioural patterns, affect social welfare and dynamics of cooperation. Our results reveal a significant gap in the per-individual incentive cost between optimising for pure cost efficiency or cooperation frequency and optimising for maximal social welfare. Overall, our findings indicate that incentive design, policy, and benchmarking in multi-agent systems and human societies should prioritise welfare-centric objectives over proxy targets of cost or cooperation frequency.</description>

      <title>Efficient Low-Tubal-Rank Tensor Estimation via Alternating Preconditioned Gradient Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of low-tubal-rank tensor estimation is a fundamental task with wide applications across high-dimensional signal processing, machine learning, and image science. Traditional approaches tackle such a problem by performing tensor singular value decomposition, which is computationally expensive and becomes infeasible for large-scale tensors. Recent approaches address this issue by factorizing the tensor into two smaller factor tensors and solving the resulting problem using gradient descent. However, this kind of approach requires an accurate estimate of the tensor rank, and when the rank is overestimated, the convergence of gradient descent and its variants slows down significantly or even diverges. To address this problem, we propose an Alternating Preconditioned Gradient Descent (APGD) algorithm, which accelerates convergence in the over-parameterized setting by adding a preconditioning term to the original gradient and updating these two factors alternately. Based on certain geometric assumptions on the objective function, we establish linear convergence guarantees for more general low-tubal-rank tensor estimation problems. Then we further analyze the specific cases of low-tubal-rank tensor factorization and low-tubal-rank tensor recovery. Our theoretical results show that APGD achieves linear convergence even under over-parameterization, and the convergence rate is independent of the tensor condition number. Extensive simulations on synthetic data are carried out to validate our theoretical assertions.</description>
