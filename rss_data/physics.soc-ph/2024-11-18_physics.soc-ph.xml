      <title>Self-Propelled Agents and Group Social Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brownian motion have long been studied on a diversity of fields, not only in physics of statistical mechanics, but also in biological models, finance and economic process, and social systems. In the past twenty years, there has been a growing interest in studying the model in self-propelled feature and interaction force such that the model also fits into study of social phenomenon of many individuals. This article will continue with this research trend and especially investigate the model in paradigms for a quantitative description of social and economic process. We mainly discuss a class of collective decision process of Brownian agent/particles, where the stochastic process does not exist in the fluctuation in the traditional Brownian motion, but in selection among several discrete choices. Their decisions interacts with each other in a given social topology. To simply our discussion the binary choice problem is particularly discussed where each agent only takes an alternative of two choices. Mathematically, we introduce a set of arrays to describe social relationship of agents in a quantitative manner, and the arrays deduce the group social force and opinion dynamics, which are useful to study complex social movement and self-organization phenomena including discrete-choice activities, social groups and de-individualization effect. Such agent-based simulation symbolizes a variety of collective activities in human society, especially in the field of economics and social science.</description>

      <title>Uncover the Dynamic Community Structure of Instant Delivery Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of instant delivery services has reshaped urban spatial structures through the interaction between suppliers and consumers. However, limited research has explored the spatiotemporal dynamics of delivery network structures. This study constructs a time-dependent, multi-layer instant delivery network in the case city of Beijing using a large-scale dataset from Eleme, organized into 500m grid units. A dynamic community detection method identifies evolving community structures over time. The results reveal 309 dynamic communities, with an average size of 13.78 square kilometers. Communities form in the morning, expand, stabilize, then contract, and disappear by night. Key factors influencing stability include building area and residential population, while online retail and service facilities contribute to instability. These findings offer insights into the spatial structure of instant delivery networks and the factors driving their dynamics, with practical implications for optimizing platform strategies, resource allocation, and urban transportation planning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose to define a notion of state of the opinion in order to link politician popularity estimations and voting intentions. We present two ways of modelling: a classical approach and quantum modelling. We test these  ideas on data obtained during the French presidential election of April 2012.</description>

      <title>The Link Between Large Scientific Collaboration and Productivity. Rethinking How to Estimate the Monetary Value of Publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses how to assign a monetary value to scientific publications, particularly in the case of multi-author papers arising from large-scale research collaborations. Contemporary science increasingly relies on extensive and varied collaborations to tackle global challenges in fields such as life sciences, climate science, energy, high-energy physics, astronomy, and many others. We argue that existing literature fails to address the collaborative nature of research by overlooking the relationship between coauthorship and scientists productivity. Using the Marginal Cost of Production (MCP) approach, we first highlight the methodological limitations of ignoring this relationship, then propose a generalised MCP model to value co-authorship. As a case study, we examine High-Energy Physics (HEP) collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, analysing approximately half a million scientific outputs by over 50,000 authors from 1990 to 2021. Our findings indicate that collaborative adjustments yield monetary valuations for subsets of highly collaborative papers up to 3 orders of magnitude higher than previous estimates, with elevated values correlating with high research quality. This study contributes to the literature on research output evaluation, addressing debates in science policy around assessing research performance and impact. Our methodology is applicable to authorship valuation both within academia and in large-scale scientific collaborations, fitting diverse research impact assessment frameworks or as self-standing procedure. Additionally, we discuss the conditions under which this method may complement survey-based approaches.</description>

      <title>Entropy and type-token ratio in gigaword corpora</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lexical diversity measures the vocabulary variation in texts. While its utility is evident for analyses in language change and applied linguistics, it is not yet clear how to operationalize this concept in a unique way. We here investigate entropy and text-token ratio, two widely employed metrics for lexical diversities, in six massive linguistic datasets in English, Spanish, and Turkish, consisting of books, news articles, and tweets. These gigaword corpora correspond to languages with distinct morphological features and differ in registers and genres, thus constituting a diverse testbed for a quantitative approach to lexical diversity. Strikingly, we find a functional relation between entropy and text-token ratio that holds across the corpora under consideration. Further, in the limit of large vocabularies we find an analytical expression that sheds light on the origin of this relation and its connection with both Zipf and Heaps laws. Our results then contribute to the theoretical understanding of text structure and offer practical implications for fields like natural language processing.</description>

      <title>How the interplay between power concentration, competition, and propagation affects the resource efficiency of distributed ledgers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forks in the Bitcoin network result from the natural competition in the blockchain's Proof-of-Work consensus protocol. Their frequency is a critical indicator for the efficiency of a distributed ledger as they can contribute to resource waste and network insecurity. We introduce a model for the estimation of natural fork rates in a network of heterogeneous miners as a function of their number, the distribution of hash rates and the block propagation time over the peer-to-peer infrastructure. Despite relatively simplistic assumptions, such as zero propagation delay within mining pools, the model predicts fork rates which are comparable with the empirical stale blocks rate. In the past decade, we observe a reduction in the number of mining pools approximately by a factor 3, and quantify its consequences for the fork rate, whilst showing the emergence of a truncated power-law distribution in hash rates, justified by a rich-get-richer effect constrained by global energy supply limits. We demonstrate, both empirically and with the aid of our quantitative model, that the ratio between the block propagation time and the mining time is a sufficiently accurate estimator of the fork rate, but also quantify its dependence on the heterogeneity of miner activities. We provide empirical and theoretical evidence that both hash rate concentration and lower block propagation time reduce fork rates in distributed ledgers. Our work introduces a robust mathematical setting for investigating power concentration and competition on a distributed network, for interpreting discrepancies in fork rates -- for example caused by selfish mining practices and asymmetric propagation times -- thus providing an effective tool for designing future and alternative scenarios for existing and new blockchain distributed mining systems.</description>

      <title>Static network structure cannot stabilize cooperation among Large Language Model agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to model human social behavior, with recent research exploring their ability to simulate social dynamics. Here, we test whether LLMs mirror human behavior in social dilemmas, where individual and collective interests conflict. Humans generally cooperate more than expected in laboratory settings, showing less cooperation in well-mixed populations but more in fixed networks. In contrast, LLMs tend to exhibit greater cooperation in well-mixed settings. This raises a key question: Are LLMs about to emulate human behavior in cooperative dilemmas on networks? In this study, we examine networked interactions where agents repeatedly engage in the Prisoner's Dilemma within both well-mixed and structured network configurations, aiming to identify parallels in cooperative behavior between LLMs and humans. Our findings indicate critical distinctions: while humans tend to cooperate more within structured networks, LLMs display increased cooperation mainly in well-mixed environments, with limited adjustment to networked contexts. Notably, LLM cooperation also varies across model types, illustrating the complexities of replicating human-like social adaptability in artificial agents. These results highlight a crucial gap: LLMs struggle to emulate the nuanced, adaptive social strategies humans deploy in fixed networks. Unlike human participants, LLMs do not alter their cooperative behavior in response to network structures or evolving social contexts, missing the reciprocity norms that humans adaptively employ. This limitation points to a fundamental need in future LLM design -- to integrate a deeper comprehension of social norms, enabling more authentic modeling of human-like cooperation and adaptability in networked environments.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Laplacian community detection in heterogeneous networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04514v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heterogeneous and complex networks represent intertwined interactions between real-world elements or agents. Determining the multi-scale mesoscopic organization of clusters and intertwined structures is still a fundamental and open problem of complex network theory. By taking advantage of the recent Laplacian Renormalization Group, we scrutinize information diffusion pathways throughout networks to shed further light on this issue. Based on inter-node communicability, our definition provides a clear-cut framework for resolving the multi-scale mesh of structures in complex networks, disentangling their intrinsic arboreal architecture. As it does not consider any topological null-model assumption, the LRG naturally permits the introduction of scale-dependent optimal partitions. Moreover, we demonstrate the existence of a particular class of nodes, called 'metastable' nodes, that switching regions to which they belong at different scales, likely playing a pivotal role in cross-regional communication and, therefore, in managing macroscopic effects of the whole network.</description>

      <title>An "Opinion Reproduction Number" for Infodemics in a Bounded-Confidence Content-Spreading Process on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spreading dynamics of content on networks. To do this, we use a model in which content spreads through a bounded-confidence mechanism. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, the agents of a network have continuous-valued opinions, which they adjust when they interact with agents whose opinions are sufficiently close to theirs. The employed content-spreading model introduces a twist into BCMs by using bounded confidence for the content spread itself. We define an analogue of the basic reproduction number from disease dynamics that we call an \emph{opinion reproduction number}. A critical value of the opinion reproduction number indicates whether or not there is an ``infodemic'' (i.e., a large content-spreading cascade) of content that reflects a particular opinion. By determining this critical value, one can determine whether or not an opinion dies off or propagates widely as a cascade in a population of agents. Using configuration-model networks, we quantify the size and shape of content dissemination by calculating a variety of summary statistics, and we illustrate how network structure and spreading-model parameters affect these statistics. We find that content spreads most widely when the agents have a large expected mean degree or a large receptiveness to content. When the spreading process slightly exceeds the infodemic threshold, there can be longer dissemination trees than when the expected mean degree or receptiveness are larger, even though the total number of content shares is smaller.</description>

      <title>The SIS process on Erd\"os-R\'enyi graphs: determining the infected fraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are many methods to estimate the quasi-stationary infected fraction of the SIS process on (random) graphs. A challenge is to adequately incorporate correlations, which is especially important in sparse graphs. Methods typically are either significantly biased in sparse graphs, or computationally very demanding already for small network sizes. The former applies to Heterogeneous Mean Field and to the N-intertwined Mean Field Approximation, the latter to most higher order approximations. In this paper we present a new method to determine the infected fraction in sparse graphs, which we test on Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs. Our method is based on degree-pairs, does take into account correlations and gives accurate estimates. At the same time, computations are very feasible and can easily be done even for large networks.</description>

      <title>The Structure of Occupational Mobility in France</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In an era of rapid technological advancements and macroeconomic shifts, worker reallocation is necessary, yet responses to labor market shocks remain sluggish, making it crucial to identify bottlenecks in occupational transitions to understand labor market dynamics and improve mobility. In this study, we analyze French occupational data to uncover patterns of worker mobility and pinpoint specific occupations that act as bottlenecks which impede rapid reallocation. We introduce two metrics, transferability and accessibility, to quantify the diversity of occupational transitions and find that bottlenecks can be explained by a condensation effect of occupations with high accessibility but low transferability. Transferability measures the variety of transitions from an occupation to others, while accessibility assesses the variety of transitions into an occupation. We provide a comprehensive framework for analyzing occupational complexity and mobility patterns, offering insights into potential barriers and pathways for efficient retraining programs. We argue that our approach can inform policymakers and stakeholders aiming to enhance labor market efficiency and support workforce adaptability.</description>

      <title>The replacement number dynamics in SIR-type epidemic models I: From SSISS to RND picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19532v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In SIR-type epidemic models time derivative of prevalence $I$ can always be cast into the form $\dot{I}=(X-1)I$, where $X$ is the replacement number and recovery rate is normalized to one. Assuming $\dot{X}=f(X,I)$ for some smooth function $f$ defines a "replacement number dynamics" (RND). Choosing transmission coefficients $\beta_1&gt;\beta_2$, any such system uniquely maps to an isomorphic "SSISS model", i.e. an abstract SIR-type 3-compartment model. Extending to negative values $\beta_i&lt;0$ takes care of demographic dynamics with compartment dependent birth and death rates. Fixing $f$ and varying $\beta_i$ generates a family of isomorphic SSISS systems, the "SSISS fiber" $\cal{F}(f)$}. A symmetry group $G_\sigma$ acts freely and transitively on fibers $\cal{F}(f)$, so SSISS systems become a principal $G_\sigma$-fiber bundle over the space of RND systems. Choosing two specific 6-parameter polynomials $f$ at most quadratic in $(X,I)$ covers a large class of models in the literature, with in total up to 17 (largely redundant!) parameters, including also reactive social behavior models. Epidemiological admissibility conditions guarantee forward boundedness and absence of periodic solutions in all these models. Part II of this work will prove existence and stability properties of endemic equilibria, which in RND picture simply boils down to analyzing zeros of the parabolas $f|_{I=0}$ and $f|_{X=1}$. This will cover and extend well known results for a wide range of models by a unifying approach while also closing some open issues in the literature.</description>
