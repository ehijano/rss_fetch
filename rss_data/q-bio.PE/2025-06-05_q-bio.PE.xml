      <title>Genotype networks drive oscillating endemicity and epidemic trajectories in viral evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidly evolving viruses use antigenic drift as a key mechanism to evade host immunity and persist in real populations. While traditional models of antigenic drift and epidemic spread rely on low-dimensional antigenic spaces, genomic surveillance data reveal that viral evolution produces complex antigenic genotype networks with hierarchical modular structures. In this study, we present an eco-evolutionary framework in which viral evolution and population immunity dynamics are shaped by the structure of antigenic genotype networks. Using synthetic networks, we demonstrate that network topology alone can drive transitions between stable endemic states and recurrent seasonal epidemics. Furthermore, our results show how the integration of the genotype network of the H3N2 influenza in our model allows for estimating the emergence times of various haplotypes resulting from its evolution. Our findings underscore the critical role of the topology of genotype networks in shaping epidemic behavior and, besides, provide a robust framework for integrating real-world genomic data into predictive epidemic models.</description>

      <title>Climate benefits of afforestation and reforestation with varying species mixtures and densities in the north-western boreal lands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The boreal forest plays a crucial role as a global carbon sink. This study uses two 250-year simulations of Canada's Taiga Plains, an area targeted by the 2 Billion Trees Program to evaluate afforestation and reforestation strategies that vary by species mix, planting density, and surface albedo. Medium density stands, 600 to 1400 trees per hectare, composed of mixed species with approximately 25 to 40 percent deciduous trees sequestered 15 to 30 percent more net ecosystem carbon than conifer monocultures. These benefits stem from a combination of rapid early growth, long-term carbon retention, and enhanced resilience to disturbance. Replanting understocked stands with such mixtures increased long-term carbon storage by 18 to 30 percent relative to prevailing scenarios. When surface albedo was considered, pure evergreen or deciduous stands showed a reduction in climate benefit by 6 to 20 percent, while mixed stands maintained net cooling and achieved the highest sequestration rates, approximately 4.6 to 4.7 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per hectare per year. Scenarios involving partial harvesting followed by replanting sustained or improved ecosystem carbon stocks, about 300 to 340 tons of carbon per hectare, and productivity, roughly 1.6 to 2.0 tons of carbon per hectare per year, without increasing ecological risk. Overall, integrating fast-growing deciduous species with long-lived conifers at moderate planting densities enhances the climate mitigation potential of boreal afforestation and reforestation efforts and offers guidance for reforestation policy in similar high latitude ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Negligible effects of environmental fluctuations on the maintenance of coral biodiversity: A test of five storage effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The storage effect is a general explanation for ecological coexistence, wherein different species specialize on different states of a fluctuating environment, e.g., hot vs. cold years. Despite the storage effect's prominence in theoretical ecology, we lack evidence on whether it maintains biodiversity in nature. Here, we examine five storage effects in a community of 11 coral species from the Great Barrier Reef, using detailed size-structured demographic data collected over five years. We parameterize integral projection models, simulate coral communities, and quantify coexistence mechanisms through Modern Coexistence Theory. Results show that storage effects promote coexistence but are weak compared to fitness differences. Despite coral communities exhibiting theoretical prerequisites for strong temporal niche partitioning, the storage effect plays only a minor role in maintaining coral biodiversity. This aligns with growing evidence that storage effects are weak across ecosystems. Coral coexistence likely depends more on spatial processes, including microhabitat partitioning and asymmetric dispersal.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation within phenotype-structured chemotactic populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Populations can become spatially organised through chemotaxis autoattraction, wherein population members release their own chemoattractant. Standard models of this process usually assume phenotypic homogeneity, but recent studies have shed illumination on the inherent heterogeneity within populations: in terms of chemotactic behaviour, trait heterogeneity can range from the sensitivity to attractant gradients to the rate at which attractants are produced. We propose a framework that accounts for this heterogeneity, extending the standard Keller-Segel model to a non-local formulation in which the population is continuously structured across some phenotype state space. Focussing on autoattraction, we allow both the chemotactic sensitivity and the rate of attractant secretion to vary across the population and suppose members can switch between different phenotype states. We extend classical Turing-type linear stability analyses to determine the impact of phenotypic structuring on pattern formation, showing that the rate of switching influences both the critical condition for self-organisation and subsequent pattern dynamics. Scenarios in which the chemotactic sensitivity and attractant secretion are positively or negatively correlated are used to highlight the significance of these results.</description>

      <title>Age-Structured Population Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter reviews some aspects of the theory of age-structured models of populations with finite maximum age. We formulate both the renewal equation for the birth rate and the partial differential equation for the age density, and show their equivalence. Next, we define and discuss central concepts in population dynamics, like the basic reproduction number $R_0$, the Malthusian parameter $r$, and the stable age distribution. We briefly review the sun-star theory that turns the birth term into a bounded additive perturbation, thus allowing to develop stability and bifurcation theory along standard lines. Finally, we review the pseudospectral approximation of the infinite-dimensional age-structured models by means of a finite system of ordinary differential equations, which allows to perform numerical bifurcation analysis with existing software tools. Here, Nicholson's blowfly equation serves as a worked example.</description>

      <title>Size-Structured Population Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter focuses on variable maturation delay or, more precisely, on the mathematical description of a size-structured population consuming an unstructured resource. When the resource concentration is a known function of time, we can describe the growth and survival of individuals quasi-explicitly, i.e., in terms of solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODE). Reproduction is captured by a (non-autonomous) renewal equation, which can be solved by generation expansion. After these preparatory steps, a contraction mapping argument is needed to construct the solution of the coupled consumer-resource system with prescribed initial conditions. As we shall show, this interpretation-guided constructive approach does in fact yield weak solutions of a familiar partial differential equation (PDE). A striking difficulty with the PDE approach is that the solution operators are, in general, not differentiable, precluding a linearized stability analysis of steady states. This is a manifestation of the state-dependent delay difficulty. As a (not entirely satisfactory and rather technical) way out, we present a delay equation description in terms of the history of both the $p$-level birth rate of the consumer population and the resource concentration. We end by using pseudospectral approximation to derive a system of ODE and demonstrating its use in a numerical bifurcation analysis. Importantly, the state-dependent delay difficulty dissolves in this approximation.</description>

      <title>ARB inactivation, ARGs and antibiotics degradation in hospital wastewater</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antibiotic resistance (AR) is one of the greatest public health challenges worldwide. Processes that allow the reduction of AR predictor of hospital wastewater has become crucial process that contributes to the protection of public health and the environment. The aim of this review article was to compare the effectiveness of various methods for treatment hospital wastewater in eliminating antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and degrading antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotics. A large number of studies dealing with wastewater treatment suggest that this topic is highly relevant and that new solutions are being developed to limit the spread of AR. Some wastewater treatment techniques have been in use for decades. Despite the negative effects of chlorine compounds, chlorination is still applied to eliminate ARB, ARGs, and drug metabolites. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation and ozonation have long been recognized for their treating properties. In the literature, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are increasingly often indicated as the most effective alternative to conventional treatment methods. Various methods for disinfecting hospital wastewater were reviewed and their environmental impact was analyzed in this article, and the results provide valuable insights for the further development of effective wastewater management strategies.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lotka-Volterra systems with quenched random interactions and saturating functional response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Lotka-Volterra (GLV) equations with quenched random interactions have been extensively used to investigate the stability and dynamics of complex ecosystems. However, the standard linear interaction model suffers from pathological unbounded growth, especially under strong cooperation or heterogeneity. This work addresses that limitation by introducing a Monod-type saturating functional response into the GLV framework. Using Dynamical Mean Field Theory, we derive analytical expressions for the species abundance distribution in the Unique Fixed Point phase and show the suppression of unbounded dynamics. Numerical simulations reveal a rich dynamical structure in the Multiple Attractor phase, including a transition between high-dimensional chaotic and low-volatility regimes, governed by interaction symmetry. These findings offer a more ecologically realistic foundation for disordered ecosystem models and highlight the role of nonlinearity and symmetry in shaping the diversity and resilience of large ecological communities.</description>

      <title>A minimal model of pan-immunity maintenance by horizontal gene transfer in the ecological dynamics of bacteria and phages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bacteria and phages have been in an ongoing arms race for billions of years. To resist phages bacteria have evolved numerous defense systems, which nevertheless are still overcome by counter-defense mechanisms of specific phages. These defense/counter-defense systems are a major element of microbial genetic diversity and have been demonstrated to propagate between strains by Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT). It has been proposed that the totality of defense systems found in microbial communities collectively form a distributed "pan-immune" system with individual elements moving between strains via ubiquitous HGT. Here, we formulate a Lotka-Volterra type model of a bacteria/phage community interacting via a combinatorial variety of defense/counter-defense systems and show that HGT enables stable maintenance of diverse defense/counter-defense genes in the microbial pan-genome even when individual microbial strains inevitably undergo extinction. This stability requires the HGT rate to be sufficiently high to ensure that some descendant of a "dying" strain survives, thanks to the immunity acquired through HGT from the community at large, thus establishing a new strain.This mechanism of persistence for the pan-immune gene pool is fundamentally similar to the "island migration" model of ecological diversity, with genes moving between genomes instead of species migrating between islands.</description>

      <title>When is local search both effective and efficient?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02634v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many combinatorial optimization problems can be represented by valued constraint satisfaction problems (VCSPs) and the fitness landscapes that they generate. Local search starts at an assignment in this landscape and successively moves assignments until no further improvement is possible among the adjacent assignments. Classic analyses of local search algorithms have focused mostly on the question of effectiveness ("did we find a good solution?") and often implicitly assumed that there are no doubts about their efficiency ("did we find it quickly?"). But there are many reasons to doubt the efficiency of local search. Even if we focus on fitness landscapes on the hypercube that are single peaked on every subcube (known as semismooth fitness landscapes, completely unimodal pseudo-Boolean functions, or acyclic unique sink orientations) where effectiveness is obvious, many local search algorithms are known to be inefficient. We define a "direction" for valued constraints such that directed VCSPs generate semismooth fitness landscapes. We call directed VCSPs oriented if they do not have any pair of variables with arcs in both directions. Since recognizing if a VCSP-instance is directed or oriented is coNP-complete, we generalized oriented VCSPs as conditionally-smooth fitness landscapes where the structural property of 'conditionally-smooth' is recognizable in polynomial time. We prove that many popular local search algorithms like random ascent, simulated annealing, history-based rules, jumping rules, and the Kernighan-Lin heuristic are very efficient on conditionally-smooth landscapes. But conditionally-smooth landscapes are still expressive enough so that other well-regarded local search algorithms like steepest ascent and random facet require a super-polynomial number of steps to find the fitness peak.</description>
