      <title>Choice Paralysis in Evolutionary Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider finite-strategy approximations of infinite-strategy evolutionary games. We prove that such approximations converge to the true dynamics over finite-time intervals, under mild regularity conditions which are satisfied by classical examples, e.g., the replicator dynamics. We identify and formalize novel characteristics in evolutionary games: choice mobility, and its complement choice paralysis. Choice mobility is shown to be a key sufficient condition for the long-time limiting behavior of finite-strategy approximations to coincide with that of the true infinite-strategy game. An illustrative example is constructed to showcase how choice paralysis may lead to the infinite-strategy game getting "stuck," even though every finite approximation converges to equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Choquet rank-dependent utility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new decision model under ambiguity, called the Choquet rank-dependent utility model. The model extends the Choquet expected utility model by allowing for the reduction to the rank-dependent utility model in the absence of ambiguity, rather than to the expected utility model. The model has three major components: a utility function $u$ and a probability distortion $g$, which together capture the risk component of the preferences, and generalized probabilistic beliefs $\nu$, which captures the ambiguity component of the preferences. The representation takes the form $X\succsim Y\iff \int_{\Omega} u(X)d(g\circ\nu)\iff \int_{\Omega} u(Y)d(g\circ\nu).$ To obtain the axiomatization, we work in the uncertainty setting of Savage with a non-ambiguous source. Afterwards, we discuss ambiguity attitudes and their representation with respect to the generalized probabilistic beliefs, along with conditions for a robust representation.</description>

      <title>Matching to two sides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a matching problem in which a group of agents cooperate with agents on two sides. In environments with either nontransferable or transferable utilities, we demonstrate that a stable outcome exists when cooperations exhibit same-side complementarity and cross-side substitutability. Our results apply to pick-side matching problems and membership competition in online duopoly markets.</description>

      <title>The Dynamics of the Profit Rate in an Extended Okishio Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the classical Okishio theorem, we construct a two-sector, multi-period dynamic model that relaxes the rigid assumption of a fixed real wage and introduces an endogenous wage-growth mechanism together with a process of technology diffusion. Through analytical derivations and numerical simulations we find that the long-run trajectory of the profit rate is not unique: it hinges on the relative strength of the speed of wage adjustment and the potency of technical progress. (1) When wage adjustment is relatively sluggish, the technical effect dominates and the profit rate trends upward. (2) When wage adjustment proceeds at a moderate pace, the profit rate first rises and then falls. (3) When wage adjustment is extremely rapid, the wage effect dominates and the profit rate declines continuously. The results offer a new theoretical lens on the intricate interplay among technical change, wage dynamics and profitability.</description>

      <title>Partially rational preferences under ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Completeness and transitivity are standard rationality conditions in economics. However, under ambiguity, decision makers sometimes violate these requirements because of the difficulty of forming accurate predictions about ambiguous events. Motivated by this, we study various ambiguity preferences that partially satisfy completeness and transitivity. Our characterization results show that completeness and a novel yet natural weakening of transitivity correspond to two opposite ways of using multiple probability distributions in mind; that is, these two axioms have dual implications at the level of cognitive processes for ambiguity.</description>

      <title>Grabbing the Forbidden Fruit: Restriction-Sensitive Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Restricting individuals' access to some opportunities may steer their desire toward their substitutes, a phenomenon known as the forbidden fruit effect. We axiomatize a choice model named restriction-sensitive choice (RSC), which rationalizes the forbidden fruit effect and is compatible with the prominent psychological explanations: reactance theory and commodity theory. The model is identifiable from choice data, specifically from the observation of choice reversals caused by the removal of options. We conduct a normative analysis both in terms of the agent's freedom and welfare. We apply our model to shed light on two phenomena: the backfire effect of beliefs and the backlash of integration policies targeted towards minorities.</description>

      <title>Optimal Savings with Preference for Wealth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The consumption function maps current wealth and the exogenous state to current consumption. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a consumption function when the agent has a preference for wealth. When the period utility functions are restricted to power functions, we prove that the consumption function is asymptotically linear as wealth tends to infinity and provide a complete characterization of the asymptotic slopes. When the risk aversion with respect to wealth is less than that for consumption, the asymptotic slope is zero regardless of other model parameters, implying wealthy households save a large fraction of their income, consistent with empirical evidence.</description>

      <title>Independence and indifferent points imply continuity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I propose the new axiom of Indifferent Points (IP) that can replace continuity axioms in classical expected utility representations under the Independence Axiom over a finite set of prices. IP asserts the existence of a set of indifferent points that span a hyperplane. In the case of three prices, often used for illustrations, the decision maker only needs to show indifference between two distinct lotteries. IP does not imply any of the established continuity axioms and is even strictly weaker than mixture continuity and solvability.</description>

      <title>Who and How? Adverse Selection and flexible Moral Hazard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12979v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize incentive compatible mechanisms in environments with hidden types and flexible hidden actions. Our approach introduces extended recommendation schedules that specify prescribed actions also off-path, after misreports. This approach yields a tractable and complete characterization of incentive compatibility, which includes a generalized integral monotonicity condition capturing the interaction between adverse selection and moral hazard. We demonstrate the usefulness of the characterization across a range of contracting problems.</description>

      <title>Axiomatizations of a simple Condorcet voting method for Final Four and Final Five elections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proponents of Condorcet voting face the question of what to do in the rare case when no Condorcet winner exists. Recent work provides compelling arguments for the rule that should be applied in three-candidate elections, but already with four candidates, many rules appear reasonable. In this paper, we consider a recent proposal of a simple Condorcet voting method for Final Four political elections. Our question is what normative principles could support this simple form of Condorcet voting. When there is no Condorcet winner, one natural principle is to pick the candidate who is closest to being a Condorcet winner. Yet there are multiple plausible ways to define closeness, leading to different results. Here we take the following approach: identify a relatively uncontroversial sufficient condition for one candidate to be closer than another to being a Condorcet winner; then use other principles to help settle who wins in cases when that condition alone does not. We prove that our principles uniquely characterize the simple Condorcet voting method for Final Four elections. This analysis also points to a new way of extending the method to elections with five or more candidates that is simpler than an extension previously considered. The new proposal is to elect the candidate with the most head-to-head wins, and if multiple candidates tie for the most wins, then elect the one who has the smallest head-to-head loss. We provide additional principles sufficient to characterize this simple method for Final Five elections.</description>

      <title>Efficient Defection: Overage-Proportional Rationing Attains the Cooperative Frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07145v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a noncooperative $n$-player game of slack allocation in which each player $j$ has entitlement $L_j&gt;0$ and chooses a claim $C_j\ge0$. Let $v_j=(C_j-L_j)_+$ (overage) and $s_j=(L_j-C_j)_+$ (slack); set $X=\sum_j v_j$ and $I=\sum_j s_j$. At the end of the period an overage-proportional clearing rule allocates cooperative surplus $I$ to defectors in proportion to $v_j$; cooperators receive $C_j$. We show: (i) the selfish outcome reproduces the cooperative payoff vector $(L_1,\dots,L_n)$; (ii) with bounded actions, defection is a weakly dominant strategy; (iii) within the $\alpha$-power family, the linear rule ($\alpha=1$) is the unique boundary-continuous member; and (iv) the dominant-strategy outcome is Strong Nash under transferable utility and hence coalition-proof (Bernheim et al., 1987). We give a policy interpretation for carbon rationing with a penalty collar.</description>

      <title>Collusion-Resilience in Transaction Fee Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Users bid in a transaction fee mechanism (TFM) to get their transactions included and confirmed by a blockchain protocol. Roughgarden (EC'21) initiated the formal treatment of TFMs and proposed three requirements: user incentive compatibility (UIC), miner incentive compatibility (MIC), and a form of collusion-resilience called OCA-proofness. Ethereum's EIP-1559 mechanism satisfies all three properties simultaneously when there is no contention between transactions, but loses the UIC property when there are too many eligible transactions to fit in a single block. Chung and Shi (SODA'23) considered an alternative notion of collusion-resilience, called $c$-side-contract-proofness ($c$-SCP), and showed that, when there is contention between transactions, no TFM can satisfy UIC, MIC, and $c$-SCP for any $c\geq 1$. OCA-proofness asserts that the users and a miner should not be able to "steal from the protocol." On the other hand, the $c$-SCP condition requires that a coalition of a miner and a subset of users should not be able to profit through strategic deviations (whether at the expense of the protocol or of the users outside the coalition).
  Our main result is the first proof that, when there is contention between transactions, no (possibly randomized) TFM in which users are expected to bid truthfully satisfies UIC, MIC, and OCA-proofness.This result resolves the main open question in Roughgarden (EC'21). We also suggest several relaxations of the basic model that allow our impossibility result to be circumvented.</description>
