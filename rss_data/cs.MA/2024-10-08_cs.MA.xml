      <title>YOLO-MARL: You Only LLM Once for Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have positioned it as a promising approach for decision-making in cooperative games. However, it still remains challenging for MARL agents to learn cooperative strategies for some game environments. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent reasoning capabilities, making them promising candidates for enhancing coordination among the agents. However, due to the model size of LLMs, it can be expensive to frequently infer LLMs for actions that agents can take. In this work, we propose You Only LLM Once for MARL (YOLO-MARL), a novel framework that leverages the high-level task planning capabilities of LLMs to improve the policy learning process of multi-agents in cooperative games. Notably, for each game environment, YOLO-MARL only requires one time interaction with LLMs in the proposed strategy generation, state interpretation and planning function generation modules, before the MARL policy training process. This avoids the ongoing costs and computational time associated with frequent LLMs API calls during training. Moreover, the trained decentralized normal-sized neural network-based policies operate independently of the LLM. We evaluate our method across three different environments and demonstrate that YOLO-MARL outperforms traditional MARL algorithms.</description>

      <title>GenSim: A General Social Simulation Platform with Large Language Model based Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), recent years have witnessed many promising studies on leveraging LLM-based agents to simulate human social behavior. While prior work has demonstrated significant potential across various domains, much of it has focused on specific scenarios involving a limited number of agents and has lacked the ability to adapt when errors occur during simulation. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel LLM-agent-based simulation platform called \textit{GenSim}, which: (1) \textbf{Abstracts a set of general functions} to simplify the simulation of customized social scenarios; (2) \textbf{Supports one hundred thousand agents} to better simulate large-scale populations in real-world contexts; (3) \textbf{Incorporates error-correction mechanisms} to ensure more reliable and long-term simulations. To evaluate our platform, we assess both the efficiency of large-scale agent simulations and the effectiveness of the error-correction mechanisms. To our knowledge, GenSim represents an initial step toward a general, large-scale, and correctable social simulation platform based on LLM agents, promising to further advance the field of social science.</description>

      <title>Distributed Detection of Adversarial Attacks for Resilient Cooperation of Multi-Robot Systems with Intermittent Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper concerns the consensus and formation of a network of mobile autonomous agents in adversarial settings where a group of malicious (compromised) agents are subject to deception attacks. In addition, the communication network is arbitrarily time-varying and subject to intermittent connections, possibly imposed by denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. We provide explicit bounds for network connectivity in an integral sense, enabling the characterization of the system's resilience to specific classes of adversarial attacks. We also show that under the condition of connectivity in an integral sense uniformly in time, the system is finite-gain $\mathcal{L}_{p}$ stable and uniformly exponentially fast consensus and formation are achievable, provided malicious agents are detected and isolated from the network. We present a distributed and reconfigurable framework with theoretical guarantees for detecting malicious agents, allowing for the resilient cooperation of the remaining cooperative agents. Simulation studies are provided to illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Towards the Pedagogical Steering of Large Language Models for Tutoring: A Case Study with Modeling Productive Failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-to-one tutoring is one of the most efficient methods of teaching. Following the rise in popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs), there have been efforts to use them to create conversational tutoring systems, which can make the benefits of one-to-one tutoring accessible to everyone. However, current LLMs are primarily trained to be helpful assistants and thus lack crucial pedagogical skills. For example, they often quickly reveal the solution to the student and fail to plan for a richer multi-turn pedagogical interaction. To use LLMs in pedagogical scenarios, they need to be steered towards using effective teaching strategies: a problem we introduce as Pedagogical Steering and believe to be crucial for the efficient use of LLMs as tutors. We address this problem by formalizing a concept of tutoring strategy, and introducing StratL, an algorithm to model a strategy and use prompting to steer the LLM to follow this strategy. As a case study, we create a prototype tutor for high school math following Productive Failure (PF), an advanced and effective learning design. To validate our approach in a real-world setting, we run a field study with 17 high school students in Singapore. We quantitatively show that StratL succeeds in steering the LLM to follow a Productive Failure tutoring strategy. We also thoroughly investigate the existence of spillover effects on desirable properties of the LLM, like its ability to generate human-like answers. Based on these results, we highlight the challenges in Pedagogical Steering and suggest opportunities for further improvements. We further encourage follow-up research by releasing a dataset of Productive Failure problems and the code of our prototype and algorithm.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models can Achieve Social Balance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social balance is a concept in sociology which states that if every three individuals in a population achieve certain structures of positive or negative interactions, then the whole population ends up in one faction of positive interactions or divided between two or more antagonistic factions. In this paper, we consider a group of interacting large language models (LLMs) and study how, after continuous interactions, they can achieve social balance. Across three different LLM models, we found that social balance depends on (i) whether interactions are updated based on "relationships", "appraisals", or "opinions"; (ii) whether agents update their interactions based on homophily or influence from their peers; and (iii) the number of simultaneous interactions the LLMs consider. When social balance is achieved, its particular structure of positive or negative interactions depends on these three conditions and are different across LLM models and sizes. The stability of interactions and the justification for their update also vary across models. Thus, social balance is driven by the pre-training and alignment particular to each LLM model.</description>

      <title>Coalescing Force of Group Pressure: Consensus in Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work extends the recent opinion dynamics model from Cheng et al., emphasizing the role of group pressure in consensus formation. We generalize the findings to incorporate social influence algorithms with general time-varying, opinion-dependent weights and multidimensional opinions, beyond bounded confidence dynamics. We demonstrate that, with uniformly positive conformity levels, group pressure consistently drives consensus and provide a tighter estimate for the convergence rate. Unlike previous models, the common public opinion in our framework can assume arbitrary forms within the convex hull of current opinions, offering flexibility applicable to real-world scenarios such as opinion polls with random participant selection. This analysis provides deeper insights into how group pressure mechanisms foster consensus under diverse conditions.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Potential of Conversational Test Suite Based Program Repair on SWE-bench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic program repair at project level may open yet to be seen opportunities in various fields of human activity. Since the SWE-Bench challenge was presented, we have seen numerous of solutions. Patch generation is a part of program repair, and test suite-based conversational patch generation has proven its effectiveness. However, the potential of conversational patch generation has not yet specifically estimated on SWE-Bench. This study reports experimental results aimed at evaluating the individual effectiveness of conversational patch generation on problems from SWE-Bench. The experiments show that a simple conversational pipeline based on LLaMA 3.1 70B can generate valid patches in 47\% of cases, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art in program repair on SWE-Bench.</description>

      <title>The Role of Social Support and Influencers in Social Media Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can individual agents coordinate their actions to achieve a shared objective in distributed systems? This challenge spans economic, technical, and sociological domains, each confronting scalability, heterogeneity, and conflicts between individual and collective goals. In economic markets, a common currency facilitates coordination, raising the question of whether such mechanisms can be applied in other contexts. This paper explores this idea within social media platforms, where social support (likes, shares, comments) acts as a currency that shapes content production and sharing. We investigate two key questions: (1) Can social support serve as an effective coordination tool, and (2) What role do influencers play in content creation and dissemination? Our formal analysis shows that social support can coordinate user actions similarly to money in economic markets. Influencers serve dual roles, aggregating content and acting as information proxies, guiding content producers in large markets. While imperfections in information lead to a "price of influence" and suboptimal outcomes, this price diminishes as markets grow, improving social welfare. These insights provide a framework for understanding coordination in distributed environments, with applications in both sociological systems and multi-agent AI systems.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Multi-Agent Evaluation of Large Language Models through Iterative Debates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores optimal architectures for evaluating the outputs of large language models (LLMs) using LLMs themselves. We propose a novel framework that interprets LLMs as advocates within an ensemble of interacting agents, allowing them to defend their answers and reach conclusions through a judge and jury system. This approach offers a more dynamic and comprehensive evaluation process compared to traditional human-based assessments or automated metrics. We discuss the motivation behind this framework, its key components, and comparative advantages. We also present a probabilistic model to evaluate the error reduction achieved by iterative advocate systems. Finally, we outline experiments to validate the effectiveness of multi-advocate architectures and discuss future research directions.</description>

      <title>Cloud-Based Scheduling Mechanism for Scalable and Resource-Efficient Centralized Controllers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to address the challenges of deploying complex robotic software in large-scale systems, i.e., Centralized Nonlinear Model Predictive Controllers (CNMPCs) for multi-agent systems. The proposed approach is based on a Kubernetes-based scheduling mechanism designed to monitor and optimize the operation of CNMPCs, while addressing the scalability limitation of centralized control schemes. By leveraging a cluster in a real-time cloud environment, the proposed mechanism effectively offloads the computational burden of CNMPCs. Through experiments, we have demonstrated the effectiveness and performance of our system, especially in scenarios where the number of robots is subject to change. Our work contributes to the advancement of cloud-based control strategies and lays the foundation for enhanced performance in cloud-controlled robotic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11834v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, simulations of pedestrians using the multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have been studied. This study considered the roads on a grid-world environment, and implemented pedestrians as MARL agents using an echo-state network and the least squares policy iteration method. Under this environment, the ability of these agents to learn to move forward by avoiding other agents was investigated. Specifically, we considered two types of tasks: the choice between a narrow direct route and a broad detour, and the bidirectional pedestrian flow in a corridor. The simulations results indicated that the learning was successful when the density of the agents was not that high.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12561v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To identify a stationary action profile for a population of competitive agents, each executing private strategies, we introduce a novel active-learning scheme where a centralized external observer (or entity) can probe the agents' reactions and recursively update simple local parametric estimates of the action-reaction mappings. Under very general working assumptions (not even assuming that a stationary profile exists), sufficient conditions are established to assess the asymptotic properties of the proposed active learning methodology so that, if the parameters characterizing the action-reaction mappings converge, a stationary action profile is achieved. Such conditions hence act also as certificates for the existence of such a profile. Extensive numerical simulations involving typical competitive multi-agent control and decision-making problems illustrate the practical effectiveness of the proposed learning-based approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.10695v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a nonparametric statistical test for determining whether an agent is following a given mixed strategy in a repeated strategic-form game given samples of the agent's play. This involves two components: determining whether the agent's frequencies of pure strategies are sufficiently close to the target frequencies, and determining whether the pure strategies selected are independent between different game iterations. Our integrated test involves applying a chi-squared goodness of fit test for the first component and a generalized Wald-Wolfowitz runs test for the second component. The results from both tests are combined using Bonferroni correction to produce a complete test for a given significance level $\alpha.$ We applied the test to publicly available data of human rock-paper-scissors play. The data consists of 50 iterations of play for 500 human players. We test with a null hypothesis that the players are following a uniform random strategy independently at each game iteration. Using a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$, we conclude that 305 (61%) of the subjects are following the target strategy.</description>

      <title>BioDiscoveryAgent: An AI Agent for Designing Genetic Perturbation Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Agents based on large language models have shown great potential in accelerating scientific discovery by leveraging their rich background knowledge and reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce BioDiscoveryAgent, an agent that designs new experiments, reasons about their outcomes, and efficiently navigates the hypothesis space to reach desired solutions. We demonstrate our agent on the problem of designing genetic perturbation experiments, where the aim is to find a small subset out of many possible genes that, when perturbed, result in a specific phenotype (e.g., cell growth). Utilizing its biological knowledge, BioDiscoveryAgent can uniquely design new experiments without the need to train a machine learning model or explicitly design an acquisition function as in Bayesian optimization. Moreover, BioDiscoveryAgent, using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, achieves an average of 21% improvement in predicting relevant genetic perturbations across six datasets, and a 46% improvement in the harder task of non-essential gene perturbation, compared to existing Bayesian optimization baselines specifically trained for this task. Our evaluation includes one dataset that is unpublished, ensuring it is not part of the language model's training data. Additionally, BioDiscoveryAgent predicts gene combinations to perturb more than twice as accurately as a random baseline, a task so far not explored in the context of closed-loop experiment design. The agent also has access to tools for searching the biomedical literature, executing code to analyze biological datasets, and prompting another agent to critically evaluate its predictions. Overall, BioDiscoveryAgent is interpretable at every stage, representing an accessible new paradigm in the computational design of biological experiments with the potential to augment scientists' efficacy.</description>

Abstract: Designing incentives for an adapting population is a ubiquitous problem in a wide array of economic applications and beyond. In this work, we study how to design additional rewards to steer multi-agent systems towards desired policies \emph{without} prior knowledge of the agents' underlying learning dynamics. Motivated by the limitation of existing works, we consider a new and general category of learning dynamics called \emph{Markovian agents}. We introduce a model-based non-episodic Reinforcement Learning (RL) formulation for our steering problem. Importantly, we focus on learning a \emph{history-dependent} steering strategy to handle the inherent model uncertainty about the agents' learning dynamics. We introduce a novel objective function to encode the desiderata of achieving a good steering outcome with reasonable cost. Theoretically, we identify conditions for the existence of steering strategies to guide agents to the desired policies. Complementing our theoretical contributions, we provide empirical algorithms to approximately solve our objective, which effectively tackles the challenge in learning history-dependent strategies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithms through empirical evaluations.</description>

      <title>Principal-Agent Reinforcement Learning: Orchestrating AI Agents with Contracts</title>

Abstract: The increasing deployment of AI is shaping the future landscape of the internet, which is set to become an integrated ecosystem of AI agents. Orchestrating the interaction among AI agents necessitates decentralized, self-sustaining mechanisms that harmonize the tension between individual interests and social welfare. In this paper we tackle this challenge by synergizing reinforcement learning with principal-agent theory from economics. Taken separately, the former allows unrealistic freedom of intervention, while the latter struggles to scale in sequential settings. Combining them achieves the best of both worlds. We propose a framework where a principal guides an agent in a Markov Decision Process (MDP) using a series of contracts, which specify payments by the principal based on observable outcomes of the agent's actions. We present and analyze a meta-algorithm that iteratively optimizes the policies of the principal and agent, showing its equivalence to a contraction operator on the principal's Q-function, and its convergence to subgame-perfect equilibrium. We then scale our algorithm with deep Q-learning and analyze its convergence in the presence of approximation error, both theoretically and through experiments with randomly generated binary game-trees. Extending our framework to multiple agents, we apply our methodology to the combinatorial Coin Game. Addressing this multi-agent sequential social dilemma is a promising first step toward scaling our approach to more complex, real-world instances.</description>
