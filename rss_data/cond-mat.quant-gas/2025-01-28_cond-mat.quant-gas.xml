      <title>Two-body contact of a Bose gas near the superfluid--Mott-insulator transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-body contact is a fundamental quantity of a dilute Bose gas which relates the thermodynamics to the short-distance two-body correlations. For a Bose gas in an optical lattice, near the superfluid--Mott-insulator transition, a ``universal'' contact $C_{\rm univ}$ can be defined from the singular part $P-P_{\rm MI}$ of the pressure ($P_{\rm MI}$ is the pressure of the Mott insulator). Its expression $C_{\rm univ}=C_{\rm DBG}(|n-n_{\rm MI}|,a^*)$ coincides with that of a dilute Bose gas provided we consider the effective ``scattering length'' $a^*$ of the quasi-particles at the quantum critical point (QCP) rather than the scattering length in vacuum, and the excess density $|n-n_{\rm MI}|$ of particles (or holes) with respect to the Mott insulator. Sufficiently close to the transition, there is a broad momentum range in the Brillouin zone where the singular part $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}=n_{\bf k}-n^{\rm MI}_{\bf k}$ of the momentum distribution exhibits the high-momentum tail $Z_{\rm QP} C_{\rm univ}/|{\bf k}|^4$, where $Z_{\rm QP}$ the quasi-particle weight of the elementary excitations at the QCP. We argue that the contact $C_{\rm univ}$ can be measured in state-of-the-art experiments on Bose gases in optical lattices, and in magnetic insulators.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling RPA theory of a Bose gas near the superfluid--Mott-insulator transition: universal thermodynamics and two-body contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a strong-coupling expansion of the Bose-Hubbard model based on a mean-field treatment of the hopping term, while onsite fluctuations are taken into account exactly. This random phase approximation (RPA) describes the universal features of the generic Mott-insulator--superfluid transition (induced by a density change) and the superfluid phase near the phase transition. The critical quasi-particles at the quantum critical point have a quadratic dispersion with an effective mass $m^*$ and their mutual interaction is described by an effective $s$-wave scattering length $a^*$. The singular part of the pressure takes the same form as in a dilute Bose gas, provided we replace the boson mass $m$ and the scattering length in vacuum $a$ by $m^*$ and $a^*$, and the density $n$ by the excess density $|n-n_{\rm MI}|$ of particles (or holes) with respect to the Mott insulator. We define a ``universal'' two-body contact $C_{\rm univ}$ that controls the high-momentum tail $\sim 1/|{\bf k}|^4$ of the singular part $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}$ of the momentum distribution. We also apply the strong-coupling RPA to a lattice model of hard-core bosons and find that the high-momentum distribution is controlled by a universal contact, in complete agreement with the Bose-Hubbard model. Finally, we discuss a continuum model of bosons in an optical lattice and define two additional two-body contacts: a short-distance ``universal'' contact $C_{\rm univ}^{\rm sd}$ which controls the high-momentum tail of $n^{\rm sing}_{\bf k}$ at scales larger than the inverse lattice spacing, and a ``full'' contact $C$ which controls the high-momentum tail of the full momentum distribution $n_{\bf k}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlations and spatial localization in trapped one-dimensional ultra-cold Bose-Bose-Bose mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate and illustrate the complete ground-state phase diagram for a one-dimensional, three-species mixture of a few repulsively interacting bosons trapped harmonically. To numerically obtain the solutions to the many-body Schr\"{o}dinger equation, we employ the improved Exact Diagonalization method [T. D. Anh-Tai {\it et al.}, SciPost Physics 15, 048 (2023)], which is capable of treating strongly-correlated few-body systems from first principles in an efficiently truncated Hilbert space. We present our comprehensive results for all possible combinations of intra- and interspecies interactions in the extreme limits that are either the ideal limit ($g=0$) or close to the hard-core limit ($g\to\infty$). These results show the emergence of unique ground-state properties related to correlations, coherence and spatial localization stemming from strongly repulsive interactions.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Gauge Field for Ultracold Atoms Induced by Vector Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vector beams (VBs) with spatially varying polarization have broad applications across various fields of optics. We introduce a novel use of VBs to generate synthetic gauge fields for ultracold atoms. By leveraging VBs' rich tunability, this scheme enables the emergence of angular stripe phases over a significantly expanded parameter range, achieving a three-orders-of-magnitude enhancement in the phase diagram and thereby making experimental observation feasible. It also allows for the creation of topologically nontrivial giant skyrmions in spin space, with tunable topology controlled by VB parameters and without requiring rotation. Our work opens new avenues for utilizing VBs in quantum control of ultracold atoms and the exploration of exotic quantum states and phases.</description>

      <title>Transverse Field Dependence of the Ground State in the Z2 Bose-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of interaction between the particle and lattice degrees of freedom is one of the central interests in the quantum many-body systems. The Z2 Bose-Hubbard model has been proposed to describe ultracold bosons in a dynamical optical lattice. This model introduces the lattice degrees of freedom by placing half-spins on the bonds between neighboring lattice sites. In this study, we investigate the effect of spin fluctuations on the ground state by using the density-matrix renormalization group method. By calculating the spin structure factor and the compressibility, we show that there is a phase transition between two spatially nonuniform states. We also discuss the ground state in the strong transverse magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Bi-Josephson Effect in a Driven-Dissipative Supersolid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Josephson effect is a macroscopic quantum tunneling phenomenon in a system with superfluid property, when it is split into two parts by a barrier. Here, we examine the Josephson effect in a driven-dissipative supersolid realized by coupling Bose-Einstein condensates to an optical ring cavity. We show that the spontaneous breaking of spatial translation symmetry in supersolid makes the location of the splitting barrier have a significant influence on the Josephson effect. Remarkably, for the same splitting barrier, depending on its location, two different types of DC Josephson currents are found in the supersolid phase (compared to only one type found in the superfluid phase). Thus, we term it a bi-Josephson effect. We examine the Josephson relationships and critical Josephson currents in detail, revealing that the emergence of supersolid order affects these two types of DC Josephson currents differently -- one is enhanced, while the other is suppressed. The findings of this work unveil unique Josephson physics in the supersolid phase, and show new opportunities to build novel Josephson devices with supersolids.</description>

      <title>Dispersive measurement of spin shot noise in a Bose--Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report dispersive spin shot noise measurement of a Bose--Einstein condensate (BEC). While dispersive probing has been used for quantum spin noise measurement of thermal and cold gases for decades, confirmative measurement of spin shot noise, i.e.,\ the linear dependence of the spin variance on the number of atoms in a BEC has been lacking. Here, we demonstrate precise spin noise measurement of a BEC of rubidium atoms at the spin shot noise level by polarization rotation using a two-color probe at optimal detunings, with power balance stabilization to suppress probe-induced excess spin noise. This work opens the possibility for the unexplored study of quantum spin fluctuations in multi-component or spinor BECs and offers an approach to improve spin measurement precision, which is relevant to atomic spin-based sensors.</description>

      <title>Self-Adapted Josephson Oscillation of Dark-Bright Solitons under Constant Forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation of dark-bright solitons in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) with general nonlinear parameters, and explore how nonlinear interactions enrich the soliton dynamics giving rise to nonsinusoidal oscillations under constant forces. Treating the bright soliton as an effective barrier, we reveal that such oscillations are characterized by the Josephson equations with self-adapted critical current and bias voltage, whose explicit analytic expressions are derived using the Lagrangian variational method. The dynamical phase diagram in nonlinear parameter space is presented, identifying oscillation regions with different skewed sinusoidal dependence, and diffusion regions with irreversible soliton spreading due to instability of the barrier. Furthermore, we obtain periodic dispersion relations of the solitons, indicating a switch between positive and negative inertial masses, consistent with the oscillation behaviors. Our results provide a general and comprehensive theoretical framework for soliton oscillation dynamics and pave the way for investigating various nonlinear transports and their potential applications.</description>

      <title>Environment-limited transfer of angular momentum in Bose liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impurity motion in a many-body environment has been a central issue in the field of low-temperature physics for decades. In bosonic quantum fluids, the onset of a drag force experienced by point-like objects is due to collective environment excitations, driven by the exchange of linear momentum between the impurity and the many-body bath. In this work we consider a rotating impurity, with the aim of exploring how angular momentum is exchanged with the surrounding bosonic environment. In order to elucidate this issues, we employ a quasiparticle approach based on the angulon theory, which allows us to effectively deal with the non-trivial algebra of quantized angular momentum in presence of a many-body environment. We uncover how impurity dressing by environmental excitations can establish an exchange channel, whose effectiveness crucially depends on the initial state of the impurity. Remarkably, we find that there is a critical value of initial angular momentum, above which this channel effectively freezes.</description>

      <title>Exactly Solvable Models of Interacting Chiral Bosons and Fermions on a Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider one-dimensional theories of chiral fermions and bosons on a lattice, which arise as edge states of two-dimensional topological matter breaking time-reversal invariance. We show that hard core bosons or their spin chain equivalent exhibit properties that are similar to free fermions, solving the many-body problem exactly. For fermions, we study the effect of a static impurity exactly and show the orthogonality catastrophe in the continuum limit via bosonization. The interacting many-fermion problem in the continuum limit is solved exactly using simple momentum conservation arguments.</description>

      <title>Probing non-Gaussian correlations through entanglement generation in a many-body quantum system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In understanding strongly correlated quantum systems, quantifying the non-Gaussian nature of interparticle correlations is invaluable. We show that, for a uniform quantum gas, there exists a natural connection between non-Gaussian correlations and the generation of momentum-space entanglement. Furthermore, this entanglement can be directly measured in an experiment using time-of-flight techniques. To prototype our method, we numerically study entanglement generation in a degenerate Bose gas following a quench to the unitary regime, where Gaussian and non-Gaussian correlations are generated sequentially in time.</description>

      <title>Shift of the Bose-Einstein condensation temperature due to dipolar interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the first measurements of the BEC critical temperature shift due to dipolar interactions, employing samples of ultracold erbium atoms which feature significant (magnetic) dipole-dipole interactions in addition to tuneable contact interactions. Using a highly prolate harmonic trapping potential, we observe a clear dependence of the critical temperature on the orientation of the dipoles relative to the trap axis. Our results are in good agreement with mean-field theory for a range of contact interaction strengths. This work opens the door for further investigations into beyond-mean-field effects and the finite-temperature phase diagram in the more strongly dipolar regime where supersolid and droplet states emerge.</description>

      <title>Towards perfect quantum insulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric fields, applied to insulators, cause transitions between valence and conduction bands, giving rise to current. Adjustments of the Hamiltonian can perfect the quality of the insulator, shutting down transitions whilst fully preserving the many-particle state, but they are challenging to implement. Instead, adjusted Hamiltonians having desirable features are addressed variationally, via the analysis of a suitable figure of merit. They suppress current-enabling transitions whilst tending to preserve the many-particle state, and hence they yield optimal insulation. Emerging naturally from this approach are two established concepts: transitionless quantum driving [M. V. Berry, J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 42, 365303 (2009)] and (a modified) localization tensor [R. Resta and S. Sorella, Phys. Rev. Lett. 82, 370-373 (1999)]. The variational approach is illustrated via application to a tight-binding model. In this setting, the optimally adjusted Hamiltonian has a powerful impact on transition suppression and localization-tensor reduction, suggesting strong enhancement of insulation. These features are expected to be more general than the model that displays them.</description>

      <title>Optimal spectral transport of non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optimal transport problem seeks to minimize the total transportation cost between two distributions, thus providing a measure of distance between them. In this work, we study the optimal transport of the eigenspectrum of one-dimensional non-Hermitian models as the spectrum deforms on the complex plane under a varying imaginary gauge field. Notably, according to the non-Bloch band theory, the deforming spectrum continuously connects the eigenspectra of the original non-Hermitian model (with vanishing gauge field) under different boundary conditions. It follows that the optimal spectral transport should contain key information of the model. Characterizing the optimal spectral transport through the Wasserstein metric, we show that, indeed, important features of the non-Hermitian model, such as the (auxiliary) generalized Brillouin zone, the non-Bloch exceptional point, and topological phase transition, can be determined from the Wasserstein-metric calculation. We confirm our conclusions using concrete examples. Our work highlights the key role of spectral geometry in non-Hermitian physics, and offers a practical and convenient access to the properties of non-Hermitian models.</description>

      <title>Laser cooled 137BaF molecules for measuring nuclear-spin-dependent parity violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate optical cycling and transverse laser cooling of a beam of fermionic 137BaF molecules. Their high masses and nuclear spins make these molecules sensitive probes for parity violation and properties of the weak interaction. However, the nuclear spins also lead to a quasi-closed cycling transition currently involving up to 112 levels, which significantly exceeds the complexity in other laser-cooled molecules. Optical cycling and cooling are facilitated through carefully designed optical spectra tailored to this molecular structure. Our results pave the way for efficient state preparation, detection, and cooling in precision measurements using this species and other similar species.</description>

      <title>Expediting quantum state transfer through long-range extended XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Going beyond short-range interactions, we explore the role of long-range interactions in the extended XY model for transferring quantum states through evolution. In particular, employing a spin-1/2 chain with interactions decaying as a power law, we demonstrate that long-range interactions significantly enhance the efficiency of a quantum state transfer (QST) protocol, reducing the minimum time required to achieve fidelity beyond the classical limit. Our study identifies the long-range regime as providing an optimal balance between interaction range and transfer efficiency, outperforming the protocol with the short-range interacting model. Our detailed analysis reveals the impact of system parameters, such as anisotropy, magnetic field strength, and coordination number, on QST dynamics. Specifically, we find that intermediate coordination numbers lead to a faster and more reliable state transfer, while extreme values diminish performance. Further, we exhibit that the presence of long-range interactions also improves the achievable fidelity, mitigating its decline associated with increasing system-size.</description>

      <title>Protecting Intercavity Polaritons in Strongly Coupled Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically designed and experimentally demonstrated a mechanism to protect a spatially segregated mixed light-matter state, known as intercavity exciton-polariton in strongly coupled optical cavities. This excitation, shared across the coupled cavity array, exhibits remarkable robustness over a wide momentum range, without compromising photon-exciton mixing or the spatial separation of its photonic and excitonic components, which also enables a tunable heavy mass. Additionally, we unveil a direct connection between the transparency window, characteristic of slow-light experiments, and the protection of the intercavity polariton nature. Both phenomena originate from the strategic design of an energy-level landscape featuring a $\Lambda$-scheme, opening new avenues for exploring and utilizing these unique optical excitations in advanced photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Optimal control for preparing fractional quantum Hall states in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10720v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preparing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states represents a key challenge for quantum simulators. While small Laughlin-type states have been realized by manipulating two atoms or two photons, scaling up these settings to larger ensembles stands as an impractical task using existing methods and protocols. In this work, we propose to use optimal-control methods to substantially accelerate the preparation of small Laughlin-type states, and demonstrate that the resulting protocols are also well suited to realize larger FQH states under realistic preparation times. Our schemes are specifically built on the recent optical-lattice experiment [Leonard et al., Nature (2023)], and consist in optimizing very few control parameters: the tunneling amplitudes and linear gradients along the two directions of the lattice. We demonstrate the robustness of our optimal-control schemes against control errors and disorder, and discuss their advantages over existing preparation methods. Our work paves the way to the efficient realization of strongly-correlated topological states in quantum-engineered systems.</description>

      <title>The Timescales of Quantum Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09410v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the inevitable existence of quantum effects, a classical description generically breaks down after a finite quantum break-time $t_q$. We aim to find criteria for determining $t_q$. To this end, we construct a new prototype model that features numerous dynamically accessible quantum modes. Using explicit numerical time evolution, we establish how $t_q$ depends on the parameters of the system such as its particle number $N$. The presence of a classical instability leads to $t_q \sim \ln N$ or $t_q\sim \sqrt{N}$. In the stable case, we observe $t_q\sim N$, although full quantum breaking may not take place at all. We find that the different regimes merge smoothly with $t_q\sim N^\gamma$ ($0&lt;\gamma&lt;1$). As an outlook, we point out possibilities for transferring our results to black holes and expanding spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Entanglement of weighted graphs uncovers transitions in variable-range interacting models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cluster state acquired by evolving the nearest-neighbor (NN) Ising model from a completely separable state is the resource for measurement-based quantum computation. Instead of an NN system, a variable-range power law interacting Ising model can generate a genuine multipartite entangled (GME) weighted graph state (WGS) that may reveal intrinsic characteristics of the evolving Hamiltonian. We establish that the pattern of generalized geometric measure (GGM) in the evolved state with an arbitrary number of qubits is sensitive to fall-off rates and the range of interactions of the evolving Hamiltonian. We report that the time-derivative and time-averaged GGM at a particular time can detect the transition points present in the fall-off rates of the interaction strength, separating different regions, namely long-range, quasi-local and local ones in one- and two-dimensional lattices with deformation. Moreover, we illustrate that in the quasi-local and local regimes, there exists a minimum coordination number in the evolving Ising model for a fixed total number of qubits which can mimic the GGM of the long-range model. In order to achieve a finite-size subsystem from the entire system, we design a local measurement strategy that allows a WGS of an arbitrary number of qubits to be reduced to a local unitarily equivalent WGS having fewer qubits with modified weights.</description>

      <title>SU($N$) altermagnetism: Lattice models, magnon modes, and flavor-split bands</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a type of magnetic order that combines properties of ferro- and antiferromagnets, has stirred great interest lately not only as a promising source of spintronics applications, but also as a potential gateway to exotic phases of matter. Here, we demonstrate how to generalize collinear altermagnetism to SU($N$) magnets with $N&gt;2$. Guided by symmetry principles, we present a recipe to construct Heisenberg models for such generalized altermagnets and apply it explicitly for $N=3,4$. Using flavor-wave theory, we compute the excitation spectrum of a two-dimensional SU(3) model and show that it exhibits magnon bands with altermagnetic splitting according to magnetic quantum numbers; we connect this quantum-number splitting to the frequently used concept of magnon chirality. We also compute the electronic band structure for a metallic system of the same symmetry and map out the polarization of the resulting flavor-split bands.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of future quantum devices requires understanding the dynamics of driven many-body systems, in which the Floquet-induced interactions play a central role. This understanding is crucial for coherently controlling quantum states, minimising errors, and benchmarking the performance of these devices. In this thesis, we analyse the enhancement on the Floquet-induced interactions by many-body correlations, and develop an advanced Floquet method to understand the Floquet-induced interactions relevant for future quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Toward the Observation of Entangled Pairs in BEC analogue Expanding Universes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pair creation is a fundamental prediction of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes. While classical aspects of this phenomenon have been observed, the experimental confirmation of its quantum origin remains elusive. In this article, we quantify the entanglement produced by pair creation in two dimensional Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC) analogues of expanding universes and examine the impact of various experimental factors, including decoherence from thermal noise and losses. Our analysis evaluates the feasibility of detecting entanglement in these systems and identifies optimal experimental configurations for achieving this goal. Focusing on the experimental setup detailed in \cite{Viermann:2022wgw}, we demonstrate that entanglement can be observed in these BEC analogues at a significance level of $\sim 2\sigma$ with current capabilities, and at $\gtrsim 3.3\sigma$ with modest improvements. Achieving this would provide unequivocal evidence of the quantum nature of pair creation and validate one of the most iconic predictions of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</description>
