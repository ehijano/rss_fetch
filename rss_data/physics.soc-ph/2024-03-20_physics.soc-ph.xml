      <title>Complex Networks characterization of Indian Water Dam Systems and its topographic response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we have taken a Complex Network approach to understand the salient features of Indian Water Dam Networks. Detailed analysis of 15 river basin networks have been carried out. The data has been taken from "River Basin Atlas of India" compiled by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and Central Water Commission (CWC), Ministry of Water Resources, Government of India. The paper also investigates the correlation between various structural properties of the networks like total number of nodes, Link Density, Clustering Coefficient amongst each other; and also with the Irrigation Potential and topographical features like the Elevation gradient of the region measured in meters. A mathematical model has also been proposed to understand the relation between irrigation potential measured in thousand hectares unit with the number of nodes, i.e. dams and barrages, to get a more quantitative understanding of the system. The paper also tries to observe the response of the network properties to actual topographical features of the region. This lays down a basic foundational work in understanding these water dam networks through a complex network approach over which further work can be done to make the predictions more efficient.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Disinformation in Social Networks through Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An abundance of literature has shown that the injection of noise into complex socio-economic systems can improve their resilience. This study aims to understand whether the same applies in the context of information diffusion in social networks. Specifically, we aim to understand whether the injection of noise in a social network of agents seeking to uncover a ground truth among a set of competing hypotheses can build resilience against disinformation. We implement two different stylized policies to inject noise in a social network, i.e., via random bots and via randomized recommendations, and find both to improve the population's overall belief in the ground truth. Notably, we find noise to be as effective as debunking when disinformation is particularly strong. On the other hand, such beneficial effects may lead to a misalignment between the agents' privately held and publicly stated beliefs, a phenomenon which is reminiscent of cognitive dissonance.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale Traffic Flow Modeling: A Renormalization Group Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traffic flow modeling is typically performed at one of three different scales (microscopic, mesoscopic, or macroscopic), each with distinct modeling approaches. Recent works that attempt to merge models at different scales have yielded some success, but there still exists a need for a single modeling framework that can seamlessly model traffic flow across several spatiotemporal scales. The presented work utilizes a renormalization group (RG) theoretic approach, building upon our prior research on statistical mechanics-inspired traffic flow modeling. Specifically, we use an Ising model-inspired cellular automata model to represent traffic flow dynamics. RG transformations are applied to this model to obtain coarse-grained parameters (interaction and field coefficients) to simulate traffic at coarser spatiotemporal scales and different vehicular densities. We measure the accuracy of the coarse-grained traffic flow simulation using a pixel-based image correlation metric and find good correlation between the dynamics at different scales. Importantly, emergent traffic dynamics such as backward moving congestion waves are retained at coarser scales with this approach. The presented work has the potential to spur the development of a unified traffic flow modeling framework for transportation analysis across varied spatiotemporal scales, while retaining an analytical relationship between the model parameters at these scales.</description>

      <title>Herd Behaviour in Public Goods Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of free-riding arises when individuals benefit from a shared resource, service, or public good without proportionately contributing to its provision. This conduct often leads to a collective action problem, as individuals pursue personal gains while relying on the contributions of others. In this study, we present a Bayesian inference model to elucidate the behaviour of participants in a Public Goods Game, a conceptual framework that captures the essence of the free-riding problem. Here, individuals possess information on the distribution of group donations to the public good. Our model is grounded in the premise that individuals strive to harmonise their actions with the group's donation patterns. Our model is able to replicate behavioural patterns that resemble those observed in experiments with mid-sized groups (100 people) but fails to replicate those for larger scales (1000 people). These insights contribute to the understanding of how cooperation is achieved through alignment with group behaviour.</description>

      <title>An SEIR network epidemic model with manual and digital contact tracing allowing delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an SEIR epidemic model on a network also allowing random contacts, where recovered individuals could either recover naturally or be diagnosed. Upon diagnosis, manual contact tracing is triggered such that each infected network contact is reported, tested and isolated with some probability and after a random delay. Additionally, digital tracing (based on a tracing app) is triggered if the diagnosed individual is an app-user, and then all of its app-using infectees are immediately notified and isolated. The early phase of the epidemic with manual and/or digital tracing is approximated by different multi-type branching processes, and three respective reproduction numbers are derived. The effectiveness of both contact tracing mechanisms is numerically quantified through the reduction of the reproduction number. This shows that app-using fraction plays an essential role in the overall effectiveness of contact tracing. The relative effectiveness of manual tracing compared to digital tracing increases if: more of the transmission occurs on the network, when the tracing delay is shortened, and when the network degree distribution is heavy-tailed. For realistic values, the combined tracing case can reduce $R_0$ by $20-30\%$, so other preventive measures are needed to reduce the reproduction number down to $1.2-1.4$ for contact tracing to make it successful in avoiding big outbreaks.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and Panic Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Panic-induced herding in individuals often leads to social disasters, resulting in people being trapped and trampled in crowd stampedes triggered by panic. We introduce a novel approach that offers fresh insights into studying the phenomenon of asymmetrical panic-induced escape. Our approach is based on the concept of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB), a fundamental governing mechanism in the Physical Sciences. By applying the principles of SSB, we elucidate how asymmetrical panic-induced herding in individuals occurs. We highlight that understanding panic escape and preventing catastrophic situations can be achieved through two crucial parameters: "population density" control and "communication (or information transfer)" among individuals in a crowd. The interplay of these two parameters is responsible for either breaking or restoring the symmetry of a system. We describe how these parameters are set by design conditions as well as crowd control. Based on these parameters, we discuss strategies for preventing potential social disasters caused by asymmetrical panic escape.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation in systems of active particles with chiral interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.05454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.05454v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyzed pattern formation in systems of active particles with chiral forces in the context of pedestrian dynamics. To describe the interparticle interactions, we use the standard social force model and supplement it with a new type of force that reflects the chirality. We performed numerical simulations of two pedestrian flows moving in opposite directions in a long corridor. We observed two dynamic phase transitions which occur for varying number density of particles and strength of the chirality force -- one from disordered motion to multi-lane motion and another -- from the multi-lane to two-lane motion. We develop a qualitative theory which describes the demarcation lines for these phase transitions on the phase diagram chirality-density. The results of our analysis agree fairly well with the simulation data. Our findings may find applications for problems of urban and transportation planning.</description>

      <title>Applicability of QKD: TerraQuantum view on the NSA's scepticism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum communication offers unique features that have no classical analog, in particular, it enables provably secure quantum key distribution (QKD). Despite the benefits of quantum communication are well understood within the scientific community, the practical implementations sometimes meet with scepticism or even resistance. In a recent publication [1], NSA claims that QKD is inferior to "quantum-resistant" cryptography and does not recommend it for use. Here we show that such a sceptical approach to evaluation of quantum security is not well justified. We hope that our arguments will be helpful to clarify the issue.</description>
