      <title>A Practical Approach Towards Inertia Estimation Using Ambient Synchrophasor Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-time tracking of inertia is important because it reflects the power system's ability to withstand contingencies and maintain frequency security. This paper proposes a practical approach to estimate inertia using ambient phasor measurement unit (PMU) data and a partitioned form of the swing equation. The approach accounts for (bounded) uncertainties in network parameters and PMU measurements, enabling precise estimation of inertia and damping constants, as well as mechanical power inputs. Instead of assuming constant mechanical power input throughout, the approach leverages knowledge of power system operations to determine intervals when it is actually constant to maintain estimation consistency. Simulation results on the IEEE 14-bus system and IEEE 39 bus system integrated with renewable energy sources affirm the method's accuracy and applicability.</description>

      <title>Robustly Invertible Nonlinear Dynamics and the BiLipREN: Contracting Neural Models with Contracting Inverses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the invertibility of nonlinear dynamical systems from the perspective of contraction and incremental stability analysis and propose a new invertible recurrent neural model: the BiLipREN. In particular, we consider a nonlinear state space model to be robustly invertible if an inverse exists with a state space realisation, and both the forward model and its inverse are contracting, i.e. incrementally exponentially stable, and Lipschitz, i.e. have bounded incremental gain. This property of bi-Lipschitzness implies both robustness in the sense of sensitivity to input perturbations, as well as robust distinguishability of different inputs from their corresponding outputs, i.e. the inverse model robustly reconstructs the input sequence despite small perturbations to the initial conditions and measured output. Building on this foundation, we propose a parameterization of neural dynamic models: bi-Lipschitz recurrent equilibrium networks (biLipREN), which are robustly invertible by construction. Moreover, biLipRENs can be composed with orthogonal linear systems to construct more general bi-Lipschitz dynamic models, e.g., a nonlinear analogue of minimum-phase/all-pass (inner/outer) factorization. We illustrate the utility of our proposed approach with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Global Task-aware Fault Detection, Identification For On-Orbit Multi-Spacecraft Collaborative Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a global-to-local task-aware fault detection and identification algorithm to detect failures in a multi-spacecraft system performing a collaborative inspection (referred to as global) task. The inspection task is encoded as a cost functional $\costH$ that informs global (task allocation and assignment) and local (agent-level) decision-making. The metric $\costH$ is a function of the inspection sensor model, and the agent full-pose. We use the cost functional $\costH$ to design a metric that compares the expected and actual performance to detect the faulty agent using a threshold. We use higher-order cost gradients $\costH$ to derive a new metric to identify the type of fault, including task-specific sensor fault, an agent-level actuator, and sensor faults. Furthermore, we propose an approach to design adaptive thresholds for each fault mentioned above to incorporate the time dependence of the inspection task. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method empirically, by simulating and detecting faults (such as inspection sensor faults, actuators, and sensor faults) in a low-Earth orbit collaborative spacecraft inspection task using the metrics and the threshold designed using the global task cost $\costH$.</description>

      <title>The ISAC systems aided by MIMO, RIS and with Beamforming Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the integration of communication and sensing in modern wireless systems through the configuration of BS and RIS antenna elements. By leveraging time multiplexing for both communication and sensing, the proposed system optimizes spectral efficiency and operational performance. The use of static RIS configurations tailored to specific environments eliminates the need for dynamic reconfigurations, enhancing system agility, reducing processing complexity, and improving sensing accuracy. The system incorporates trilateration, angle of arrival, and time of arrival techniques to enable precise user localization by combining signals reflected along multiple paths. This method helps choose the best connections and lowers sensing costs while preventing interference with communication data, highlighting the need to bring together new technologies like passive and adaptive beamforming in one system.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing, Computing, Communication, and Control for Time-Sequence-Based Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the upcoming industrial internet of things (IIoT) era, a surge of task-oriented applications will rely on real-time wireless control systems (WCSs). For these systems, ultra-reliable and low-latency wireless communication will be crucial to ensure the timely transmission of control information. To achieve this purpose, we propose a novel time-sequence-based semantic communication paradigm, where an integrated sensing, computing, communication, and control (ISC3) architecture is developed to make sensible semantic inference (SI) for the control information over time sequences, enabling adaptive control of the robot. However, due to the causal correlations in the time sequence, the control information does not present the Markov property. To address this challenge, we compute the mutual information of the control information sensed at the transmitter (Tx) over different time and identify their temporal semantic correlation via a semantic feature extractor (SFE) module. By this means, highly correlated information transmission can be avoided, thus greatly reducing the communication overhead. Meanwhile, a semantic feature reconstructor (SFR) module is employed at the receiver (Rx) to reconstruct the control information based on the previously received one if the information transmission is not activated at the Tx. Furthermore, a control gain policy is also employed at the Rx to adaptively adjust the control gain for the controlled target based on several practical aspects such as the quality of the information transmission from the Tx to the Rx. We design the neural network structures of the above modules/policies and train their parameters by a novel hybrid reward multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework. On-site experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of our proposed method in practice, which shows significant gains over other baseline schemes.</description>

      <title>Non-linear dynamics of multibody systems: a system-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents causal block-diagram models to represent the equations of motion of multi-body systems in a very compact and simple closed form. Both the forward dynamics (from the forces and torques imposed at the various degrees-of-freedom to the motions of these degrees-of-freedom) or the inverse dynamics (from the motions imposed at the degrees-of-freedom to the resulting forces and torques) can be considered and described by a block diagram model. This work extends the Two-Input Two-Output Port (TITOP) theory by including all non-linear terms and uniform or gravitational acceleration fields. Connection among different blocks is possible through the definition of the motion vector. The model of a system composed of a floating base, rigid bodies, revolute and prismatic joints, working under gravity is developed to illustrate the methodology. The proposed model is validated by simulation and cross-checking with a model built using an alternative modeling tool on a scenario where the nonlinear terms are determining.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Fuzzy Control: A Hierarchical Multi-Agent Control Architecture for Outdoor Search-and-Rescue Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous robots deployed in unknown search-and-rescue (SaR) environments can significantly improve the efficiency of the mission by assisting in fast localisation and rescue of the trapped victims. We propose a novel integrated hierarchical control architecture, called model predictive fuzzy control (MPFC), for autonomous mission planning of multi-robot SaR systems that should efficiently map an unknown environment: We combine model predictive control (MPC) and fuzzy logic control (FLC), where the robots are locally controlled by computationally efficient FLC controllers, and the parameters of these local controllers are tuned via a centralised MPC controller, in a regular or event-triggered manner. The proposed architecture provides three main advantages: (1) The control decisions are made by the FLC controllers, thus the real-time computation time is affordable. (2) The centralised MPC controller optimises the performance criteria with a global and predictive vision of the system dynamics, and updates the parameters of the FLC controllers accordingly. (3) FLC controllers are heuristic by nature and thus do not take into account optimality in their decisions, while the tuned parameters via the MPC controller can indirectly incorporate some level of optimality in local decisions of the robots. A simulation environment for victim detection in a disaster environment was designed in MATLAB using discrete, 2-D grid-based models. While being comparable from the point of computational efficiency, the integrated MPFC architecture improves the performance of the multi-robot SaR system compared to decentralised FLC controllers. Moreover, the performance of MPFC is comparable to the performance of centralised MPC for path planning of SaR robots, whereas MPFC requires significantly less computational resources, since the number of the optimisation variables in the control problem are reduced.</description>

      <title>Multi-Class Stackelberg Games for the Co-Design of Networked Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a co-design problem, encompassing simultaneous design of system infrastructure and control, through a game-theoretical framework. To this end, we propose the co-design problem as a two-layer hierarchical strategic interaction. At the upper layer, a leader (or multiple leaders) determines system design parameters, while at the lower layer, a follower (or multiple followers) optimizes the control strategy. To capture this hierarchy, we propose four novel classes of Stackelberg games that integrate diverse strategic behaviors, including combinations of cooperative and non-cooperative interactions across two different layers. Notably, the leaders' interactions are represented using a normal-form game, whereas the followers' interactions are modeled by different games (dynamic games in discrete time). These distinct game structures result in a Stackelberg game that accommodates different game types per layer, and/or supports heterogeneous strategic behaviors involving cooperation and non-cooperation simultaneously. Learning algorithms using the best-response dynamics are used to solve the game problems when considering a discrete strategic space for the leaders. The efficacy of the proposed approach is demonstrated through an application to the co-design of the Barcelona drinking water network.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Homothetic Tube MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study homothetic tube model predictive control (MPC) of discrete-time linear systems subject to bounded additive disturbance and mixed constraints on the state and input. Different from most existing work on robust MPC, we assume that the true disturbance set is unknown but a conservative surrogate is available a priori. Leveraging the real-time data, we develop an online learning algorithm to approximate the true disturbance set. This approximation and the corresponding constraints in the MPC optimisation are updated online using computationally convenient linear programs. We provide statistical gaps between the true and learned disturbance sets, based on which, probabilistic recursive feasibility of homothetic tube MPC problems is discussed. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed algorithm and compare with state-of-the-art MPC algorithms.</description>

      <title>Power Loss and Temperature Distribution in Coil of PFC Inductor with Air Gap for Multimode Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power converters inherently display non-linear load characteristics, resulting in a high level of mains harmonics, and hence the necessity of implementing Power Factor Correction (PFC). Active PFC circuitry typically comprises an inductor and a power switch to control and alter the input current so that it matches, in shape and phase, the input voltage. This modelling of the waveforms can be performed by means of distinct conduction modes of the PFC inductor. The digital controller implemented in the constructed and investigated boost-type PFC converter can be programmed to operate in discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), continuous conduction mode (CCM), or a combination of the two. The individual modes of operation, via distinct PFC inductor current waveforms, impact the overall efficiency of power conversion and, by extension, temperature distribution in the magnetic component. This paper investigates how the examined conduction modes bear on distinct power-loss mechanisms present in the PFC inductor, including high-frequency eddy-current-generating phenomena, and the fringing effect in particular. As demonstrated herein, the DCM operation, for the set output power level, exhibits exacerbated power dissipation in the winding of the inductor due to the somewhat increased RSM value of the current and the intensified fringing magnetic flux at an air gap. The latter assertion will undergo further, more quantitatively focused research. Finally, the construction of the coil was optimised to reduce power loss by diminishing eddy-current mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Sequentially learning regions of attraction from data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is dedicated to data-driven analysis of dynamical systems. It deals with certifying the basin of attraction of a stable equilibrium for an unknown dynamical system. It is supposed that point-wise evaluation of the right-hand side of the ordinary differential equation governing the system is available for a set of points in the state space. Technically, a Piecewise Affine Lyapunov function will be constructed iteratively using an optimisation-based technique for the effective validation of the certificates. As a main contribution, whenever those certificates are violated locally, a refinement of the domain and the associated tessellation is produced, thus leading to an improvement in the description of the domain of attraction.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered GAT-LSTM Framework for Attack Detection in Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems are essential for maintaining indoor environmental quality, but their interconnected nature and reliance on sensor networks make them vulnerable to cyber-physical attacks. Such attacks can interrupt system operations and risk leaking sensitive personal information through measurement data. In this paper, we propose a novel attack detection framework for HVAC systems, integrating an Event-Triggering Unit (ETU) for local monitoring and a cloud-based classification system using the Graph Attention Network (GAT) and the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. The ETU performs a binary classification to identify potential anomalies and selectively triggers encrypted data transmission to the cloud, significantly reducing communication cost. The cloud-side GAT module models the spatial relationships among HVAC components, while the LSTM module captures temporal dependencies across encrypted state sequences to classify the attack type. Our approach is evaluated on datasets that simulate diverse attack scenarios. Compared to GAT-only (94.2% accuracy) and LSTM-only (91.5%) ablations, our full GAT-LSTM model achieves 98.8% overall detection accuracy and reduces data transmission to 15%. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves high detection accuracy while preserving data privacy by using the spatial-temporal characteristics of HVAC systems and minimizing transmission costs through event-triggered communication.</description>

      <title>Artificial Potential Field and Sliding Mode Control for Spacecraft Attitude Maneuver with Actuation and Pointing Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the combination of guidance and control strategies for rigid spacecraft attitude reorientation, while dealing with forbidden pointing constraints, actuator limitations, and system uncertainties. These constraints arise due to the presence of bright objects in space that may damage sensitive payloads onboard the spacecraft, and the risk that actuator saturations may compromise closed-loop system stability. Furthermore, spacecraft attitude dynamics are typically affected by parametric uncertainties, external disturbances, and system nonlinearities, which cannot be neglected. In this article, the problem of spacecraft reorientation under pointing and actuation constraints is addressed using a strategy that combines Artificial Potential Field (APF) and Sliding Mode Control (SMC). A rigorous Lyapunov-based analysis yields closed-form expressions for APF/SMC gains, providing explicit mathematical formulas for gain values without the need for iterative computations. These expressions account for angular velocity and control torque limitations, external disturbances, and inertia uncertainties. The robustness of the proposed control strategy is demonstrated through Monte Carlo simulations using a high-fidelity attitude dynamics simulator. Additionally, mu-analysis is employed to assess local stability properties and quantify robustness margins. The results confirm the practical feasibility of the proposed method in real-world space scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness in uncertain and constrained environments.</description>

      <title>Dynamic load balancing for cloud systems under heterogeneous setup delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a distributed cloud service deployed at a set of distinct server pools. Arriving jobs are classified into heterogeneous types, in accordance with their setup times which are differentiated at each of the pools. A dispatcher for each job type controls the balance of load between pools, based on decentralized feedback. The system of rates and queues is modeled by a fluid differential equation system, and analyzed via convex optimization. A first, myopic policy is proposed, based on task delay-to-service. Under a simplified dynamic fluid queue model, we prove global convergence to an equilibrium point which minimizes the mean setup time; however queueing delays are incurred with this method. A second proposal is then developed based on proximal optimization, which explicitly models the setup queue and is proved to reach an optimal equilibrium, devoid of queueing delay. Results are demonstrated through a simulation example.</description>

      <title>Backstepping Reach-avoid Controller Synthesis for Multi-input Multi-output Systems with Mixed Relative Degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing controllers with provable formal guarantees has become an urgent requirement for cyber-physical systems in safety-critical scenarios. Beyond addressing scalability in high-dimensional implementations, controller synthesis methodologies separating safety and reachability objectives may risk optimization infeasibility due to conflicting constraints, thereby significantly undermining their applicability in practical applications. In this paper, by leveraging feedback linearization and backstepping techniques, we present a novel framework for constructing provable reach-avoid formal certificates tailored to multi-input multi-output systems. Based on this, we developed a systematic synthesis approach for controllers with reach-avoid guarantees, which ensures that the outputs of the system eventually enter the predefined target set while staying within the required safe set. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations.</description>

      <title>Optimal Droop Control Strategy for Coordinated Voltage Regulation and Power Sharing in Hybrid AC-MTDC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the growing integration of modular multilevel converters (MMCs) in Multi-Terminal Direct Current (MTDC) transmission systems, there is an increasing need for control strategies that ensure both economic efficiency and robust dynamic performance. This paper presents an enhanced Optimal Power Flow (OPF) framework for hybrid AC-MTDC systems, integrating a novel droop control strategy that coordinates DC voltage and AC frequency regulation. By embedding frequency control loops into the MMCs, the method enables system-wide coordination, enhancing power sharing and improving system resilience under disturbances. The proposed strategy dynamically adjusts converter operating points to minimize generation costs and DC voltage deviations, thus balancing economic objectives with system stability. A modified Nordic test system integrated with a four-terminal MTDC grid is used to validate the approach. Optimization is performed using Julia, while the system's dynamic performance is evaluated through electromagnetic transient simulations with the EMTP software. Case studies across multiple scenarios demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves lower generation costs than active power control and adaptive droop control strategy while maintaining stable control characteristics. The results highlight the method's capability to deliver cost-effective operation without compromising performance, offering a promising solution for the coordinated control of future hybrid AC-DC transmission networks.</description>

      <title>Toward a Harmonized Approach - Requirement-based Structuring of a Safety Assurance Argumentation for Automated Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03709v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite increasing testing operation on public roads, media reports on incidents show that safety issues remain to this day. One major cause factoring into this circumstance is high development uncertainty that manufacturers face when deploying these systems in an open context. In particular, one challenge is establishing a valid argument at design time that the vehicle will exhibit reasonable residual risk when operating in its intended operational design domain. Regulations, such as the European Implementing Regulation 2022/1426, require manufacturers to provide a safety assurance argumentation for SAE-Level-4 automated vehicles. While there is extensive literature on assurance cases for safety-critical systems, the domain of automated driving lacks explicit requirements regarding the creation of safety assurance argumentations. In this paper, we aim to narrow this gap by elaborating a requirement-based approach. We derive structural requirements for an argumentation from literature and supplement these with requirements derived from stakeholder concerns. We implement the requirements, yielding a proposal for an overall argumentation structure. The resulting "safety arguments" argue over four topic complexes: The developed product, the underlying process including its conformance/compliance to standards/laws, as well as the argumentations' context and soundness. Finally, we instantiate this structure with respect to domain-specific needs and principles.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Coordination Strategies for Underground Automated Vehicle Fleets in Mixed Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the efficiency and safety outcomes of implementing different adaptive coordination models for automated vehicle (AV) fleets, managed by a centralized coordinator that dynamically responds to human-controlled vehicle behavior. The simulated scenarios replicate an underground mining environment characterized by narrow tunnels with limited connectivity. To address the unique challenges of such settings, we propose a novel metric - Path Overlap Density (POD) - to predict efficiency and potentially the safety performance of AV fleets. The study also explores the impact of map features on AV fleets performance. The results demonstrate that both AV fleet coordination strategies and underground tunnel network characteristics significantly influence overall system performance. While map features are critical for optimizing efficiency, adaptive coordination strategies are essential for ensuring safe operations.</description>

      <title>Floating Car Observers in Intelligent Transportation Systems: Detection Modeling and Temporal Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floating Car Observers (FCOs) extend traditional Floating Car Data (FCD) by integrating onboard sensors to detect and localize other traffic participants, providing richer and more detailed traffic data. In this work, we explore various modeling approaches for FCO detections within microscopic traffic simulations to evaluate their potential for Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) applications. These approaches range from 2D raytracing to high-fidelity co-simulations that emulate real-world sensors and integrate 3D object detection algorithms to closely replicate FCO detections. Additionally, we introduce a neural network-based emulation technique that effectively approximates the results of high-fidelity co-simulations. This approach captures the unique characteristics of FCO detections while offering a fast and scalable solution for modeling. Using this emulation method, we investigate the impact of FCO data in a digital twin of a traffic network modeled in SUMO. Results demonstrate that even at a 20% penetration rate, FCOs using LiDAR-based detections can identify 65% of vehicles across various intersections and traffic demand scenarios. Further potential emerges when temporal insights are integrated, enabling the recovery of previously detected but currently unseen vehicles. By employing data-driven methods, we recover over 80% of these vehicles with minimal positional deviations. These findings underscore the potential of FCOs for ITS, particularly in enhancing traffic state estimation and monitoring under varying penetration rates and traffic conditions.</description>

      <title>Allocation of Heterogeneous Resources in General Lotto Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The allocation of resources plays an important role in the completion of system objectives and tasks, especially in the presence of strategic adversaries. Optimal allocation strategies are becoming increasingly more complex, given that multiple heterogeneous types of resources are at a system planner's disposal. In this paper, we focus on deriving optimal strategies for the allocation of heterogeneous resources in a well-known competitive resource allocation model known as the General Lotto game. In standard formulations, outcomes are determined solely by the players' allocation strategies of a common, single type of resource across multiple contests. In particular, a player wins a contest if it sends more resources than the opponent. Here, we propose a multi-resource extension where the winner of a contest is now determined not only by the amount of resources allocated, but also by the composition of resource types that are allocated. We completely characterize the equilibrium payoffs and strategies for two distinct formulations. The first consists of a weakest-link/best-shot winning rule, and the second considers a winning rule based on a weighted linear combination of the allocated resources. We then consider a scenario where the resource types are costly to purchase, and derive the players' equilibrium investments in each of the resource types.</description>

      <title>Computing in Integrated Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of Internet-of-things (IoT) devices, smart vehicles, and other connected objects is driving demand for ubiquitous connectivity and intensive computing capacity. 5G and upcoming 6G networks are crucial to meeting these demands and the fast-evolving services and applications. However, traditional terrestrial networks face limitations in coverage and capacity. Integrated Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks (ITNTN) are emerging to address these challenges. In essence, ITNTN combines ground-based infrastructure with aerial, space, and water surface networks to provide seamless connectivity and computing resources anytime, anywhere. Given the stringent quality-of-service (QoS) of future services, edge computing will be an inseparable component of ITNTN. Consequently, we dive in this survey into current efforts of integrating cloud/fog/edge computing into ITNTN layers to facilitate stringent QoS services and address the data processing needs of modern applications. Since there have been only limited and partial efforts in integrating computing functionalities within ITNTN, we aim to extend the discussion to the full integration of computing and identifying the challenges and future research directions to achieve it.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear quadratic-output systems by multivariate rational interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal approximation of linear dynamical systems with quadratic-output functions, also known as linear quadratic-output systems. Our major contributions are threefold. First, we derive interpolation-based first-order optimality conditions for the linear quadratic-output $\mathcal{H}_2$ minimization problem. These conditions correspond to the mixed-multipoint tangential interpolation of the full-order linear- and quadratic-output transfer functions, and generalize the Meier-Luenberger optimality framework for the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear time-invariant systems. Second, given the interpolation data, we show how to enforce these mixed-multipoint tangential interpolation conditions explicitly by Petrov-Galerkin projection of the full-order model matrices. Third, to find the optimal interpolation data, we build on this projection framework and propose a generalization of the iterative rational Krylov algorithm for the $\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal model reduction of linear quadratic-output systems, called LQO-IRKA. Upon convergence, LQO-IRKA produces a reduced linear quadratic-output system that satisfies the interpolatory optimality conditions. The method only requires solving shifted linear systems and matrix-vector products, thus making it suitable for large-scale problems. Numerical examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Coevolution of Actions and Opinions in Networks of Coordinating and Anti-Coordinating Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of coordinating and anti-coordinating agents in a coevolutionary model for actions and opinions. In the model, the individuals of a population interact on a two-layer network, sharing their opinions and observing others' action, while revising their own opinions and actions according to a game-theoretic mechanism, grounded in the social psychology literature. First, we consider the scenario of coordinating agents, where convergence to a Nash equilibrium (NE) is guaranteed. We identify conditions for reaching consensus configurations and establish regions of attraction for these equilibria. Second, we study networks of anti-coordinating agents. In this second scenario, we prove that all trajectories converge to a NE by leveraging potential game theory. Then, we establish analytical conditions on the network structure and model parameters to guarantee the existence of consensus and polarized equilibria, characterizing their regions of attraction.</description>

      <title>Enabling Robots to Autonomously Search Dynamic Cluttered Post-Disaster Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robots will bring search and rescue (SaR) in disaster response to another level, in case they can autonomously take over dangerous SaR tasks from humans. A main challenge for autonomous SaR robots is to safely navigate in cluttered environments with uncertainties, while avoiding static and moving obstacles. We propose an integrated control framework for SaR robots in dynamic, uncertain environments, including a computationally efficient heuristic motion planning system that provides a nominal (assuming there are no uncertainties) collision-free trajectory for SaR robots and a robust motion tracking system that steers the robot to track this reference trajectory, taking into account the impact of uncertainties. The control architecture guarantees a balanced trade-off among various SaR objectives, while handling the hard constraints, including safety. The results of various computer-based simulations, presented in this paper, showed significant out-performance (of up to 42.3%) of the proposed integrated control architecture compared to two commonly used state-of-the-art methods (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree and Artificial Potential Function) in reaching targets (e.g., trapped victims in SaR) safely, collision-free, and in the shortest possible time.</description>

      <title>Thermal-LiDAR Fusion for Robust Tunnel Localization in GNSS-Denied and Low-Visibility Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite significant progress in autonomous navigation, a critical gap remains in ensuring reliable localization in hazardous environments such as tunnels, urban disaster zones, and underground structures. Tunnels present a uniquely difficult scenario: they are not only prone to GNSS signal loss, but also provide little features for visual localization due to their repetitive walls and poor lighting. These conditions degrade conventional vision-based and LiDAR-based systems, which rely on distinguishable environmental features. To address this, we propose a novel sensor fusion framework that integrates a thermal camera with a LiDAR to enable robust localization in tunnels and other perceptually degraded environments. The thermal camera provides resilience in low-light or smoke conditions, while the LiDAR delivers precise depth perception and structural awareness. By combining these sensors, our framework ensures continuous and accurate localization across diverse and dynamic environments. We use an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) to fuse multi-sensor inputs, and leverages visual odometry and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) techniques to process the sensor data, enabling robust motion estimation and mapping even in GNSS-denied environments. This fusion of sensor modalities not only enhances system resilience but also provides a scalable solution for cyber-physical systems in connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). To validate the framework, we conduct tests in a tunnel environment, simulating sensor degradation and visibility challenges. The results demonstrate that our method sustains accurate localization where standard approaches deteriorate due to the tunnels featureless geometry. The frameworks versatility makes it a promising solution for autonomous vehicles, inspection robots, and other cyber-physical systems operating in constrained, perceptually poor environments.</description>

Abstract: Learning-enabled planning and control algorithms are increasingly popular, but they often lack rigorous guarantees of performance or safety. We introduce an algorithm for computing underapproximate backward reachable sets of nonlinear discrete time neural feedback loops. We then use the backward reachable sets to check goal-reaching properties. Our algorithm is based on overapproximating the system dynamics function to enable computation of underapproximate backward reachable sets through solutions of mixed-integer linear programs. We rigorously analyze the soundness of our algorithm and demonstrate it on a numerical example. Our work expands the class of properties that can be verified for learning-enabled systems.</description>

      <title>Frenet Corridor Planner: An Optimal Local Path Planning Framework for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the requirements for effectiveness and efficiency, path-speed decomposition-based trajectory planning methods have widely been adopted for autonomous driving applications. While a global route can be pre-computed offline, real-time generation of adaptive local paths remains crucial. Therefore, we present the Frenet Corridor Planner (FCP), an optimization-based local path planning strategy for autonomous driving that ensures smooth and safe navigation around obstacles. Modeling the vehicles as safety-augmented bounding boxes and pedestrians as convex hulls in the Frenet space, our approach defines a drivable corridor by determining the appropriate deviation side for static obstacles. Thereafter, a modified space-domain bicycle kinematics model enables path optimization for smoothness, boundary clearance, and dynamic obstacle risk minimization. The optimized path is then passed to a speed planner to generate the final trajectory. We validate FCP through extensive simulations and real-world hardware experiments, demonstrating its efficiency and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Policy Gradient Adaptive Control for the LQR: Indirect and Direct Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances of reinforcement learning and direct data-driven control, we propose policy gradient adaptive control (PGAC) for the linear quadratic regulator (LQR), which uses online closed-loop data to improve the control policy while maintaining stability. Our method adaptively updates the policy in feedback by descending the gradient of the LQR cost and is categorized as indirect, when gradients are computed via an estimated model, versus direct, when gradients are derived from data using sample covariance parameterization. Beyond the vanilla gradient, we also showcase the merits of the natural gradient and Gauss-Newton methods for the policy update. Notably, natural gradient descent bridges the indirect and direct PGAC, and the Gauss-Newton method of the indirect PGAC leads to an adaptive version of the celebrated Hewer's algorithm. To account for the uncertainty from noise, we propose a regularization method for both indirect and direct PGAC. For all the considered PGAC approaches, we show closed-loop stability and convergence of the policy to the optimal LQR gain. Simulations validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the robustness and computational efficiency of PGAC.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we focus on a class of decentralized constraint-coupled optimization problem: $\min_{x_i \in \mathbb{R}^{d_i}, i \in \mathcal{I}; y \in \mathbb{R}^p}$ $\sum_{i=1}^n\left(f_i(x_i) + g_i(x_i)\right) + h(y) \ \text{s.t.} \ \sum_{i=1}^{n}A_ix_i = y$, over an undirected and connected network of $n$ agents. Here, $f_i$, $g_i$, and $A_i$ represent private information of agent $i \in \mathcal{I} = \{1, \cdots, n\}$, while $h$ is public for all agents. Building on a novel dual$^2$ approach, we develop two accelerated algorithms for solving this problem: the inexact Dual$^2$ Accelerated (iD2A) gradient method and the Multi-consensus inexact Dual$^2$ Accelerated (MiD2A) gradient method. We demonstrate that both iD2A and MiD2A can guarantee asymptotic convergence under a milder condition on $h$ compared to existing algorithms. Furthermore, linear convergence is established under additional assumptions. By employing specialized saddle-point subproblem solvers, iD2A and MiD2A attain significantly lower communication and computational complexities than existing algorithms across various scenarios. Finally, we conduct several numerical experiments to validate our theoretical results and to showcase the superior performance of iD2A and MiD2A in practice.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Aggregate Flexibility of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations for Market-based Congestion Management Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) play a crucial role in the transition towards sustainable modes of transportation and thus are critical to the energy transition. As their number grows, managing the aggregate power of EV charging is crucial to maintain grid stability and mitigate congestion. This study analyses more than 500 thousand real charging transactions in the Netherlands to explore the challenge and opportunity for the energy system presented by EV growth and smart charging flexibility. Specifically, it analyses the collective ability to provide congestion management services according to the specifications of those services in the Netherlands. In this study, a data-driven model of charging behaviour is created to explore the implications of delivering dependable congestion management services at various aggregation levels and types of service. The probabilistic ability to offer different flexibility products, namely, redispatch and capacity limitation, for congestion management, is assessed for different categories of charging stations (CS) and dispatch strategies. These probabilities can help EV aggregators, such as charging point operators, make informed decisions about offering congestion mitigation products per relevant regulations and distribution system operators to assess their potential. Further, it is shown how machine learning models can be incorporated to predict the day-ahead consumption, followed by operationally predicting redispatch flexibility. The findings demonstrate that the timing of EV arrivals, departures, and connections plays a crucial role in determining the feasibility of product offerings, and dependable services can generally be delivered using a sufficiently large number of CSs.</description>

      <title>TTT: A Temporal Refinement Heuristic for Tenuously Tractable Discrete Time Reachability Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14394v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reachable set computation is an important tool for analyzing control systems. Simulating a control system can show general trends, but a formal tool like reachability analysis can provide guarantees of correctness. Reachability analysis for complex control systems, e.g., with nonlinear dynamics and/or a neural network controller, is often either slow or overly conservative. To address these challenges, much literature has focused on spatial refinement, i.e., tuning the discretization of the input sets and intermediate reachable sets. This paper introduces the idea of temporal refinement: automatically choosing when along the horizon of the reachability problem to execute slow symbolic queries which incur less approximation error versus fast concrete queries which incur more approximation error. Temporal refinement can be combined with other refinement approaches as an additional tool to trade off tractability and tightness in approximate reachable set computation. We introduce a temporal refinement algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness at computing approximate reachable sets for nonlinear systems with neural network controllers. We calculate reachable sets with varying computational budget and show that our algorithm can generate approximate reachable sets with a similar amount of error to the baseline in 20-70% less time.</description>

      <title>The statistical spread of transmission outages on a fast protection time scale based on utility data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When there is a fault, the protection system automatically removes one or more transmission lines on a fast time scale of less than one minute. The outaged lines form a pattern in the transmission network. We extract these patterns from utility outage data, determine some key statistics of these patterns, and then show how to generate new patterns consistent with these statistics. The generated patterns provide a new and easily feasible way to model the overall effect of the protection system at the scale of a large transmission system. This new generative modeling of protection is expected to contribute to simulations of disturbances in large grids so that they can better quantify the risk of blackouts. Analysis of the pattern sizes suggests an index that describes how much outages spread in the transmission network at the fast timescale.</description>

      <title>Linear Model of Aggregated Homogeneous Energy Storage Elements with Realizable Dispatch Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04508v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To optimize the dispatch of batteries, a model is required that can predict the state of charge (SOC) trajectory for a chosen open-loop power schedule to ensure admissibility (i.e., that schedule can be realized). However, battery dispatch optimization is inherently challenging since batteries cannot simultaneously charge and discharge, which begets a non-convex complementarity constraint. In this paper, we develop a novel composition of energy storage elements that can charge or discharge independently and provide a sufficient linear energy storage model of the composite battery. This permits convex optimization of the composite battery SOC trajectory while guaranteeing admissibility of the resulting (aggregated) power schedule and its disaggregation to the individual energy storage elements.</description>

      <title>A Decision-Focused Predict-then-Bid Framework for Strategic Energy Storage</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel decision-focused framework for energy storage arbitrage bidding. Inspired by the bidding process for energy storage in electricity markets, we propose a predict-then-bid end-to-end method incorporating the storage arbitrage optimization and market clearing models. This is achieved through a tri-layer framework that combines a price prediction layer with a two-stage optimization problem: an energy storage optimization layer and a market-clearing optimization layer. We leverage the implicit function theorem for gradient computation in the first optimization layer and incorporate a perturbation-based approach into the decision-focused loss function to ensure differentiability in the market-clearing layer. Numerical experiments using electricity market data from New York demonstrate that our bidding design substantially outperforms existing methods, achieving the highest profits and showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Trust and Resilience in Distributed Consensus for Cyberphysical Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.05464v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work considers the problem of resilient consensus where stochastic values of trust between agents are available. Specifically, we derive a unified mathematical framework to characterize convergence, deviation of the consensus from the true consensus value, and expected convergence rate, when there exists additional information of trust between agents. We show that under certain conditions on the stochastic trust values and consensus protocol: 1) almost sure convergence to a common limit value is possible even when malicious agents constitute more than half of the network connectivity, 2) the deviation of the converged limit, from the case where there is no attack, i.e., the true consensus value, can be bounded with probability that approaches 1 exponentially, and 3) correct classification of malicious and legitimate agents can be attained in finite time almost surely. Further, the expected convergence rate decays exponentially as a function of the quality of the trust observations between agents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transport systems on networks are crucial in various applications, but face a significant risk of being adversely affected by unforeseen circumstances such as disasters. The application of entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT) on graph structures has been investigated to enhance the robustness of transport on such networks. In this study, we propose an imitation-regularized OT (I-OT) that mathematically incorporates prior knowledge into the robustness of OT. This method is expected to enhance interpretability by integrating human insights into robustness and to accelerate practical applications. Furthermore, we mathematically verify the robustness of I-OT and discuss how these robustness properties relate to real-world applications. The effectiveness of this method is validated through a logistics simulation using automotive parts data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18251v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method for mobile robot navigation in dynamic, unknown environments, leveraging onboard sensing and distributionally robust optimization to impose probabilistic safety constraints. Our method introduces a distributionally robust control barrier function (DR-CBF) that directly integrates noisy sensor measurements and state estimates to define safety constraints. This approach is applicable to a wide range of control-affine dynamics, generalizable to robots with complex geometries, and capable of operating at real-time control frequencies. Coupled with a control Lyapunov function (CLF) for path following, the proposed CLF-DR-CBF control synthesis method achieves safe, robust, and efficient navigation in challenging environments. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach for safe autonomous navigation under uncertainty in simulations and real-world experiments with differential-drive robots.</description>

      <title>AI-Aided Kalman Filters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12289v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kalman filter (KF) and its variants are among the most celebrated algorithms in signal processing. These methods are used for state estimation of dynamic systems by relying on mathematical representations in the form of simple state-space (SS) models, which may be crude and inaccurate descriptions of the underlying dynamics. Emerging data-centric artificial intelligence (AI) techniques tackle these tasks using deep neural networks (DNNs), which are model-agnostic. Recent developments illustrate the possibility of fusing DNNs with classic Kalman-type filtering, obtaining systems that learn to track in partially known dynamics. This article provides a tutorial-style overview of design approaches for incorporating AI in aiding KF-type algorithms. We review both generic and dedicated DNN architectures suitable for state estimation, and provide a systematic presentation of techniques for fusing AI tools with KFs and for leveraging partial SS modeling and data, categorizing design approaches into task-oriented and SS model-oriented. The usefulness of each approach in preserving the individual strengths of model-based KFs and data-driven DNNs is investigated in a qualitative and quantitative study, whose code is publicly available, illustrating the gains of hybrid model-based/data-driven designs. We also discuss existing challenges and future research directions that arise from fusing AI and Kalman-type algorithms.</description>

      <title>Reward-Based Collision-Free Algorithm for Trajectory Planning of Autonomous Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel mission planning algorithm for autonomous robots that selects an optimal waypoint sequence from a predefined set to maximize total reward while satisfying obstacle avoidance, state, input, derivative, mission time, and distance constraints. The formulation extends the prize-collecting traveling salesman problem. A tailored genetic algorithm evolves candidate solutions using a fitness function, crossover, and mutation, with constraint enforcement via a penalty method. Differential flatness and clothoid curves are employed to penalize infeasible trajectories efficiently, while the Euler spiral method ensures curvature-continuous trajectories with bounded curvature, enhancing dynamic feasibility and mitigating oscillations typical of minimum-jerk and snap parameterizations. Due to the discrete variable length optimization space, crossover is performed using a dynamic time-warping-based method and extended convex combination with projection. The algorithm's performance is validated through simulations and experiments with a ground vehicle, quadrotor, and quadruped, supported by benchmarking and time-complexity analysis.</description>

      <title>CalibRefine: Deep Learning-Based Online Automatic Targetless LiDAR-Camera Calibration with Iterative and Attention-Driven Post-Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17648v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate multi-sensor calibration is essential for deploying robust perception systems in applications such as autonomous driving and intelligent transportation. Existing LiDAR-camera calibration methods often rely on manually placed targets, preliminary parameter estimates, or intensive data preprocessing, limiting their scalability and adaptability in real-world settings. In this work, we propose a fully automatic, targetless, and online calibration framework, CalibRefine, which directly processes raw LiDAR point clouds and camera images. Our approach is divided into four stages: (1) a Common Feature Discriminator that leverages relative spatial positions, visual appearance embeddings, and semantic class cues to identify and generate reliable LiDAR-camera correspondences, (2) a coarse homography-based calibration that uses the matched feature correspondences to estimate an initial transformation between the LiDAR and camera frames, serving as the foundation for further refinement, (3) an iterative refinement to incrementally improve alignment as additional data frames become available, and (4) an attention-based refinement that addresses non-planar distortions by leveraging a Vision Transformer and cross-attention mechanisms. Extensive experiments on two urban traffic datasets demonstrate that CalibRefine achieves high-precision calibration with minimal human input, outperforming state-of-the-art targetless methods and matching or surpassing manually tuned baselines. Our results show that robust object-level feature matching, combined with iterative refinement and self-supervised attention-based refinement, enables reliable sensor alignment in complex real-world conditions without ground-truth matrices or elaborate preprocessing.

      <title>Neural Configuration-Space Barriers for Manipulation Planning and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planning and control for high-dimensional robot manipulators in cluttered, dynamic environments require both computational efficiency and robust safety guarantees. Inspired by recent advances in learning configuration-space distance functions (CDFs) as robot body representations, we propose a unified framework for motion planning and control that formulates safety constraints as CDF barriers. A CDF barrier approximates the local free configuration space, substantially reducing the number of collision-checking operations during motion planning. However, learning a CDF barrier with a neural network and relying on online sensor observations introduce uncertainties that must be considered during control synthesis. To address this, we develop a distributionally robust CDF barrier formulation for control that explicitly accounts for modeling errors and sensor noise without assuming a known underlying distribution. Simulations and hardware experiments on a 6-DoF xArm manipulator show that our neural CDF barrier formulation enables efficient planning and robust real-time safe control in cluttered and dynamic environments, relying only on onboard point-cloud observations.</description>
