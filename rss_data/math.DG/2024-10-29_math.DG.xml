      <title>A characterization of the Legendre involution on the class of generic frontals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, under an additional mild assumption, on the class of generic frontals, any involution whose fixed point set is exactly the same as the fixed point set of the Legendre involution must be the Legendre involution (Theorem 2 in \S 1). Moreover, its natural complexification (Corollary 1 in \S 3) is simultaneously shown.</description>

      <title>T-dual branes on hyperk\"ahler manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This submission is a PhD dissertation. Kapustin and Witten conjectured that there is a mirror symmetry relation between the hyperk\"ahler structures on certain Higgs bundle moduli spaces. As a consequence, they conjecture an equivalence between categories of BBB and BAA-branes. At the classical level, this mirror symmetry is given by T-duality between semi-flat hyperk\"ahler structures on algebraic integrable systems. In this thesis, we investigate the T-duality relation between hyperk\"ahler structures and the corresponding branes on affine torus bundles. We use the techniques of generalized geometry to show that semi-flat hyperk\"ahler structures are T-dual on algebraic integrable systems. We also describe T-duality for generalized branes. Motivated by Fourier-Mukai transform we upgrade the T-duality between generalized branes to T-duality of submanifolds endowed with U(1)-bundles and connections. This T-duality in the appropriate context specializes to T-duality between BBB and BAA-branes.</description>

      <title>Nijenhuis operators on homogeneous spaces related to $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a unital non-simple $C^*$-algebra $\mathcal A$ we consider its Banach--Lie group $G$ of invertible elements. For a given closed ideal $\mathfrak k$ in $\mathcal A$, we consider the embedded Banach--Lie subgroup $K$ of $G$ of elements differing from the unit element by an element in $\mathfrak k$. We study vector bundle maps of the tangent space of the homogeneous space $G/K$, induced by an admissible bounded operator on $\mathcal A$. In particular, we discuss when this vector bundle map is a Nijenhuis operator in $G/K$. The special case of almost complex structures in $G/K$ is also addressed. Examples for particular classes of $C^*$-algebras are presented, including the Toeplitz algebra and crossed products by $\mathbb Z$.</description>

      <title>Microscopic stability thresholds and constant scalar curvature K\"{a}hler metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we directly prove that if the limit of microscopic stability thresholds introduced by Berman for a polarized manifold satisfies some condition, then there exists a unique constant scalar curvature K\"{a}hler metric. This is an analogue of K.Zhang's result which is proved by the delta-invariant introduced by Fujita-Odaka. This work is motivated by Berman's result which shows that if a Fano manifold is uniformly Gibbs stable, then there exists a unique K\"{a}hler-Einstein metric, without uniform K-stability. We also give some sufficient conditions of the existence of a constant scalar curvature K\"{a}hler cone metric.</description>

      <title>Singularity formations in Lagrangian mean curvature flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study singularities along the Lagrangian mean curvature flow with tangent flows given by multiplicity one special Lagrangian cones that are smooth away from the origin. Some results are: uniqueness of all such tangent flows in dimension two; uniqueness in any dimension when the link of the cone is connected; the existence of nontrivial special Lagrangian blowup limits. We also prove a singular version of Imagi-Joyce-dos Santos's uniqueness result of the Lawlor neck. As an application we prove that in any dimension, singularities that admit a tangent flow given by the union of two transverse planes is modeled on shrinking Lawlor necks at suitable scales.</description>

      <title>Blowing up Chern-Ricci flat balanced metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact Chern-Ricci flat balanced orbifold, we show that its blow-up at a finite family of smooth points admits constant Chern scalar curvature balanced metrics, extending Arezzo-Pacard's construction to the balanced setting. Moreover, if the orbifold has isolated singularities and admits crepant resolutions, we show that they always carry Chern-Ricci flat balanced metrics, without any further hypothesis. In addition, we discuss the general constant Chern scalar curvature balanced case and discuss another version of the main Theorem assuming the existence of a special (n-2, n-2)-form. We also present several classes of examples in which our results can be applied.</description>

Abstract: We prove vanishing results for Witten genera of string generalized complete intersections in homogeneous $\text{Spin}^c$-manifolds and in other $\text{Spin}^c$-manifolds with Lie group actions. By applying these results to Fano manifolds with second Betti number equal to one we get new evidence for a conjecture of Stolz.</description>

      <title>Partially hyperbolic geodesic flow via conformal deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new construction of non-Anosov Partially Hyperbolic Geodesic flows. Our construction is closely related to the construction made by Carneiro and Pujals, the novelty is the use of conformal deformations to produce the examples. Some of the necessary conditions appear more naturally and are easier to check. Besides that, we could enumerate the conditions required to produce partially hyperbolic geodesic flow examples. We show how to produce examples with metrics that are non-positively curved and with a finner analysis we can prove ergodicity for the Liouville measure and uniqueness of the measure of maximal entropy. These examples lie on the boundary of Anosov metrics, allowing us to also produce metrics with partially hyperbolic geodesic flows and conjugate points.</description>

      <title>Local bi-integrability of bi-Hamiltonian systems, Part II: Real smooth case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that any bi-Hamiltonian system $v = \left(\mathcal{A} + \lambda \mathcal{B}\right)dH_{\lambda}$ on a real smooth manifold that is Hamiltonian with respect all Poisson brackets $\left(\mathcal{A} + \lambda \mathcal{B}\right)$ is locally bi-integrable. We construct a complete set of functions $\mathcal{G}$ in bi-involution by extending the set of standard integrals $\mathcal{F}$ consisting of Casimir functions of Poisson brackets, eigenvalues of the Poisson pencil, and the Hamiltonians. Moreover, we show that at a generic point of $M$ differentials of the extended family $d \mathcal{G}$ can realize any bi-Lagrangian subspace $L$ containing the differentials of the standard integrals $d \mathcal{F}$.</description>

      <title>Graphs with positive Lin-Lu-Yau curvature without Quadrilateral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The definition of Ricci curvature on graphs given in Lin-Lu-Yau, Tohoku Math., 2011, which is a variation of Ollivier, J. Funct. Math., 2009. Recently, a powerful limit-free formulation of Lin-Lu-Yau curvature using graph Laplacian was given in M\"{u}nch-Wojciechowski, Adv. Math., 2019. Let $F_k$ be the friendship graph obtained from $k$ triangles by sharing a common vertex and $T$ be the graph obtained from a triangle and $K_{1,3}$ by adding a matching between every leave of $K_{1,3}$ and a vertex of the triangle. In this paper, we classify all of connected $C_4$-free graphs with positive LLY curvature for minimum degree at least 2: the cycles $C_3,C_5$, the friendship graphs $F_2,F_3$ and $T$.</description>

      <title>A $C^{*}$-Algebraic Approach To Principal Symbol Calculus On Filtered Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the viewpoint of $*$-homomorphism on $C^{*}$-algebras, we establish the principal symbol mapping for filtered manifolds which are locally isomorphic to stratified Lie groups. Let $\mathbb{G}$ be a stratified Lie group, and let $M$ be a filtered manifold with a $\mathbb{G}$-atlas and a smooth positive density $\nu$. For the $C^{*}$-algebra bundle $E_{hom}$ of $M$ constructed from quasi-Riesz transforms on $\mathbb{G}$, we show that there exists a surjective $*$-homomorphism $${\rm sym}_{M}:\Pi_{M}\to C_{b}(E_{hom})$$ such that $${\rm ker}({\rm sym}_{M})=\mathcal{K}(L_{2}(M,\nu))\subset \Pi_{M}$$ where the domain $\Pi_{M}\subset\mathcal{B}(L_{2}(M,\nu))$ is a $C^{*}$-algebra and $C_{b}(E_{hom})$ is the $C^{*}$-algebra of bounded continuous sections of $E_{hom}$. Especially, we do not make any assumptions on the lattice of the osculating group of $M$ and the assumption of compactness on manifolds in \cite{DAO3,DAO4} is dispensed of.</description>

      <title>Piecewise geodesic Jordan curves II: Loewner energy, projective structures, and accessory parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a Jordan curve on the Riemann sphere passing through $n \ge 3$ given points. We show that in each relative isotopy class of such curves, there exists a unique curve that minimizes the Loewner energy. These curves have the property that each arc between two consecutive points is a hyperbolic geodesic in the domain bounded by the other arcs. This geodesic property lets us define a complex projective structure on the punctured sphere. We show that its associated quadratic differential has simple poles, whose residues (accessory parameters) are given by the Wirtinger derivatives of the minimal Loewner energy, a result resembling Polyakov's conjecture for the Fuchsian projective structure that was later proven by Takhtajan and Zograf. Finally, we show that the projective structures we obtain are related to the Fuchsian projective structures via a $\pi$-grafting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2203.07166v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each odd $n \geq 3$, we construct a closed convex hypersurface of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ that contains a non-degenerate closed geodesic with Morse index zero. A classical theorem of J. L. Synge would forbid such constructions for even $n$, so in a sense we prove that Synge's theorem is "sharp." We also construct stable figure-eights: that is, for each $n \geq 3$ we embed the figure-eight graph in a closed convex hypersurface of $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, such that sufficiently small variations of the embedding either preserve its image or must increase its length. These index-zero geodesics and stable figure-eights are mainly derived by constructing explicit billiard trajectories with "controlled parallel transport" in convex polytopes.</description>

Abstract: We construct two different families of properly Alexandrov-immersed surfaces in $\mathbb{H}^2\times \mathbb{R}$ with constant mean curvature $0&lt;H\leq \frac 1 2$, genus one and $k\geq2$ ends ($k=2$ only for one of these families). These ends are asymptotic to vertical $H$-cylinders for $0&lt;H&lt;\frac 1 2$. This shows that there is not a Schoen-type theorem for immersed surfaces with positive constant mean curvature in $\mathbb{H}^2\times\mathbb{R}$. These surfaces are obtained by means of a conjugate construction.</description>

      <title>Static manifolds with boundary: Their geometry and some uniqueness theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Static manifolds with boundary were recently introduced to mathematics. This kind of manifolds appears naturally in the prescribed scalar curvature problem on manifolds with boundary, when the mean curvature of the boundary is also prescribed. They are also interesting from the point of view of General Relativity. For example, the (time-slice of the) photon sphere on the Riemannian Schwarzschild manifold splits it into static manifolds with boundary. In this paper we prove a number of theorems, which relate the topology and geometry of a given static manifold with boundary to some properties of the zero-level set of its potential (such as connectedness and closedness). Also, we characterize the round ball in the Euclidean 3-space with standard potential as the only scalar-flat static manifold with mean-convex boundary, whose zero-level set of the potential has Morse index one. This result follows from a general isoperimetric inequality for 3-dimensional static manifolds with boundary, whose zero-level set of the potential has Morse index one. Finally, we prove some uniqueness theorem for the domains bounded by the photon sphere on the Riemannian Schwarzschild manifold.</description>

      <title>A CMC existence result for expanding cosmological spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a new CMC (constant mean curvature) existence result for cosmological spacetimes, i.e., globally hyperbolic spacetimes with compact Cauchy surfaces satisfying the strong energy condition. If the spacetime contains an expanding Cauchy surface and is future timelike geodesically complete, then the spacetime contains a CMC Cauchy surface. This result settles, under certain circumstances, a conjecture of the authors and a conjecture of Dilts and Holst. Our proof relies on the construction of barriers in the support sense, and the CMC Cauchy surface is found as the asymptotic limit of mean curvature flow. Analogous results are also obtained in the case of a positive cosmological constant $\Lambda &gt; 0$. Lastly, we include some comments concerning the future causal boundary for cosmological spacetimes which pertain to the CMC conjecture of the authors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in the deformation theory of Calabi-Yau varieties $Y$ with canonical singularities has highlighted the key role played by the higher Du Bois and higher rational singularities, and especially by the so-called $k$-liminal singularities for $k\ge 1$. The goal of this paper is to show that certain aspects of this study extend naturally to the $0$-liminal case as well, i.e. to Calabi-Yau varieties $Y$ with Gorenstein log canonical, but not canonical, singularities. In particular, we show the existence of first order smoothings of $Y$ in the case of isolated $0$-liminal hypersurface singularities, and extend Namikawa's unobstructedness theorem for deformations of singular Calabi-Yau threefolds $Y$ with canonical singularities to the case where $Y$ has an isolated $0$-liminal lci singularity under suitable hypotheses. Finally, we describe an interesting series of examples.</description>

      <title>Equivalence between Geometric Frequency and Lagrange Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper shows the equivalence between the geometric frequency of an electric quantity, namely, voltage and current, and the Lagrange derivative of a stream-line of a fluid. The geometric frequency is a concept recently proposed by the author and is a generalization of the instantaneous frequency, a quantity that is particularly important for the analysis and the control of electric power systems. On the other hand, the Lagrange derivative is mostly utilized in fluid dynamics and helps decomposing the time derivative into various components. The paper shows how these components relate to the elements of the geometric frequency. The paper also shows, through a variety of numerical examples, how the decomposition of the Lagrange derivative helps identifying the distortion of the waveform of a measured electric quantity and how this information can be utilized to classify system operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Estimates on the Laplace Operator in Heat Flows of Harmonic Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20419v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate estimates about the Laplace operator in heat flows of harmonic maps, focusing outside the singularities through spherical coordinates. These estimates can be used in the general Ericksen--Leslie system to obtain higher-order estimates. We consider the problem subject to the $\mathbb{T}^2$ and $\mathbb{T}^3$ boundary conditions.</description>
