      <title>Drawdowns, Drawups, and Occupation Times under General Markov Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drawdown risk, an important metric in financial risk management, poses significant computational challenges due to its highly path-dependent nature. This paper proposes a unified framework for computing five important drawdown quantities introduced in Landriault et al. (2015) and Zhang (2015) under general Markov models. We first establish linear systems and develop efficient algorithms for such problems under continuous-time Markov chains (CTMCs), and then establish their theoretical convergence to target quantities under general Markov models. Notably, the proposed algorithms for most quantities achieve the same complexity order as those for path-independent problems: cubic in the number of CTMC states for general Markov models and linear when applied to diffusion models. Rigorous convergence analysis is conducted under weak regularity conditions, and extensive numerical experiments validate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Markovian projections for functionals of It\^o semimartingales with jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given an It\^o semimartingale $X$, its Markovian projection is an It\^o semimartingale $\widehat{X}$, with Markovian differential characteristics, that matches the one-dimensional marginal laws of $X$. One may even require certain functionals of the two processes to have the same fixed-time marginals, at the cost of enhancing the differential characteristics of $\widehat{X}$ but still in a Markovian sense. In the continuous case, the definitive result on existence of Markovian projections was obtained by Brunick and Shreve~\cite{MR3098443}. In this paper, we extend their result to the fully general setting of It\^o semimartingales with jumps.</description>

      <title>Learning to optimize convex risk measures: The cases of utility-based shortfall risk and optimized certainty equivalent risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problems of estimation and optimization of two popular convex risk measures: utility-based shortfall risk (UBSR) and Optimized Certainty Equivalent (OCE) risk. We extend these risk measures to cover possibly unbounded random variables. We cover prominent risk measures like the entropic risk, expectile risk, monotone mean-variance risk, Value-at-Risk, and Conditional Value-at-Risk as few special cases of either the UBSR or the OCE risk. In the context of estimation, we derive non-asymptotic bounds on the mean absolute error (MAE) and mean-squared error (MSE) of the classical sample average approximation (SAA) estimators of both, the UBSR and the OCE. Next, in the context of optimization, we derive expressions for the UBSR gradient and the OCE gradient under a smooth parameterization. Utilizing these expressions, we propose gradient estimators for both, the UBSR and the OCE. We use the SAA estimator of UBSR in both these gradient estimators, and derive non-asymptotic bounds on MAE and MSE for the proposed gradient estimation schemes. We incorporate the aforementioned gradient estimators into a stochastic gradient (SG) algorithm for optimization. Finally, we derive non-asymptotic bounds that quantify the rate of convergence of our SG algorithm for the optimization of the UBSR and the OCE risk measure.</description>

      <title>Finding the nonnegative minimal solutions of Cauchy PDEs in a volatility-stabilized market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13558v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The strong relative arbitrage problem in Stochastic Portfolio Theory seeks an investment strategy that almost surely outperforms a benchmark portfolio at the end of a given time horizon. The highest relative return in relative arbitrage opportunities is characterized by the smallest nonnegative continuous solution of a Cauchy problem for a partial differential equation (PDE). However, solving this type of PDE poses analytical and numerical challenges, due to the high dimensionality and its non-unique solutions. In this paper, we discuss numerical methods to address the relative arbitrage problem and the associated PDE in a volatility-stabilized market, using time-changed Bessel bridges. We present a practical algorithm and demonstrate numerical results through an example in volatility-stabilized markets.</description>
