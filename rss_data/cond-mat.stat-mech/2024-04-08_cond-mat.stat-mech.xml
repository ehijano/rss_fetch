      <title>Dynamical heterogeneity and large deviations in the open quantum East glass model from tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the non-equilibrium dynamics of the dissipative quantum East model via numerical tensor networks. We use matrix product states to represent evolution under quantum-jump unravellings for sizes beyond those accessible to exact diagonalisation. This allows us to demonstrate that dynamical heterogeneity accompanies slow relaxation, in analogy with what is seen in classical glassy systems. Furthermore, using variational matrix product operators we: (i) compute the spectral gap of the Lindbladian, and show that glassiness is enhanced in the presence of weak quantum fluctuations compared to the pure classical case, and (ii) obtain the dynamical large deviations by calculating the leading eigenvector of the tilted Lindbladian, and find clear evidence for a first-order active-inactive dynamical phase transition. We also show how to directly sample the rare quantum trajectories associated to the large deviations.</description>

      <title>Learning to control non-equilibrium dynamics using local imperfect gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard approaches to controlling dynamical systems involve biologically implausible steps such as backpropagation of errors or intermediate model-based system representations. Recent advances in machine learning have shown that "imperfect" feedback of errors during training can yield test performance that is similar to using full backpropagated errors, provided that the two error signals are at least somewhat aligned. Inspired by such methods, we introduce an iterative, spatiotemporally local protocol to learn driving forces and control non-equilibrium dynamical systems using imperfect feedback signals. We present numerical experiments and theoretical justification for several examples. For systems in conservative force fields that are driven by external time-dependent protocols, our update rules resemble a dynamical version of contrastive divergence. We appeal to linear response theory to establish that our imperfect update rules are locally convergent for these conservative systems. For systems evolving under non-conservative dynamics, we derive a new theoretical result that makes possible the control of non-equilibrium steady-state probabilities through simple local update rules. Finally, we show that similar local update rules can also solve dynamical control problems for non-conservative systems, and we illustrate this in the non-trivial example of active nematics. Our updates allow learning spatiotemporal activity fields that pull topological defects along desired trajectories in the active nematic fluid. These imperfect feedback methods are information efficient and in principle biologically plausible, and they can help extend recent methods of decentralized training for physical materials into dynamical settings.</description>

      <title>The statistical mechanics and machine learning of the $\alpha$-R\'enyi ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the statistical physics of the classical Ising model in the so-called $\alpha$-R\'enyi ensemble, a finite-temperature thermal state approximation that minimizes a modified free energy based on the $\alpha$-R\'enyi entropy. We begin by characterizing its critical behavior in mean-field theory in different regimes of the R\'enyi index $\alpha$. Next, we re-introduce correlations and consider the model in one and two dimensions, presenting an exact analysis of the former and devising an unconventional Monte Carlo approach to the study of the latter. Remarkably, we find that while mean-field predicts a continuous phase transition below a threshold index value of $\alpha \sim 1.303$ and a first-order transition above it, the Monte Carlo results in two dimensions point to a continuous transition at all $\alpha$. We conclude by performing a variational minimization of the $\alpha$-R\'enyi free energy using a recurrent neural network (RNN) ansatz where we find that the RNN performs well in two dimensions when compared to the Monte Carlo simulations. Our work highlights the potential opportunities and limitations associated with the use of the $\alpha$-R\'enyi ensemble formalism in probing the thermodynamic equilibrium properties of classical and quantum systems.</description>

      <title>An Insight of Heart-Like Systems with Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the signal percolation through heart-like biological system. Starting from an initial distribution of Waiting and Inactive cells with probabilities $p$ and $(1-p)$ respectively the signal propagation is observed in terms of Active cells. As the signal enters the system from one end, the number of arrival of Active sites at the other end is studied and analysis of the system behaviour is made by varying a few important parameters of the system like $p_{switch}$ (switching probability from Inactive to Waiting) and $p_{act}$ (switching probability from Waiting to active). In this connection, the non-regular heart rhythms are discussed. Fraction of percolating paths through the system is studied and showed a transition from $0$ to $1$ near $p=p_c$. Some other important quantities like tortuosity and cluster distribution are discussed and corresponding exponents have been found.</description>

      <title>Rare events, time crystals and symmetry-breaking dynamical phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this PhD thesis, I investigate the properties of symmetry-breaking dynamical phase transitions that manifest in the fluctuations of time-integrated observables within classical systems. In particular, I analyze how these phase transitions impose stringent constraints on the structure of the eigenvectors of the system dynamical generator of the dynamics. Additionally, I identify a dynamical phase transition to a time-crystal phase in a model of driven-diffusive lattice gas. The study of this transition then allows the identification of the "packing-field" mechanism responsible for its emergence. This mechanism is then exploited to propose new transport models displaying time-crystal behavior.</description>

      <title>Markovian description of a wide class of feedback-controlled systems: Application to the feedback flashing ratchet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In feedback-controlled systems, an external agent -- the feedback controller -- measures the state of the system and modifies its subsequent dynamics depending on the outcome of the measurement. In this paper, we build a Markovian description for the joint stochastic process that comprises both the system and the controller variables. This Markovian description is valid for a wide class of feedback-controlled systems, allowing for the inclusion of errors in the measurement. The general framework is motivated and illustrated with the paradigmatic example of the feedback flashing ratchet.</description>

      <title>Aging following a zero-temperature quench in the $d=3$ Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aging in phase-ordering kinetics of the $d=3$ Ising model following a quench from infinite to zero temperature is studied by means of Monte Carlo simulations. In this model the two-time spin-spin autocorrelator $C_\text{ag}$ is expected to obey dynamical scaling and to follow asymptotically a power-law decay with the autocorrelation exponent $\lambda$. Previous work indicated that the lower Fisher-Huse bound of $\lambda\geq d/2 = 1.5$ is violated in this model. Using much larger systems than previously studied, the instantaneous exponent for $\lambda$ we obtain at late times does \emph{not} disagree with this bound. By conducting systematic fits to the data of $C_\text{ag}$ using different ansaetze for the leading correction term, we find $\lambda = 1.58(14)$ with most of error attributed to the systematic uncertainty regarding the ansaetze. This result is in contrast to the recent report that below the roughening transition universality might be violated.</description>

      <title>Computing macroscopic reaction rates in reaction-diffusion systems using Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction-diffusion models are employed to represent many complex physical, biological, societal, and ecological systems. The macroscopic reaction rates describing the large-scale kinetics in such systems are effective, scale-dependent parameters that need to be either measured experimentally or computed using a microscopic model. In a Monte Carlo simulation of stochastic reaction-diffusion systems, microscopic probabilities for specific events to happen serve as the input control parameters. Finding the functional dependence of emergent macroscopic rates on the microscopic probabilities is a difficult problem, and there is no systematic analytical way to achieve this goal. Therefore, we introduce a straightforward numerical method of using Monte Carlo simulations to evaluate the macroscopic reaction rates by directly obtaining the count statistics of how many events occur per simulation time step. Our technique is first tested on well-understood fundamental examples, namely restricted birth processes, diffusion-limited two-particle coagulation, and two-species pair annihilation kinetics. Next we utilize the thus gained experience to investigate how the microscopic algorithmic probabilities become coarse-grained into effective macroscopic rates in more complex model systems such as the Lotka--Volterra model for predator-prey competition and coexistence, as well as the rock-paper-scissors or cyclic Lotka--Volterra model as well as its May--Leonard variant that capture population dynamics with cyclic dominance motifs. Thereby we achieve a deeper understanding of coarse-graining in spatially extended stochastic reaction systems and the nontrivial relationships between the associated microscopic and macroscopic model parameters. The proposed technique should generally provide a useful means to better fit Monte Carlo simulation results to experimental or observational data.</description>

      <title>Free Energy Calculations using Smooth Basin Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The efficiency of atomic simulations of materials and molecules can rapidly deteriorate when large free energy barriers exist between local minima. We propose smooth basin classification, a universal method to define reaction coordinates based on the internal feature representation of a graph neural network. We achieve high data efficiency by exploiting their built-in symmetry and adopting a transfer learning strategy. We benchmark our approach on challenging chemical and physical transformations, and show that it matches and even outperforms reaction coordinates defined based on human intuition.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of the Normal Distribution in Deterministic Chaotic Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Central Limit Theorem states that, in the limit of a large number of terms, an appropriately scaled sum of independent random variables yields another random variable whose probability distribution tends to a stable distribution. The condition of independence, however, only holds in real systems as an approximation. To extend the theorem to more general situations, previous studies have derived a version of the Central Limit Theorem that also holds for variables that are not independent. Here, we present numerical results that characterize how convergence is attained when the variables being summed are deterministically related to one another by the recurrent application of an ergodic mapping. In all the explored cases, the convergence to the limit distribution is slower than for random sampling. Yet, the speed at which convergence is attained varies substantially from system to system, and these variations imply differences in the way information about the deterministic nature of the dynamics is progressively lost as the number of summands increases. Some of the identified factors in shaping the convergence process are the strength of mixing induced by the mapping and the shape of the marginal distribution of each variable, most particularly, the presence of divergences or fat tails.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Parisi-Sourlas approach to supersymmetry implies that, in spacetime dimensions greater than 1, there is a constraint on the minimal number of flavors, in order for a field theory to define a closed system. In particular, this number is greater than 1. This does not preclude that supersymmetry can be broken, however, and the known ways of breaking supersymmetry can be taken into account from this point of view, by using the so-called Nicolai map. This procedure is well-defined for abelian gauge theories and corresponds to the construction of the so-called trivializing maps for non-abelian gauge theories, that is, still, work in progress.</description>

      <title>Thermal Area Law in Long-Range Interacting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The area law of the bipartite information measure characterizes one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics. In thermal equilibrium, the area law for the mutual information universally holds at arbitrary temperatures as long as the systems have short-range interactions. In systems with power-law decaying interactions, $r^{-\alpha}$ ($r$: distance), conditions for the thermal area law are elusive. In this work, we aim to clarify the optimal condition $\alpha&gt; \alpha_c$ such that the thermal area law universally holds. A standard approach to considering the conditions is to focus on the magnitude of the boundary interaction between two subsystems. However, we find here that the thermal area law is more robust than this conventional argument suggests. We show the optimal threshold for the thermal area law by $\alpha_c= (D+1)/2$ ($D$: the spatial dimension of the lattice), assuming a power-law decay of the clustering for the bipartite correlations. Remarkably, this condition encompasses even the thermodynamically unstable regimes $\alpha &lt; D$. We verify this condition numerically, finding that it is qualitatively accurate for both integrable and non-integrable systems. Unconditional proof of the thermal area law is possible by developing the power-law clustering theorem for $\alpha &gt; D$ above a threshold temperature. Furthermore, the numerical calculation for the logarithmic negativity shows that the same criterion $\alpha &gt; (D+1)/2$ applies to the thermal area law for quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Interplay of network structure and talent configuration on wealth dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The economic success of individuals is often determined by a combination of talent, luck, and assistance from others. We introduce a new agent-based model that simultaneously considers talent, luck, and social interaction. This model allows us to explore how network structure (how agents interact) and talent distribution among agents affect the dynamics of capital accumulation through analytical and numerical methods. We identify a phenomenon as "talent configuration effect", which refers to the influence of how talent is allocated to individuals (nodes) in the network. We analyze this effect through two key properties: talent assortativity (TA) and talent-degree correlation (TD). In particular, we focus on three economic indicators: growth rate ($n_{\rm rate}$), Gini coefficient (inequality: $n_{\rm Gini}$), and meritocratic fairness ($n_{LT}$). This investigation helps us understand the interplay between talent configuration and network structure on capital dynamics. We find that, in the short term, positive correlations exist between TA and TD for all three economic indicators. Furthermore, the dominant factor influencing capital dynamics depends on the network topology. In scale free networks, TD has a stronger influence on the economic indices than TA. Conversely, in lattice-like networks, TA plays a more significant role. Our findings intuitively explain why highly talented agents are more likely to become central hubs in the network and why social connections tend to form between individuals with similar talent levels (socioeconomic homophily).</description>

      <title>Nightclub bar dynamics: statistics of serving times</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the statistical properties of drink serving in a nightclub bar, utilizing a stochastic model to characterize pedestrian dynamics within the venue. Our model comprises a system of n agents moving across an underlying square lattice of size l representing the nightclub venue. Each agent can exist in one of three states: thirsty, served, or dancing. The dynamics governing the state changes are influenced by a memory time, denoted as {\tau}, which reflects their drinking habits. Agents' movement throughout the lattice is controlled by a parameter {\alpha} which measures the impetus towards/away from the bar. When {\alpha} = 0, a power-law distribution emerges due to the non-objectivity of the agents. As {\alpha} moves into intermediate values, an exponential behavior is observed, as it becomes possible to mitigate the drastic jamming effects in this scenario. However, for higher {\alpha} values, the power-law distribution resurfaces due to increased jamming. We also demonstrate that the average concentration of served, thirsty, and dancing agents provide a reliable indicator of when the system reaches a jammed state. Subsequently, we construct a comprehensive map of the system's stationary state, supporting the idea that for high densities, {\alpha} is not relevant, but for lower densities, the optimal values of measurements occurs at high values of {\alpha}. To complete the analysis, we evaluate the conditional persistence, which measures the probability of an agent failing to receive their drink despite attempting to do so. In addition to contributing to the field of pedestrian dynamics, the present results serve as valuable indicators to assist commercial establishments in providing better services to their clients, tailored to the average drinking habits of their customers.</description>

      <title>Zeno physics of the Ising chain with symmetry-breaking boundary dephasing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In few-qubit systems, the quantum Zeno effect arises when measurement occurs sufficiently frequently that the spins are unable to relax between measurements. This can compete with Hamiltonian terms, resulting in interesting relaxation processes which depend non-monotonically on the ratio of measurement rate to coherent oscillations. While Zeno physics for a single qubit is well-understood, an interesting open question is how the Zeno effect is modified by coupling the measured spin to a non-trivial bulk. In this work, we study the effect of coupling a one-dimensional transverse field Ising to a Zeno spin which lives at the boundary. We find that sharp singularities occur in the boundary relaxation dynamics, which can be tied to the emergence or destruction of edge modes that can be found analytically. Finally, we provide numerical evidence that the dynamical singularities are stable in the presence of integrability-breaking interactions.</description>

Abstract: We present a framework to integrate tensor network (TN) methods with reinforcement learning (RL) for solving dynamical optimisation tasks. We consider the RL actor-critic method, a model-free approach for solving RL problems, and introduce TNs as the approximators for its policy and value functions. Our "actor-critic with tensor networks" (ACTeN) method is especially well suited to problems with large and factorisable state and action spaces. As an illustration of the applicability of ACTeN we solve the exponentially hard task of sampling rare trajectories in two paradigmatic stochastic models, the East model of glasses and the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP), the latter being particularly challenging to other methods due to the absence of detailed balance. With substantial potential for further integration with the vast array of existing RL methods, the approach introduced here is promising both for applications in physics and to multi-agent RL problems more generally.</description>

Abstract: Heat engines and information engines have each historically served as motivating examples for the development of thermodynamics. While these two types of systems are typically thought of as two separate kinds of machines, recent empirical studies of specific systems have hinted at possible connections between the two. Inspired by molecular machines in the cellular environment, which in many cases have separate components in contact with distinct sources of fluctuations, we study bipartite heat engines. We show that a bipartite heat engine can only produce net output work by acting as an information engine. Conversely, information engines can only extract more work than the work consumed to power them if they have access to different sources of fluctuations, i.e., act as heat engines. We illustrate these findings first through an analogy to economics and a cyclically controlled 2D ideal gas. We then explore two analytically tractable model systems in more detail: a Brownian-gyrator heat engine which we show can be reinterpreted as a feedback-cooling information engine, and a quantum-dot information engine which can be reinterpreted as a thermoelectric heat engine. Our results suggest design principles for both heat engines and information engines at the nanoscale, and ultimately imply constraints on how free-energy transduction is carried out in biological molecular machines.</description>

      <title>Fast rare events in exit times distributions of jump processes</title>

Abstract: Rare events in the first-passage distributions of jump processes are capable of triggering anomalous reactions or series of events. Estimating their probability is particularly important when the jump probabilities have broad-tailed distributions, and rare events are therefore not so rare. We formulate a general approach for estimating the contribution of fast rare events to the exit probabilities in the presence of fat tailed distributions. Using this approach, we study three jump processes that are used to model a wide class of phenomena ranging from biology to transport in disordered systems, ecology and finance: discrete time random-walks, L\'evy walks and the L\'evy-Lorentz gas. We determine the exact form of the scaling function for the probability distribution of fast rare events, in which the jump process exits from an interval in a very short time at a large distance opposite to the starting point. In particular, we show that events occurring on time scales orders of magnitude smaller than the typical time scale of the process can make a significant contribution to the exit probability. Our results are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Emergent Gauge Symmetry in Active Brownian Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a two-dimensional system of interacting Active Brownian Particles. Using the Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de Dominicis formalism, we built up the generating functional for correlation functions. We study in detail the hydrodynamic regime with a constant density stationary state. Our findings reveal that, within a small density fluctuations regime, an emergent $U(1)$ gauge symmetry arises, originated from the conservation of fluid vorticity. Consequently, the interaction between the orientational order parameter and density fluctuations can be cast into a gauge theory, where the concept of ``electric charge density" aligns with the local vorticity of the original fluid. We study in detail the case of a microscopic local two-body interaction. We show that, upon integrating out the gauge fields, the stationary states of the rotational degrees of freedom satisfy a non-local Frank free energy for a nematic fluid. We give explicit expressions for the splay and bend elastic constants as a function of the P\'eclet number (${\rm Pe}$) and the diffusion interaction constant ($k_d$).</description>

      <title>Fractionalized Prethermalization in a Driven Quantum Spin Liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10453v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids subject to a periodic drive can display fascinating non-equilibrium heating behavior because of their emergent fractionalized quasi-particles. Here, we investigate a driven Kitaev honeycomb model and examine the dynamics of emergent Majorana matter and $Z_2$ flux excitations. We uncover a distinct two-step heating profile $\textrm{--}$ dubbed fractionalized prethermalization $\textrm{--}$ and a quasi-stationary state with vastly different temperatures for the matter and the flux sectors. We argue that this peculiar prethermalization behavior is a consequence of fractionalization. Furthermore, we discuss an experimentally feasible protocol for preparing a zero-flux initial state of the Kiteav honeycomb model with a low energy density, which can be used to observe fractionalized prethermalization in quantum information processing platforms.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy in excited-state quantum phase transitions of two-level bosonic models and its influence on system dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.16551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Excited-state quantum phase transitions (ESQPTs) strongly influence the spectral properties of collective many-body quantum systems, changing degeneracy patterns in different quantum phases. Level degeneracies, in turn, affect the system's dynamics. We analyze the degeneracy dependence on the size of two-level boson models with a $u(n+1)$ dynamical algebra, where $n$ is the number of collective degrees of freedom. Below the ESQPT critical energy of these models, the energy gap between neighboring levels that belong to different symmetry sectors gets close to zero as the system size increases. We report and explain why this gap goes to zero exponentially for systems with one collective degree of freedom, but algebraically in models with more than one degree of freedom. As a consequence, we show that the infinite-time average of out-of-time-order correlators is an ESQPT order parameter in finite systems with $n=1$, but in systems with $n&gt;1$, this average only works as an order parameter in the mean-field limit.</description>

      <title>Stable developmental patterns of gene expression without morphogen gradients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00537v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gene expression patterns (GEPs) are established by cross-regulating target genes that interpret morphogen gradients. However, as development progresses, morphogen activity is reduced, leaving the emergent GEP without stabilizing positional cues. The GEP then can be deteriorated by the intrinsically noisy biochemical processes acting at the cellular level. However, the established GEPs remain spatio-temporally stable in many biological systems. Here we combine spatial-stochastic simulations with an enhanced sampling method (Non-Stationary Forward Flux Sampling) and a recently developed stability theory to address how spatiotemporal integrity of a GEP is maintained without morphogen gradients. Using a minimal embryo model consisting of spatially coupled biochemical reactor volumes, we study a stripe pattern in which weak cross-repression between nearest neighbor domians alternates with strong repression between next-nearest neighbor domains, inspired by the gap gene system in the Drosophila embryo. We find that fine-tuning of the weak repressive interactions to an optimal level increases temporal stability of GEPs by orders of magnitude, providing stability over developmentally relevant times, without morphogen gradients. The numerically determined optimal parameter regime closely agrees with the predictions of the stability theory. By analizing the dynamics of GEP asymmetry factors, we trace back the pattern stability enhancement to the emergence of a metastable basin and restoring forces that counteract pattern perturbations. The origin of these forces is further explained by the effective model, describing the emergent deterministic dynamics of the system. Altogether, we show that metastable attractors can emerge as a property of stochastic GEPs even without system-wide positional cues, provided that the gene regulatory interactions shaping the pattern are optimally tuned.</description>

      <title>A data-driven framework for dimensionality reduction and causal inference in climate fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven framework to simplify the description of spatiotemporal climate variability into few entities and their causal linkages. Given a high-dimensional climate field, the methodology first reduces its dimensionality into a set of regionally constrained patterns. Time-dependent causal links are then inferred in the interventional sense through the fluctuation-response formalism, as shown in Baldovin et al. (2020). These two steps allow to explore how regional climate variability can influence remote locations. To distinguish between true and spurious responses, we propose a novel analytical null model for the fluctuation-dissipation relation, therefore allowing for uncertainty estimation at a given confidence level. Finally, we select a set of metrics to summarize the results, offering a useful and simplified approach to explore climate dynamics. We showcase the methodology on the monthly sea surface temperature field at global scale. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed framework by studying few individual links as well as "link maps", visualizing the cumulative degree of causation between a given region and the whole system. Finally, each pattern is ranked in terms of its "causal strength", quantifying its relative ability to influence the system's dynamics. We argue that the methodology allows to explore and characterize causal relationships in high-dimensional spatiotemporal fields in a rigorous and interpretable way.</description>

      <title>Phase Diagram and Crossover Phases of Topologically Ordered Graphene Zigzag Nanoribbons: Role of Localization Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04352v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We computed the phase diagram of the zigzag graphene nanoribbons as a function of on-site repulsion, doping, and disorder strength. The topologically ordered phase undergoes topological phase transitions into crossover phases, which are new disordered phases with a nonuniversal topological entanglement entropy with significant variance. The topological order is destroyed by competition between localization effects and on-site repulsion. We found that strong on-site repulsion and/or doping weakens the nonlocal correlations between the opposite zigzag edges. In one of the crossover phases, both $\frac{e^-}{2}$ fractional charges and spin-charge separation were absent; however, charge-transfer correlations between the zigzag edges were possible. Another crossover phase contains $\frac{e^-}{2}$ fractional charges, but no charge transfer correlations. In low-doped zigzag ribbons the interplay between electron localization and on-site repulsion contributes to the spatial separation of quasi-degenerate gap-edge states and protects the charge fractionalization against quantum fluctuations. In all these effects, mixed chiral gap-edge states play an important role. The properties of nontopological strongly disordered and strongly repulsive phases are also observed. Each phase of the phase diagram has a different zigzag-edge structure. Additionally, we investigated the tunneling of solitonic fractional charges under an applied voltage between the zigzag edges of undoped topologically ordered zigzag ribbons, and found that it may lead to a zero-bias tunneling anomaly.</description>

Abstract: We analyze a mean-field model for mixtures involving biaxial nematogens and dipolar nanoparticles, taking into account orientational and isotropic pair interactions between nematogens, but also orientational nematogen-nanoparticle interactions. We determine bulk equilibrium phase diagrams for a wide range of interaction strengths, identifying in each case the effect of the nanoparticles on the stability of nematic phases and on the appearance of multicritical points. Special attention is given to the limit of low concentration of nanoparticles, in which their effect on the temperatures of both the first-order uniaxial-isotropic and the continuous biaxial-uniaxial transitions is investigated in detail.</description>

      <title>Unravelling Metastable Markovian Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14107v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse the dynamics of metastable Markovian open quantum systems by unravelling their average dynamics into stochastic trajectories. We use quantum reset processes as examples to illustrate metastable phenomenology, including a simple three-state model whose metastability is of classical type, and a two-qubit model that features a metastable decoherence free subspace. In the three-state model, the trajectories exhibit classical metastable phenomenology: fast relaxation into distinct phases and slow transitions between them. This extends the existing correspondence between classical and quantum metastability. It enables the computation of committors for the quantum phases, and the mechanisms of rare transitions between them. For the two-qubit model, the decoherence-free subspace appears in the unravelled trajectories as a slow manifold on which the quantum state has a continuous slow evolution. This provides a classical (non-metastable) analogue of this quantum effect. We discuss the general implications of these results, and we highlight the useful role of quantum reset processes for analysis of quantum trajectories in metastable systems.</description>

      <title>On harvesting physical predictions from asymptotically safe quantum field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic safety is a powerful mechanism for obtaining a consistent and predictive quantum field theory beyond the realm of perturbation theory. It hinges on an interacting fixed point of the Wilsonian renormalization group flow which controls the microscopic dynamics. Connecting the fixed point to observations requires constructing the set of effective actions compatible with this microscopic dynamics. Technically, this information is stored in the UV-critical surface of the fixed point. In this work, we describe a novel approach for extracting this information based on analytical and pseudo-spectral methods. Our construction is illustrated at the level of the two-dimensional Ising model and easily generalizes to any asymptotically safe quantum field theory. It also constitutes an important step towards setting up a well-founded swampland program within the gravitational asymptotic safety program.</description>
