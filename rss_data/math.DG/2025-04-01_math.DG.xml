      <title>Lagrangian mean curvature flow of surfaces with mean curvature bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $L_t$ be a zero Maslov Lagrangian mean curvature flow in $\mathbb{C}^2.$ We show that if the mean curvature stays uniformly bounded along the flow, then the tangent flow at a singular point is unique i.e. the limit of the parabolic rescalings does not depend on the chosen sequence of rescalings.</description>

      <title>Gromov-Hausdorff Limits of Aspherical Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact Gromov-Hausdorff limit space of a collapsing sequence of compact $n$-manifolds, $M_i$, of Ricci curvature $\text{Ric}_{M_i}\ge -(n-1)$ and all points in $M_i$ are $(\delta,\rho)$-local rewinding Reifenberg points, or sectional curvature $\text{sec}_{M_i}\ge -1$, respectively. We conjecture that if $M_i$ is an aspherical manifold of fundamental group satisfying a certain condition (e.g., a nilpotent group), then $X$ is a differentiable, or topological aspherical manifold, respectively. A main result in this paper asserts that if $M_i$ a diffeomorphic or homeomorphic to a nilmanifold, then $X$ is diffeomorphic or homeomorphic to a nilmanifold, respectively.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove that a closed minimally immersed hypersurface $M^4\subset\mathbb S^5$ with constant $S:=\sum\limits_{i=1}^4\lambda_i^2$ and $A_3:=\sum\limits_{i=1}^4\lambda_i^3$ whose scalar curvature $R_M$ is nonnegative must be isoparametric. Moreover, $S$ can only be $0, 4,$ and $12.$ That is $M^4$ is either an equatorial $4$-sphere, a clifford torus, or a Cartan's minimal hypersurface.</description>

      <title>Conserved quantities of distinguished curves on conformal sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give conserved quantities of two generalizations of conformal circles on the conformal sphere. One generalization concerns curves carrying a distinguished parallel tractor along them, which can be used to construct the conserved quantities. The other is the class of curves satisfying the conformal Mercator equation, the conserved quantities of which are computed using Lagrangian formalism. The two generalizations are not disjoint, and our main result is the relation between their conserved quantities. Explicit examples are also presented.</description>

      <title>Moduli of special Lagrangians with boundary, I: Unobstructed Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article studies the deformation problem for compact special Lagrangians with boundary in a Calabi--Yau manifold, with each boundary component constrained along a given Lagrangian submanifold. The tangent vectors generating such deformations are identified with harmonic 1-forms vanishing on the boundary of the special Lagrangian, and the deformation generated by any such tangent vector is unobstructed. Consequently the moduli space of special Lagrangians with boundary is a smooth manifold whose dimension equals the dimension of the first relative cohomology of the special Lagrangian.</description>

Abstract: This article continues the study of moduli spaces of special Lagrangians with boundary in a Calabi--Yau manifold. The moduli space was shown to be a smooth finite dimensional manifold in the prequel arXiv:2503.6321918. This article investigates geometric structures on the moduli space of special Lagrangians with boundary and constructs a pair of special affine structures and a Hessian metric on this moduli space.</description>

      <title>Topological consequences of null-geodesic refocusing and applications to $Z^x$ manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(M,h)$ be a connected, complete Riemannian manifold, let $x\in M$ and $l&gt;0$. Then $M$ is called a $Z^x$ manifold if all geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ and it is called a $Y^x_l$ manifold if every unit-speed geodesic starting at $x$ returns to $x$ at time $l$. It is unknown whether there are $Z^x$ manifolds that are not $Y^x_l$-manifolds for some $l&gt;0$. By the B\'erard-Bergery theorem, any $Y^x_l$ manifold of dimension at least $2$ is compact with finite fundamental group. We prove the same result for $Z^x$ manifolds $M$ for which all unit-speed geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ in uniformly bounded time. We also prove that any $Z^x$ manifold $(M,h)$ with $h$ analytic is a $Y^x_l$ manifold for some $l&gt;0$. We start by defining a class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes (called observer-refocusing) such that any $Z^x$ manifold is the Cauchy surface of some observer-refocusing spacetime. We then prove that under suitable conditions the Cauchy surfaces of observer-refocusing spacetimes are compact with finite fundamental group and show that analytic observer-refocusing spacetimes of dimension at least $3$ are strongly refocusing. We end by stating a contact-theoretic conjecture analogous to our results in Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry.</description>

      <title>On a natural L2 metric on the space of Hermitian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23756v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the space of Hermitian metrics on a fixed complex vector bundle. This infinite-dimensional space has appeared in the study of Hermitian-Einstein structures, where a special L2-type Riemannian metric is introduced. We compute the metric spray, geodesics and curvature associated to this metric, and show that the exponential map is a diffeomorphsim. Though being geodesically complete, the space of Hermitian metrics is metrically incomplete, and its metric completion is proved to be the space of L2 integrable singular Hermitian metrics. In addition, both the original space and its completion are CAT(0). In the holomorphic case, it turns out that Griffiths seminegative/semipositive singular Hermitian metric is always L2 integrable in our sense. Also, in the Appendix, the Nash-Moser inverse function theorem is used to prove that, for any L2 metric on the space of smooth sections of a given fiber bundle, the exponential map is always a local diffeomorphism, provided that each fiber is nonpositively curved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that every finite type polarised curve in the conformal $2$-sphere with a polynomial conserved quantity admits a resonance point, under a non-orthogonality assumption on the conserved quantity. Using this fact, we deduce that every finite type curve polarised by space form arc-length in the conformal $2$-sphere admits a resonance point, possibly on a multiple cover.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we give a construction of curvature-adapted hypersurfaces in the product $G_1/K_1\times G_2/K_2$ of (Riemannian) symmetric spaces $G_i/K_i$ ($i=1,2$). By this construction, we obtain many examples of curvature-adapted hypersurfaces in $G_1/K_1\times G_2/K_2$. Also, we calculate the eigenvalues of the shape operator and the normal Jacobi operator of the curvature-adapted hypersurfaces obtained by this construction.</description>

      <title>PhD Thesis: Shifted Contact Structures on Differentiable Stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis focuses on developing "stacky" versions of contact structures, extending the classical notion of contact structures on manifolds. A fruitful approach is to study contact structures using line bundle-valued $1$-forms. Specifically, we introduce the notions of $0$ and $+1$-shifted contact structures on Lie groupoids. To define the kernel of a line bundle-valued $1$-form $\theta$ on a Lie groupoid, we draw inspiration from the concept of the homotopy kernel in Homological Algebra. That kernel is essentially given by a representation up to homotopy (RUTH). Similarly, the curvature is described by a specific RUTH morphism. Both the definitions are motivated by the Symplectic-to-Contact Dictionary, which establishes a relationship between Symplectic and Contact Geometry. Examples of $0$-shifted contact structures can be found in contact structures on orbifolds, while examples of $+1$-shifted contact structures include the prequantization of $+1$-shifted symplectic structures and the integration of Dirac-Jacobi structures.</description>

      <title>On gradient $\rho$-Einstein solitons with Bach tensor radially nonnegative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study $n$-dimensional gradient $\rho$-Einstein solitons whose Bach tensor is radially nonnegative. Under this assumption, we show that such $\rho$-Einstein solitons are locally warped products of an interval and an Einstein manifold, provided either $\rho\neq0$ or $\rho=0$ and the soliton is rectifiable. We obtain as a consequence that these solitons must have harmonic Weyl tensor and vanishing Bach tensor. We also finish the classification of complete locally conformally flat steady $\rho$-Einstein solitons and classify these manifolds when their Bach tensor is radially nonnegative and $n\in\{3,4\}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complexes and cohomology, traditionally central to topology, have emerged as fundamental tools across applied mathematics and the sciences. This survey explores their roles in diverse areas, from partial differential equations and continuum mechanics to reformulations of the Einstein equations and network theory. Motivated by advances in compatible and structure-preserving discretisation such as Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC), we examine how differential complexes encode critical properties such as existence, uniqueness, stability and rigidity of solutions to differential equations. We demonstrate that various fundamental concepts and models in solid and fluid mechanics are essentially formulated in terms of differential complexes.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian approach for PDE constrained shape optimization over the diffeomorphism group using outer metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the use of outer metrics, in particular Sobolev-type metrics on the diffeomorphism group in the context of PDE-constrained shape optimization. Leveraging the structure of the diffeomorphism group we analyze the connection between the push-forward of a smooth function defined on the diffeomorphism group and the classical shape derivative as an Eulerian semi-derivative. We consider in particular, two predominant examples on PDE-constrained shape optimization. An electric impedance tomography inspired problem, and the optimization of a two-dimensional bridge. These problems are numerically solved using the Riemannian steepest descent method where the descent directions are taken to be the Riemannian gradients associated to various outer metrics. For comparison reasons, we also solve the problem using other previously proposed Riemannian metrics in particular the Steklov-Poincar\'e metric.</description>

Abstract: Given two Riemannian manifolds $M$ and $N\subset\mathbb{R}^L$, we consider the energy concentration phenomena of the penalized energy functional $$E_{\epsilon}(u)=\int_M\frac{\vert\nabla u\vert^2}{2}+\frac{F(u)}{\epsilon^2},u\in W^{1,2}(M,\mathbb{R}^L),$$ where $F(x)$=dist$(x,N)$ in a small tubular neighborhood of $N$ and is constant away from $N$. It was shown by Chen-Struwe that as $\epsilon\rightarrow0$, the critical points $u_{\epsilon}$ of $E_{\epsilon}$ with energy bound $E_{\epsilon}(u_{\epsilon})\leqslant\Lambda$ subsequentially converge weakly in $W^{1,2}$ to a weak harmonic map $u:M\rightarrow N$ . In addition, we have the convergence of the energy density $$\left(\frac{\vert\nabla u_{\epsilon}\vert^2}{2}+\frac{F(u_{\epsilon})}{\epsilon^2}\right)dx\rightarrow\frac{\vert\nabla u_{\epsilon}\vert^2}{2}dx+\nu,$$ and the defect measure $\nu$ above is $(dimM-2)$-rectifiable. Lin-Wang showed that if $N$ is a sphere or dim$M$=2, then the density of $\nu$ can be expressed by the sum of energies of harmonic spheres. In this paper, we prove this result for an arbitrary $M$ using the idea introduced by Naber-Valtorta.</description>

      <title>The holonomy Lie $\infty$-groupoid of a singular foliation I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a finite-dimensional higher Lie groupoid integrating a singular foliation $\mathcal F$, under the mild assumption that the latter admits a geometric resolution. More precisely, a recursive use of bi-submersions, a tool coming from non-commutative geometry and invented by Androulidakis and Skandalis, allows us to integrate any universal Lie $\infty$-algebroid of a singular foliation to a Kan simplicial manifold, where all components are made of non-connected manifolds which are all the same finite dimension that can be chosen to be equal to the ranks of a given geometric resolution. Its 1-truncation is the Androulidakis-Skandalis holonomy groupoid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the goal of solving optimisation problems on non-Riemannian manifolds, such as geometrical surfaces with sharp edges, we develop and prove the convergence of a forward-backward method in Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded both from above and from below. This bilateral boundedness is crucial for the availability of both the gradient and proximal steps, instead of just one or the other. We numerically demonstrate the behaviour of the proposed method on simple geometrical surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24161v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we provide an algebraic characterization of those stratified groups in which boundaries with locally constant normal are locally flat. We show that these groups, which we call hypergenerated, are exactly the stratified groups where embeddings of non-characteristic hypersurfaces are locally bi-Lipschitz. Finally, we extend these results to submanifolds of arbitrary codimension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational instantons with a self-dual Hermitian structure and a non-zero self-dual Weyl tensor have a quasi-locally conserved charge associated to spin-lowering via Killing spinors, and corresponding to a parameter of the moduli space. For any asymptotic structure (e.g. AF/ALF, ALE, compact), we prove that infinitesimal Einstein deformations admit a closed 2-form that measures the perturbation to this charge. In the ALF and compact cases, we furthermore prove that a curve of metrics in the moduli space passing through the background instanton is conformally K\"ahler to second perturbative order.</description>

Abstract: We show that the volume of transcendental big $(1,1)$-classes on compact K\"ahler manifolds can be realized by convex bodies, thus answering questions of Lazarsfeld-Musta\c{t}\u{a} and Deng. In our approach we use an approximation process by partial Okounkov bodies together with properties of the restricted volume, and we study the extension of K\"ahler currents, as well as the bimeromorphic behavior of currents with analytic singularities. We also establish a connection between transcendental Okounkov bodies and toric degenerations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the synthetic geometric setting introduced by Kunzinger and S\"amann, we present an analogue of Toponogov's Globalisation Theorem which applies to Lorentzian length spaces with lower (timelike) curvature bounds. Our approach utilises a "cat's cradle" construction akin to that which appears in several proofs in the metric setting. On the road to our main result, we also provide a lemma regarding the subdivision of triangles in spaces with a local lower curvature bound and a synthetic Lorentzian version of the Lebesgue Number Lemma. Several properties of time functions and the null distance on globally hyperbolic Lorentzian length spaces are also highlighted. We conclude by presenting several applications of our results, including versions of the Bonnet--Myers Theorem and the Splitting Theorem for Lorentzian length spaces with local lower curvature bounds, as well as discussion of stability of curvature bounds under Gromov--Hausdorff convergence.</description>

      <title>On integrable nets in general and concordant Chebyshev nets in particular</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12626v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider general integrable curve nets in Euclidean space as a particular integrable geometry invariant with respect to rigid motions and net-preserving reparameterisations. For the purpose of their description, we first give an overview of the most important second-order invariants and relations among them. As a particular integrable example, we reinterpret the result of I.S. Krasil'shchik and M. Marvan, Coverings and integrability of the Gauss--Mainardi--Codazzi equations, Acta Appl. Math. 56 (1999) 217--230, \S 2, Case 2 as a curve net satisfying an $\mathbb R$-linear relation between the Schief curvature of the net and the Gauss curvature of the supporting surface. In the special case when the curvatures are proportional (concordant nets), we find a correspondence to pairs of pseudospherical surfaces of equal negative constant Gaussian curvatures. Conversely, we also show that two generic pseudospherical surfaces of equal negative constant Gaussian curvatures induce a concordant Chebyshev net. The construction generalises the well-known correspondence between pairs of curves and translation surfaces.</description>

      <title>Entropic curvature not comparable to other curvatures -- or is it?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider global $\theta$-curvatures of finite Markov chains with associated means $\theta$ in the spirit of the entropic curvature (based on the logarithmic mean) by Erbar-Maas and Mielke. As in the case of Bakry-\'Emery curvature, we also allow for a finite dimension parameter by making use of an adapted $\Gamma$ calculus for $\theta$-curvatures. We prove explicit positive lower curvature bounds (both finite- and infinite-dimensional) for finite abelian Cayley graphs. In the case of cycles, we provide also an upper curvature bound which shows that our lower bounds are asymptotically sharp (up to a logarithmic factor). Moreover, we prove new universal lower curvature bounds for finite Markov chains as well as curvature perturbation results (allowing, in particular, to compare entropic and Bakry-\'Emery curvatures). Finally, we present examples where entropic curvature differs significantly from other curvature notions like Bakry-\'Emery curvature or Ollivier Ricci and sectional curvatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any Lie algebroid $A$ admits a Nash-type blow-up $\mathrm{Nash}(A)$ that sits in a nice short exact sequence of Lie algebroids $0\rightarrow K\rightarrow \mathrm{Nash}(A)\rightarrow \mathcal{D}\rightarrow 0$ with $K$ a Lie algebra bundle and $\mathcal{D}$ a Lie algebroid whose anchor map is injective on an open dense subset. The base variety is a blowup determined by the singular foliation of $A$. We provide concrete examples. Moreover, we extend the construction following Mohsen's to singular subalgebroids in the sense of Androulidakis-Zambon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that modeling a Grassmannian as symmetric orthogonal matrices $\operatorname{Gr}(k,\mathbb{R}^n) \cong\{Q \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n} : Q^{\scriptscriptstyle\mathsf{T}} Q = I, \; Q^{\scriptscriptstyle\mathsf{T}} = Q,\; \operatorname{tr}(Q)=2k - n\}$ yields exceedingly simple matrix formulas for various curvatures and curvature-related quantities, both intrinsic and extrinsic. These include Riemann, Ricci, Jacobi, sectional, scalar, mean, principal, and Gaussian curvatures; Schouten, Weyl, Cotton, Bach, Pleba\'nski, cocurvature, nonmetricity, and torsion tensors; first, second, and third fundamental forms; Gauss and Weingarten maps; and upper and lower delta invariants. We will derive explicit, simple expressions for the aforementioned quantities in terms of standard matrix operations that are stably computable with numerical linear algebra. Many of these aforementioned quantities have never before been presented for the Grassmannian.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove lower and upper semi-continuity of the Morse index for sequences of gradient Ricci shrinkers which bubble tree converge in the sense of past work by the author and Buzano. Our proofs rely on adapting recent arguments of Workman which were used to study certain sequences of CMC hypersurfaces and were in turn adapted from work on Da Lio-Gianocca-Riviere. Moreover, we are able to refine Workman's methods by using techniques related to polynomially weighted Sobolev spaces. This all also requires us to extend the analysis to handle when the shrinkers we study are non-compact, which we can do due to the availability of a suitable notion of finite weighted volume. Finally, we identify a technical condition which ensures the Morse index of an asymptotically conical shrinker is bounded below by the f-index of its asymptotic cone.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of causally-null-compactifiable space-times which can be canonically converted into a compact timed-metric-spaces using the cosmological time of Andersson-Howard-Galloway and the null distance of Sormani-Vega. We produce a large class of such space-times including future developments of compact initial data sets and regions which exhaust asymptotically flat space-times. We then present various notions of intrinsic distances between these space-times (introducing the timed-Hausdorff distance) and prove some of these notions of distance are definite in the sense that they equal zero iff there is a time-oriented Lorentzian isometry between the space-times. These definite distances enable us to define various notions of convergence of space-times to limit space-times which are not necessarily smooth. Many open questions and conjectures are included throughout.</description>

Abstract: The tension field of the identity map from a statistical manifold to a Riemannian statistical manifold, which shares the same Riemannian metric, is the Tchevychev vector field multiplied by negative one. We derive a new class of statistical manifolds that satisfy the semi-equiaffine condition based on the statistical biharmonicity of the identity map. Furthermore, we determine the statistical structures of this class, when the pair of the manifold and the Riemannian metric is a simply connected complete Riemannian manifold of constant curvature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14125v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study is motivated by the interest in metric $f$-contact geometry and Ricci-type solitons in theoretical physics and geometry. Weak $f$-structures on a smooth manifold $M^{2n+s}\ (s&gt;1)$ have been introduced by V. Rovenski and R. Wolak as a generalization of $f$-structures $(f,\xi_i,\eta^i,g)$ by K. Yano. In this paper, we introduce a new structure of this kind called the weak $\beta$-Kenmotsu $f$-structure as a generalization of the concept by K. Kenmotsu and explore its properties and geometrical interpretations. We show that a weak $\beta$-Kenmotsu $f$-manifold is locally a twisted product of $\mathbb{R}^s$ and a weak K\"{a}hler manifold. Our main results show that such manifolds with $\beta=const$ and equipped with an $\eta$-Ricci soliton structure whose potential vector field is either a contact vector field or collinear with $\sum_i\xi_i$ are $\eta$-Einstein manifolds of constant scalar curvature.</description>

      <title>Flat Convergence of Pushforwards of Rectifiable Currents Under $C^0-$Diffeomorphism Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article deals with the stability of the pushforward operation on currents with respect to $C^0$ limits of diffeomorphisms on compact Riemannian manifolds. We have established the uniform convergence of pullbacks of smooth forms and weak-* convergence of pushforwards of general currents. The key lemma brings convergence on closed 1-forms for the evaluation of 1-currents. The main theorem shows that the pushforward of rectifiable $k$-currents converges in the flat topology for $C^0$ convergent sequences of diffeomorphisms. We discuss implications in symplectic, cosymplectic, and contact geometry, making connections with the $C^0$ rigidity of certain geometric structures. We also consider applications to free boundary problems and stochastic currents. These results provide insight into the behavior of geometric objects under non-smooth perturbations, which have relevance in geometric measure theory, dynamical systems, and optimal transport. We highlight various open problems regarding weaker regularity and more involved geometric settings.</description>

      <title>Several isoperimetric inequalities of Dirichlet and Neumann eigenvalues of the Witten-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08075v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, by mainly using the rearrangement technique and suitably constructing trial functions, under the constraint of fixed weighted volume, we can successfully obtain several isoperimetric inequalities for the first and the second Dirichlet eigenvalues, the first nonzero Neumann eigenvalue of the Witten-Laplacian on bounded domains in space forms. These spectral isoperimetric inequalities extend those classical ones (i.e. the Faber-Krahn inequality, the Hong-Krahn-Szeg\H{o} inequality and the Szeg\H{o}-Weinberger inequality) of the Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Quantization and reduction for torsion free CR manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00478v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider a compact torsion free CR manifold $X$ and assume that $X$ admits a compact CR Lie group action $G$. Let $L$ be a $G$-equivariant rigid CR line bundle over $X$. It seems natural to consider the space of $G$-invariant CR sections in the high tensor powers as quantization space, on which a certain weighted $G$-invariant Fourier-Szeg\H{o} operator projects. Under certain natural assumptions, we show that the group invariant Fourier-Szeg\H{o} projector admits a full asymptotic expansion. As an application, if the tensor power of the line bundle is large enough, we prove that quantization commutes with reduction.</description>

      <title>The hot spots conjecture on Riemannian manifolds with isothermal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the hot spots conjecture on Riemannian manifolds with isothermal coordinates and analytic metrics, such as hyperbolic spaces $\mathbb{D}^n$ and spheres $S^n$ for $n\geq 2$. We prove that for some (possibly non-convex) Lipschitz domains in such a Riemannian manifold, which are generalizations of lip domains and symmetric domains with two axes of symmetry in $\mathbb{R}^2$, the hot spot conjecture holds.</description>

      <title>Global Geometry within an SPDE Well-Posedness Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On a closed Riemannian manifold, we construct a family of intrinsic Gaussian noises indexed by a regularity parameter $\alpha\geq0$ to study the well-posedness of the parabolic Anderson model. We show that with rough initial conditions, the equation is well-posed assuming non-positive curvature with a condition on $\alpha$ similar to that of Riesz kernel-correlated noise in Euclidean space. Non-positive curvature was used to overcome a new difficulty introduced by non-uniqueness of geodesics in this setting, which required exploration of global geometry. The well-posedness argument also produces exponentially growing in time upper bounds for the moments. Using Feynman-Kac formula for moments, we also obtain exponentially growing in time second moment lower bounds for our solutions with bounded initial condition.</description>

      <title>On the intertwining differential operators between vector bundles over the real projective space of dimension two</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22323v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is twofold. One is to classify and construct $SL(3,\mathbb{R})$-intertwining differential operators between vector bundles over the real projective space $\mathbb{RP}^2$. It turns out that two kinds of operators appear. We call them Cartan operators and PRV operators. The second objective is then to study the representations realized on the kernel of those operators both in the smooth and holomorphic setting. A key machinery is the BGG resolution. In particular, by exploiting some results of Davidson-Enright-Stanke and Enright-Joseph, the irreducible unitary highest weight modules of $SU(1,2)$ at the (first) reduction points are classified by the image of Cartan operators and kernel of PRV operators.</description>
