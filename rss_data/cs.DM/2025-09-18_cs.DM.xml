      <title>Hyper-Zagreb Indices of Hypergraphs with Application in Drug Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}$ be a hypergraph on the non-empty finite vertex set $V(\mathcal{H})$ with the hyperedge set $E(\mathcal{H})$, where each hyperedge $e \in E(\mathcal{H})$ is a subset of $V(\mathcal{H})$ with at least two vertices. This paper introduces the first and second Hyper-Zagreb indices for hypergraphs, extending these well-known graph indices to hypergraphs. We discuss bounds on these indices for general hypergraphs, weak bipartite hypergraphs, hypertrees, $k$-uniform hypergraphs, $k$-uniform weak bipartite hypergraphs, and $k$-uniform hypertrees, characterizing the extremal hypergraphs that achieve these bounds. Additionally, we present a novel application of these indices in drug design and bioactivity prediction, demonstrating their utility in quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling.</description>

      <title>4-uniform Maker-Breaker and Maker-Maker games are PSPACE-complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13819v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study two positional games where two players take turns picking a previously unpicked vertex of a hypergraph $H$. We say a player fills an edge of $H$ if that player has picked all the vertices of that edge. In the Maker-Maker game, whoever first fills an edge wins, or we get a draw if no edge is filled. In the Maker-Breaker game, the first player aims at filling an edge while the second player aims at preventing the first player from filling an edge. We show that, for both games, deciding whether the first player has a winning strategy is a PSPACE-complete problem even when restricted to 4-uniform hypergraphs. For the Maker-Maker game, this improves on a previous result for hypergraphs of rank 4. For the Maker-Breaker game, this improves on a previous result for 5-uniform hypergraphs, and closes the complexity gap as the problem for hypergraphs of rank 3 is known to be solvable in polynomial time.</description>

      <title>Gremban Expansion for Signed Networks: Algebraic and Combinatorial Foundations for Community-Faction Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article deals with the characterization and detection of community and faction structures in signed networks. We approach the study of these mesoscale structures through the lens of the Gremban expansion. This graph operation lifts a signed graph to a larger unsigned graph, and allows the extension of standard techniques from unsigned to signed graphs. We develop the combinatorial and algebraic properties of the Gremban expansion, with a focus on its inherent involutive symmetry. The main technical result is a bijective correspondence between symmetry-respecting cut-sets in the Gremban expansion, and regular cut-sets and frustration sets in the signed graph (i.e., the combinatorial structures that underlie communities and factions respectively). This result forms the basis for our new approach to community-faction detection in signed networks, which makes use of spectral clustering techniques that naturally respect the required symmetries. We demonstrate how this approach distinguishes the two mesoscale structures, how to generalize the approach to multi-way clustering and discuss connections to network dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Curvature as a tool for evaluating dimensionality reduction and estimating intrinsic dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing recently developed abstract notions of sectional curvature, we introduce a method for constructing a curvature-based geometric profile of discrete metric spaces. The curvature concept that we use here captures the metric relations between triples of points and other points. More significantly, based on this curvature profile, we introduce a quantitative measure to evaluate the effectiveness of data representations, such as those produced by dimensionality reduction techniques. Furthermore, Our experiments demonstrate that this curvature-based analysis can be employed to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality of datasets. We use this to explore the large-scale geometry of empirical networks and to evaluate the effectiveness of dimensionality reduction techniques.</description>

      <title>Smaller Circuits for Bit Addition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bit addition arises virtually everywhere in digital circuits: arithmetic operations, increment/decrement operators, computing addresses and table indices, and so on. Since bit addition is such a basic task in Boolean circuit synthesis, a lot of research has been done on constructing efficient circuits for various special cases of it. A vast majority of these results are devoted to optimizing the circuit depth (also known as delay).
  In this paper, we investigate the circuit size (also known as area) over the full binary basis of bit addition. Though most of the known circuits are built from Half Adders and Full Adders, we show that, in many interesting scenarios, these circuits have suboptimal size. Namely, we improve an upper bound $5n-3m$ to $4.5n-2m$, where $n$ is the number of input bits and $m$ is the number of output bits. In the regimes where $m$ is small compared to $n$ (for example, for computing the sum of $n$ bits or multiplying two $n$-bit integers), this leads to $10\%$ improvement.
  We complement our theoretical result by an open-source implementation of generators producing circuits for bit addition and multiplication. The generators allow one to produce the corresponding circuits in two lines of code and to compare them to existing designs.</description>

      <title>The lonely runner conjecture holds for eight runners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the lonely runner conjecture holds for eight runners. Our proof relies on a computer verification and on recent results that allow bounding the size of a minimal counterexample. We note that our approach also applies to the known cases with 4, 5, 6, and 7 runners. We expect that minor improvements to our approach could be enough to solve the cases of 9 or 10 runners.</description>

      <title>Spectral Independence and Local-to-Global Techniques for Optimal Mixing of Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13826v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This monograph is an exposition on an exciting new technique known as spectral independence, which has been instrumental in analyzing the convergence rate of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. For a high-dimensional distribution defined on labelings of the vertices of an n-vertex graph, the spectral independence condition, introduced by Anari, Liu, and Oveis Gharan (2020), is a bound on the maximum eigenvalue of the nxn influence matrix whose entries capture the influence between pairs of vertices (closely related to the covariance between the variables). In the first part of the monograph, we present results showing that spectral independence (and related techniques) imply fast mixing of simple Markov chains such as the Gibbs sampler. These proofs utilize local-to-global theorems which we will detail in this work.
  We focus on two applications: the hard-core model on independent sets of a graph (which is a binary graphical model) and random bases of a matroid. We demonstrate several methods for establishing spectral independence, including the correlation decay approach introduced by Weitz (2006) and the analytic approach introduced by Barvinok (2015) using zero-freeness of the associated complex-valued partition function. As a consequence of the techniques presented in this monograph we obtain fast mixing of the Gibbs sampler on general graphs in the so-called tree-uniqueness region, polynomial-time mixing on general graphs at the critical point for the uniqueness threshold, and polynomial-time mixing on random regular graphs beyond the uniqueness threshold. We also utilize the local-to-global framework of spectral independence and the Trickle-Down theorem of Oppenheim (2018) to prove fast mixing of the bases-exchange walk for generating a random basis of an arbitrary matroid, which was established by Anari, Liu, Oveis Gharan and Vinzant (2019).</description>

      <title>Heuristics for the Run-length Encoded Burrows-Wheeler Transform Alphabet Ordering Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) is a string transformation technique widely used in areas such as bioinformatics and file compression. Many applications combine a run-length encoding (RLE) with the BWT in a way which preserves the ability to query the compressed data efficiently. However, these methods may not take full advantage of the compressibility of the BWT as they do not modify the alphabet ordering for the sorting step embedded in computing the BWT. Indeed, any such alteration of the alphabet ordering can have a considerable impact on the output of the BWT, in particular on the number of runs. For an alphabet $\Sigma$ containing $\sigma$ characters, the space of all alphabet orderings is of size $\sigma!$. While for small alphabets an exhaustive investigation is possible, finding the optimal ordering for larger alphabets is not feasible. Therefore, there is a need for a more informed search strategy than brute-force sampling the entire space, which motivates a new heuristic approach. In this paper, we explore the non-trivial cases for the problem of minimizing the size of a run-length encoded BWT (RLBWT) via selecting a new ordering for the alphabet. We show that random sampling of the space of alphabet orderings usually gives sub-optimal orderings for compression and that a local search strategy can provide a large improvement in relatively few steps. We also inspect a selection of initial alphabet orderings, including ASCII, letter appearance, and letter frequency. While this alphabet ordering problem is computationally hard we demonstrate gain in compressibility.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Algorithm and Faster Algorithm for Submodular Maximization subject to a Matroid Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of maximizing a monotone submodular function subject to a matroid constraint, and present for it a deterministic non-oblivious local search algorithm that has an approximation guarantee of $1 - 1/e - \varepsilon$ (for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$) and query complexity of $\tilde{O}_\varepsilon(nr)$, where $n$ is the size of the ground set and $r$ is the rank of the matroid. Our algorithm vastly improves over the previous state-of-the-art $0.5008$-approximation deterministic algorithm, and in fact, shows that there is no separation between the approximation guarantees that can be obtained by deterministic and randomized algorithms for the problem considered. The query complexity of our algorithm can be improved to $\tilde{O}_\varepsilon(n + r\sqrt{n})$ using randomization, which is nearly-linear for $r = O(\sqrt{n})$, and is always at least as good as the previous state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

      <title>Application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm in Solving the Total Domination Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00364v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in quantum computing have spurred substantial research into the application of quantum algorithms to combinatorial optimization problems. Among these challenges, the Total Domination Problem (TDP) emerges as a classic and critical paradigm in the field. For a graph G(V, E), TDP entails finding a minimal subset D subset of V that contains no isolated vertices, where every vertex not in D has at least one neighbor in D. TDP finds extensive applications across domains such as computer networks, social networks, and communications. Since the latter half of the last century, research efforts have focused on establishing its NP-completeness and developing solution algorithms, which have become foundational to combinatorial mathematics. Despite this rich history, the application of quantum algorithms to TDP remains largely underexplored. In this study, we present a pioneering application of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to tackle TDP, evaluating its efficacy across a diverse set of parameters. This paper proves that the upper bound on the number of qubits required to solve TDP is 2|V| + |V| log_2( (2|E|)/|V| - 1 ). Our experimental findings demonstrate that QAOA is effective in addressing TDP: under most parameter combinations, it successfully computes a valid total dominating set (TDS). However, the algorithm's performance in identifying the optimal TDS is contingent upon specific parameter choices, revealing a significant bias in the distribution of effective parameter points. This research contributes valuable insights into the potential of quantum algorithms for solving TDP and lays a solid groundwork for future investigations in this area.</description>

      <title>Homotopy equivalence of digital pictures in $\mathbb{Z}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03023v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of digital homotopy in the context of digital pictures $(X,\kappa,\bar \kappa)$, where $X\subsetneq \Z^n$ is a finite set, $\kappa$ is an adjacency relation on $X$, and $\bar \kappa$ is an adjacency relation on the complement of $X$. In particular we focus on homotopy equivalence between digital pictures in $\Z^2$. We define a numerical homotopy-type invariant for digital pictures in $\Z^2$ called the outer perimeter, which is a basic tool for distinguishing homotopy types of digital pictures. When a digital picture has no holes, we show that it is homotopy equivalent to its rc-convex hull, obtained by ``filling in the gaps'' of any row or column. We show that a digital picture $(X,c_i,c_j)$ is homotopy equivalent to only finitely many other digital pictures $(Y,c_i,c_j)$. At the end of the paper, we raise a conjecture on the largest digital picture of the same homotopy-type of a given digital picture.</description>

      <title>The Power Contamination Problem on Grids Revisited: Optimality, Combinatorics, and Links to Integer Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a combinatorial study of the power contamination problem, a dynamic variant of power domination modeled on grid graphs. We resolve a conjecture posed by Ainouche and Bouroubi (2021) by proving it is false and instead establish the exact value of the power contamination number on grid graphs. Furthermore, we derive recurrence relations for this number and initiate the enumeration of optimal contamination sets. We prove that the number of optimal solutions for specific grid families corresponds to well-known integer sequences, including those counting ternary words with forbidden subwords and the large Schr\"oder numbers. This work settles the fundamental combinatorial questions of the power contamination problem on grids and reveals its rich connections to classical combinatorics.</description>
