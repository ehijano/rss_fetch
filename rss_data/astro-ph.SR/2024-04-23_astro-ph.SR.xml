      <title>Finding the unusual red giant remnants of cataclysmic variable mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mergers between helium white dwarfs and main-sequence stars are likely common, producing red giant-like remnants making up roughly a few percent of all low-mass ($\lesssim2M_\odot$) red giants. Through detailed modelling, we show that these merger remnants possess distinctive photometric, asteroseismic, and surface abundance signatures through which they may be identified. During hydrogen shell burning, merger remnants reach higher luminosities and possess pulsations which depart from the usual degenerate sequence on the asteroseismic $\Delta\nu$--$\Delta\Pi$ diagram for red giant branch stars. For sufficiently massive helium white dwarfs, merger remnants undergo especially violent helium flashes which can dredge up a large amount of core material (up to $\sim0.1M_\odot$) into the envelope. Such post-dredge-up remnants are more luminous than normal red clump stars, surface carbon-rich, and possess a wider range of asteroseismic g-mode period spacings and mixed-mode couplings. Recently discovered low-mass ($\lesssim0.8M_\odot$) red clump stars may be core helium-burning remnants of mergers involving lower-mass helium white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Impact of main-sequence mass loss on the appearance, structure and evolution of Wolf-Rayet stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar winds are one of the most important drivers of massive star evolution and a vital source of chemical, mechanical, and radiative feedback. Despite its significance, mass loss remains a major uncertainty in stellar evolution models. Particularly the interdependencies of different approaches with subsequent evolutionary stages and predicted observable phenomena are far from being systematically understood. In this study, we examine the impact of main sequence mass loss on the structure of massive stars throughout their evolution. A particular focus is placed on the consequences for entering the Wolf-Rayet (WR) regime and the subsequent evolution. Using the Geneva stellar evolution code, we compute grids of single, non-rotating stellar models at solar and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) metallicity of initial masses between 20 and 120 solar masses, with two representative prescriptions for high and low main sequence mass loss. We obtain detailed numerical predictions regarding the structure and evolution of massive stars, and infer the role of main sequence mass loss by comparison of the mass-loss rate prescriptions. We present implications for the overall evolutionary trajectory, including the evolution of WR stars, as well as the effect on stellar yields and stellar populations. Mass loss during the main sequence plays an important role due to its ability to affect the sequence and duration of all subsequent phases. We identify several distinct evolutionary paths for massive stars which are significantly influenced by the chosen main sequence mass-loss description. We also discuss the impact of uncertainties other than mass loss on the evolution, in particular those relating to convection. We further demonstrate that not just the total mass loss, but the specific mass-loss history throughout a star's life is a crucial determinant of many aspects, such as the resulting stellar yields.</description>

      <title>Formation of low mass protostars and their circumstellar disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The birth process of circumstellar disks remains poorly constrained due to observational and numerical challenges. Recent numerical works have shown that the small-scale physics, often wrapped into a sub-grid model, play a crucial role in disk formation and evolution. This calls for a combined approach in which both the protostar and circumstellar disk are studied in concert. We aim to elucidate the small scale physics and constrain sub-grid parameters commonly chosen in the literature by resolving the star-disk interaction. We carry out a set of very high resolution 3D radiative-hydrodynamics simulations that self-consistently describe the collapse of a turbulent dense molecular cloud core to stellar densities. We study the birth of the protostar, the circumstellar disk, and its early evolution (&lt; 6 yr after protostellar formation). Following the second gravitational collapse, the nascent protostar quickly reaches breakup velocity and sheds its surface material, thus forming a hot ($\sim 10^{3}$ K), dense, and highly flared circumstellar disk. The protostar is embedded within the disk, such that material can flow without crossing any shock fronts. The circumstellar disk mass quickly exceeds that of the protostar, and its kinematics are dominated by self-gravity. Accretion onto the disk is highly anisotropic, and accretion onto the protostar mainly occurs through material that slides on the disk surface. The polar mass flux is negligible in comparison. The radiative behavior also displays a strong anisotropy, as the polar accretion shock is shown to be supercritical whereas its equatorial counterpart is subcritical. We also find a remarkable convergence of our results with respect to initial conditions. These results reveal the structure and kinematics in the smallest spatial scales relevant to protostellar and circumstellar disk evolution.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the disk in the Be binary $\delta$ Scorpii probed during three periastron passages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the evolution of the disk surrounding the Be star in the highly eccentric binary system $\delta$ Scorpii over its three most recent periastron passages. $V$-band and $B-V$ photometry, along with H$\alpha$ spectroscopy are combined with a new set of extensive multi-band polarimetry data to produce a detailed comparison of the disk's physical conditions during the time periods surrounding each closest approach of the secondary star. We use the three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiative transfer code \textsc{HDUST} and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (\textsc{SPH}) code to support our observations with models of disk evolution, discussing the behaviour of the H$\alpha$ and He\,\textsc{i} 6678 lines, $V$-band magnitude, and polarization degree. We compare the characteristics of the disk immediately before each periastron passage to create a baseline for the unperturbed disk. We find that the extent of the H$\alpha$ emitting region increased between each periastron passage, and that transient asymmetries in the disk become more pronounced with each successive encounter. Asymmetries of the H$\alpha$ and He\,\textsc{i} 6678 lines in 2011 indicate that perturbations propagate inward through the disk near periastron. When the disk's direction of orbit is opposite to that of the secondary, the parameters used in our models do not produce spiral density enhancements in the H$\alpha$ emitting region because the tidal interaction time is short due to the relative velocities of the disk particles with the secondary. The effects of the secondary star on the disk are short-lived and the disk shows independent evolution between each periastron event.</description>

      <title>Frequency Dispersed Ion Acoustic Waves in the Near Sun Solar Wind: Signatures of Impulsive Ion Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work reports a novel plasma wave observation in the near-Sun solar wind: frequency-dispersed ion acoustic waves. Similar waves were previously reported in association with interplanetary shocks or planetary bow shocks, but the waves reported here occur throughout the solar wind sunward of $\sim 60$ solar radii, far from any identified shocks. The waves reported here vary their central frequency by factors of 3 to 10 over tens of milliseconds, with frequencies that chirp up or down in time. Using a semi-automated identification algorithm, thousands of wave instances are recorded during each near-Sun orbit of the Parker Solar Probe spacecraft. Wave statistical properties are determined and used to estimate their plasma frame frequency and the energies of protons most likely to be resonant with these waves. Proton velocity distribution functions are explored for one wave interval, and proton enhancements that may be consistent with proton beams are observed. A conclusion from this analysis is that properties of the observed frequency-dispersed ion acoustic waves are consistent with driving by cold, impulsively accelerated proton beams near the ambient proton thermal speed. Based on the large number of observed waves and their properties, it is likely that the impulsive proton beam acceleration mechanism generating these waves is active throughout the inner heliosphere. This may have implications for acceleration of the solar wind.</description>

      <title>Spectropolarimetric Radio Imaging of Faint Gyrosynchrotron Emission from a CME : A Possible Indication of the Insufficiency of Homogeneous Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geo-effectiveness of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is determined primarily by their magnetic fields. Modeling of Gyrosynchrotron (GS) emission is a promising remote sensing technique to measure the CME magnetic field at coronal heights. However, faint GS emission from CME flux ropes is hard to detect in the presence of bright solar emission from the solar corona. With high dynamic-range spectropolarimetric meter wavelength solar images provided by the Murchison Widefield Array, we have detected faint GS emission from a CME out to $\sim 8.3\ R_\odot$, the largest heliocentric distance reported to date. High-fidelity polarimetric calibration also allowed us to robustly detect circularly polarized emission from GS emission. For the first time in literature, Stokes V detection has jointly been used with Stokes I spectra to constrain GS models. One expects that the inclusion of polarimetric measurement will provide tighter constraints on GS model parameters. Instead, we found that homogeneous GS models, which have been used in all prior works, are unable to model both the total intensity and circular polarized emission simultaneously. This strongly suggests the need for using inhomogeneous GS models to robustly estimate the CME magnetic field and plasma parameters.</description>

      <title>Variation in Path Lengths of Turbulent Magnetic Field Lines and Solar Energetic Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling of time profiles of solar energetic particle (SEP) observations often considers transport along a large-scale magnetic field with a fixed path length from the source to the observer. Here we point out that variability in the turbulent field line path length can affect the fits to SEP data and the inferred mean free path and injection profile. To explore such variability, we perform Monte Carlo simulations in representations of homogeneous 2D MHD + slab turbulence adapted to spherical geometry and trace trajectories of field lines and full particle orbits, considering proton injection from a narrow or wide angular region near the Sun, corresponding to an impulsive or gradual solar event, respectively. We analyze our simulation results in terms of field line and particle path length statistics for $1^\circ\times 1^\circ$ pixels in heliolatitude and heliolongitude at 0.35 and 1 AU from the Sun, for different values of the turbulence amplitude $b/B_0$ and turbulence geometry as expressed by the slab fraction $f_s$. Maps of the most probable path lengths of field lines and particles at each pixel exhibit systematic patterns that reflect the fluctuation amplitudes experienced by the field lines, which in turn relate to the local topology of 2D turbulence. We describe the effects of such path length variations on SEP time profiles, both in terms of path length variability at specific locations and motion of the observer with respect to turbulence topology during the course of the observations.</description>

      <title>X-ray detection of astrospheres around three main-sequence stars and their mass-loss rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar winds of cool main sequence stars are very difficult to constrain observationally. One way to measure stellar mass loss rates is to detect soft X-ray emission from stellar astrospheres produced by charge exchange between heavy ions of the stellar wind and cold neutrals of the interstellar medium (ISM) surrounding the stars. Here we report detections of charge-exchange induced X-ray emission from the extended astrospheres of three main sequence stars, 70 Ophiuchi, epsilon Eridani, and 61 Cygni based on analysis of observations by XMM-Newton. We estimate the corresponding mass loss rates to be 66.5 +- 11.1, 15.6 +- 4.4, and 9.6 +- 4.1 times the solar mass loss rate for 70 Ophiuchi, epsilon Eridani, and 61 Cygni, respectively, and compare our results to the hydrogen wall method. We also place upper limits on the mass loss rates of several other main sequence stars. This method has potential utility for determining the mass loss rates from X-ray observations showing spatial extension beyond a coronal point source.</description>

      <title>Solar flare observations with the Radio Neutrino Observatory Greenland (RNO-G)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The science program of the Radio Neutrino Observatory-Greenland (RNO-G) extends beyond particle astrophysics to include radioglaciology and, as we show herein, solar physics, as well. Impulsive solar flare observations not only permit direct measurements of light curves, spectral content, and polarization on time scales significantly shorter than most extant dedicated solar observatories, but also offer an extremely useful above-surface calibration source, with pointing precision of order tens of arc-minutes. Using the early RNO-G data from 2022-2023, observed flare characteristics are compared to well-established solar observatories. Also, a number of individual flares are used to highlight angular reconstruction and calibration methods. RNO-G observes signal excesses during solar flares reported by the solar-observing Callisto network and in coincidence with about 60% of the brightest excesses recorded by the SWAVES satellite, when the Sun is above the horizon for RNO-G. In these observed flares, there is significant impulsivity in the time-domain. In addition, the solar flares are used to calibrate the RNO-G absolute pointing on the radio signal arrival direction to sub-degree resolution.</description>

      <title>Quantum study of the CH$_3^+$ photodissociation in full dimension Neural Networks potential energy surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CH$_3^+$, a cornerstone intermediate in interstellar chemistry, has recently been detected for the first time by the James Webb Space Telescope. The photodissociation of this ion is studied here. Accurate explicitly correlated multi-reference configuration interaction {\it ab initio} calculations are done, and full dimensional potential energy surfaces are developed for the three lower electronic states, with a fundamental invariant neural network method. The photodissociation cross section is calculated using a full dimensional quantum wave packet method, in heliocentric Radau coordinates. The wave packet is represented in angular and radial grids allowing to reduce the number of points physically accessible, requiring to push up the spurious states appearing when evaluating the angular kinetic terms, through a projection technique. The photodissociation spectra, when employed in astrochemical models to simulate the conditions of the Orion Bar, results in a lesser destruction of CH$_3^+$ compared to that obtained when utilizing the recommended values in the kinetic database for astrochemistry (KIDA).</description>

      <title>Resolving Red Giant Winds with the Hubble Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe recent spectroscopic observations of red giant stars made by the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) instrument on board the Hubble Space Telescope, which have provided spatially resolved observations of the warm chromospheric winds that predominate for early K to mid-M giants. The H I Lyman-alpha lines of a set of 11 red giants observed with the STIS/E140M echelle grating are first analyzed to ascertain wind H I column densities and total wind mass-loss rates. The M giants have estimated mass-loss rates of Mdot=(14-86)e-11 Msun/yr, while the K giants with detected wind absorption have weaker winds with Mdot=(1.5-2.8)e-11 Msun/yr. We use long-slit spectra of H I Lyman-alpha for two particular red giants, Alpha Tau (K5 III) and Gamma Cru (M3.5 III), to study the spatial extent of the Lyman-alpha emission. From these data we estimate limits for the extent of detectable emission, which are r=193 Rstar for Gamma Cru and r=44 Rstar for Alpha Tau. Cross-dispersion emission profiles in the STIS echelle spectra of the larger sample of red giants also show evidence for spatial resolution, not only for H I Lyman-alpha but for other lines with visible wind absorption, such as Fe II, Mg II, Mg I, O I, and C II. We characterize the nature of these spatial signatures. The spatial extent is far more apparent for the M giants than for the K giants, consistent with the stronger winds found for the M giants from the Lyman-alpha analysis.</description>

      <title>APPLE: An Evolution Code for Modeling Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce APPLE, a novel planetary evolution code designed specifically for the study of giant exoplanet and Jovian planet evolution in the era of Galileo, Juno, and Cassini. With APPLE, state-of-the-art equations of state for hydrogen, helium, ice, and rock are integrated with advanced features to treat ice/rock cores and metals in the gaseous envelope; models for helium rain and hydrogen/helium immiscibility; detailed atmosphere boundary tables that also provide self-consistent albedos and spectra; and options to address envelope metal gradients and stably-stratified regions. Our hope is that these purpose-built features of APPLE will help catalyze the development of the next generation of giant exoplanet and Jovian planet evolutionary models.</description>

      <title>Lifetime-Limited Linewidth Measurements of the 3C and 3D Soft X-ray Transitions in Ni XIX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We used the monochromatic soft X-ray beamline P04 at the synchrotron-radiation facility PETRA III to resonantly excite the strongest $2p-3d$ transitions in neon-like Ni XIX ions, $[2p^6]_{J=0} \rightarrow [(2p^5)_{1/2}\,3d_{3/2}]_{J=1}$ and $[2p^6]_{J=0} \rightarrow [(2p^5)_{3/2}\,3d_{5/2}]_{J=1}$, respectively dubbed 3C and 3D, achieving a resolving power of 15,000 and signal-to-background ratio of 30. We obtain their natural linewidths, with an accuracy of better than 10\%, as well as the oscillator-strength ratio $f(3C)/f(3D)$ = 2.51(11) from analysis of the resonant fluorescence spectra. These results agree with those of previous experiments, earlier predictions, and our own advanced calculations.</description>

      <title>VLBI with SKA: Possible Arrays and Astrometric Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The next generation of very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) is stepping into the era of microarcsecond ($\mu$as) astronomy, and pushing astronomy, especially astrometry, to new heights. VLBI with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), SKA-VLBI, will increase current sensitivity by an order of magnitude, and reach astrometric precision routinely below 10 $\mu$as, even challenging 1 $\mu$as. This advancement allows precise parallax and proper motion measurements of various celestial objects. Such improvements can be used to study objects (including isolated objects, and binary or multiple systems) in different stellar stages (such as star formation, main-sequence stars, asymptotic giant branch stars, pulsars, black holes, white dwarfs, etc.), unveil the structure and evolution of complex systems (such as the Milky Way), benchmark the international celestial reference frame, and reveal cosmic expansion. Furthermore, the theory of general relativity can also be tested with SKA-VLBI using precise measurements of light deflection under the gravitational fields of different solar system objects and the perihelion precession of solar system objects.</description>

      <title>On the X-ray efficiency of the white dwarf pulsar candidate ZTF J190132.9+145808.7</title>

Abstract: Strongly magnetized, rapidly rotating massive white dwarfs (WDs) emerge as potential outcomes of double degenerate mergers. These WDs can act as sources of non-thermal emission and cosmic rays, gethering attention as WD pulsars. In this context, we studied the X-ray emissions from ZTF J190132.9+145808.7 (hereafter ZTF J1901+14), a notable massive isolated WD in the Galaxy, using the Chandra X-ray observatory. Our results showed 3.5sigma level evidence of X-ray signals, although it is marginal. Under the assumption of a photon index of 2, we derived its intrinsic flux to be 2.3 (0.9--4.7) $\times 10^{-15}$~erg~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and luminosity 4.6 (2.0--9.5) $\times 10^{26}$~erg~s$^{-1}$ for a 0.5--7 keV band in the 90% confidence range, given its distance of 41 pc. We derived an X-ray efficiency (eta) concerning the spin-down luminosity to be 0.012 (0.0022--0.074), a value comparable to that of ordnary neutron star pulsars. The inferred X-ray luminosity may be compatible with curvature radiation from sub-TeV electrons accelerated within open magnetic fields in the magnetosphere of ZTF J1901+14. Conducting more extensive X-ray observations is crucial to confirm whether ZTF J1901+14-like isolated WDs are also significant sources of X-rays and sub-TeV electron cosmic rays, similar to other WD pulsars in accreting systems.</description>

      <title>Isochrone Fitting of Galactic Globular Clusters -- VI. High-latitude Clusters NGC5024 (M53), NGC5053, NGC5272 (M3), NGC5466, and NGC7099 (M30)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We fit various colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) of the high-latitude Galactic globular clusters NGC\,5024 (M53), NGC\,5053, NGC\,5272 (M3), NGC\,5466, and NGC\,7099 (M30) by isochrones from the Dartmouth Stellar Evolution Database and Bag of Stellar Tracks and Isochrones for $\alpha$-enrichment [$\alpha$/Fe]$=+0.4$. For the CMDs, we use data sets from {\it Hubble Space Telescope}, {\it Gaia}, and other sources utilizing, at least, 25 photometric filters for each cluster. We obtain the following characteristics with their statistic uncertainties for NGC\,5024, NGC\,5053, NGC\,5272, NGC\,5466, and NGC\,7099, respectively: metallicities [Fe/H]$=-1.93\pm0.02$, $-2.08\pm0.03$, $-1.60\pm0.02$, $-1.95\pm0.02$, and $-2.07\pm0.04$ dex with their systematic uncertainty 0.1 dex; ages $13.00\pm0.11$, $12.70\pm0.11$, $11.63\pm0.07$, $12.15\pm0.11$, and $12.80\pm0.17$ Gyr with their systematic uncertainty 0.8 Gyr; distances (systematic uncertainty added) $18.22\pm0.06\pm0.60$, $16.99\pm0.06\pm0.56$, $10.08\pm0.04\pm0.33$, $15.59\pm0.03\pm0.51$, and $8.29\pm0.03\pm0.27$ kpc; reddenings $E(B-V)=0.023\pm0.004$, $0.017\pm0.004$, $0.023\pm0.004$, $0.023\pm0.003$, and $0.045\pm0.002$ mag with their systematic uncertainty 0.01 mag; extinctions $A_\mathrm{V}=0.08\pm0.01$, $0.06\pm0.01$, $0.08\pm0.01$, $0.08\pm0.01$, and $0.16\pm0.01$ mag with their systematic uncertainty 0.03 mag, which suggest the total Galactic extinction $A_\mathrm{V}=0.08$ across the whole Galactic dust to extragalactic objects at the North Galactic pole. The horizontal branch morphology difference of these clusters is explained by their different metallicity, age, mass-loss efficiency, and loss of low-mass members in the evolution of the core-collapse cluster NGC\,7099 and loose clusters NGC\,5053 and NGC\,5466.</description>

      <title>The Solar System: structural overview, origins and evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the origin and long-term evolution of the Solar System is a fundamental goal of planetary science and astrophysics. This chapter describes our current understanding of the key processes that shaped our planetary system, informed by empirical data such as meteorite measurements, observations of planet-forming disks around other stars, and exoplanets, and nourished by theoretical modeling and laboratory experiments. The processes at play range in size from microns to gas giants, and mostly took place within the gaseous planet-forming disk through the growth of mountain-sized planetesimals and Moon- to Mars-sized planetary embryos. A fundamental shift in our understanding came when it was realized (thanks to advances in exoplanet science) that the giant planets' orbits likely underwent large radial shifts during their early evolution, through gas- or planetesimal-driven migration and dynamical instability. The characteristics of the rocky planets (including Earth) were forged during this early dynamic phase. Our Solar System is currently middle-aged, and we can use astrophysical tools to forecast its demise in the distant future.</description>

      <title>Confronting Dark Matter Capture Rate with Continuous Gravitational Wave Probe of Local Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) from various astrophysical sources are one of the many future probes of upcoming Gravitational Wave (GW) search missions. Neutron stars (NSs) with deformity are one of the leading sources of CGW emissions. In this work, for the first time, a novel attempt to estimate the dark matter (DM) capture rate is performed using CGW as the probe to the local NS population. Competitive bounds on DM capture from the local NS population are reported when compared with DM direct search experiments and other astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Variability in SSTc2d J163134.1-240100, a brown dwarf with quasi-spherical mass loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a search for variability in the young brown dwarf SST1624 (~M7 spectral type, M~0.05Msol), previously found to feature an expanding gaseous shell and to undergo quasi-spherical mass loss. We find no variability on timescales of 1-6hours. Specifically, on these timescales, we rule out the presence of a period with amplitude &gt;1%. A photometric period in that range would have been evidence for either pulsation powered by Deuterium burning or rotation near breakup. However, we see a 3% decrease in the K-band magnitude between two consecutive observing nights (a 10sigma result). There is also clear evidence for variations in the WISE lightcurves at 3.6 and 4.5 microns on timescales of days, with a tentative period of about 6d (with a plausible range between 3 and 7d). The best explanation for the variations over days is rotational modulation due to spots. These results disfavour centrifugal winds driven by fast rotation as mechanism for the mass loss, which, in turn, makes the alternative scenario -- a thermal pulse due to Deuterium burning -- more plausible.</description>

      <title>Electron-capture supernovae in NS+He star systems and the double neutron star systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron-capture supernovae (EC-SNe) provide an alternative channel for producing neutron stars (NSs). They play an important role in the formation of double NS (DNS) systems and the chemical evolution of galaxies, and contribute to the NS mass distribution in observations. It is generally believed that EC-SNe originate from $e$-captures on $\rm^{24}Mg$ and $\rm^{20}Ne$ in the massive degenerate oxygen-neon (ONe) cores with masses close to the Chandrasekhar limit ($M_{\rm Ch}$). However, the origin of EC-SNe is still uncertain. In this paper, we systematically studied the EC-SNe in NS+He star systems by considering the explosive oxygen burning that may occur in the near-$M_{\rm Ch}$ ONe core. We provided the initial parameter spaces for producing EC-SNe in the initial orbital period $-$ initial He star mass (log$P_{\rm orb}^{\rm i}-M_{\rm He}^{\rm i}$) diagram, and found that both $M_{\rm He}^{\rm i}$ and minimum $P_{\rm orb}^{\rm i}$ for EC-SNe increase with metallicity. Then, by considering NS kicks added to the newborn NS, we investigated the properties of the formed DNS systems after the He star companions collapse into NSs, such as the orbital periods, eccentricities and spin periods of recycle pulsars ($P_{\rm spin}$), etc. The results show that most of the observed DNS systems can be produced by NS kicks of $\lesssim50\rm\,km\,s^{-1}$. In addition, we found that NSs could accrete more material if the residual H envelope on the He star companions is considered, which can form the mildly recycled pulsars ($P_{\rm spin}\sim20\,$ms) in DNS systems.</description>

      <title>A perspective on the Milky Way Bulge-Bar as seen from the neutron-capture elements Cerium and Neodymium with APOGEE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study probes the chemical abundances of the neutron-capture elements cerium and neodymium in the inner Milky Way from an analysis of a sample of $\sim$2000 stars in the Galactic Bulge/bar spatially contained within $|X_{Gal}|&lt;$5 kpc, $|Y_{Gal}|&lt;$3.5 kpc, and $|Z_{Gal}|&lt;$1 kpc, and spanning metallicities between $-$2.0$\lesssim$[Fe/H]$\lesssim$+0.5. We classify the sample stars into low- or high-[Mg/Fe] populations and find that, in general, values of [Ce/Fe] and [Nd/Fe] increase as the metallicity decreases for the low- and high-[Mg/Fe] populations. Ce abundances show a more complex variation across the metallicity range of our Bulge-bar sample when compared to Nd, with the r-process dominating the production of neutron-capture elements in the high-[Mg/Fe] population ([Ce/Nd]$&lt;$0.0). We find a spatial chemical dependence of Ce and Nd abundances for our sample of Bulge-bar stars, with low- and high-[Mg/Fe] populations displaying a distinct abundance distribution. In the region close to the center of the MW, the low-[Mg/Fe] population is dominated by stars with low [Ce/Fe], [Ce/Mg], [Nd/Mg], [Nd/Fe], and [Ce/Nd] ratios. The low [Ce/Nd] ratio indicates a significant contribution in this central region from r-process yields for the low-[Mg/Fe] population. The chemical pattern of the most metal-poor stars in our sample suggests an early chemical enrichment of the Bulge dominated by yields from core-collapse supernovae and r-process astrophysical sites, such as magneto-rotational supernovae.</description>
