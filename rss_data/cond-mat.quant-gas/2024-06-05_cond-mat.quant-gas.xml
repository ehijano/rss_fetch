      <title>Dark state transport between unitary Fermi superfluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of dark states is an important concept in quantum sciences, but its compatibility with strong interparticle interactions, for example, in a quantum degenerate gas is hardly explored. Here, we realize a dark state in one of the spins of a two-component, resonantly-interacting Fermi gas using a $\Lambda$ system within the $D_2$ transitions of $^6$Li at high magnetic field. The dark state is created in a micrometer-sized region within a one-dimensional channel connecting two superfluid reservoirs. The particle transport between the reservoirs is used as a probe. We observe that atoms are transported in the dark state and the superfluid-assisted fast current is preserved. If the dark state resonant condition is not met, the transport is suppressed by the spontaneous emission. We also uncover an asymmetry in the transport timescale across the two-photon resonance, which is absent in the non-interacting regime. This work raises questions on the interplay of dark states with interparticle interactions and opens up perspectives for optical manipulation of fermionic pairing.</description>

      <title>Detecting Phase Coherence of 2D Bose Gases via Noise Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the noise correlations of two-dimensional (2D) Bose gases after free expansion, which allows us to characterize the in-situ phase coherence across the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. The noise correlation function features a characteristic spatial oscillatory behavior in the superfluid phase, which gives direct access to the superfluid exponent. This oscillatory behavior vanishes above the BKT critical point, as we demonstrate for both single-layer and decoupled bilayer 2D Bose gases. Our work establishes noise interferometry as a general tool to probe and identify many-body states of bilayer quantum gases.</description>

      <title>Quantum Transport Theory of Strongly Correlated Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This report reviews recent progress in computing Kubo formulas for general interacting Hamiltonians. The aim is to calculate electric and thermal magneto-conductivities in strong scattering regimes where Boltzmann equation and Hall conductivity proxies exceed their validity. Three primary approaches are explained.
  1. Degeneracy-projected polarization formulas for Hall-type conductivities, which substantially reduce the number of calculated current matrix elements. These expressions generalize the Berry curvature integral formulas to imperfect lattices. 2. Continued fraction representation of dynamical longitudinal conductivities. The calculations produce a set of thermodynamic averages, which can be controllably extrapolated using their mathematical relations to low and high frequency conductivity asymptotics. 3. Hall-type coefficients summation formulas, which are constructed from thermodynamic averages.
  The thermodynamic formulas are derived in the operator Hilbert space formalism, which avoids the opacity and high computational cost of the Hamiltonian eigenspectrum. The coefficients can be obtained by well established imaginary-time Monte Carlo sampling, high temperature expansion, traces of operator products, and variational wavefunctions at low temperatures. We demonstrate the power of approaches 1--3 by their application to well known models of lattice electrons and bosons. The calculations clarify the far-reaching influence of strong local interactions on the metallic transport near Mott insulators. Future directions for these approaches are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we bring up our investigation on the properties of asymmetric scattering in graphene made with the microcavity exciton-polaritons. It is shown by numerical simulations of Gross-Pitaevskii equation that ratchet phenomena occurs in the polariton graphene due to its structural inhomogeneity. Thus, we suggest a way to induce preferential motion of polaritons by the confinement potential engineering.</description>

      <title>Paths towards time evolution with larger neural-network quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the neural-network quantum states method has been investigated to study the ground state and the time evolution of many-body quantum systems. Here we expand on the investigation and consider a quantum quench from the paramagnetic to the anti-ferromagnetic phase in the tilted Ising model. We use two types of neural networks, a restricted Boltzmann machine and a feed-forward neural network. We show that for both types of networks, the projected time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (p-tVMC) method performs better than the non-projected approach. We further demonstrate that one can use K-FAC or minSR in conjunction with p-tVMC to reduce the computational complexity of the stochastic reconfiguration approach, thus allowing the use of these techniques for neural networks with more parameters.</description>

      <title>Relaxation and fluctuations of a mass- and dipole-conserving stochastic lattice gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Han et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 132, 137102 (2024)] have recently introduced a classical stochastic lattice gas model which, in addition to particle conservation, also conserves the particles' dipole moment. Because of its intrinsic nonlinearity this model exhibits unusual macroscopic scaling behaviors, different from those of lattice gases that conserve only the number of particles. Here we investigate some basic relaxation and fluctuation properties of this model at large scales and at long times. These properties crucially depend on whether the total number of particles is infinite or finite. We find similarity solutions, describing relaxation of the dipole-conserving gas (DCG) in several standard settings. A major part of our effort is an extension to this model of the macroscopic fluctuation theory (MFT), previously developed for lattice gases where only the number of particles is conserved. We apply the MFT to the calculation of the variance of nonequilibrium fluctuations of the excess number of particles on the positive semi-axis when starting from an (either deterministic, or random) constant density at $t=0$. Using the MFT, we also identify the equilibrium Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution for the DCG. Finally, based on these results, we determine the probability distribution of, and the most probable density history leading to, a large deviation in the form of a macroscopic void of a given size in an initially uniform DCG at equilibrium.</description>

      <title>A self-aligning recirculated crossed optical dipole trap for lithium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crossed optical dipole traps (ODTs) provide three-dimensional confinement of cold atoms and other optically trappable particles. However, the need to maintain the intersection of the two trapping beams poses strict requirements on alignment stability, and limits the ability to move the trap. Here we demonstrate a novel crossed ODT design that features inherent stability of the beam crossing, allowing the trap to move and remain aligned. The trap consists of a single high-power laser beam, imaged back onto itself at an angle to form a crossed trap. Self-aligning behavior results from employing an imaging system with positive magnification tuned precisely to unity. We employ laser-cooled samples of $^6$Li atoms to demonstrate that the trap remains well-aligned over a 4.3 mm travel range along an axis approximately perpendicular to the plane containing the crossed beams. Our scheme can be applied to bring an atomic cloud held in a crossed ODT close to a surface or field source for various applications in quantum simulation, sensing, and information processing.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic bosonic $t$-$J$ models and their quantum simulation in tweezer arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02322v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combination of optical tweezer arrays with strong interactions -- via dipole-exchange of molecules and van-der-Waals interactions of Rydberg atoms -- has opened the door for the exploration of a wide variety of quantum spin models. A next significant step will be the combination of such settings with mobile dopants: This will enable to simulate the physics believed to underlie many strongly correlated quantum materials. Here we propose an experimental scheme to realize bosonic t-J models via encoding the local Hilbert space in a set of three internal atomic or molecular states. By engineering antiferromagnetic (AFM) couplings between spins, competition between charge motion and magnetic order similar to that in high-$T_c$ cuprates can be realized. Since the ground states of the 2D bosonic AFM t-J model we propose to realize have not been studied extensively before, we start by analyzing the case of two dopants -- the simplest instance in which their bosonic statistics plays a role, and contrast our results to the fermionic case. We perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations on six-legged cylinders, and find a strong tendency for bosonic holes to form stripes. This demonstrates that bosonic, AFM t-J models may contain similar physics as the collective phases in strongly correlated electrons.</description>

      <title>Dissipative preparation of a Floquet topological insulator in an optical lattice via bath engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03739v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floquet engineering is an important tool for realizing topologically nontrivial band structures for charge-neutral atoms in optical lattices. However, the preparation of a topological-band-insulator-type state of fermions, with one nontrivial quasi-energy band filled completely and the others empty, is challenging as a result of both driving induced heating as well as imperfect adiabatic state preparation (with the latter induced by the unavoidable gap closing when passing the topological transition). An alternative procedure that has been proposed is to prepare such states dissipatively, i.e. as a steady state that emerges when coupling the system to reservoirs. Here we discuss a concrete scheme that couples the system to a weakly interacting Bose condensate given by second atomic species acting as a heat bath. Our strategy relies on the engineering of the potential for the bath particles, so that they occupy weakly coupled tubes perpendicular to the two-dimensional system. Using Floquet-Born-Markov theory, we show that the resulting nonequilibrium steady state of the driven-dissipative system approximates a topological insulator. We even find indications for the approximate stabilization of an anomalous Floquet topological insulator, a state that is impossible to realize in equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Probing the local rapidity distribution of a 1D Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-dimensional Bose gases with contact repulsive interactions are characterized by the presence of infinite-lifetime quasiparticles whose momenta are called the `rapidities'. Here we develop a probe of the local rapidity distribution, based on the fact that rapidities are the asymptotic momenta of the particles after a long one-dimensional expansion. This is done by performing an expansion of a selected slice of the gas. We first apply this idea to a cloud in the quasi-condensate regime at equilibrium in a trap. We obtain an experimental picture of the position-dependent rapidity distribution which is in fair agreement with the theory prediction. The asymptotic regime is barely reached, but we show that finite expansion time can be taken into account using the Generalized Hydrodynamics theory. We then apply this local probe to an out-of-equilibrium situation where the local rapidity distribution is expected to be doubly peaked -- a hallmark of a non-thermal state -- even though the global rapidity distribution would possess no such distinctive feature. We observe the doubly-peaked local rapidity distribution.</description>

      <title>Finite-frequency normal and superfluid drag effects in two-component atomic Bose-Einstein condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-component systems consisting of mutually interacting particles can demonstrate both intracomponent transport effects and intercomponent entrainment (or drag) effects. In the presence of superfluidity, the intracomponent transport is characterized by dissipative conductivity and superfluid weight in the framework of two-fluid model, and intercomponent entrainment gives rise to normal and nondissipative drag effects. We present unified treatment of all these effects for spatially homogeneous two-component atomic Bose-Einstein condensates based on the Bogoliubov theory, focusing specifically on the drag effects. Calculating finite-frequency intra- and intercomponent conductivities with taking into account quasiparticle damping, we derive and numerically check analytical Drude-like approximations applicable at low frequencies, and Lorentz-like approximations applicable at higher frequencies in vicinity of the resonant energy of spin-to-density Bogoliubov quasiparticle conversion. As possible physical realizations of two-component atomic systems, we consider three-dimensional Bose-Bose mixtures and closely spaced two-layered systems of magnetic dipolar atoms.</description>

      <title>Observation of Nonlinear Response and Onsager Regression in a Photon Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum regression theorem states that the correlations of a system at two different times are governed by the same equations of motion as the temporal response of the average values. Such a relation provides a powerful framework for the investigation of physical systems by establishing a formal connection between intrinsic microscopic behaviour and a macroscopic 'effect' due to an external 'cause'. Measuring the response to a controlled perturbation in this way allows to determine, for example, structure factors in condensed matter systems as well as other correlation functions of material systems. Here we experimentally demonstrate that the two-time particle number correlations in a photon Bose-Einstein condensate inside a dye-filled microcavity exhibit the same dynamics as the response of the condensate to a sudden perturbation of the dye molecule bath. This confirms the regression theorem for a quantum gas and, moreover, establishes a test of this relation in an unconventional form where the perturbation acts on the bath and only the condensate response is monitored. For strong perturbations, we observe nonlinear relaxation dynamics which our microscopic theory relates to the equilibrium fluctuations, thereby extending the regression theorem beyond the regime of linear response. The demonstrated nonlinearity of the condensate-bath system paves the way for studies of novel elementary excitations in lattices of driven-dissipative photon condensates.</description>

      <title>Classification of symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic framework to classify symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids in two spatial dimensions. This framework can deal with all topological quantum spin liquids, which may be either Abelian or non-Abelian, chiral or non-chiral. It can systematically treat a general symmetry, which may include both lattice symmetry and internal symmetry, may contain anti-unitary symmetry, and may permute anyons. The framework applies to all types of lattices, and can systematically distinguish different lattice systems with the same symmetry group using their Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomalies. We apply this framework to classify $U(1)_{2N}$ chiral states and non-Abelian Ising$^{(\nu)}$ states enriched by a $p6\times SO(3)$ or $p4\times SO(3)$ symmetry, and $\mathbb{Z}_N$ topological orders and $U(1)_{2N}\times U(1)_{-2N}$ topological orders enriched by a $p6m\times SO(3)\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$, $p4m\times SO(3)\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$, $p6m\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ or $p4m\times\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, where $p6$, $p4$, $p6m$ and $p4m$ are lattice symmetries, while $SO(3)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2^T$ are spin rotation and time reversal symmetries, respectively. In particular, we identify symmetry-enriched topological quantum spin liquids that are not easily captured by the usual parton-mean-field approach, including examples with the familiar $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order.</description>
