      <title>Strategic Optimization and Demand Response for Thermal Load Management in Multi-Regional Integrated Energy Systems: A Stackelberg Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of high fossil fuel consumption and inefficiency within China's energy systems, effective demand-side management is essential. This study examines the thermal characteristics of various building types across different functional areas, utilizing the concept of body coefficient to integrate their unique structural and energy use traits into a demand response framework supported by real-time pricing. We developed a Stackelberg game-based bi-level optimization model that captures the dynamic interplay of costs and benefits between integrated energy providers and users. This model is formulated into a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and linearized with the Big M method, subsequently solved using MATLAB and CPLEX. This approach enables distinctive management of heating loads in public and residential areas, optimizing energy efficiency while balancing the interests of both providers and users. Furthermore, the study explores how the proportion of different area types affects the potential for reducing heat loads, providing insights into the scalability and effectiveness of demand response strategies in integrated energy systems. This analysis not only highlights the economic benefits of such strategies but also their potential in reducing dependency on traditional energy sources, thus contributing to more sustainable energy system practices.</description>

      <title>A Hardware-in-the-Loop Experimental Testbed using Air Conditioners for Grid Balancing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the need to offset the variability of renewable generation on the grid, development of load control is a highly active field of research. However, practical use of residential loads for grid balancing remains rare, in part due to the cost of communicating with large numbers of small loads and also the limited experimentation done so far to demonstrate reliable operation. To establish a basis for the safe and reliable use of fleets of compressor loads as distributed energy resources, we constructed an experimental testbed in a laboratory, so that load coordination schemes could be tested at extreme conditions. This experimental testbed was used to tune a simulation testbed to which it was then linked, thereby augmenting the effective size of the fleet. Modeling of the system was done both to demonstrate the experimental testbed's behavior and also to understand how to tune the behavior of each load. Implementing this testbed has enabled rapid turnaround of experiments on various load control algorithms, and year-round testing without the constraints and limitations arising in seasonal field tests with real houses. Experimental results show the practical feasibility of an ensemble of small loads contributing to grid balancing.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Propagation and Minimization for Channel Estimation in UAV-mounted RIS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) are emerging as a key technology for sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, leveraging adjustable reflecting elements to dynamically control electromagnetic wave propagation and optimize wireless connectivity. By positioning the RIS on an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), it can maintain line-of-sight and proximity to both the transmitter and receiver, critical factors that mitigate path loss and enhance signal strength. The lightweight, power-efficient nature of RIS makes UAV integration feasible, yet the setup faces significant disturbances from UAV motion, which can degrade RIS alignment and link performance. In this study, we address these challenges using both experimental measurements and analytical methods. Using an extended Kalman filter (EKF), we estimate the UAV's orientation in real time during experimental flights to capture real disturbance effects. The resulting orientation uncertainty is then propagated to the RIS's channel estimates by applying the Guide to the Expression of Uncertainty in Measurement (GUM) framework as well as complex-valued propagation techniques to accurately assess and minimize the impact of UAV orientation uncertainties on RIS performance. This method enables us to systematically trace and quantify how orientation uncertainties affect channel gain and phase stability in real-time. Through numerical simulations, we find that the uncertainty of the RIS channel link is influenced by the RIS's configuration. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that the uncertainty area is most accurately represented by an annular section, enabling a 58% reduction in the uncertainty area while maintaining a 95% coverage probability.</description>

      <title>A Robust Solver for Phasor-Domain Short-Circuit Analysis with Inverter-Based Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of Inverter-Based Resource (IBR) model into phasor-domain short circuit (SC) solvers challenges their numerical stability. To address the challenge, this paper proposes a solver that improves numerical stability by employing the Newton-Raphson iterative method. The solver can integrate the latest implementation of IBR SC model in industry-standard fault analysis programs including the voltage controlled current source tabular model as well as vendor-specific black-box and white-box equation-based models. The superior numerical stability of the proposed solver has been mathematically demonstrated, with identified convergence conditions. An algorithm for the implementation of the proposed solver in fault analysis programs has been developed. The objective is to improve the capability of the industry to accurately represent IBRs in SC studies and ensure system protection reliability in an IBR-dominated future.</description>

      <title>Is Locational Marginal Price All You Need for Locational Marginal Emission?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing concerns over climate change call for improved techniques for estimating and quantifying the greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity generation and transmission. Among the emission metrics designated for power grids, locational marginal emission (LME) can provide system operators and electricity market participants with valuable information on the emissions associated with electricity usage at various locations in the power network. In this paper, by investigating the operating patterns and physical interpretations of marginal emissions and costs in the security-constrained economic dispatch (SCED) problem, we identify and draw the exact connection between locational marginal price (LMP) and LME. Such interpretation helps instantly derive LME given nodal demand vectors or LMP, and also reveals the interplay between network congestion and nodal emission pattern. Our proposed approach helps reduce the computation time of LME by an order of magnitude compared to analytical approaches, while it can also serve as a plug-and-play module accompanied by an off-the-shelf market clearing and LMP calculation process.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Proactive False Data Injection Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Smart inverters are instrumental in the integration of renewable and distributed energy resources (DERs) into the electric grid. Such inverters rely on communication layers for continuous control and monitoring, potentially exposing them to cyber-physical attacks such as false data injection attacks (FDIAs). We propose to construct a defense strategy against a priori unknown FDIAs with a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework. The first agent is an adversary that simulates and discovers various FDIA strategies, while the second agent is a defender in charge of detecting and localizing FDIAs. This approach enables the defender to be trained against new FDIAs continuously generated by the adversary. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed MARL defender outperforms a supervised offline defender. Additionally, we show that the detection skills of an MARL defender can be combined with that of an offline defender through a transfer learning approach.</description>

      <title>Development of a Comprehensive Physics-Based Battery Model and Its Multidimensional Comparison with an Equivalent-Circuit Model: Accuracy, Complexity, and Real-World Performance under Varying Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a comprehensive physics-based model (PBM) that spans a wide operational range, including varying temperatures, charge/discharge conditions, and real-world field data cycles. The PBM incorporates key factors such as hysteresis effects, concentration-dependent diffusivity, and the Arrhenius law to provide a realistic depiction of battery behavior. Additionally, the paper presents an in-depth analysis comparing the PBM with an equivalent-circuit model (ECM) for accurately capturing the dynamics of lithium-ion batteries under diverse operating conditions. To ensure a fair comparison, both the PBM and ECM are rigorously calibrated and validated through parameter identification and testing across 55 different operating conditions. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this represents the most comprehensive model calibration and validation effort for PBM and ECM in the literature to date, encompassing large temperature variations (-20 to 40{\deg}C), various charging/discharging C-rates, and real-world driving cycles. Comparative analysis between the PBM and ECM highlights key differences in accuracy, computational complexity, parameterization requirements, and performance under varying temperature conditions. appropriate models for battery management applications.</description>

      <title>Action-Attentive Deep Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Alignment of Beamlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synchrotron radiation sources play a crucial role in fields such as materials science, biology, and chemistry. The beamline, a key subsystem of the synchrotron, modulates and directs the radiation to the sample for analysis. However, the alignment of beamlines is a complex and time-consuming process, primarily carried out manually by experienced engineers. Even minor misalignments in optical components can significantly affect the beam's properties, leading to suboptimal experimental outcomes. Current automated methods, such as bayesian optimization (BO) and reinforcement learning (RL), although these methods enhance performance, limitations remain. The relationship between the current and target beam properties, crucial for determining the adjustment, is not fully considered. Additionally, the physical characteristics of optical elements are overlooked, such as the need to adjust specific devices to control the output beam's spot size or position. This paper addresses the alignment of beamlines by modeling it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and training an intelligent agent using RL. The agent calculates adjustment values based on the current and target beam states, executes actions, and iterates until optimal parameters are achieved. A policy network with action attention is designed to improve decision-making by considering both state differences and the impact of optical components. Experiments on two simulated beamlines demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms existing methods, with ablation studies highlighting the effectiveness of the action attention-based policy network.</description>

      <title>The Soft-PVTOL: modeling and control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents, for the first time, the soft planar vertical take-off and landing (Soft-PVTOL) aircraft. This concept captures the soft aerial vehicle's fundamental dynamics with a minimum number of states and inputs but retains the main features to consider when designing control laws. Unlike conventional PVTOL and multi-rotors, where altering position inevitably impacts orientation due to their underactuated design, the Soft-PVTOL offers the unique advantage of separating these dynamics, opening doors to unparalleled maneuverability and precision. We demonstrate that the Soft-PVTOL can be modeled using the Euler-Lagrange equations by assuming a constant curvature model in the aerial robot's arms. Such a mathematical model is presented in detail and can be extended to several constant curvature segments in each Soft-PVTOL arm. Moreover, we design a passivity-based control law that exploits the flexibility of the robot's arms. We solve the tracking control problem, proving that the error equilibrium globally exponentially converges to zero. The controller is tested in numerical simulations, demonstrating robust performance and ensuring the efficacy of the closed-loop system.</description>

      <title>Age of Information Minimization in UAV-Assisted Covert Communication: Trajectory and Beamforming Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have the potential for time-sensitive applications. Due to wireless channel variation, received data may have an expiration time, particularly in critical situations such as rescue operations, natural disasters, or the military. Age of Information (AoI) is a metric that measures the freshness of received packets to specify the validity period of information. In addition, it is necessary to guarantee the privacy of confidential information transmission through air-to-ground links against eavesdroppers. This paper investigates UAV-assisted covert communication to minimize AoI in the presence of an aerial eavesdropper for the first time. However, to ensure the eavesdropper's error detection rate, UAV-enabled beamforming employs the power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) technique to cover the covert user by a public user. PD-NOMA technique significantly improves the user's AoI, too. The joint optimization problem contains non-convex constraints and coupled optimization variables, including UAV trajectory, beamforming design, and the user's AoI which is challenging to derive a direct solution. We have developed an efficient alternating optimization technique to address the formulated optimization problem. Numerical results demonstrate the impact of the main parameters on the performance of the proposed communication system.</description>

      <title>Service Restoration for Distribution Systems Based on Semi-Analytical Metamodeling of Decision-Dependent Interruption Cost and Cold Load Pickup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Developing optimized restoration strategies for power distribution systems (PDSs) is essential to meet the pressing demand for enhanced resilience. Prior knowledge of customer interruption cost (CIC) and load restoration behaviors, particularly cold load pickup (CLPU), is crucial for guiding effective restoration; however, both are reciprocally affected by the realized customer interruption duration (CID), making them decision-dependent and challenging to model especially given the limited understanding of underlying physical mechanisms. This paper presents a novel approach by constructing tractable metamodels to capture the varying patterns of CIC and CLPU with CID - patterns which can be derived from limited data and reflect observed surface-level correlations rather than underlying mechanisms, thereby enabling practical surrogate modeling of these decision-dependencies. Specifically, quadratic functions are used to model the increasing rate of CIC with CID based on data fitting. Several defining characteristics of CLPU are extracted, each modeled in a piecewise linear form relative to CID, and the actual restored load accounting for CLPU is subsequently retrieved. Building on these metamodels, a PDS restoration optimization model is constructed, incorporating mobile energy storage systems (MESSs) and network reconfiguration. Case studies validate our approach and also highlight MESS's unique potential to accelerate CLPU-related restoration.</description>

      <title>Smart Predict-then-Optimize Method with Dependent Data: Risk Bounds and Calibration of Autoregression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The predict-then-optimize (PTO) framework is indispensable for addressing practical stochastic decision-making tasks. It consists of two crucial steps: initially predicting unknown parameters of an optimization model and subsequently solving the problem based on these predictions. Elmachtoub and Grigas [1] introduced the Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) loss for the framework, which gauges the decision error arising from predicted parameters, and a convex surrogate, the SPO+ loss, which incorporates the underlying structure of the optimization model. The consistency of these different loss functions is guaranteed under the assumption of i.i.d. training data. Nevertheless, various types of data are often dependent, such as power load fluctuations over time. This dependent nature can lead to diminished model performance in testing or real-world applications. Motivated to make intelligent predictions for time series data, we present an autoregressive SPO method directly targeting the optimization problem at the decision stage in this paper, where the conditions of consistency are no longer met. Therefore, we first analyze the generalization bounds of the SPO loss within our autoregressive model. Subsequently, the uniform calibration results in Liu and Grigas [2] are extended in the proposed model. Finally, we conduct experiments to empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the SPO+ surrogate compared to the absolute loss and the least squares loss, especially when the cost vectors are determined by stationary dynamical systems and demonstrate the relationship between normalized regret and mixing coefficients.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Initialization of Object-Oriented Advanced Thermal Power Generation System Models with Application to the Case of the SOS-CO2 Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forthcoming energy transition calls for a new generation of thermal power generation systems with low- or zero-emission and highly flexible operation. Dynamic modelling and simulation is a key enabling factor in this field, as controlling such plants is a difficult task for which there is no previous experience and very short design times are expected. The steady-state initialization of those dynamic models is an essential step in the design process, but is unfortunately a difficult task which involves the numerical solution of large systems of nonlinear equations with iterative Newton methods, which is often prone to numerical failures.
  In this work, several strategies and methodologies are discussed to successfully achieve steady-state initialization of first-principles equation-based, object-oriented models of advanced thermal power generation systems. These are presented in the context of the Modelica modelling language, but could be applied to other equation-based, object-oriented modelling and simulation environments.
  Finally, the successful application of such strategies and methodologies to the SOS-CO2 advanced power generation system is presented.</description>

      <title>Distributed Coordination of Grid-Forming and Grid-Following Inverter-Based Resources for Optimal Frequency Control in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the fast-growing penetration of power inverter-interfaced renewable generation, power systems face significant challenges in maintaining power balance and the nominal frequency. This paper studies the grid-level coordinated control of a mix of grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) inverter-based resources (IBRs) for power system frequency regulation at scale. Specifically, a fully distributed optimal frequency control algorithm is proposed by leveraging the projected primal-dual gradient method and the structure of the physical system dynamics. This algorithm 1) restores the nominal frequency, 2) minimizes the total control cost, 3) respects the IBR power limits and the line thermal constraints, and 4) is implemented in a distributed fashion that only needs local measurement and local communication. The effectiveness and optimality of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated through high-fidelity electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations on the IEEE 39-bus system.</description>

      <title>Transmission Line Outage Probability Prediction Under Extreme Events Using Peter-Clark Bayesian Structural Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a notable increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. With a rising number of power outages caused by these events, accurate prediction of power line outages is essential for safe and reliable operation of power grids. The Bayesian network is a probabilistic model that is very effective for predicting line outages under weather-related uncertainties. However, most existing studies in this area offer general risk assessments, but fall short of providing specific outage probabilities. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for predicting transmission line outage probabilities using a Bayesian network combined with Peter-Clark (PC) structural learning. Our approach not only enables precise outage probability calculations, but also demonstrates better scalability and robust performance, even with limited data. Case studies using data from BPA and NOAA show the effectiveness of this approach, while comparisons with several existing methods further highlight its advantages.</description>

      <title>On-the-Go Path Planning and Repair in Static and Dynamic Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous systems, including robots and drones, face significant challenges when navigating through dynamic environments, particularly within urban settings where obstacles, fluctuating traffic, and pedestrian activity are constantly shifting. Although, traditional motion planning algorithms like the wavefront planner and gradient descent planner, which use potential functions, work well in static environments, they fall short in situations where the environment is continuously changing. This work proposes a dynamic, real-time path planning approach specifically designed for autonomous systems, allowing them to effectively avoid static and dynamic obstacles, thereby enhancing their overall adaptability. The approach integrates the efficiency of conventional planners with the ability to make rapid adjustments in response to moving obstacles and environmental changes. The simulation results discussed in this article demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating its suitability for robotic path planning in both known and unknown environments, including those involving mobile objects, agents, or potential threats.</description>

      <title>Stability and Performance Analysis on Self-dual Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonsymmetric solutions to certain Lyapunov and Riccati equations and inequalities with coefficient matrices corresponding to cone-preserving dynamical systems. Most results presented here appear to be novel even in the special case of positive systems. First, we provide a simple eigenvalue criterion for a Sylvester equation to admit a cone-preserving solution. For a single system preserving a self-dual cone, this reduces to stability. Further, we provide a set of conditions equivalent to testing a given H-infinity norm bound, as in the bounded real lemma. These feature the stability of a coefficient matrix similar to the Hamiltonian, a solution to two conic inequalities, and a stabilizing cone-preserving solution to a nonsymmetric Riccati equation. Finally, we show that the H-infinity norm is attained at zero frequency.</description>

      <title>Tangential Randomization in Linear Bandits (TRAiL): Guaranteed Inference and Regret Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze TRAiL (Tangential Randomization in Linear Bandits), a computationally efficient regret-optimal forced exploration algorithm for linear bandits on action sets that are sublevel sets of strongly convex functions. TRAiL estimates the governing parameter of the linear bandit problem through a standard regularized least squares and perturbs the reward-maximizing action corresponding to said point estimate along the tangent plane of the convex compact action set before projecting back to it. Exploiting concentration results for matrix martingales, we prove that TRAiL ensures a $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ growth in the inference quality, measured via the minimum eigenvalue of the design (regressor) matrix with high-probability over a $T$-length period. We build on this result to obtain an $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T} \log(T))$ upper bound on cumulative regret with probability at least $ 1 - 1/T$ over $T$ periods, and compare TRAiL to other popular algorithms for linear bandits. Then, we characterize an $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ minimax lower bound for any algorithm on the expected regret that covers a wide variety of action/parameter sets and noise processes. Our analysis not only expands the realm of lower-bounds in linear bandits significantly, but as a byproduct, yields a trade-off between regret and inference quality. Specifically, we prove that any algorithm with an $\mathcal{O}(T^\alpha)$ expected regret growth must have an $\Omega(T^{1-\alpha})$ asymptotic growth in expected inference quality. Our experiments on the $L^p$ unit ball as action sets reveal how this relation can be violated, but only in the short-run, before returning to respect the bound asymptotically. In effect, regret-minimizing algorithms must have just the right rate of inference -- too fast or too slow inference will incur sub-optimal regret growth.</description>

      <title>Sensor-fusion based Prognostics Framework for Complex Engineering Systems Exhibiting Multiple Failure Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex engineering systems are often subject to multiple failure modes. Developing a remaining useful life (RUL) prediction model that does not consider the failure mode causing degradation is likely to result in inaccurate predictions. However, distinguishing between causes of failure without manually inspecting the system is nontrivial. This challenge is increased when the causes of historically observed failures are unknown. Sensors, which are useful for monitoring the state-of-health of systems, can also be used for distinguishing between multiple failure modes as the presence of multiple failure modes results in discriminatory behavior of the sensor signals. When systems are equipped with multiple sensors, some sensors may exhibit behavior correlated with degradation, while other sensors do not. Furthermore, which sensors exhibit this behavior may differ for each failure mode. In this paper, we present a simultaneous clustering and sensor selection approach for unlabeled training datasets of systems exhibiting multiple failure modes. The cluster assignments and the selected sensors are then utilized in real-time to first diagnose the active failure mode and then to predict the system RUL. We validate the complete pipeline of the methodology using a simulated dataset of systems exhibiting two failure modes and on a turbofan degradation dataset from NASA.</description>

      <title>A Control Lyapunov Function Approach to Event-Triggered Parameterized Control for Discrete-Time Linear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an event-triggered parameterized control method using a control Lyapunov function approach for discrete time linear systems with external disturbances. In this control method, each control input to the plant is a linear combination of a fixed set of linearly independent scalar functions. The controller updates the coefficients of the parameterized control input in an event-triggered manner so as to minimize a quadratic cost function subject to quadratic constraints and communicates the same to the actuator. We design an event-triggering rule that guarantees global uniform ultimate boundedness of trajectories of the closed loop system and non-trivial inter-event times. We illustrate our results through numerical examples and we also compare the performance of the proposed control method with other existing control methods in the literature.</description>

      <title>Robotic transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement with hybrid enhanced intelligence: a new paradigm and first-in-vivo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transcatheter tricuspid valve replacement (TTVR) is the latest treatment for tricuspid regurgitation and is in the early stages of clinical adoption. Intelligent robotic approaches are expected to overcome the challenges of surgical manipulation and widespread dissemination, but systems and protocols with high clinical utility have not yet been reported. In this study, we propose a complete solution that includes a passive stabilizer, robotic drive, detachable delivery catheter and valve manipulation mechanism. Working towards autonomy, a hybrid augmented intelligence approach based on reinforcement learning, Monte Carlo probabilistic maps and human-robot co-piloted control was introduced. Systematic tests in phantom and first-in-vivo animal experiments were performed to verify that the system design met the clinical requirement. Furthermore, the experimental results confirmed the advantages of co-piloted control over conventional master-slave control in terms of time efficiency, control efficiency, autonomy and stability of operation. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive pathway for robotic TTVR and, to our knowledge, completes the first animal study that not only successfully demonstrates the application of hybrid enhanced intelligence in interventional robotics, but also provides a solution with high application value for a cutting-edge procedure.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Day-Ahead Battery Scheduling based on Mixed Random Variables for Enhanced Grid Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources introduces significant challenges to power grid stability, primarily due to their inherent variability. A new opportunity for grid operation is the smart integration of electricity production combined with battery storages in residential buildings. This study explores how residential battery systems can aid in stabilizing the power grid by flexibly managing deviations from forecasted residential power consumption and PV generation. The key contribution of this work is the development of an analytical approach that enables the asymmetric allocation of quantified power uncertainties between a residential battery system and the power grid, introducing a new degree of freedom into the scheduling problem. This is accomplished by employing mixed random variables - characterized by both continuous and discrete events - to model battery and grid power uncertainties. These variables are embedded into a continuous stochastic optimization framework, which computes probabilistic schedules for battery operation and power exchange with the grid. Test cases demonstrate that the proposed framework can be used effectively to reduce and quantify grid uncertainties while minimizing electricity costs. It is also shown that residential battery systems can be actively used to provide flexibility during critical periods of grid operation. Overall, this framework empowers prosumers to take an active role in grid stabilization, contributing to a more resilient and adaptive energy system.</description>

      <title>ACING: Actor-Critic for Instruction Learning in Black-Box Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving tasks vastly depends on the quality of the instructions, which often require fine-tuning through extensive human effort. This highlights the need for automated instruction optimization; however, this optimization is particularly challenging when dealing with black-box LLMs, where model parameters and gradients remain inaccessible. We propose ACING, a task-specific prompt optimization approach framed as a stateless continuous-action Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem, known as the continuum bandit setting. ACING leverages an actor-critic-based method to optimize prompts, learning from non-differentiable reward signals. We validate ACING by optimizing prompts for ChatGPT on 30 instruction-based tasks. ACING consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving a median score improvement of 10 percentage points. Furthermore, ACING not only recovers but also surpasses human-crafted expert instructions, achieving up to a 39 percentage point improvement against human benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine a class of optimization problems involving the optimal operation of a single lossy energy storage system, where energy losses occur during charging and discharging. These inefficiencies typically lead to a nonconvex set of feasible charging and discharging power profiles. In this paper, we derive an equivalent reformulation of this class of optimization problems by eliminating the charging and discharging power variables and recasting the problem entirely in terms of the storage state-of-charge variables. We show that the feasible set of the proposed reformulation is always convex. We also provide sufficient conditions under which the objective function of the proposed reformulation is guaranteed to be convex. The conditions provided both unify and generalize many existing conditions for convexity in the literature.</description>

      <title>Cross-Forming Control and Fault Current Limiting for Grid-Forming Inverters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13376v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article proposes a "cross-forming" control concept for grid-forming inverters operating against grid faults. Cross-forming refers to voltage angle forming and current magnitude forming. It differs from classical grid-forming and grid-following paradigms that feature voltage magnitude-and-angle forming and voltage magnitude-and-angle following (or current magnitude-and-angle forming), respectively. The cross-forming concept addresses the need for inverters to remain grid-forming (particularly voltage angle forming, as required by grid codes) while managing fault current limitation. Simple and feasible cross-forming control implementations are proposed, enabling inverters to quickly limit fault currents to a prescribed level while preserving voltage angle forming for grid-forming synchronization and providing dynamic ancillary services, during symmetrical or asymmetrical fault ride-through. Moreover, the cross-forming control yields an equivalent system featuring a constant virtual impedance and a "normal form" representation, allowing for the extension of previously established transient stability results to include scenarios involving current saturation. Simulations and experiments validate the efficacy of the proposed cross-forming control implementations.</description>

      <title>Information-Theoretic Opacity-Enforcement in Markov Decision Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper studies information-theoretic opacity, an information-flow privacy property, in a setting involving two agents: A planning agent who controls a stochastic system and an observer who partially observes the system states. The goal of the observer is to infer some secret, represented by a random variable, from its partial observations, while the goal of the planning agent is to make the secret maximally opaque to the observer while achieving a satisfactory total return. Modeling the stochastic system using a Markov decision process, two classes of opacity properties are considered -- Last-state opacity is to ensure that the observer is uncertain if the last state is in a specific set and initial-state opacity is to ensure that the observer is unsure of the realization of the initial state. As the measure of opacity, we employ the Shannon conditional entropy capturing the information about the secret revealed by the observable. Then, we develop primal-dual policy gradient methods for opacity-enforcement planning subject to constraints on total returns. We propose novel algorithms to compute the policy gradient of entropy for each observation, leveraging message passing within the hidden Markov models. This gradient computation enables us to have stable and fast convergence. We demonstrate our solution of opacity-enforcement control through a grid world example.</description>

Abstract: Living organisms interact with their surroundings in a closed-loop fashion, where sensory inputs dictate the initiation and termination of behaviours. Even simple animals are able to develop and execute complex plans, which has not yet been replicated in robotics using pure closed-loop input control. We propose a solution to this problem by defining a set of discrete and temporary closed-loop controllers, called "tasks", each representing a closed-loop behaviour. We further introduce a supervisory module which has an innate understanding of physics and causality, through which it can simulate the execution of task sequences over time and store the results in a model of the environment. On the basis of this model, plans can be made by chaining temporary closed-loop controllers. The proposed framework was implemented for a real robot and tested in two scenarios as proof of concept.</description>

      <title>SAFE-GIL: SAFEty Guided Imitation Learning for Robotic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05249v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Behavior cloning (BC) is a widely-used approach in imitation learning, where a robot learns a control policy by observing an expert supervisor. However, the learned policy can make errors and might lead to safety violations, which limits their utility in safety-critical robotics applications. While prior works have tried improving a BC policy via additional real or synthetic action labels, adversarial training, or runtime filtering, none of them explicitly focus on reducing the BC policy's safety violations during training time. We propose SAFE-GIL, a design-time method to learn safety-aware behavior cloning policies. SAFE-GIL deliberately injects adversarial disturbance in the system during data collection to guide the expert towards safety-critical states. This disturbance injection simulates potential policy errors that the system might encounter during the test time. By ensuring that training more closely replicates expert behavior in safety-critical states, our approach results in safer policies despite policy errors during the test time. We further develop a reachability-based method to compute this adversarial disturbance. We compare SAFE-GIL with various behavior cloning techniques and online safety-filtering methods in three domains: autonomous ground navigation, aircraft taxiing, and aerial navigation on a quadrotor testbed. Our method demonstrates a significant reduction in safety failures, particularly in low data regimes where the likelihood of learning errors, and therefore safety violations, is higher.

Abstract: Automated vehicles rely on an accurate and robust perception of the environment. Similarly to automated cars, highly automated trains require an environmental perception. Although there is a lot of research based on either camera or LiDAR sensors in the automotive domain, very few contributions for this task exist yet for automated trains. Additionally, no public dataset or described approach for a 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation in the railway environment exists yet. Thus, we propose an approach for a point-wise 3D semantic segmentation based on the 2DPass network architecture using scans and images jointly. In addition, we present a semi-automated intelligent data annotation approach, which we use to efficiently and accurately label the required dataset recorded on a railway track in Germany. To improve performance despite a still small number of labeled scans, we apply an active learning approach to intelligently select scans for the training dataset. Our contributions are threefold: We annotate rail data including camera and LiDAR data from the railway environment, transfer label the raw LiDAR point clouds using an image segmentation network, and train a state-of-the-art 3D LiDAR semantic segmentation network efficiently leveraging active learning. The trained network achieves good segmentation results with a mean IoU of 71.48% of 9 classes.</description>
