      <title>Solving Crystal Structures by Carrying Out the Calculation of the Single-Atom R1 Method in a Lottery Mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As originally designed [Zhang &amp; Donahue (2024), Acta Cryst. A80, 2370248.], after one cycle of calculation, the single-atom R1 (sR1) method required a user to intelligently determine a partial structure to start the next cycle. In this paper, a lottery scheme has been designed to randomly split a parent model into two child models. This allows the calculation to be carried out in care-free manner. By chance, one child model may have higher amounts of "good" atoms than the parent model. Thus, its expansion in the next cycle favors an improved model. These "lucky" results are carried onto the next cycles. while "unlucky" results in which no improvements occur are discarded. Furthermore, unchanged models are carried onto the next cycles in those "unlucky" occasions. On average a child model has the same fraction of "good" atoms as the parent. Only a substantial statistical fluctuation results in appreciable deviation. This lottery scheme works because such fluctuations do happen. Indeed, test applications with the computing power accessibly by the author have demonstrated that the designed scheme can drive an sR1 calculation to or close to reaching a correct structure solution.</description>

      <title>BoostMD: Accelerating molecular sampling by leveraging ML force field features from previous time-steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating atomic-scale processes, such as protein dynamics and catalytic reactions, is crucial for advancements in biology, chemistry, and materials science. Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) have emerged as powerful tools that achieve near quantum mechanical accuracy, with promising generalization capabilities. However, their practical use is often limited by long inference times compared to classical force fields, especially when running extensive molecular dynamics (MD) simulations required for many biological applications. In this study, we introduce BoostMD, a surrogate model architecture designed to accelerate MD simulations. BoostMD leverages node features computed at previous time steps to predict energies and forces based on positional changes. This approach reduces the complexity of the learning task, allowing BoostMD to be both smaller and significantly faster than conventional MLFFs. During simulations, the computationally intensive reference MLFF is evaluated only every $N$ steps, while the lightweight BoostMD model handles the intermediate steps at a fraction of the computational cost. Our experiments demonstrate that BoostMD achieves an eight-fold speedup compared to the reference model and generalizes to unseen dipeptides. Furthermore, we find that BoostMD accurately samples the ground-truth Boltzmann distribution when running molecular dynamics. By combining efficient feature reuse with a streamlined architecture, BoostMD offers a robust solution for conducting large-scale, long-timescale molecular simulations, making high-accuracy ML-driven modeling more accessible and practical.</description>

      <title>Eigensolutions and thermodynamic properties of generalized hyperbolic Hulthen and Woods-Saxon potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the solutions of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation and the thermodynamic properties of generalized hyperbolic Hulthen and Woods-Saxon potential. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions were found using the parametric Nikiforov-Uvarov method (PNUM). The clean energies of the molecules HCl, NiC, CO, I$_2$, H$_2$, LiH, CuLi and CrH are calculated for certain values of $n$ and $\ell$. They are positive and close to the energy of the ground state ($n= \ell= 0$) in the case of the atomic unit (whose energies become negative for $n=2$). The figures show that the proper energies decrease as $n$, $\ell$, $\alpha$ increase, while they increase as $m$ increases, which confirms the results obtained in the literature. The obtained energy was used to calculate the partition function from which thermodynamic properties such as average energy, specific heat capacity, entropy and free energy are calculated. Numerical results are generated for this generalized hyperbolic Hulthen and Woods-Saxon potential. This study showed that the disorder decreases if the temperature decreases and this decrease is more rapid for HCl and H$_{2}$ molecules.</description>

      <title>The Excited States of Chichibabin, M\"uller and related Singlet Diradicaloids based on Polyhalogenated Trityl Radicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tris(2,4,6-trichlorophenyl)methyl radical (TTM) has inspired the synthesis of several luminescent diradicals and diradicaloids, providing an extraordinary opportunity to control the nature of the low-lying excited states by fine-tuning the diradical character. However, the photophysical properties of TTM-derived diradicals remain not fully understood yet. Here we present a comprehensive theoretical investigation on a series of symmetric TTM-derived diradicals, featuring radical moieties separated by pi-conjugated spacers of different length with distinct conjugation extension. All these diradicals exhibit a singlet electronic ground state. The nature of the lowest excited electronic states that control the pho-tophysical behavior of the diradicals, is discussed in detail. The theoretical study is complemented by a complete spectro-scopic characterization of the TTM-TTM diradical, synthesized using a novel, simpler and more efficient procedure ex-ploiting the unique reactivity of TTM. The lowest excited states of the diradicals differ qualitatively from those of TTM: two novel low-lying states emerge in the diradical, due to charge resonance (CR) between the two radical units. The low-est CR state is a dark state for symmetric diradicals. The CR nature explains the blue-shifted emission observed by in-creasing the distance between the radical centres as seen in TTM-ph-TTM. This insight suggests different design strate-gies to improve the luminescence properties of TTM-derived diradicals.</description>

      <title>Label-free SERS Discrimination of Proline from Hydroxylated Proline at Single-molecule Level Assisted by a Deep Learning Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discriminating the low-abundance hydroxylated proline from hydroxylated proline is crucial for monitoring diseases and eval-uating therapeutic outcomes that require single-molecule sensors. While the plasmonic nanopore sensor can detect the hydrox-ylation with single-molecule sensitivity by surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), it suffers from intrinsic fluctuations of single-molecule signals as well as strong interference from citrates. Here, we used the occurrence frequency histogram of the single-molecule SERS peaks to extract overall dataset spectral features, overcome the signal fluctuations and investigate the citrate-replaced plasmonic nanopore sensors for clean and distinguishable signals of proline and hydroxylated proline. By ligand exchange of the citrates by analyte molecules, the representative peaks of citrates decreased with incubation time, prov-ing occupation of the plasmonic hot spot by the analytes. As a result, the discrimination of the single-molecule SERS signals of proline and hydroxylated proline was possible with the convolutional neural network model with 96.6% accuracy.</description>

      <title>Predicting Accurate X-ray Absorption Spectra for CN$^+$, CN$^\bullet$, and CN$^-$: Insights from First-Principles Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is an essential tool in X-ray astronomy, enabling detailed studies of celestial objects and their physical and chemical properties. However, comprehensive mapping of high-resolution X-ray spectra for even simple interstellar and circumstellar molecules is still lacking. In this study, we conducted systematic quantum chemical simulations to predict the C1s X-ray absorption spectra of CN$^+$, CN, and CN$^-$. Our findings provide valuable references for both X-ray astronomy and laboratory studies. We assigned the first electronic peak of CN$^+$ and CN to C1s $\rightarrow \sigma^*$ transitions, while the peak for CN$^-$ corresponds to a C1s $\rightarrow \pi^*$ transition. We further calculated the vibronic fine structures for these transitions using the quantum wavepacket method based on multiconfigurational-level, anharmonic potential energy curves, revealing distinct energy positions for the 0-0 absorptions at 280.7 eV, 279.6 eV, and 285.8 eV. Each vibronic profile features a prominent 0-0 peak, showing overall similarity but differing intensity ratios of the 0-0 and 0-1 peaks. Notably, introducing a C1s core hole leads to shortened C-N bond lengths and increased vibrational frequencies across all species. These findings enhance our understanding of the electronic structures and X-ray spectra of carbon-nitrogen species, emphasizing the influence of charge state on X-ray absorptions.</description>

      <title>Orbital Surface Hopping from Orbital Quantum-Classical Liouville Equation for Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Many-electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate simulation the many-electronic nonadiabatic dynamics process at metal surfaces remains as a significant task. In this work, we present an orbital surface hopping (OSH) algorithm rigorously derived from the orbital quantum classical Liouville equation (o-QCLE) to deal with nonadiabatic dynamics for many-electron systems. This OSH algorithm closely connects with the popular Independent Electron Surface Hopping (IESH) method, which has shown remarkable success in addressing these nonadiabatic phenomena, except that electrons hop between orbitals. We compare OSH with IESH approach and benchmark these two algorithms against the surface hopping method with a full Configuration Interaction (FCI) wavefunction. Our approach shows strong agreement with IESH and FCI-SH results for molecular orbital populations and kinetic energy relaxation and in high efficiency, demonstrating the ability of the new OSH method in capturing key aspects of many-electronic nonadiabatic dynamics.</description>

      <title>Silver Nanoplates: Theoretical and Experimental Characterization. Study of SERS Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal nanostructures have received significant attention in recent years owing to their peculiar physical and chemical properties, which span a wide range of practical applications in a variety of scientific and engineering fields. Herein, we report a study of the optical properties and application in the field enhancement of silver nanoplates (Ag-Nplates) obtained by two-step chemical synthesis. Optical Extinction Spectroscopy (OES), together with a detailed theoretical analysis of the experimental spectra, was used to characterize the size distribution, morphology, and optical spectral behavior of the obtained suspensions. These studies were complemented with shape and size distribution analyses using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM). It was observed by both techniques that these characteristics are related to the concentration of silver spherical nanoparticles (Ag-Seeds) added during the synthesis of Ag-Nplates. A decrease in the Ag-Seed amount produces an infrared shift of the main plasmon peak with respect to the neat Ag-Seeds suspension, which is related to the size growth of Ag-Nplates showing size distributions centered in the edge length range of 12-15 nm and 34-36 nm for the experimental spectra, whose plasmon peak positions are at 543 nm (higher Ag-Seeds concentration) and 815 nm (lower Ag-Seed concentration), respectively. The detection of Brilliant Blue (BB) by Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS) was successfully probed with the incorporation of Ag-Nplates in an agarose gel.</description>

      <title>The Key Steps and Distinct Performance Trends of Pyrrolic vs. Pyridinic M-N-C Catalysts in Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction(NO3RR)offers a sustainable route for ambient ammonia synthesis. While metal-nitrogen-carbon (M-N-C) single-atom catalysts have emerged as promising candidates for NO3RR, the structure-activity relations underlying their catalytic behavior remain to be elucidated. Through systematic analysis of reported experimental data and pH-field coupled microkinetic modelling on a reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) scale, we reveal that the coordination-dependent activity originates from distinct scaling relations governed by metal-intermediate interactions. M-N-Pyrrolic catalysts demonstrate higher turnover frequencies for ammonia production, whereas M-N-Pyridinic catalysts exhibit broader activity ranges across the activity volcano plot. Meanwhile, the adsorption and protonation of nitrate, which is a step often dismissed and/or assumed to be simultaneous in many previous reports, is identified to be the rate-determining step (RDS) in NO3RR. Remarkably, our subsequent experimental validation confirms the theoretical predictions under both neutral and alkaline conditions. This study offers a comprehensive mechanistic framework for interpreting the electrocatalytic activity of M-N-C catalysts in NO3RR, showing that a classical thermodynamic limiting-potential model is not sufficiently accurate to capture the RDS and the catalytic performance trends of different materials (even on M-N-Pyrrolic and M-N-Pyridinic catalysts). These findings provide brand new insights into the reaction mechanism of NO3RR and establish fundamental design principles for electrocatalytic ammonia synthesis.</description>

      <title>Photoreforming of plastic waste into valuable products and hydrogen using a high-entropy oxynitride with distorted atomic-scale structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The persistent existence of plastic waste causes serious problems for the environment, directly and indirectly affecting the health of organisms and humans. Photoreforming is a nature-friendly method that only uses solar energy to convert plastic waste into green hydrogen (H2) and valuable organic products. This study shows that a high-entropy oxynitride (HEON) photocatalyst, synthesized by the addition of nitrogen to a Ti-Zr-Hf-Nb-Ta-containing high-entropy oxide (HEO), exhibits a higher potential for the production of H2, formic acid and acetic acid from polyethylene terephthalate (PET) photoreforming compared to the relevant HEO. Examination of X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) by synchrotron light shows that, in addition to hybridization of 2p orbitals from oxygen and nitrogen, nitrogen atoms distort the structure and completely change the neighborhood of niobium and titanium (a main contributor to the conduction band), expands the atomic bonds of zirconium and tantalum, contracts the atomic bonds of hafnium and decreases the binding energy of titanium, niobium and tantalum. These electronic structure changes lead to a narrower bandgap and diminished electron-hole recombination, enhancing the photoreforming performance. This study introduces HEONs with distorted atomic bond structures as efficient low-bandgap and stable catalysts for transforming plastics into high-value organic chemicals and H2 by photocatalysis.</description>

      <title>Tensor hypercontraction for self-consistent vertex corrected GW with static and dynamic screening; applications to molecules and solids with superexchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For molecules and solids, we developed efficient MPI-parallel algorithms for evaluating the second-order exchange term with bare, statically screened, and dynamically screened interactions. We employ the resulting term in a fully self-consistent manner together with scGW, resulting in the following vertex-corrected scGW schemes: scGWSOX, scGWSOSEX, scGW2SOSEX, and scG3W2theories. We show that for the vertex evaluation, the reduction of scaling by tensor hypercontraction (THC) has two limiting execution regimes. We used the resulting code to perform the largest (by the number of orbitals) fully self-consistent calculations with the SOX term. We demonstrate that our procedure allows for a reliable evaluation of even small energy differences. Utilizing a broken-symmetry approach, we explore the influence of the SOX term on the effective magnetic exchange couplings. We show that the treatment of SOX has a significant impact on the obtained values of the effective exchange constants, which we explain through a self-energy dependence on an effective dielectric constant. We confirm this explanation by analyzing natural orbitals and local changes in charge transfer quantifying superexchange. Our analysis explains the structure of weak electron correlation responsible for the modulation of superexchange in both molecules and solids. Finally, for solids, we evaluate Neel temperatures utilizing the high-temperature expansion and compare the results obtained with experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Identifying Split Vacancies with Foundation Models and Electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point defects are ubiquitous in solid-state compounds, dictating many functional properties such as conductivity, catalytic activity and carrier recombination. Over the past decade, the prevalence of metastable defect geometries and their importance to relevant properties has been increasingly recognised. A particularly striking example of this is split vacancies, where an isolated atomic vacancy transforms to a stoichiometry-conserving complex of two vacancies and an interstitial ($V_X \rightarrow [V_X + X_i + V_X]$), which can be accompanied by a dramatic lowering of the defect energy and change in behaviour. Such species are particularly challenging to identify from computation, due to the `non-local' nature of this reconstruction. Here, I present an approach for efficiently identifying such species in solid-state compounds, through tiered screening which combines geometric analysis, electrostatic energies and foundation machine learning (ML) models. This approach allows the screening of all compounds in the Materials Project database (including all entries in the ICSD, along with several thousand predicted metastable materials), identifying thousands of split vacancy configurations, hitherto unknown. This study highlights both the potential utility of machine-learning potentials for defect investigations, with important caveats, and the importance of global optimisation approaches for correctly identifying stable defect geometries.</description>

Abstract: This review outlines the main results which show the dual nature of the chemical bond in diatomic beryllium molecule in the ground $X^1\Sigma_g^+$ state. It has been shown that the beryllium atoms are covalently bound at low-lying vibrational energy levels ({\nu}=0-4), while at higher ones ({\nu}=5-11) they are bound by van der Waals forces near the right turning points. High precision ab initio quantum calculations of Be$_2$ resulted in the development of the modified expanded Morse oscillator potential function which contains all twelve vibrational energy levels [A.V. Mitin, Chem. Phys. Lett. 682, 30 (2017)]. The dual nature of chemical bond in Be$_2$ is evidenced as a sharp corner on the attractive branch of the ground state potential curve. Moreover, it has been found that the Douglas-Kroll-Hess relativistic corrections also show a sharp corner when presented in dependence on the internuclear separation. The difference in energy between the extrapolated and calculated multi-reference configuration interaction energies in dependence on the internuclear separation also exhibits singular point in the same region. The other problems of ab initio quantum calculations of the beryllium dimer are also discussed. Calculated spectrum of vibrational-rotational bound states and new metastable states of the beryllium dimer in the ground state important for laser spectroscopy are presented. The vibration problem was solved for the modified expanded Morse oscillator potential function and for the potential function obtained with Slater-type orbitals [M. Lesiuk et al, Chem. Theory Comput. 15, 2470 (2019)]. The theoretical upper and lower estimates of the spectrum of vibrational-rotational bound states and the spectrum of rotational-vibrational metastable states with complex-valued energy eigenvalues and the scattering length in the beryllium dimer are presented.</description>

Abstract: The formation of the four three-ring systems \ce{c-(CH2)_{3-k}(SiH2)_{k}}, ($k=0$: cyclopropane, $k=1$: silirane, $k=2$: disilirane, $k=3$: cyclotrisilane) by addition of methylene and silylene to the double bond in ethene, disilene, and silaethene, as well as the elimination of the carbene analogs from the three-rings, was studied with CAS(4,4) wave functions in both $C_{2v}$ and $C_s$ symmetry. To reveal charge and spin redistribution during these reactions the CAS(4,4) wave functions were analyzed using the orthogonal valence bond method (OVB). The potential energy curves, different internal coordinates, and the results of the OVB analysis show, that frequently the addition and elimination reactions follow different minimum energy paths, because they are indeed diabatic reactions. In these cases, there are no energy barriers corresponding to saddle points on the potential energy surfaces but the energy increases during one diabatic reaction until, at a certain point, the system jumps to the other diabatic state and, in the following, the energy decreases. This happens for reactions in $C_{2v}$ symmetry; as soon as the system can change to the lower symmetry, the diabatic states combine to an adiabatic one and the reaction follows a single minimum energy path.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of piezoelectric response in V doped LiNbO3 films deposited by RF magnetron sputtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20864v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LiNbO3 films doped with vanadium (V) were deposited using RF magnetron sputtering technique. To realize doping with a wider range of V concentration, a 30 mm V metal inlaid target asymmetrically embedded in the 150 mm lithium niobate target was used. The V concentration in the deposited films was a decreasing function of the distance from the V target. The V/Nb ratio in the film decreased from 0.155 to 0.024. Surface and inner morphology and structure, phase and element composition, microstructure, and ferroelectric properties of the undoped and V doped LiNbO3 films were studied. The measured maximal d33 constant of the LiNbVO film with V/Nb ratio of 0.07 was about three times higher than that of the undoped LiNbO3 film, 13.5 pC/N and 4.76 pC/N, respectively. The optimal composition in the deposition geometry used was within the V/Nb ratio range of 0.05 to 0.13. Undoped and V doped LiNbO3 thin films were used as bulk acoustic wave ultrasonic transducers deposited on stainless steel plates to generate longitudinal waves and compare their ultrasonic performance.</description>
