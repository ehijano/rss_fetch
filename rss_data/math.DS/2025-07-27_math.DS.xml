      <title>Electronic Equivalent of a Mechanical Impact Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel design of an electronic circuit that is equivalent to a mechanical discontinuous impact oscillator exhibiting hard impacts. The governing equations of the electronic circuit are derived to demonstrate its equivalence to the mechanical system. Numerical simulations of the electronic circuit are compared with those of the mechanical oscillator in both single and coupled configurations, showing a high degree of consistency between the two systems.</description>

      <title>Maximizing measures for countable alphabet shifts via blur shift spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For upper semi-continuous potentials defined on shifts over countable alphabets, this paper ensures sufficient conditions for the existence of a maximizing measure. We resort to the concept of blur shift, introduced by T. Almeida and M. Sobottka as a compactification method for countable alphabet shifts consisting of adding new symbols given by blurred subsets of the alphabet. Our approach extends beyond the Markovian case to encompass more general countable alphabet shifts. In particular, we guarantee a convex characterization and compactness for the set of blur invariant probabilities with respect to the discontinuous shift map.</description>

      <title>Maximizing entropy for power-free languages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A power-free language is characterized by the number of symbols used and a limit on how many times a block of symbols can repeat consecutively. For certain values of these parameters, it is known that the number of legal words grows exponentially fast with respect to length. In the terminology of dynamical systems and ergodic theory, this means that the corresponding shift space has positive topological entropy.
  We prove that in many cases, this shift space has a unique measure of maximal entropy. The proof uses a weak analogue of Bowen's specification property. The lack of any periodic points in power-free shift spaces stands in striking contrast to other applications of specification-based techniques, where the number of periodic points often has exponential growth rate given by the topological entropy.</description>

      <title>Order of dynamical and control systems on maximal compact subgroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we characterize the dynamical orders of minimal Morse components and, partially, of control sets on maximal compact subgroups of a semisimple Lie group as an algebraic order similar to the Bruhat order of the Weyl group. We call this order the extended Bruhat order of the extended Weyl group (or Weyl-Tits group), since it projects onto the Bruhat order and is obtained in an analogous way as the Bruhat order was historically obtained, as the incidence order of the Schubert cells in the maximal flag manifold, but now the Schubert cells in the maximal extended flag manifold.</description>

      <title>On the regularity of solutions to the Hamilton-Jacobi equations for the N-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that certain suitably renormalized value functions associated with the $d$-dimensional ($d\geq2$) $N$-body problem corresponding to different limiting shapes of expanding solutions, under the assumption that the center of mass is at the origin, are viscosity solutions of the associated Hamilton-Jacobi equation. We analyze their singularities, defined as the initial configurations for which the minimizer of the associated variational problem is not unique. Moreover, we estimate the size of the closure of the singular set by proving its $\mathcal{H}^{d(N-1)-1}$-rectifiability, and we provide an upper bound on the Hausdorff dimension of the set of regular conjugate points.</description>

      <title>Adding a fecundity-survival trade-off to a discrete population model with maturation delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although maturation delays of new individuals are frequently added in population models, researchers rarely account for the mortality of individuals between birth and maturity. Previous studies have added mortality of immature individuals to the maturation delay in discrete population models, finding that increasing the delay results in a decreased population level at equilibrium. Furthermore, increasing the maturation delay beyond a critical threshold ultimately leads to the extinction of the modeled species. Because maturation delays beyond one breeding cycle are often found in nature, clearly, maturation delays must also have a positive benefit leading to a trade-off. We explore such a trade-off by deriving a class of discrete single species models with a maturation delay and the realistic assumption of a reproductive trade-off. In this reproductive trade-off, although a prolonged maturation delay decreases the total probability of survival, the delay results in larger body sizes which we assume, based on some fish species, to result in higher fecundity. We examine two scenarios: density independent survival and cohort density dependent survival of immature individuals. For the mature and immature individuals, we consider two different, but popular, survival functions: the Beverton-Holt model and the Ricker model. Overall, we identify a positive maturation delay that maximizes the population size, which we refer to as "optimal maturation delay".</description>

      <title>Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Learning and Extrapolating System Dynamics Across Bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forecasting system behaviour near and across bifurcations is crucial for identifying potential shifts in dynamical systems. While machine learning has recently been used to learn critical transitions and bifurcation structures from data, most studies remain limited as they exclusively focus on discrete-time methods and local bifurcations. To address these limitations, we use Neural Ordinary Differential Equations which provide a continuous, data-driven framework for learning system dynamics. We apply our approach to a predator-prey system that features both local and global bifurcations, presenting a challenging test case. Our results show that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can recover underlying bifurcation structures directly from timeseries data by learning parameter-dependent vector fields. Notably, we demonstrate that Neural Ordinary Differential Equations can forecast bifurcations even beyond the parameter regions represented in the training data. We also assess the method's performance under limited and noisy data conditions, finding that model accuracy depends more on the quality of information that can be inferred from the training data, than on the amount of data available.</description>

      <title>The Doeblin-Lenstra conjecture: effective results and central limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish effective convergence rates in the Doeblin-Lenstra law, describing the limiting distribution of approximation coefficients arising from continued fraction convergents of a typical real number. More generally, we prove quantitative versions of the Doeblin-Lenstra law for best approximates in higher dimensions, as well as for points sampled from fractal measures on the real line, including the middle-third Cantor measure.
  Our method reduces the problem to proving effective convergence of Birkhoff averages for diagonal flows on spaces of unimodular lattices. A key step is to show that, despite the discontinuity of the observable of interest, it satisfies the regularity conditions on average required for effective ergodic theorems. For the fractal setting, we establish effective multi-equidistribution properties of self-similar measures under diagonal flow, extending recent work on single equidistribution by B\'enard, He and Zhang. As a consequence, we also obtain central limit theorems for these Diophantine statistics in both classical and fractal settings.</description>

      <title>Dual Mechanisms for Heterogeneous Responses of Inspiratory Neurons to Noradrenergic Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Respiration is an essential involuntary function necessary for survival. This poses a challenge for the control of breathing. The preB\"otzinger complex (preB\"otC) is a heterogeneous neuronal network responsible for driving the inspiratory rhythm. While neuromodulators such as norepinephrine (NE) allow it to be both robust and flexible for all living beings to interact with their environment, the basis for how neuromodulation impacts neuron-specific properties remains poorly understood. In this work, we examine how NE influences different preB\"otC neuronal subtypes by modeling its effects through modulating two key parameters: calcium-activated nonspecific cationic current gating conductance ($g_{\rm CAN}$) and inositol-triphosphate ($\rm IP_3$), guided by experimental studies. Our computational model captures the experimentally observed differential effects of NE on distinct preB\"otC bursting patterns. We show that this dual mechanism is critical for inducing conditional bursting and identify specific parameter regimes where silent neurons remain inactive in the presence of NE. Furthermore, using methods of dynamical systems theory, we uncover the mechanisms by which NE differentially modulates burst frequency and duration in NaP-dependent and CAN-dependent bursting neurons. These results align well with previously reported experimental findings and provide a deeper understanding of cell-specific neuromodulatory responses within the respiratory network.</description>

      <title>Analytic Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a novel EDMD-type algorithm that captures the spectrum of the Koopman operator defined on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space of analytic functions. This method, which we call analytic EDMD, relies on an orthogonal projection on polynomial subspaces, which is equivalent to a data-driven Taylor approximation. In the case of dynamics with a hyperbolic equilibrium, analytic EDMD demonstrates excellent performance to capture the lattice-structured Koopman spectrum based on the eigenvalues of the linearized system at the equilibrium. Moreover, it yields the Taylor approximation of associated principal eigenfunctions. Since the method preserves the triangular structure of the operator, it does not suffer from spectral pollution and, moreover, arbitrary accuracy on the spectrum can be reached with a fixed finite dimension of the approximation. The performance of analytic EDMD is illustrated with numerical examples and is assessed through a comparative study with related methods. Finally, the method is complemented with theoretical results, proving strong convergence of the eigenfunctions and providing error bounds on the spectrum estimation.</description>

      <title>L\'{e}vy-Khintchine Theorems: effective results and central limit theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20718v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The L\'evy-Khintchine theorem is a classical result in Diophantine approximation that describes the asymptotic growth of the denominators of convergents in the continued fraction expansion of a typical real number. An effective version of this theorem was proved by Phillip and Stackelberg (\textit{Math. Annalen}, 1969) and Central Limit Theorems were proved by several authors \cites{Ibragimov, Misevicius, Morita, Vallee}. In this work, we develop a new approach towards quantifying the L\'evy-Khintchine theorem. Our methods apply to the setting of higher-dimensional simultaneous Diophantine approximation, thereby providing an effective version of a theorem of Cheung and Chevallier (\textit{Annales scientifiques de l'ENS}, 2024). Further, we prove a Central Limit Theorem for best approximations in all dimensions. Unlike previous approaches to the one-dimensional problem, our approach relies on techniques from homogeneous dynamics.</description>
