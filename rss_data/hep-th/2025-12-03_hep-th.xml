      <title>Baby Universes in AdS$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss Euclidean geometries in AdS$_3$ whose Lorentzian slicing gives rise to closed baby universes with a spatial geometry given by genus $g\geq 2$ surfaces. Our setup only involves a two-dimensional holographic CFT defined on a higher genus Riemann surface and thus provides a well-posed alternative to shell states whose microscopic duals are less well understood. We find that geometries giving rise to baby universes are always subdominant. It follows that the baby universe does not provide a semi-classical description of the state since it is encoded in an exponentially suppressed part of the wave function. We then apply a prescription developed in \cite{Belin:2025wju} to make the baby universe geometry the leading saddle. In the process, the CFT state becomes mixed, in agreement with the qualitative gravitational picture. We show that the fluctuations in the baby universe are small, even at fixed central charge, making the geometry reliable in the semi-classical limit. Finally, we discuss the interpretation of this mixed state in pure gravity from the perspective of the Virasoro TQFT.</description>

      <title>Generalized Schur limit, modular differential equations and quantum monodromy traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore some aspects of the generalized Schur limit, defined in arXiv:2506.13764. Based on several examples, we conjecture that the generalized Schur limit as a function of $\alpha$ solves a modular linear differential equation of fixed order, with coefficients depending on $\alpha$. We also observe in examples that for Argyres-Douglas theories of type $(A_1,G)$ with $G=A_n,D_n$, the generalized Schur limit for certain negative integer values of $\alpha$, coincides with the trace of higher powers of the quantum monodromy operator. This hints at a more general correspondence between the wall-crossing invariant traces on the Coulomb branch and the generalized Schur limit, which is related to the Higgs branch.</description>

      <title>To gauge or to double gauge? Matrix models, global symmetry, and black hole cohomologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure of the Hilbert space of gauged matrix models with a global symmetry. In the first part of the paper, we focus on bosonic matrix models with $U(2)$ gauge group and $SO(d)$ global symmetry, and consider singlets under both the gauge and global symmetry. We show how such "double-gauged'' matrix models can be described in terms of a simpler $SO(3)$ single-matrix model. In the second part of the paper, we consider the so-called BMN subsector of the $\mathcal{N}=4$ $SU(N)$ super Yang-Mills theory, which is closely related to the BMN matrix model. Among the 1/16 BPS operators in this sector, "non-graviton'' operators were recently discovered, which are expected to relate to the microstates of supersymmetric $AdS_5$ black holes. We show that a double gauging of this model, where one projects onto $SU(3)_R$ $R$-symmetry singlets, considerably simplifies the analysis of the non-graviton spectrum. In particular, for low values of $N$, we show that (almost) all graviton operators project out of the spectrum, while important classes of non-graviton operators remain. In the $N=3$ case, we obtain a closed form expression for the superconformal index of singlet non-gravitons, which reveals structural features of their spectrum.</description>

      <title>Generalised 4d Partition Functions and Modular Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the equivalence of a class of generalised Schur partition functions $\mathcal Z_G(q;\alpha)$ of 4d $\mathcal N=2$ superconformal gauge theories to contour integral representations of vector-valued modular forms of the type that arise in 2d rational conformal field theories (RCFT). Concretely, we consider the $USp(2N)$ theory with $2N+2$ fundamental hypermultiplets and analytically prove that $\mathcal Z_{USp(2N)}(q;\alpha)$ satisfies an order-$(N+1)$ modular linear differential equation (MLDE) with vanishing Wronskian index, explaining how the parameter $\alpha$ of the former determines the parameters of the latter. Several connections are made to characters of RCFTs including unitary ones. We then propose a two-parameter extension $\mathcal Z_{USp(2N)}(q;\alpha,\beta)$ of the generalised Schur partition function. Finally, we relate the $\alpha=-k$ specialisation to quantum monodromy traces ${\rm Tr}\,M^k$ and formulate a conjecture linking their $k$-dependence to MLDEs.</description>

      <title>Wilson loops in ABJM theory reloaded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new technique for computing supersymmetric Wilson loops in the ABJM theory via supersymmetric localization, valid for arbitrary values of the rank of the gauge group $N$ and the Chern-Simons level $k$. The approach relies on an operator representation of the Wilson loops within the Fermi gas formalism in terms of the resolvent of a certain integral operator previously encountered in the computation of the ABJM partition function on the round three-sphere. By deriving a set of nontrivial relations for this resolvent, we obtain exact expressions for the generating functions of Wilson loops in terms of the partition function. For large $k$, these expressions reproduce the weak-coupling expansion of the Wilson loops, and in the large-$N$ limit at fixed $k$ they match previously obtained high-precision numerical results. This analysis also resolves the longstanding discrepancy between numerical data and the semiclassical expression for the $1/6$ BPS Wilson loop.</description>

      <title>(Iso)spin from Isospin in Top-Down Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the spin from isospin mechanism of Jackiw-Rebbi-Hasenfratz-'t Hooft, we study two SU(2) gauged supergravity solutions of the form $M_{d}\times\text{S}^{2}$ containing non-Abelian hedgehog monopole on the 2-sphere. Due to the presence of the monopole, the SO(3) isometry group of the 2-sphere is not a symmetry of the configuration. Instead, a diagonal combination of the SU(2) gauge and the SO(3) isometry of the 2-sphere is the true symmetry of the configuration. Uplifting the solutions to Type II, the gauge-isometry diagonal symmetry becomes a diagonal combination between the SO(3) symmetry of the 2-sphere and a SU(2) symmetry of a 3-sphere used to uplift the configuration. One of the uplifts is supersymmetric and corresponds to the I-brane theory on a 2-sphere. The second background is a deformation of $\text{AdS}_{5}\times\text{S}^{5}$ and is not supersymmetric. We study dilaton fluctuations on the later geometry. Due to the diagonal symmetry, the fluctuations show angular momentum mixing between the SU(2) and SO(3) spins, mimicking the spin from isospin mechanism.</description>

      <title>General Four-Loop Beta Function for Scalar-Fermion Theories in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present general four-loop template $\beta$-functions and anomalous field dimensions for renormalisable scalar-fermion theories in three dimensions. By imposing $\mathcal{N}=1$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry, we obtain relations between the template RGE coefficients, valid in any renormalisation scheme. Directly in $d=3$, we identify a new theory with a non-trivial IR fixed point that is under perturbative control in a large-$N$ limit. We provide up-to-date numerical results for all required massive tadpole master integrals up to four loops and complement them with analytic expressions where available.</description>

      <title>Generalizing fusion rules by shuffle: Symmetry-based classifications of nonlocal systems constructed from similarity transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study fusion rings, or symmetry topological field theories (SymTFTs), which lie outside the non-negative integer matrix representation (NIM-rep), by combining knowledge from generalized symmetry and that from pseudo-Hermitian systems. By applying the Galois shuffle operation to the SymTFTs, we reconstruct fusion rings that correspond to nonlocal CFTs constructed from the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs by applying the similarity transformations. The resultant SymTFTs are outside of NIM-rep, whereas they are ring isomorphic to the NIM-rep of the corresponding local nonunitary CFTs. We study the consequences of this correspondence between the nonlocal unitary model and local nonunitary models. We demonstrate the correspondence between their classifications of massive or massless renormalization group flows and the discrepancies between their boundary or domain wall phenomena. Our work reveals a new connection between ring isomorphism and similarity transformations, providing the fundamental implications of ring-theoretic ideas in the context of symmetry in physics.</description>

      <title>Ramp and plateau in bulk correlators within the disk topology in JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the solution of the information paradox in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity - manifested as a linear growth (ramp) followed by saturation (plateau) of matter correlators after an initial decay - is fully encoded in the next-to-leading-order steepest-descent approximation of the gravitational path integral. The correlators exhibiting this ramp-plateau behavior are those entangling the two sides of the eternal black hole, while those on the same side only show an exponential decay. This seems to imply that the information flows across the separate universes that are causally disconnected by the black hole horizon. Finally, we show that the dip-time, defined as the minimum of the correlator, grows inversely with the black hole temperature, as predicted by the holographic dual theory.</description>

      <title>Universality of pseudoentropy for deformed spheres in dS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the universal part of pseudoentropy for small shape deformations of spherical entangling surfaces in the context of de Sitter/conformal field theory (dS/CFT) correspondence. The leading correction at quadratic order in the deformation parameter is controlled by the coefficient of the two-point stress-energy tensor correlator, $C_T$, of the non-unitary dual CFT, and it retains the sign of the unperturbed result, thereby establishing the sphere as a local extremum. The same structure holds in higher-curvature theories, as we check explicitly for quadratic curvature gravity, suggesting a universal behavior across non-unitary holographic CFTs. Our findings extend the Mezei formula to the dS/CFT setting and indicate that the shape dependence of pseudoentropy in dS holography resembles that of entanglement entropy in AdS space.</description>

      <title>Interface Correlators in Symmetric Product Orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric product orbifolds provide a controlled environment to explore generic features of gauge theory and holography. The tractability of these theories lies in the complete characterisation of their gauge structure through holomorphic covering maps. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of generalised covering maps, which define a universal family of interfaces between symmetric product orbifolds. These interfaces coincide with the holographic interfaces that were recently proposed as duals to AdS$_2$ branes in pure NSNS AdS$_3$ backgrounds. The new covering-map description enables efficient evaluation of interface correlators via a generalisation of the Lunin-Mathur method. To organise these computations, we derive a generalised Riemann-Hurwitz formula for interface coverings and introduce novel diagrammatic rules that systematically classify these maps. The new framework allows us to define a concrete grand-canonical ensemble that has the correct properties to compute correlation functions dual to open string scattering amplitudes. Using the generalised Riemann-Hurwitz formula, we explicitly show that the correlators of the ensemble structurally match string perturbation theory to all orders in the string coupling.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The symmetries of asymptotically flat spacetimes impose constraints on observables at infinity. The consequences of this have been extensively explored for S-matrix elements, where soft theorems are known to be equivalent to Ward identities for asymptotic symmetries. However, recently there has been interest in broader classes of asymptotic observables. Here, we consider soft graviton insertions in the 'in-in' formalism. We derive a Ward identity for supertranslations and compute two point functions for the soft charges for 'in-in' correlators. We find that the connected memory correlators are non-trivial in this set up and can be straightforwardly inferred from the average null energy (ANEC) correlators using observations from celestial Conformal Field Theory (cCFT).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we investigate analytical properties of Weyl fermions in (2+1)-dimensional Lifshitz spacetimes. In particular, we are interested in obtaining geometric phases and verifying the existence of well-behaved fermionic zero modes. Using the Dirac phase method, we show how geometric phases naturally arise from the coupling between the fermionic fields and the Lifshitz geometry. We also present exact solutions of the zero modes by rewriting the Weyl equation as a system of supersymmetric equations.</description>

      <title>Singular $\alpha$-attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\alpha$-attractor models naturally appear in supergravity with hyperbolic geometry. The simplest versions of $\alpha$-attractors, T- and E-models, originate from theories with non-singular potentials. In canonical variables, these potentials have a plateau that is approached exponentially fast at large values of the inflaton field $\varphi$. In a closely related class of polynomial $\alpha$-attractors, or P-models, the potential is not singular, but its derivative is singular at the boundary. The resulting inflaton potential also has a plateau, but it is approached polynomially. In this paper, we will consider a more general class of potentials, which can be singular at the boundary of the moduli space, S-models. These potentials may have a short plateau, after which the potential may grow polynomially or exponentially at large values of the inflaton field. We will show that this class of models may provide a simple solution to the initial conditions problem for $\alpha$-attractors and may account for a very broad range of possible values of $n_{s}$ matching the recent ACT, SPT, and DESI data.</description>

      <title>Dualities and trialities in $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauged quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study new Seiberg-like dualities for 1d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories -- that is, supersymmetric gauged quantum mechanics -- with unitary gauge group and (anti)fundamental matter in chiral and fermi multiplets, and with non-zero Fayet--Iliopoulos parameter. Similarly to its higher-dimensional analogues, this 1d Seiberg duality is an infrared duality: the supersymmetric ground states of the dual gauge theories match exactly. We provide strong evidence for the dualities, including the matching of the flavoured Witten indices, a Higgs-branch derivation in terms of dual Grassmannian manifolds, and a detailed study of the Coulomb-branch ground states in the abelian case. We study how the supersymmetric ground states, in either dual description, depend on the sign of the Fayet--Iliopoulos parameter, and we explore the corresponding wall-crossing phenomenon. For some special values of the discrete parameters defining the unitary gauge theory, the dualities, combined with trivial wall-crossing, enhances to a triality. This includes, as a special case, the dimensional reduction to 1d of the 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ Gadde--Gukov--Putrov triality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study consistent truncations in the framework of Exceptional Generalised Geometry. We classify the 4-dimensional gauged supergravities that can be obtained as a consistent truncation of 10/11-dimensional supergravity. Any truncation is associated to a (generalised) $G_S$-structure with singlet intrinsic torsion. We give the full classification for all truncations associated to continuous structure groups and we discuss a few examples with discrete ones. We recover gauged supergravities corresponding to known truncations as well as others for which explicit truncations are still to be constructed. We also summarise similar results obtained in the literature for truncations to $d=5,6,7$ dimensions and we complete them, when needed.</description>

      <title>The Hilbert space of gauge theories: group averaging and the quantization of Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When the gauge group of a theory has infinite volume, defining the inner product on physical states becomes subtle. This is the case for gravity, even in exactly solvable models such as minisuperspace or low-dimensional theories: the physical states do not inherit an inner product in a straightforward manner, and different quantization procedures yield a priori inequivalent prescriptions. This is one of the main challenges when constructing gravitational Hilbert spaces. In this paper we study a quantization procedure known as group averaging, which is a special case of the BRST/BV formalism and has gained popularity as a promising connection between Dirac quantization and gravitational path integrals. We identify a large class of theories for which group averaging is ill-defined due to isometry groups with infinite volume, which includes Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. We propose a modification of group averaging to renormalize these infinite volumes and use it to quantize Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity with a positive cosmological constant in closed universes. The resulting Hilbert space naturally splits into infinite-dimensional superselection sectors and has a positive-definite inner product. This is the first complete Dirac quantization of this theory, as we are able to capture all the physical states for the first time.</description>

      <title>Computing nonlinearity ratios using second order black hole perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit an analytical approximation scheme for computing nonlinearity ratios involving quadratic quasinormal modes (QQNMs). We compute these ratios for the general case when the QQNM is not one of the linear QNMs, for the $(l,m)$ channel $(2,2) \times (2,2) \to (4,4)$. We find an excellent match with numerical simulations. We also discuss where and why the method can fail, for example, for the channel $(2,0) \times (2,0) \to (2,0)$ where we can only get crude estimates for the nonlinearity ratio. Motivated by recent studies on nonlinear ringdown at the horizon, we also compute the nonlinearity ratios at the horizon. We find that the ratio both at the horizon and infinity is insensitive to different choices of regularization of the source term in the second order perturbations. We also discuss amplitudes of QQNMs sourced by linear overtones. Finally, we discuss the issues that must be resolved within this method to do precision analysis of nonlinear ringdown.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unitarity imposes coupled constraints on elastic and inelastic amplitudes. Satisfying them requires resummation of the self-energy contributions from both elastic and inelastic channels. Inelastic channels generate anti-Hermitian contributions that can be consistently deduced from the unitarity relation underlying the optical theorem, leading to non-local separable potentials and a compact unitarization scheme in the non-relativistic regime. We present two alternative derivations of the anti-Hermitian kernel, from the continuity equation and by integrating out inelastic channels. We further extend this framework to treat non-analytic and non-convergent behavior of inelastic amplitudes in the complex momentum plane and to incorporate bound states. For non-convergent amplitudes, we demonstrate a simple renormalization procedure in which anti-Hermitian separable potentials necessarily induce Hermitian separable counterterms, yielding finite cross sections consistent with unitarity. These results provide a general tool for non-relativistic scattering problems, with clear applications to dark-matter phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from flavoured SU(2) early-universe phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flavourful extensions of the Standard Model aimed at explaining its fermionic mass structure typically rely on symmetries, broken at high-energy scales far beyond the reach of foreseeable direct collider searches. We illustrate, using a $SU(2)$ flavour gauge group, that the breaking of these symmetries up to scales as high as $10^7$ GeV could generate a gravitational-wave signal potentially observable by future observatories. We use dimensional reduction techniques to obtain the finite-temperature effective potential and study the possible first-order phase transitions. We match these transitions to steady-state hydrodynamical solutions in order to determine the corresponding gravitational-wave spectra. We observe that order-one gauge couplings are always required for a first-order phase transition to occur. On the other hand, adding leptoquarks (as an example of particles that are typically present in a complete flavour theory) significantly extends the testable parameter space. We find excellent prospects at the Einstein Telescope for future gravitational-wave detection of flavoured $SU(2)$ early-universe phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: The fuzzy-sphere regularization is an emerging numerical and theoretical technique for studying conformal field theories (CFTs). In this paper, we apply it to the $O(N)$ vector model, one of the most prominent theories for critical behavior in three space-time dimensions. We construct a model that realizes the $O(N)$ Wilson-Fisher and free-scalar CFTs for general $N$. For $N=2,3,4$, we present numerical evidence including the operator spectra and correlation functions in agreement with conformal symmetry and conformal bootstrap results.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the single-particle reduced density operator during two-particle scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A particle initially in a pure state but interacting with some environment evolves into a discrete ensemble of pure states, the eigenstates of its reduced density operator, with ensemble probabilities given by the corresponding eigenvalues. In this work, we use numerics to present explicit results for the time-dependence of these eigenvalues and eigenstates for simple scattering experiments in one and two dimensions. This provides a time-resolved picture of the scattering process, showing in detail how an initial state described entirely in terms of continuous parameters evolves into a discrete set of possible outcomes, each with an associated probability and time-evolving wavefunction. We find that for scattering of Gaussian wavepackets in one dimension, the late time spectrum is dominated by two large eigenvalues nearly equal to the transmission and reflection probabilities associated with the central value of momentum. The corresponding eigenstates appear as single-peaked reflected or transmitted wavepackets. The remaining smaller eigenvalues, which increase to a maximum during scattering and then decrease to small values, correspond to reflected or transmitted wavepackets with multiple spatially separated parts. In this case and also for two-dimensional scattering, we find that successively smaller eigenvalues correspond to probability distributions with successively more peaks. These multi-peaked states correspond to outcomes of the scattering experiment where a particle initially in a single wavepacket ends up in a superposition of separated wavepackets after scattering.</description>

      <title>Cancellation Identities and Renormalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a manifest gauge invariant renormalization framework by first introducing a perturbative BRST Feynman graph complex and then combining it with Connes--Kreimer renormalization theory: To this end, we first formalize the cancellation identities of 't Hooft (1971), which were used to prove the absence of gauge anomalies in Quantum Yang--Mills theories. Specifically, we start with some reasonable axioms of (generalized) gauge theories and then present the most general version of cancellation identities ensuring transversality. Then, we construct a perturbative BRST Feynman graph complex, whose cohomology groups consist of transversal invariant linear combinations of Feynman graphs. We prove that the cohomology groups are zero in odd degree and generated by connected combinatorial Green's functions in even degree, with a corresponding number of external ghost edges. Ultimately, we then formulate the renormalization Hopf algebra on these cohomology groups, which directly links to Hopf subalgebras for multiplicative renormalization. Finally, we exemplify the developed theory with Quantum Yang--Mills theory and (effective) Quantum General Relativity.</description>

Abstract: In this work I use a frequency-domain Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli approach to compute the gravitational wave energy radiated by a compact body moving along a hyperbolic or parabolic geodesic of a Schwarzschild black hole. I compare my results with the latest post-Minkowskian (PM) calculations for the radiated energy and find agreement for hyperbolic orbits with large impact parameters and characterized by a velocity at infinity, $v_\infty$, as large as $v_\infty/c=0.7$. I also find agreement between my results and the leading-order PM expansion for the radiation absorbed by the black hole. I make further comparisons with post-Newtonian (PN) theory and show the effectiveness of a simple PN-PM hybrid model. Finally, I make a first comparison of the radiated energy between self-force and numerical relativity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The leading corrections to General Relativity can be parametrized by higher-derivative interactions in a low-energy effective field theory, in a way that is general and agnostic to the precise UV completion of gravity. Using pseudospectral methods, we compute the leading-order corrections to the Kerr metric across the entire range of sub-extremal values of spin and analyse their impact on physical quantities. We find that near-extremal black holes are most affected by the higher-derivative corrections, making them especially sensitive probes of new physics. A dataset of solutions and the code used to produce them are publicly available.</description>

      <title>Properties of Stable Massive Quark Stars in Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a holographic D3/D7 system, whose dilaton profile has been phenomenologically adjusted in the infrared. The model is used to describe a deconfined yet massive quark phase of QCD at finite density, concluding that the equation of state of such a phase can be stiff enough to support exotic dense stars as massive as 2 solar masses. Nucleons are modeled phenomenologically using the Hebeler-et.al EFT baryon phases. For the stiff phenomenological baryon phases the transition to the quark phase is weakly first order allowing for stable quark cores. We also find that holographic baryons, modeled as wrapped D5-branes, provide unrealistic pressures (in the homogeneous approximation) and have to be discarded. We compute the mass vs. radius relation and tidal deformability for these hybrid stars. Contrary to a large number of other holographic models, this holographic model indicates that quark matter could be present at the core of heavy compact stars and may be used to explore the phenomenology of such objects.</description>

Abstract: We compute the tidal Love numbers for a particular axially symmetric configuration of extremal Reissner-Nordstrom geometry. By exactly solving the non-linear Einstein equations, we investigate the tidal response of extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in four-dimensional spacetimes under external gravitational fields. We show that, for the specific geometry considered, the static tidal Love number remains finite and non-vanishing to all orders in the external tidal field. By contrast, we verify that the Love number of an isolated extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole remains zero, in agreement with previous expectations. Furthermore, we explicitly calculate the Zerilli-Moncrief master functions and match them with the effective field theory description.</description>

      <title>Updates on dipolar anisotropy in local measurements of the Hubble constant from Cosmicflows-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations show a persistent tension in the Hubble constant $H_0$, suggesting an incomplete understanding of cosmic expansion and local dynamics. Using the Cosmicflows-4 catalogue, we mapped the angular and radial variations of $H_0$ in radial shells with a distance modulus $\mu \in [29,36]$ (approximately corresponding to $[20,100]$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc) and equal-area sky patches, applied adaptive weighing, and fitted spherical harmonics up to the octupole. Our results reveal a clear, distance-decreasing dipole that remains coherent across shells, with subdominant higher-order multipoles, and the octupole fit capturing the main anisotropic features except in sparsely sampled or SDSS-dominated shells. The direction and amplitude of the dipole depend on whether the observed radial recessional velocities are corrected for peculiar velocities or not. If the correction is not applied, the dipole aligns with the major gravitational structures in the local universe. If it is applied, a global dipole still seems to be present, but the signal is much weaker and with much lower statistical significance. This decrease in the amplitude of the dipole supports the idea of a differential expansion rate in our universe, but does not clarify whether the origin is astrophysical or cosmological. Finally, we verify that, while this anisotropy could influence local measurements of the Hubble constant, its effect on the large-scale Hubble tension appears to be limited, as the distribution of galaxies hosting SNeIa, both used as calibrators to constrain $H_0$ and in the Hubble-flow, does not show a strong correlation with the dipole signal.</description>

Abstract: Chen-Ning Yang made important contributions to the theory of solvable models in statistical mechanics, including generalizations of the Bethe Ansatz, magnetization in the Ising model, the Lee-Yang circle theorem, and the Yang-Baxter equation. Most famously, Yang made transformative contributions to the current Standard Model of elementary particle interactions. The proposal of Yang and T. D. Lee, that left-right symetry (parity) is violated in weak particle decays, established that the primary currents involved in weak interactions are left handed. The work of Yang and R. L. Mills gave a framework for force carriers coupling to these currents that are non-Abelian generalizations of the electromagnetic photon, which unlike the electrically neutral photon, carry ``charges'' to which they self-couple . Two decades of work by others on quantization and mass-generation mechanisms then culminated in the Standard Model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The lecture notes cover the basics of quantum computing methods for quantum field theory applications. No detailed knowledge of either quantum computing or quantum field theory is assumed and we have attempted to keep the material at a pedagogical level. We review the anharmonic oscillator, using which we develop a hands-on treatment of certain interesting QFTs in $1+1D$: $\phi^4$ theory, Ising field theory, and the Schwinger model. We review quantum computing essentials as well as tensor network techniques. The latter form an essential part for quantum computing benchmarking. Some error modelling on QISKIT is also done in the hope of anticipating runs on NISQ devices.
  These lecture notes are the expanded version of a one semester course taught by AS during August-November 2025 at the Indian Institute of Science and TA-ed by UB. The programs written for this course are available in a GitHub repository.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of a static black hole in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the axial electromagnetic quasinormal modes of a static, asymptotically Anti--de Sitter (AdS) black hole sourced by a nonlinear electrodynamics model of Pleba\'{n}ski type. Starting from the master equation governing axial perturbations, we impose ingoing boundary conditions at the event horizon and normalizable (Dirichlet) behavior at the AdS boundary. Following the approach of Jansen, we recast the radial equation into a linear generalized eigenvalue problem by using an ingoing Eddington--Finkelstein formulation, compactifying the radial domain, and regularizing the asymptotic coefficients. The resulting problem is solved using a Chebyshev--Lobatto pseudospectral discretization. We compute the fundamental quasinormal mode frequencies for both the purely electric ($Q_m=0$) and purely magnetic ($Q_e=0$) sectors, emphasizing the role of the nonlinearity parameter $\beta$ and the effective charge magnitude $Q$. Our results show that increasing either $\beta$ or $Q$ raises both the oscillation frequency $\omega_R$ and the damping rate $-\omega_I$, leading to faster but more rapidly decaying ringdown profiles. Nonlinear electrodynamics breaks the isospectrality between electric and magnetic configurations: magnetic modes are systematically less oscillatory and more weakly damped than their electric counterparts. For sufficiently large $\beta$ and small $Q_m$, the fundamental mode becomes purely imaginary ($\omega_R \approx 0$), in agreement with the absence of a trapping potential barrier in this regime. These findings reveal qualitative signatures of nonlinear electromagnetic effects on black hole perturbations and may have implications for high-field or high-charge astrophysical environments.</description>

      <title>Inflationary assessment of $F(\mathcal{R},\tilde{\mathcal{R}})$ Einstein-Cartan models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of $F(\mathcal{R},\tilde{\mathcal{R}})$ Einstein-Cartan gravity with an action depending both of the Ricci scalar and the so-called Holst-invariant curvature we consider models that include cubic terms of the latter in the action and study their inflationary behavior. These terms can have a considerable effect either positive or negative in relation to the agreement with present observational data, depending on parameters. In parameter regions where the quadratic models fail to produce results consistent with observational data, the presence of these additional cubic terms can lead to compatible predictions.</description>

Abstract: This paper shows that the bulk metric of a planar/spherically/hyperbolically symmetric asymptotically anti-de Sitter static black brane/hole can be reconstructed from its boundary frequency 2-point correlation functions of two probe scalar operators by solving Gel'fand-Levitan-Marchenko integral equation. Since the frequency correlation function is easily handled in experiments and theories, this paper not only proposes a new method to ``measure'' the corresponding holographic spacetime for a material that has holographic dual but also provides an approach to experimentally check if a system has holographic dual.</description>

      <title>Species scale associated with Weinberg operator and bound on Majorana neutrino mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When states in a tower like the Kaluza-Klein or the string tower couple to another state through the irrelevant operators of the same type, their contributions to the loop corrections of the relevant or the marginal operators are not negligible, threatening the perturbativity. This can be avoided provided the cutoff scale is lower than the species scale associated with the irrelevant operator. We apply this to towers of states associated with the neutrino which couple to the Higgs through the Weinberg operator, the dimension-5 irrelevant operator generating the Majorana neutrino mass. Requiring the `Majorana species scale', the species scale associated with the Weinberg operator, to be below the gravitational species scale, one finds the lower bound on the Majorana neutrino mass determined by the species number. The Festina-Lente bound also gives the lower bound on the Majorana neutrino mass, but it is not so stringent. Meanwhile, even if the neutrino mass is of the Dirac type at the renormalizable level, the Majorana mass term still can be written in the effective field theory action so far as the Weinberg operator is not forbidden. Even if the Majorana neutrino mass is larger than the Dirac one, so far as there are sufficient degrees of freedom with mass smaller than the scale of the cosmological constant, the observation of the Majorana nature of the neutrino may not contradict to quantum gravity constraints which rules out the neutrino mass purely given by the Majorana type.</description>

      <title>What is a photon in de Sitter spacetime?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00761v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The states of a single photon in four-dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetime form a Unitary Irreducible Representation (UIR) of SO(1,4), which we call the photon UIR. While in flat spacetime photons are intimately tied to gauge symmetry, we demonstrate that in de Sitter, photon states emerge generically in any quantum field theory, even without an underlying U(1) gauge field. We derive a K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation for antisymmetric tensor two-point functions and show that numerous composite operators constructed from massive free fields can create states in the photon UIR. Remarkably, we find that some of these operators exhibit two-point functions with slower late-time and large-distance decay than the electromagnetic field strength itself, challenging the conventional notion that photons dominate the infrared regime. Using our spectral representation, we establish non-perturbative bounds on the late-time behavior of electric and magnetic fields in de Sitter, with potential implications for primordial magnetogenesis. Through one-loop calculations, we demonstrate that both the creation of photon states and the enhanced late-time large-distance behavior persist in weakly interacting theories.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that the geometric action on a coadjoint orbit of the Virasoro group appropriately describes non-dissipative two-dimensional conformal fluids. While this action had already appeared in the context of AdS$_3$ gravity, the hydrodynamical interpretation given here is new. We use this to argue that the geometric action manifestly controls both sides of the fluid/gravity correspondence, where the gravitational `hologram' gives an effective hydrodynamical description of the dual CFT. As a byproduct, our work sheds light on the nature of the AdS$_3$ reparametrization theory used to effectively compute Virasoro vacuum blocks at large central charge, as the reparametrization mode is now understood as a fluctuation of the fluid velocity.</description>

      <title>Yang-Lee Quantum Criticality in Various Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06369v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Yang-Lee universality class arises when imaginary magnetic field is tuned to its critical value in the paramagnetic phase of the $d&lt;6$ Ising model. In $d=2$, this non-unitary Conformal Field Theory (CFT) is exactly solvable via the $M(2,5)$ minimal model. As found long ago by von Gehlen using Exact Diagonalization, the corresponding real-time, quantum critical behavior arises in the periodic Ising spin chain when the imaginary longitudinal magnetic field is tuned to its critical value from below. Even though the Hamiltonian is not Hermitian, the energy levels are real due to the $PT$ symmetry. In this paper, we explore the analogous quantum critical behavior in higher dimensional non-Hermitian Hamiltonians on regularized spheres $S^{d-1}$. For $d=3$, we use the recently invented, powerful fuzzy sphere method, as well as discretization by the platonic solids cube, icosahedron and dodecaherdron. The low-lying energy levels and structure constants we find are in agreement with expectations from the conformal symmetry. The energy levels are in good quantitative agreement with the high-temperature expansions and with Pad\'{e} extrapolations of the $6-\epsilon$ expansions in Fisher's $i\phi^3$ Euclidean field theory for the Yang-Lee criticality. In the course of this work, we clarify some aspects of matching between operators in this field theory and quasiprimary fields in the $M(2,5)$ minimal model. For $d=4$, we obtain new results by replacing the $S^3$ with the self-dual polytope called the $24$-cell.</description>

      <title>Root-$T\overline{T}$ deformed CFT partition functions at large central charge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12093v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the partition function of 2d CFT under root-$T\bar{T}$ deformation. We demonstrate that the deformed partition function satisfies a flow equation. At large central charge sector, the deformed partition function reduces to a redefinition of the modular parameters, which preserves modular invariance under the deformed parameters. We then derive a Cardy-like formula for the asymptotic density of states using modular bootstrap trick. In the context of AdS/CFT, it was proposed the root-$T\bar{T}$ deformed CFT corresponds to the AdS$_3$ with certain deformed boundary condition. We show the deformed BTZ black hole is a quotient of hyperbolic space. In terms of Chern-Simons formulation, we compute the root-$T\bar{T}$ deformed BTZ black hole entropy and find that it obeys a Cardy-like formula, which is consistent with the modular bootstrap result. Furthermore, employing the Wilson spool technique, we compute the one-loop partition functions for the root-$T\bar{T}$ deformed AdS$_3$ geometry. Our results reveal an exact match between one-loop gravitational partition function and the large $c$ expansion of root-$T\bar{T}$ deformed CFT partition function.</description>

      <title>Free Probability approach to spectral and operator statistics in Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing the framework of free probability, we analyze the spectral and operator statistics of the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles, which exhibit a rich phase structure encompassing ergodic, fractal, and localized regimes. Leveraging subordination formulae, we develop a perturbative scheme that yields semi-analytic expressions for the density of states up to second order in system size, in good agreement with numerical results. We compute higher-point correlation functions in the ergodic regime using both numerical and suitable analytic approximations. Our analysis of operator statistics for various spin operators across these regimes reveals close agreement with free probability predictions in the ergodic phase, in contrast to persistent deviations observed in the fractal and localized phases, even at late times. Notably, the fractal phase exhibits partial freeness while retaining memory of the initial spectrum, highlighting the importance of non-localized eigenstates and associated with the late-time dynamics of cumulative out-of-time-ordered-correlators (OTOCs). Employing distance measures and statistical tools such as the $\chi^2$ statistic, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis testing, we define a characteristic time scale-the free time-that marks the onset of the validity of free probability predictions for operator spectral statistics in the ergodic phase. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate consistency across these different approaches.</description>

Abstract: Recent works have argued that improved one-loop beta-functions capturing the physical momentum dependence of one-loop corrected higher-derivative gravity theories are the most suitable to describe their high-energy behaviour. This work critically tests the validity of this claim. We compute the explicit gauge dependence of the one-loop momentum running of curvature-squared operators in quadratic gravity and conformal gravity using the background field method. We find them to be gauge dependent, and we discuss the implications of this result for the theory and its physical predictivity.</description>

      <title>Perturbations of Black Holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton-Axion (EMDA) Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04589v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend our earlier work on the linearised perturbations of static black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theories to the case where the black holes are solutions in an enlarged theory including also an axion. We study the perturbations in a 3-parameter family of such EMDA theories. The systems of equations describing the linearised perturbations can always be separated, but they can only be decoupled when the three parameters are restricted to a 1-parameter family of EMDA theories, characterised by a parameter $b$ that determines the coupling of the axion to the $\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho\sigma}\, F_{\mu\nu}\, F_{\rho\sigma}$ term. In the specific case when $b=1$, the theory is related to an ${\cal N}=2$ supergravity. In this one case we find that the perturbations in the axial and the polar sectors are related by a remarkable transformation, which generalises one found by Chandrasekhar for the perturbations of Reissner-Nordstr\"om in Einstein-Maxwell theory. This transformation is of a form found in supersymmetric quantum mechanical models. The existence of such mappings between the axial and polar perturbations appears to correlate with those cases where there is an underlying supergravity supporting the solution, even though the black hole backgrounds are non-extremal and therefore not supersymmetric. We prove the mode stability of the static black hole solutions in the supersymmetric EMDA theory. For other values of the parameter $b$ in the EMDA theories that allow decoupling of the modes, we find that one of the radial potentials can be negative outside the horizon if $b$ is sufficiently large, raising the possibility of there being perturbative mode instabilities in such a case.</description>

Abstract: We study quantum and classical systems defined by the quantum corner symmetry group $QCS = \widetilde{SL}(2,\mathbb{R}) \ltimes H_3$, which arises in the context of quantum gravity. In particular, we relate the quantum observables, defined by representation-theoretic data, to their classical counterparts through generalized Perelomov coherent states and the framework of Berezin quantization. The resulting procedure provides a mathematically well-defined notion of the semi-classical limit of quantum gravity, viewed as the representation theory of the corner symmetry group.</description>

Abstract: This manuscript aims to provide a comprehensive derivation of the Einstein-Maxwell charges and fluxes in the near-horizon region of a four-dimensional non-extremal black hole, with vanishing cosmological constant. Specifically, we present a detailed derivation of the Noether charges within both the metric and first-order formulations, elucidating the relationship between the Carrollian internal boost charge and the Lorentz boost charge. It is well-established in the literature that Carrollian fluids exhibit an internal local boost symmetry; we demonstrate that this symmetry precisely corresponds to a Lorentz internal transformation. Finally, we prove that the near-horizon Einstein equations can be obtained from the flux-balance law by employing the generalized Barnich-Troessaert bracket.</description>

      <title>Generalized Three-Family Supersymmetric Pati-Salam Models from Type IIA Intersecting D6-Branes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generalizing three-family chiral fermion conditions to $I_{ac}=-(3+h)$ and $I_{ac'}=h$, with positive integer $h$, we extend the landscape of three-family ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models in a broader region. Differing from the former investigation with $I_{ac}=-3$ and $I_{ac'}=0$, we do not restrict that the $a$ stack of D6-branes must be parallel to the orientifold image of the $c$-stack along one of the three two-tori. In this investigation, without the simple parallel construction, we find four new classes of supersymmetric Pati-Salam models that are allowed by the extended three generation condition with $I_{ac}=3, I_{ac'}=-6$ and $I_{ac}=-1, I_{ac'}=-2$ through the intersections of $a$- and $c/c'$-branes. Moreover, with the $SU(2)'_{L}$ gauge coupling realized from $SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$ symmetry breaking, the canonical normalization requirement of the gauge kinetic term provides an alternative approach that can be imposed before the renormalization group equation evolution for $SU(2)'_L$ gauge coupling. This turns out to be an effective mechanism to realize the string-scale gauge coupling relation, especially for the new supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with large $g_b/g_a$ ratio. We show that this symmetry-breaking modified renormalization group evolution can highly suppress $g_b/g_a$, and finally realizes string-scale gauge coupling relations for the extended supersymmetric Pati-Salam models as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.05304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a series representation for the dynamical two-point function of the local spin current for the XXZ chain in the antiferromagnetic massive regime at zero temperature. From this series we can compute the correlation function with very high accuracy up to very long times and large distances. Each term in the series corresponds to the contribution of all scattering states of an even number of excitations. These excitations can be interpreted in terms of an equal number of particles and holes. The lowest term in the series comprises all scattering states of one hole and one particle. This term determines the long-time large-distance asymptotic behaviour which can be obtained explicitly from a saddle-point analysis. The space-time Fourier transform of the two-point function of currents at zero momentum gives the optical spin conductivity of the model. We obtain highly accurate numerical estimates for this quantity by numerically Fourier transforming our data. For the one-particle, one-hole contribution, equivalently interpreted as a two-spinon contribution, we obtain an exact and explicit expression in terms of known special functions. For large enough anisotropy, the two-spinon contribution carries most of the spectral weight, as can be seen by calculating the f-sum rule.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05267v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a relationship between the so-called Hubble-Lema\^{i}tre constant $H_{0}$ and holographic complexity related to the emergence of spacetime in quantum gravity. Such a result can represent an important step to understanding the Hubble tension by introducing a quantum gravity perspective for cosmological observations: regarding the degree of quantum complexity we measure around us.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use String Field Theory (SFT) to construct a higher analogue of Bunke-Schick's functor $P: \mathbf{Top}^{op} \to \mathbf{Set}$ \cite{BunkeS1} by geometrizing $P.$ We use the projection of SFT onto its massless modes \cite{SFTDiffeo} to construct the category $\C$ whose objects are pairs (which we identify with SFT backgrounds) and whose maps are morphisms of pairs (which are gauge transformations). Using $\C$ and categorical equivalence, for any $CW-$complex $X$ we define the moduli space $G(X)$ of SFT backgrounds which are pairs over $X$ up to gauge equivalence. We use the homotopy theory of the moduli space $G(X)$ to define functors on the category of $CW-$complexes $P_k:\mathbf{CW}^{op} \to \mathbf{Grpd}$ such that $P_0 \simeq P,$ $P_1$ is nontrivial and $P_k(X)$ are always trivial for $k \geq 2.$ Arrows in $P_1(X)$ are shown to be isotopy classes of maps in the mapping class group of $X$ acting on (isomorphism classes of) pairs over $X.$ We discuss applications to Topological T-duality for triples and to modelling doubled geometries and T-folds \cite{HullT}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09377v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ a recently developed spectral method to obtain the spectrum of quasinormal modes of rapidly rotating black holes in alternative theories of gravity and apply it to the black holes of shift-symmetric Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theory. In this theory the quasinormal modes were recently obtained by employing perturbation theory in quadratic order in the Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant. Here we present the full non-perturbative results for the spectrum within the domain of existence of rotating black holes and compare with the perturbative results. We also compare with the quasinormal mode spectrum of rapidly rotating Einstein-dilaton-Gauss-Bonnet black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09502v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An infinite 3-parametric family of superintegrable and exactly-solvable quantum models on a plane, admitting separation of variables in polar coordinates, marked by integer index $k$ was introduced in Journ Phys A 42 (2009) 242001 and was called in literature the TTW system. In this paper it is conjectured that the Hamiltonian and both integrals of TTW system have hidden algebra $g^{(k)}$ - it was checked for $k=1,2,3,4$ - having its finite-dimensional representation spaces as the invariant subspaces. It is checked that for $k=1,2,3,4$ that the Hamiltonian $H$, two integrals ${\cal I}_{1,2}$ and their commutator ${\cal I}_{12} = [{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_2]$ are four generating elements of the polynomial algebra of integrals of the order $(k+1)$: $[{\cal I}_1,{\cal I}_{12}] = P_{k+1}(H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12})$, $[{\cal I}_2,{\cal I}_{12}] = Q_{k+1}(H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12})$, where $P_{k+1},Q_{k+1}$ are polynomials of degree $(k+1)$ written in terms of ordered monomials of $H, {\cal I}_{1,2},{\cal I}_{12}$. This implies that polynomial algebra of integrals is subalgebra of $g^{(k)}$. It is conjectured that all is true for any integer $k$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16545v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of an $\eta$-pseudo Hermitian Hamiltonian with $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is reviewed and extended to include open system dynamics. A first-principles derivation of the generalized Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation appropriate for a $\mathcal{PT}-$symmetric Hamiltonian is presented. Inspired by a simple light matter interaction open system model, information theoretic quantities like a non-Markovian witness and fidelity are calculated for the $\mathcal{PT-}$symmetric Hamiltonian, and the results are compared with their corresponding Hermitian counterparts. The nature of entanglement between two $\mathcal{PT-}$symmetric and Hermitian open quantum systems is calculated, and the contrast observed.</description>

      <title>Precision predictions of Starobinsky inflation with self-consistent Weyl-squared corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starobinsky's $R+\alpha R^2$ inflation provides a compelling one-parameter inflationary model that is supported by current cosmological observations. However, at the same order in spacetime derivatives as the $R^2$ term, an effective theory of spacetime geometry must also include the Weyl-squared curvature invariant $W^2$. In this paper, we study the inflationary predictions of the gravitational theory with action of the form $R+\alpha R^2 - \beta W^2$, where the coupling constant $\alpha$ sets the scale of inflation, and corrections due to the $W^2$ term are treated self-consistently via reduction of order in an expansion in the coupling constant $\beta$, at the linear order in $\beta/\alpha$. Cosmological perturbations are found to be described by an effective action with a nontrivial speed of sound $c_{\textrm{s}}$ for scalar and $c_{\textrm{t}}$ for tensor modes, satisfying the relation $c_{\textrm{t}}/c_{\textrm{s}} \simeq 1+ \frac{\beta}{6\, \alpha}$ during the inflationary phase. Within this self-consistent framework, we compute several primordial observables up to the next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N3LO). We find the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 3(1-\frac{\beta}{6\alpha})(n_\textrm{s}-1)^2$, the tensor tilt $n_{\textrm{t}}\simeq-\frac{r}{8}$ and the running of the scalar tilt $\mathfrak{a}_{\textrm{s}}\simeq-\frac{1}{2} (n_{\textrm{s}} - 1)^2$, all expressed in terms of the observed scalar tilt $n_{\textrm{s}}$. We also provide the corresponding corrections up to N3LO, $\mathcal{O}((n_{\textrm{s}} - 1)^3)$.</description>

      <title>Dark energy constraints in light of theoretical priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19450v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to derive model-independent observational bounds on dark energy/modified gravity theories, a typical approach is to constrain parametrised models intended to capture the space of dark energy theories. Here we investigate in detail the effect that the nature of these parametrisations can have, finding significant effects on the resulting cosmological dark energy constraints. In order to observationally distinguish well-motivated and physical parametrisations from unphysical ones, it is crucial to understand the theoretical priors that physical parametrisations place on the phenomenology of dark energy. To this end we discuss a range of theoretical priors that can be imposed on general dark energy parametrisations, and their effect on the constraints on the phenomenology of dynamical dark energy. More specifically, we investigate both the phenomenological $\{\mu,\Sigma\}$ parametrisation as well as effective field theory (EFT) inspired approaches to model dark energy interactions. We compare the constraints obtained in both approaches for different phenomenological and theory-informed time-dependences for the underlying functional degrees of freedom, discuss the effects of priors derived from gravitational wave physics, and investigate the interplay between constraints on parameters constraining only the background evolution vs. parameters controlling linear perturbations.</description>

      <title>Bianchi-I cosmology with scale dependent $G$ and $\Lambda$ in asymptotically safe gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study anisotropic Bianchi-I cosmology, incorporating quantum gravitational corrections into the Einstein equation through the scale-dependent Newton coupling and cosmological term, as determined by the flow equation of the effective action for gravity. For the classical cosmological constant $\Lambda_0=0$, we derive the quantum mechanically corrected, or quantum-improved power-series solution for a general equation-of-state parameter $w$ in the range $-1&lt;w\leq 1$ in the form of expansions in both inverse cosmic time and the anisotropy parameter. We give a general criterion, valid for any $\Lambda_0$, if the solution becomes isotropic in the late time, which indicates that the universe becomes isotropic for most cases of $-1&lt;w&lt;1$ except $w=1$. By numerical analysis, we show that quantum corrections lead to earlier isotropization compared to the classical case starting from an initially highly anisotropic state. In contrast, for $\Lambda_0 &gt;0$, we obtain the inverse power-series solution in the exponential of the cosmic time. We find that the universe always becomes isotropic in the late time, in accordance with the cosmic no hair theorem, and the quantum corrections make the isotropization faster. We also briefly summarize the Kasner solution and its generalization with quantum corrections.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Kolmogorov-Arnold Geometry in Shallow MLPs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) representation theorem constructs universal, but highly non-smooth inner functions (the first layer map) in a single (non-linear) hidden layer neural network. Such universal functions have a distinctive local geometry, a "texture," which can be characterized by the inner function's Jacobian $J({\mathbf{x}})$, as $\mathbf{x}$ varies over the data. It is natural to ask if this distinctive KA geometry emerges through conventional neural network optimization. We find that indeed KA geometry often is produced when training vanilla single hidden layer neural networks. We quantify KA geometry through the statistical properties of the exterior powers of $J(\mathbf{x})$: number of zero rows and various observables for the minor statistics of $J(\mathbf{x})$, which measure the scale and axis alignment of $J(\mathbf{x})$. This leads to a rough understanding for where KA geometry occurs in the space of function complexity and model hyperparameters. The motivation is first to understand how neural networks organically learn to prepare input data for later downstream processing and, second, to learn enough about the emergence of KA geometry to accelerate learning through a timely intervention in network hyperparameters. This research is the "flip side" of KA-Networks (KANs). We do not engineer KA into the neural network, but rather watch KA emerge in shallow MLPs.</description>

      <title>The Great Impersonation: $\mathcal{W}$-Solitons as Prototypical Black Hole Microstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze a new class of static, smooth geometries in five-dimensional supergravity, dubbed $\mathcal{W}$-solitons. They carry the same mass and charges as four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstr\"om-like black holes but replace the horizon with a Kaluza-Klein bubble supported by electromagnetic flux. These solutions provide analytically tractable prototypes of black hole microstates in supergravity, including a new, relevant neutral configuration involving a massless axion field. Focusing on photon scattering and scalar perturbations, we compute their key observables, aiming to identify mesoscopic observables. We find that $\mathcal{W}$-solitons feature a single photon sphere, qualitatively similar to that of the black hole but with quantitative differences. They have only short-lived quasinormal modes~(QNMs), as black holes, while long-lived echo modes seen in other ultracompact horizonless objects are absent. As a result, the ringdown closely resembles that of a black hole while still showing sizable deviations. The latter are at the ${\mathcal{O}}(10\%)$ level, compatible with the recent measurement of GW250114 and potentially falsifiable in the near future. Finally, we show that $\mathcal{W}$-solitons are stable under scalar perturbations. Our results underscore the qualitative similarities between $\mathcal{W}$-solitons and black holes, reinforcing their relevance as smooth black hole microstate prototypes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23808v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ultralight scalar dark matter may couple to the Standard Model through dimension-five operators that contain the field-strength tensors of the gauge interactions. Recent progress in nuclear clocks is projected to increase the sensitivity to such couplings by several orders of magnitude. Future experimental constraints may even have Planck-scale sensitivity, calling for a study of such couplings in a framework that includes quantum gravity. We take a first step towards providing the theoretical constraints on such couplings that arise in asymptotically safe gravity. We find evidence that such couplings vanish in asymptotically safe gravity and are also not generated in a perturbative quantum-gravity regime that describes quantum gravity as an effective field theory.</description>

Abstract: Ab initio predictions of two-loop electroweak contributions to observables are increasingly essential for precision collider experiments, yet their evaluation remains very challenging. We connect recurrence techniques and dispersive method in order to evaluate complex multi-loop Feynman diagrams. By expressing multi-point Passarino-Veltman functions in a two-point basis and using shifted space-time dimensions with recurrence relations, we minimize the number of required dispersive integrals. This approach reduces computation time and enables a precise and efficient analysis of one- and two-loop diagrams.</description>

      <title>Two Shades of Quark Color: Parallel Canons across the Cold War Divide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The introduction of the color quantum number is conventionally narrated as a linear progression from the quark-model statistics paradox to quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This paper challenges that teleology by arguing that "color" emerged as two conceptually distinct constructs during the Cold War. The first, originating with Han and Nambu and culminating in QCD, conceived of color as a local gauge charge, the source of a fundamental force mediated by gluons. The second, developed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, treated color as a hidden, three-valued label--a statistical and structural property within a composite, S-matrix-inflected hadron model. We trace these parallel narratives, linking the Dubna approach to a holist epistemology that prioritizes observable amplitudes and global constraints, and the QCD approach to a reductionist program grounded in micro-dynamics. A case study of Fermilab's E-36 experimental chain (1970--78) shows how an observables-first design-tuned to S-matrix and Regge constraints on forward elastic scattering--performed robustly within its natural domain but was ultimately discontinued amid declining theoretical interest and involvement. The subsequent hegemony of QCD retroactively projected its gauge-theoretic conception of color onto history, erasing this epistemic diversity. We conclude that the marginalization of Dubna's structural color was not merely a political outcome of the Cold War but a result of deep ontological and philosophical divergences, advocating for a domain-sensitive pluralism in the historiography of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Inflation RIDES Again</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) results, we revisit chaotic inflation based on a single complex scalar field with mass term $M^2 |\Phi|^2$, which usually predicts a spectra index $n_s\approx 0.96$ but a too-large tensor to scalar ratio $r\approx 0.16$. With radiative corrections, the potential $M^2 |\Phi|^2 \ln \left( |\Phi|^2/\Lambda^2 \right)$ induces spontaneous symmetry breaking near the scale $\Lambda$, yielding a Pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson which can play the role of a quintessence field, hence radiative inflation and dark energy (RIDE). Including a non-minimal coupling to gravity
  $\xi |\Phi|^2 R^2$ reduces $r$, allowing a good fit of the RIDE model to Planck data. Allowing a small additional quartic coupling correction $\lambda |\Phi|^4$ increases both $n_s$ and $r$, with a good fit to ACT data sets achieved for $\xi \approx 1$.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Zero Modes in Fractional Quantum Hall-Superconductor Heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the emergence of non-Abelian zero modes from twist defects in Abelian topological phases. We consider a setup built from a fractional quantum Hall (or a fractional Chern insulator)-superconductor heterostructure, which effectively induces a phase transition, leading to a topological phase endowed with new anyonic symmetries, and accordingly supporting distinct types of zero modes at fixed filling. These defects are modeled at the interface between two copies of the same heterostructure arranged side by side, which produces counterpropagating modes that can be gapped by interactions that realize the anyonic symmetries. We characterize the parafermions associated with each anyonic symmetry and discuss how their presence affect the periodicity of Josephson tunneling current.</description>

      <title>Non-semisimple CFT/TFT correspondence I: General setup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend the TFT construction of CFT correlators of [arXiv:hep-th/0204148] to so-called finite logarithmic CFTs for which the algebraic input data is no longer semisimple but still finite. More specifically, starting from the data of a chiral CFT given in the form of a not necessarily semisimple modular tensor category C we use a three dimensional topological field theory with surface defects based on the surgery TFT of [arXiv:1912.02063] to construct a full CFT as a braided monoidal oplax natural transformation.
  We make our construction explicit in the example of the transparent surface defect, resulting in the so-called Cardy case. In particular, we consider topological line defects and their action on bulk fields in these logarithmic CFTs, providing a source of examples for non-invertible and non-semisimple topological symmetries.</description>
