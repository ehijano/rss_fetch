      <title>Terrestrial atmospheric ion implantation occurred in the nearside lunar regolith during the history of Earth's dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light volatile elements in lunar regolith are thought to be a mixture of the solar wind and Earth's atmosphere, the latter sourced in the absence of geomagnetic field. However, the extent to which both the current and primitive geodynamo influence the transport of terrestrial ions still remains unclear, and this uncertainty is further complicated by the enigmatic composition and poorly constrained location of the Eoarchean exosphere. Here we use 3-D MHD numerical simulations with present-day magnetized and Archean unmagnetized atmospheres to investigate how Earth's intrinsic magnetic field affects this transfer, aiming to constrain how and when the lunar isotopic signature provides a record of Earth's paleoatmosphere. We find that atmospheric transfer is efficient only when the Moon is within Earth's magnetotail. The non-solar contribution to the lunar soil is best explained by implantation during the long history of the geodynamo, rather than any short, putatively unmagnetized epoch of early Earth. This further suggests the history of the terrestrial atmosphere, spanning billions of years, could be preserved in buried lunar soils. Our results indicate that the elemental abundances of Apollo samples are very sensitive to Earth's exobase altitude, which, at the time of ion implantation, was never smaller than 190 km.</description>

      <title>Origins of rings in the solar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Until about a decade ago, ring systems were only known to exist around giant planets. Each one of the four giant planets harbours its own distinctive and unique system of rings and inner satellites. The past decade has been marked by the unexpected discoveries of dense rings around small objects of the outer solar system: the Centaur object Chariklo (and possibly Chiron), the dwarf planet Haumea and the trans-Neptunian object Quaoar. In the latter case, an additional surprise came from the fact that Quaoar's rings orbit well beyond the Roche limit of the body. Here, we address the possible origins and evolution of these ring systems.</description>

      <title>Chemical Complexity and Prevalence of Life in the Universe: A New Method for the Estimation of Key Terms of Drake Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I describe a new method of estimating the prevalence of life in the Universe, based on the fact that more chemically complex environments are more rare. The paper makes three main claims: (1) There is a statistically significant (inverse) relationship between chemical complexity (quantified as the number of different types of molecules present in a given environment) and mass fraction for the successively smaller environments in the hierarchy of cosmic matter (extragalactic medium, interstellar clouds, dense cores, planetary systems, their icy fraction etc.) that is well described by a logarithmic law. (2) Minimal chemical complexity of life can be roughly defined, based on existing studies in vitro and in silico, both bottom-up (designing increasingly complex chemical systems) and top-down (simplifying minimal organisms). (3) Thus, one can estimate the fraction of the total mass density of the Universe that resides in reservoirs of chemical complexity estimated as being minimal for life. This is then translated, through simple statistical models of planetary systems, into the number of planets in a single Milky Way-sized galaxy that have, on their surface, reservoirs of biogenic chemical complexity. Two best models give the estimates of 1.6 (more complex minimal life) and 1.3e4 (slightly less complex minimal life) as the predicted upper bound for the number of instances of life per our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Detectability of biosignatures in warm, water-rich atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Warm rocky exoplanets within the habitable zone of Sun-like stars are favoured targets for current and future missions. Theory indicates these planets could be wet at formation and remain habitable long enough for life to develop. In this work we test the climate-chemistry response, maintenance, and detectability of biosignatures in warm, water-rich atmospheres with Earth biomass fluxes within the framework of the planned LIFE mission. We used the coupled climate-chemistry column model 1D-TERRA to simulate the composition of planetary atmospheres at different distances from the Sun, assuming Earth's planetary parameters and evolution. We increased the incoming instellation by up to 50 percent in steps of 10 percent, corresponding to orbits of 1.00 to 0.82 AU. Simulations were performed with and without modern Earth's biomass fluxes. Emission spectra of all simulations were produced using the GARLIC radiative transfer model. LIFEsim was then used to add noise to and simulate observations of these spectra to assess how biotic and abiotic atmospheres of Earth-like planets can be distinguished. Increasing instellation leads to surface water vapour pressures rising from 0.01 bar (1.13%) to 0.61 bar (34.72%). In the biotic scenarios, the ozone layer survives because hydrogen oxide reactions with nitrogen oxides prevent the net ozone chemical sink from increasing. Synthetic observations with LIFEsim, assuming a 2.0 m aperture and resolving power of R = 50, show that O3 signatures at 9.6 micron reliably point to Earth-like biosphere surface fluxes of O2 only for systems within 10 parsecs. Increasing the aperture to 3.5 m increases this range to 22.5 pc. The differences in atmospheric temperature due to differing H2O profiles also enables observations at 15.0 micron to reliably identify planets with a CH4 surface flux equal to that of Earth's biosphere.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical simulations of proto-Moon degassing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Similarities in the non-mass dependent isotopic composition of refractory elements with the bulk silicate Earth suggest that both the Earth and the Moon formed from the same material reservoir. On the other hand, the Moon's volatile depletion and isotopic composition of moderately volatile elements points to a global devolatilization processes, most likely during a magma ocean phase of the Moon. Here, we investigate the devolatilisation of the molten Moon due to a tidally-assisted hydrodynamic escape with a focus on the dynamics of the evaporated gas. Unlike the 1D steady-state approach of Charnoz et al. (2021), we use 2D time-dependent hydrodynamic simulations carried out with the FARGOCA code modified to take into account the magma ocean as a gas source. Near the Earth's Roche limit, where the proto-Moon likely formed, evaporated gases from the lunar magma ocean form a circum-Earth disk of volatiles, with less than 30% of material being re-accreted by the Moon. We find that the measured depletion of K and Na on the Moon can be achieved if the lunar magma-ocean had a surface temperature of about 1800-2000 K. After about 1000 years, a thermal boundary layer or a flotation crust forms a lid that inhibits volatile escape. Mapping the volatile velocity field reveals varying trends in the longitudes of volatile reaccretion on the Moon's surface: material is predominantly re-accreted on the trailing side when the Moon-Earth distance exceeds 3.5 Earth radii, suggesting a dichotomy in volatile abundances between the leading and trailing sides of the Moon. This dichotomy may provide insights on the tidal conditions of the early molten Earth. In conclusion, tidally-driven atmospheric escape effectively devolatilizes the Moon, matching the measured abundances of Na and K on timescales compatible with the formation of a thermal boundary layer or an anorthite flotation crust.</description>

      <title>An impact-free mechanism to deliver water to terrestrial planets and exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To date, the most widespread scenario is that the Earth originated without water and was brought to the planet mainly due to impacts by wet asteroids coming from further out in space. However, many uncertainties remain regarding the exact processes that supply water to inner terrestrial planets. This article explores a new mechanism that would allow water to be efficiently transported to planets without impacts. We propose that primordial asteroids were icy and that when the ice sublimated, it formed a gaseous disk that could then reach planets and deliver water. We have developed a new model that follows the sublimation of asteroids and evolves the subsequent gas disk using a viscous diffusion code. We can then quantify the amount of water that can be accreted onto each planet in a self-consistent manner. We find that this new disk-delivery mechanism can explain the water content on Earth as well as on other planets. Our model shows most of the water being delivered between 20 and 30 Myr after the birth of the Sun. Our scenario implies the presence of a gaseous water disk with substantial mass for 100s Myr, which could be one of the key tracers of this mechanism. We show that such a watery disk could be detected in young exo-asteroid belts with ALMA. We propose that viscous water transport is inevitable and more generic than the impact scenario. We also suggest it is a universal process that may also occur in extrasolar systems. The conditions required for this scenario to unfold are indeed expected to be present in most planetary systems: an opaque proto-planetary disk that is initially cold enough for ice to form in the exo-asteroid belt region, followed by a natural outward-moving snow line that allows this initial ice to sublimate after the dissipation of the primordial disk, creating a viscous secondary gas disk and leading to the accretion of water onto the exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Time Resolved Absorption of Six Chemical Species With MAROON-X Points to Strong Drag in the Ultra Hot Jupiter TOI-1518 b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01472v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wind dynamics play a pivotal role in governing transport processes within planetary atmospheres, influencing atmospheric chemistry, cloud formation, and the overall energy budget. Understanding the strength and patterns of winds is crucial for comprehensive insights into the physics of ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres. Current research has proposed two contrasting mechanisms that limit wind speeds in these atmospheres, each predicting a different scaling of wind speed with planet temperature. However, the sparse nature of existing observations hinders the determination of population trends and the validation of these proposed mechanisms. This study focuses on unraveling the wind dynamics and the chemical composition in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter TOI-1518 b. Two transit observations using the high-resolution (R{\lambda} = 85 000), optical (spectral coverage between 490 and 920 nm) spectrograph MAROON-X were obtained and analyzed to explore the chemical composition and wind dynamics using the cross-correlation techniques, global circulating models, and atmospheric retrieval. We report the detection of 14 species in the atmosphere of TOI-1518 b through cross-correlation analysis. Additionally, we measure the time-varying cross-correlation trails for 6 different species, compare them with predictions from General Circulation Models (GCM) and conclude that a strong drag is present in TOI-1518b's atmosphere. The ionized species require stronger drags than neutral species, likely due to the increased magnetic effects in the upper atmosphere. Furthermore, we detect vanadium oxide (VO) using the most up-to-date line list. This result is promising in detecting VO in other systems where inaccuracies in previous line lists have hindered detection. We use a retrieval analysis to further characterize the abundances of the different species detected.</description>

      <title>Physical Characteristics of Jupiter's Trojan (1437) Diomedes from a Tri-chord Stellar Occultation in 2020 and Dimensionless 3D Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jupiter Trojans preserve primitive formation characteristics due to their collisionless stable orbits. Determination of their shapes and size-frequency distribution constrains the collisional evolution of their parent population which also originated the Kuiper Belt. We started a program to find precise sizes/shapes for Trojans, combining stellar occultations and DAMIT 3D shape models. We report results for Diomedes, by fitting its dimensionless 3D model to 3 chords of a stellar occultation observed in 2020, using iterative $\chi^{2}$ procedures. The pole coordinates, rotation period, volume-equivalent radius and geometric albedo were: $\lambda$ = 153.73$^{o}$ $\pm$ 2.5$^{o}$, $\beta$ = 12.69$^{o}$ $\pm$ 2.6$^{o}$, $P$ = 24.4984 $\pm$ 0.0002 h, $R_{eq}$ = 59.4 $\pm$ 0.3 km and $p_{V}$ = 0.030 $\pm$ 0.004. A precise position was obtained too.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Jupiter's interior using machine learning reveals four key structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The internal structure of Jupiter is constrained by the precise gravity field measurements by NASA's Juno mission, atmospheric data from the Galileo entry probe, and Voyager radio occultations. Not only are these observations few compared to the possible interior setups and their multiple controlling parameters, but they remain challenging to reconcile. As a complex, multidimensional problem, characterizing typical structures can help simplify the modeling process. We used NeuralCMS, a deep learning model based on the accurate concentric Maclaurin spheroid (CMS) method, coupled with a fully consistent wind model to efficiently explore a wide range of interior models without prior assumptions. We then identified those consistent with the measurements and clustered the plausible combinations of parameters controlling the interior. We determine the plausible ranges of internal structures and the dynamical contributions to Jupiter's gravity field. Four typical interior structures are identified, characterized by their envelope and core properties. This reduces the dimensionality of Jupiter's interior to only two effective parameters. Within the reduced 2D phase space, we show that the most observationally constrained structures fall within one of the key structures, but they require a higher 1 bar temperature than the observed value. We provide a robust framework for characterizing giant planet interiors with consistent wind treatment, demonstrating that for Jupiter, wind constraints strongly impact the gravity harmonics while the interior parameter distribution remains largely unchanged. Importantly, we find that Jupiter's interior can be described by two effective parameters that clearly distinguish the four characteristic structures and conclude that atmospheric measurements may not fully represent the entire envelope.</description>

      <title>Concealing Circumbinary Planets with Tidal Shrinkage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Of the 14 transiting planets that have been detected orbiting eclipsing binaries ('circumbinary planets'), none have been detected with stellar binary orbital periods shorter than 7 days, despite such binaries existing in abundance. The eccentricity-period data for stellar binaries indicates that short-period ($&lt; 7$ day) binaries have had their orbits tidally circularized. We examine here to what extent tidal circularization and shrinkage can conceal circumbinary planets, i.e. whether planets actually exist around short-period binaries, but are not detected because their transit probabilities drop as tides shrink the binary away from the planet. We carry out a population synthesis by initializing a population of eccentric stellar binaries hosting circumbinary planets, and then circularizing and tightening the host orbits using stellar tides. To match the circumbinary transit statistics, stellar binaries must form with eccentricities $\gtrsim$ 0.2 and periods $\gtrsim$ 6 days, with circumbinary planets emplaced on exterior stable orbits before tidal circularization; moreover, tidal dissipation must be efficient enough to circularize and shrink binaries out to $\sim$6-8 days. The resultant binaries that shrink to sub-7-day periods no longer host transiting planets. However, this scenario cannot explain the formation of nearly circular, tight binaries, brought to their present sub-seven-day orbits from other processes like disk migration. Still, tidal shrinkage can introduce a bias against finding transiting circumbinary planets, and predicts a population of KIC 3853259 (AB)b analogs consisting of wide-separation, non-transiting planets orbiting tight binaries.</description>

      <title>A Well-Characterized Survey for Centaurs in Pan-STARRS1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To prepare for the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time, we develop methods for quantifying the selection function of a wide-field survey as a function of all six orbital parameters and absolute magnitude. We perform a HelioLinC3D search for Centaurs in the Pan-STARRS1 detection catalog and use a synthetic debiasing population to characterize our survey's selection function. We find nine new objects, including Centaur 2010 RJ$_{226}$, among 320 real objects, along with $\sim$70,000 debiasing objects. We use the debiasing population to fit a selection function and apply the selection function to a model Centaur population with literature orbital and size distributions. We confirm the model's marginal distributions but reject its joint distribution, and estimate an intrinsic population of 21,400$^{+3,400}_{-2,800}$ Centaurs with $H_r &lt; 13.7$. The discovery of only nine new objects in archival data verifies that the Pan-STARRS discovery pipeline had high completeness, but also shows that new linking algorithms can contribute even to traditional single-tracklet surveys. As the first systematic application of HelioLinC3D to a survey with extensive sky coverage, this project proves the viability of HelioLinC3D as a discovery algorithm for big-data wide-field surveys.</description>

      <title>UV-processing of icy pebbles in the outer parts of VSI-turbulent disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Icy dust particles emerge in star-forming clouds and are subsequently incorporated in protoplanetary disks, where they coagulate into larger pebbles up to mm in size. In the disk midplane, ices are shielded from UV radiation, but moderate levels of disk turbulence can lift small particles to the disk surface, where they can be altered, or destroyed. Nevertheless, studies of comets and meteorites generally find that ices at least partly retained their interstellar medium (ISM) composition before being accreted onto these minor bodies. Here we model this process through hydrodynamical simulations with VSI-driven turbulence in the outer protoplanetary disk. We use the PLUTO code in a 2.5 D global accretion setup and include Lagrangian dust particles of 0.1 and 1 mm sizes. In a post-processing step, we use the RADMC3D code to generate the local UV radiation field to assess the level of ice processing of pebbles. We find that a small fraction ($\sim$17$\%$) of 100 $\mu$m size particles are frequently lifted up to $Z/R=0.2$ which can result in the loss of their pristine composition as their residence time in this layer allows for effective CO and water photodissociation. The larger 1 mm size particles remain UV-shielded in the disk midplane throughout the dynamical evolution of the disk. Our results indicate that the assembly of icy bodies via the accretion of drifting mm-size icy pebbles can explain the presence of pristine ice from the ISM, even in VSI-turbulent disks. Nevertheless, particles $\leq$ 100 $\mu$m experience efficient UV processing and may mix with unaltered icy pebbles, resulting in a less ISM-like composition in the midplane.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength Study of Dust Emission in the Young Edge-on Protostellar Disk HH 212</title>

Abstract: Grain growth in disks around young stars plays a crucial role in the formation of planets. Early grain growth has been suggested in the HH 212 protostellar disk by previous polarization observations. To confirm it and to determine the grain size, we analyze high-resolution multi-band observations of the disk obtained with Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in Bands 9 (0.4 mm), 7 (0.9 mm), 6 (1.3 mm), 3 (3 mm) as well as with Very Large Array (VLA) in Band Ka (9 mm) and present new VLA data in Bands Q (7 mm), K (1.3 cm), and X (3 cm). We adopt a parameterized flared disk model to fit the continuum maps of the disk in these bands and derive the opacities, albedos, and opacity spectral index $\mathrm{\beta}$ of the dust in the disk, taking into account the dust scattering ignored in the previous work modeling the multi-band data of this source. For the VLA bands, since the continuum emission of the disk is more contaminated by the free-free emission at longer wavelengths, we only include the Band Q data in our modeling. The obtained opacities, albedos, and opacity spectral index $\beta$ (with a value of $\sim$ 1.2) suggest that the upper limit of maximum grain size in the disk be $\sim$ 130 $\mu$m, consistent with that implied in the previous polarization observations in Band 7, supporting the grain growth in this disk.</description>

      <title>Maximum Energy of Particles in Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particles are accelerated to very high, non-thermal energies in space, solar, and astrophysical plasma environments. In cosmic ray physics, the "Hillas limit" is often used as a rough estimate (or the necessary condition) of the maximum energy of particles. This limit is based on the concepts of one-shot direct acceleration by a system-wide motional electric field, as well as stochastic and diffusive acceleration in strongly turbulent environments. However, it remains unclear how well this limit explains the actual observed maximum energies of particles. Here we show, based on a systematic review, that the observed maximum energy of particles -- those in space, solar, astrophysical, and laboratory environments -- often reach the energy predicted by the Hillas limit. We also found several exceptions, such as electrons in solar flares and jet-terminal lobes of radio galaxies, as well as protons in planetary radiation belts, where deviations from this limit occur. We discuss possible causes of such deviations, and we argue in particular that there is a good chance of detecting ultra-high-energy ($\sim$100 GeV) solar flare electrons that have not yet been detected. We anticipate that this study will facilitate further interdisciplinary discussions on the maximum energy of particles and the underlying mechanisms of particle acceleration in diverse plasma environments.</description>

      <title>The Yarkovsky effect on the long-term evolution of binary asteroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the Yarkovsky effect on small binary asteroids. While significant attention has been given to the binary YORP effect, the Yarkovsky effect is often overlooked. We develop an analytical model for the binary Yarkovsky effect, considering both the Yarkovsky-Schach and planetary Yarkovsky components, and verify it against thermophysical numerical simulations. We find that the Yarkovsky force could change the mutual orbit when the asteroid's spin period is unequal to the orbital period. Our analysis predicts new evolutionary paths for binaries. For a prograde asynchronous secondary, the Yarkovsky force will migrate the satellite towards the location of the synchronous orbit on ~100 kyr timescales, which could be faster than other synchronization processes such as YORP and tides. For retrograde secondaries, the Yarkovsky force always migrates the secondary outwards, which could produce asteroid pairs with opposite spin poles. Satellites spinning faster than the Roche limit orbit period (e.g. from ~4h to ~10h) will migrate inwards until they disrupt, reshape, or form a contact binary. We also predict a short-lived equilibrium state for asynchronous secondaries where the Yarkovsky force is balanced by tides. We provide calculations of the Yarkovsky-induced drift rate for known asynchronous binaries. If the NASA DART impact broke Dimorphos from synchronous rotation, we predict that Dimorphos's orbit will shrink by \dot a ~ 7 cm/yr, which can be measured by the Hera mission. We also speculate that the Yarkovsky force may have synchronized the Dinkinesh-Selam system after a possible merger of Selam's two lobes.</description>

      <title>Significant mutual inclinations between the stellar spin and the orbits of both planets in the HAT-P-11 system</title>

Abstract: Planet-star obliquity and planet-planet ]mutual inclination encode a planetary system's dynamical history, but both of their values are hard to measure for misaligned systems with close-in companions. HAT-P-11 is a K4 star with two known planets: a close-in, misaligned super-Neptune with a $\approx$5-day orbit, and an outer super-Jupiter with a $\approx$10-year orbit. In this work we present a joint orbit fit of the HAT-P-11 system with astrometry and S-index corrected RV data. By combining our results with previous constraints on the orientation of the star and the inner planet, we find that all three angular momenta -- those of the star, planet b, and planet c -- are significantly misaligned. We confirm the status of planet c as a super-Jupiter, with $2.68\pm0.41\, \mathrm{M_{\rm Jup}}$ at a semimajor axis of $4.10\pm0.06\,$AU, and planet b's mass of $\mathrm{M_b\sin{i_b}}=0.074\pm0.004\, \mathrm{M_{\rm Jup}}$. We present the posterior probability distribution of obliquity between star A and planet c, and mutual inclination between planet b and planet c.</description>

      <title>Orbit of a Possible Planet X</title>

Abstract: The plausibility of an unseen planet in the outer solar system, and the expected orbit and mass of such a planet, have long been a topic of inquiry and debate. We calculate the long-term orbital stability of distant TNOs, which allows us to expand the sample of objects that would carry dynamical information about a hypothetical unseen planet in the solar system. Using this expanded sample, we find statistically significant clustering at the $\sim 3 \sigma$ level for TNOs with semimajor axes $&gt;170$ AU, in longitude of perihelion ($\varpi$), but not in inclination ($i$), argument of perihelion ($\omega$) or longitude of node ($\Omega$). Since a natural explanation for clustering in $\varpi$ is an unseen planet, we run 300 $n$-body simulations with the giant planets, a disk of test particles representing Kuiper belt objects, and an additional planet with varied initial conditions for its mass, semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination. Based on the distribution of test particles after $1-2$ Gyr, we compute relative likelihoods given the actual distribution of $\varpi$ as a function of semimajor axis for distant TNOs on stable orbits using a significantly larger sample than previous work. We find the best-fit unseen planet parameters to be: mass $m_p = 4.4\pm1.1\mathrm{\;M_{\oplus}}$, semimajor axis $a_p=290\pm30\mathrm{\;AU}$, eccentricity $e_p=0.29\pm0.13$, and inclination $i_p=6.8\pm5.0^{\circ}$. Only $0.06\%$ of the Brown &amp; Batygin (2021) Planet Nine reference population produce probabilities within $1\sigma$ of the maximum within our quadrivariate model, indicating that our work identifies a distinct preferred region of parameter space for an unseen planet in the solar system.</description>

      <title>ALMA and GMRT Studies of Dust Continuum Emission and Spectral Lines Toward Oort Cloud Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The atomic and molecular compounds of cometary ices serve as valuable knowledge into the chemical and physical properties of the outer solar nebula, where comets are formed. From the cometary atmospheres, the atoms and gas-phase molecules arise mainly in three ways: (i) the outgassing from the nucleus, (ii) the photochemical process, and (iii) the sublimation of icy grains from the nucleus. In this paper, we present the radio and millimeter wavelength observation results of Oort cloud non-periodic comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) band L and the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) band 6. We do not detect continuum emissions and an emission line of atomic hydrogen (HI) at rest frequency 1420 MHz from this comet using the GMRT. Based on ALMA observations, we detect the dust continuum emission and rotational emission lines of methanol (CH$_{3}$OH) from comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF). From the dust continuum emission, the activity of dust production (Af$\rho$) of comet ZTF is 2280$\pm$50 cm. Based on LTE spectral modelling, the column density and excitation temperature of CH$_{3}$OH towards C/2022 E3 (ZTF) are (4.50$\pm$0.25)$\times$10$^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ and 70$\pm$3 K. The integrated emission maps show that CH$_{3}$OH was emitted from the coma region of the comet. The production rate of CH$_{3}$OH towards C/2022 E3 (ZTF) is (7.32$\pm$0.64)$\times$10$^{26}$ molecules s$^{-1}$. The fractional abundance of CH$_{3}$OH with respect to H$_{2}$O in the coma of the comet is 1.52%. We also compare our derived abundance of CH$_{3}$OH with the existence modelled value, and we see the observed and modelled values are nearly similar. We claim that CH$_{3}$OH is formed via the subsequential hydrogenation of formaldehyde (H$_{2}$CO) on the grain surface of comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF).</description>

      <title>Diversity of disc viscosities can explain the period ratios of resonant and non-resonant systems of hot super-Earths and mini-Neptunes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Migration is a key ingredient for the formation of close-in super-Earth and mini-Neptune systems, as it sets in which resonances planets can be trapped. Slower migration rates result in wider resonance configurations compared to higher migration rates. We investigate the influence of different migration rates, set by the disc's viscosity, on the structure of multi-planet systems growing by pebble accretion via N-body simulations. Planets in low viscosity environments migrate slower due to partial gap opening. Thus systems formed in low viscosity environments tend to have planets trapped in wider resonant configurations (typically 4:3, 3:2 and 2:1), compared to their high viscosity counterparts (mostly 7:6, 5:4 and 4:3 resonances). After gas disc dissipation, the damping forces cease and the systems can undergo instabilities, rearranging their configurations and breaking the resonance chains. The low viscosity discs naturally account for the resonant chains like Trappist-1, TOI-178 and Kepler-223, unlike high viscosity simulations which produce relatively more compact chains. About 95% of our low viscosity resonant chains became unstable, experiencing giant impacts. Dynamical instabilities in our low viscosity simulations are more violent than those of high viscosity simulations due to the effects of leftover external perturbers (P&gt;200 days). About 50% of our final system ended with no planets within 200 days, while all our systems have remaining outer planets. We speculate that this process could be qualitatively consistent with the lack of inner planets in a large fraction of Sun-like stars. Systems produced in low viscosity simulations alone do not match the overall period ratio distribution of observations, but give a better match to the period distributions of chains, which may suggest that systems of super-Earths and mini-Neptunes form in natal discs with a diversity of viscosities.</description>

      <title>Empirical model of SSUSI-derived auroral ionization rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an empirical model for auroral (90--150 km) electron--ion pair production rates, ionization rates for short, derived from SSUSI (Special Sensor Ultraviolet Spectrographic Imager) electron energy and flux data. Using the Fang et al., 2010 parametrization for mono-energetic electrons, and the NRLMSISE-00 neutral atmosphere model, the calculated ionization rate profiles are binned in 2-h magnetic local time (MLT) and 3.6$^{\circ}$ geomagnetic latitude to yield time series of ionization rates at 5-km altitude steps. We fit each of these time series to the geomagnetic indices Kp, PC, and Ap, the 81-day averaged solar F$_{\text{10.7}}$ radio flux index, and a constant term. The resulting empirical model can easily be incorporated into coupled chemistry--climate models to include particle precipitation effects.</description>

      <title>Post-Keplerian perturbations of the hyperbolic motion in the field of a rotating massive object. Analysis in terms of osculating and nonosculating (contact) elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12063v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The perturbations of the hyperbolic motion of a test particle due to the general relativistic gravitoelectromagnetic Schwarzschild and Lense-Thirring components of the gravitational field of a rotating massive body are analytically worked out to the first post-Newtonian level in terms of the osculating Keplerian orbital elements. To the Newtonian order, the impact of the quadrupole mass moment of the source is calculated as well. The resulting analytical expressions are valid for a generic orientation in space of both the orbital plane of the probe and the spin axis of the primary, and for arbitrary values of the eccentricity. They are applied to 'Oumuamua, an interstellar asteroid which recently visited our solar system along an unbound heliocentric orbit, and to the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) spacecraft during its flyby of the Earth. The calculational approach developed can be straightforwardly extended to any alternative models of gravity as well.</description>
