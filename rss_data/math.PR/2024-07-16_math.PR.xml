      <title>Lattice points inside a random shifted integer polygon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a convex body $C \subset \mathbb{R}^d$. Let $X$ be a random point with uniform distribution in $[0,1]^d$. Consider the value $X_C$ equal to the number of lattice points $\mathbb Z^d$ inside the body $C$ shifted by $X$. It is well known that $\mathbb E X_C = \mathrm{vol}(C)$. The question arises: what can be said about the variance of this random variable? This paper answers this question in the case when $C$ is a polygon with vertices at integer points. Moreover, an explicit distribution of $X_T$ is given for the integer triangle $T$.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Pinning Points on Memorylessness in L\'evy Random Bridges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random Bridges have gained significant attention in recent years due to their potential applications in various areas, particularly in information-based asset pricing models. This paper aims to explore the potential influence of the pinning point's distribution on the memorylessness and stochastic dynamics of the bridge process. We introduce L\'evy bridges with random length and random pinning points and analyze their Markov property. Our study demonstrates that the Markov property of L\'evy bridges depends on the nature of the distribution of their pinning points. The law of any random variables can be decomposed into singular continuous, discrete, and absolutely continuous parts with respect to the Lebesgue measure (Lebesgue's decomposition theorem). We show that the Markov property holds when the pinning points' law does not have an absolutely continuous part. Conversely, the L\'evy bridge fails to exhibit Markovian behavior when the pinning point has an absolutely continuous part.</description>

      <title>On a characterization of probability distribution based on maxima of independent or max-independent random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kotlarski (1978) proved a result on identification of the distributions of independent random variables $X,Y$ and $Z$ from the joint distribution of the bivariate random vector $(U,V)$ where $(U,V)= (\max(X,Z),\max(Y,Z)).$ We extend this result to the case $(U,V)=(\max(X,aZ_1,bZ_2),\max(Y,cZ_1,dZ_2))$ where $X,Y,Z_1,Z_2$ are independent or max-independent random variables, $Z_1$ and $Z_2$ are identically distributed and $a,b,c,d$ are known positive constants.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorems describing isolation by distance under varying population size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a central limit theorem for a spatial $\Lambda$-Fleming-Viot model with fluctuating population size. At each reproduction, a proportion of the population dies and is replaced by a not necessarily equal mass of new individuals. The mass depends on the local population size and a function thereof. Additionally, as new individuals have a single parental type, with growing population size, events become more frequent and of smaller impact, modelling the successful reproduction of a higher number of individuals. From the central limit theorem we derive a Wright-Mal\'ecot formula quantifying the asymptotic probability of identity by descent and thus isolation by distance. The formula reflects that ancestral lineages are attracted by centres of population mass and coalesce with a rate inversely proportional to the population size. Notably, we obtain this information despite the varying population size rendering the dual process intractable.</description>

      <title>Power rate of convergence of discrete curves: framework and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a general framework of estimates for convergence rates of random discrete model curves approaching Schramm Loewner Evolution (SLE) curves in the lattice size scaling limit. We show that a power-law convergence rate of an interface to an SLE curve can be derived from a power-law convergence rate for an appropriate martingale observable provided the discrete curve satisfies a specific bound on crossing events, the Kempannien-Smirnov condition, along with an estimate on the growth of the derivative of the SLE curve. We apply our framework to show that the exploration process for critical site percolation on hexagonal lattice converges to the SLE$_6$ curve with a power-law convergence rate.</description>

      <title>The bilateral generalized inverse Gaussian process with applications to financial modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and document a class of probability distributions, called bilateral generalized inverse Gaussian (BGIG) distributions, that are obtained by convolution of two generalized inverse Gaussian distributions supported by the positive and negative semi-axis. We prove several results regarding their analyticity, shapes and asymptotics, and we introduce the associated L\'evy processes as well as their main properties. We study the behaviour of these processes under change of measure, their simulations and the structure of their sample paths, and we introduce a stock market model constructed by means of exponential BGIG processes. Based on real market data, we show that this model is easy to calibrate thanks notably to idiosyncratic properties of BGIG distributions, and that it is well suited to Monte Carlo and Fourier option pricing.</description>

      <title>Background Vlasov equations and Young measures for passive scalar and vector advection equations under special stochastic scaling limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last few years it was proved that scalar passive quantities subject to suitable stochastic transport noise, and more recently that also vector passive quantities subject to suitable stochastic transport and stretching noise, weakly converge to the solutions of deterministic equations with a diffusion term. In the background of these stochastic models, we introduce stochastic Vlasov equations which gives additional information on the fluctuations and oscillations of solutions: we prove convergence to non-trivial Young measures satisfying limit PDEs with suitable diffusion terms. In the case of a passive vector field the background Vlasov equation adds completely new statistical information to the stochastic advection equation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of Green functions for Markov-additive processes: an approach via dyadic splitting of integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a discrete Markov-additive process, that is a Markov chain on a state space $\mathbb{Z}^d \times E$ with invariant jumps along the $\mathbb{Z}^d$ component. In the case where the set $E$ is finite, we derive an asymptotic equivalent of the Green function of the process, providing a new proof of a result obtained by Dussaule in 2020. This result generalizes the famous theorem of Ney and Spitzer of 1966, that deals with the sum of independent and identically distributed random variables, to a spatially non-homogeneous case.
  In this new proof, we generalize the arguments used in Woess's book Random Walks on Infinite Graphs and Groups to prove Ney and Spitzer's theorem, that consists in establishing an integral formula of the Green function from which we get the asymptotic equivalent. To do so, we use techniques developed by Babillot. In particular, we use dyadic splitting of integrals, a powerful Fourier analysis tool that enables us to control the Fourier transform of a function that has a singularity at the origin.</description>

      <title>Intersection probabilities for flats in hyperbolic space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the $d$-dimensional hyperbolic space $\mathbb{M}_K^d$ of constant curvature $K&lt;0$ and fix a point $o$ playing the role of an origin. Let $\mathbf{L}$ be a uniform random $q$-dimensional totally geodesic submanifold (called $q$-flat) in $\mathbb{M}_K^d$ passing through $o$ and, independently of $\mathbf{L}$, let $\mathbf{E}$ be a random $(d-q+\gamma)$-flat in $\mathbb{M}_K^d$ which is uniformly distributed in the set of all $(d-q+\gamma)$-flats intersecting a hyperbolic ball of radius $u&gt;0$ around $o$. We are interested in the distribution of the random $\gamma$-flat arising as the intersection of $\mathbf{E}$ with $\mathbf{L}$. In contrast to the Euclidean case, the intersection $\mathbf{E}\cap \mathbf{L}$ can be empty with strictly positive probability. We determine this probability and the full distribution of $\mathbf{E}\cap \mathbf{L}$. Thereby, we elucidate crucial differences to the Euclidean case. Moreover, we study the limiting behaviour as $d\uparrow\infty$ and also $K\uparrow 0$. Thereby we obtain a phase transition with three different phases which we completely characterize, including a critical phase with distinctive behavior and a phase recovering the Euclidean results. In the background are methods from hyperbolic integral geometry.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the behavior of large connected components in the Random Connection Model in the subcritical regime with any bounded connection function. We show that the asymptotic size of the largest component restricted to a window is the log of the volume of that window. We adopt methods from the discrete setting, including a sharpness result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the result on the average volume of random polytopes with vertices following beta distributionsto the case of non-identically distributed vectors. Specifically,we consider the convex hull of independent random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$, where each vector follows a beta distribution with potentially different parameters. We derive an expression for the expected volume of these generalized beta--polytopes. Additionally, we compute the expected value of a functional introduced by Wieacker, which involves the distance of facets from the origin and their volumes.Our results extend the findings of Kabluchko, Temesvari,and Th\"ale. Key techniques used in the proofs include the Blaschke--Petkantschin formula, Kubota's formula, and projections of beta distributed random vectors.</description>

      <title>A computational approach to extreme values and related hitting probabilities in level-dependent quasi-birth-death processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the dynamics of a level-dependent quasi-birth-death process ${\cal X}=\{(I(t),J(t)): t\geq 0\}$, i.e., a bi-variate Markov chain defined on the countable state space $\cup_{i=0}^{\infty} l(i)$ with $l(i)=\{(i,j) : j\in\{0,...,M_i\}\}$, for integers $M_i\in\mathbb{N}_0$ and $i\in\mathbb{N}_0$, which has the special property that its $q$-matrix has a block-tridiagonal form. Under the assumption that the first passage to the subset $l(0)$ occurs in a finite time with certainty, we characterize the probability law of $(\tau_{\max},I_{\max},J(\tau_{\max}))$, where $I_{\max}$ is the running maximum level attained by process ${\cal X}$ before its first visit to states in $l(0)$, $\tau_{\max}$ is the first time that the level process $\{I(t): t\geq 0\}$ reaches the running maximum $I_{\max}$, and $J(\tau_{\max})$ is the phase at time $\tau_{\max}$. Our methods rely on the use of restricted Laplace-Stieltjes transforms of $\tau_{\max}$ on the set of sample paths $\{I_{\max}=i,J(\tau_{\max})=j\}$, and related processes under taboo of certain subsets of states. The utility of the resulting computational algorithms is demonstrated in two epidemic models: the SIS model for horizontally and vertically transmitted diseases; and the SIR model with constant population size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are interested in the distribution of Wishart samples after forgetting their scaling factors. We call such a distribution a projective Wishart distribution. We show that projective Wishart distributions have strong links with the affine-invariant geometry of symmetric positive definite matrices in the real case or Hermitian positive definite matrices in the complex case. First, the Fr{\'e}chet mean of a projective Wishart distribution is the covariance parameter, up to a scaling factor, of the corresponding Wishart distribution. Second, in the case of 2 by 2 matrices, the densities have simple expressions in term of the affine-invariant distance.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Statistical Properties of Outputs from a Process Inspired by Geometrical Interpretation of Newton's Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, the statistical properties of Newton s method algorithm output in a specific case have been studied. The relative frequency density of this sample converges to a well-defined function, prompting us to explore its distribution. Through rigorous mathematical proof, we demonstrate that the probability density function follows a Cauchy distribution. Additionally, a new method to generate a uniform distribution is proposed. To further confirm our findings, we employed statistical tests, including the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Anderson-Darling test, which showed high p-values. Furthermore, we show that the distribution of the distance between two successive outputs can be obtained through a transformation method applied to the Cauchy distribution.</description>

      <title>Alternative proof for the bias of the hot hand statistic of streak length one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a sequence of $n$ random variables taking values $0$ or $1$, the hot hand statistic of streak length $k$ counts what fraction of the streaks of length $k$, that is, $k$ consecutive variables taking the value $1$, among the $n$ variables are followed by another $1$. Since this statistic does not use the expected value of how many streaks of length $k$ are observed, but instead uses the realization of the number of streaks present in the data, it may be a biased estimator of the conditional probability of a fixed random variable taking value $1$ if it is preceded by a streak of length $k$, as was first studied and observed explicitly in [Miller and Sanjurjo, 2018]. In this short note, we suggest an alternative proof for an explicit formula of the expectation of the hot hand statistic for the case of streak length one. This formula was obtained through a different argument in [Miller and Sanjurjo, 2018] and [Rinott and Bar-Hillel, 2015].</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Counting and Mixed $p$-Spin Glass Models under Replica Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14571v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fluctuation problems at high temperature in the general mixed $p$-spin glass models under the weak external field assumption: $h= \rho N^{-\alpha}, \rho&gt;0, \alpha \in [1/4,\infty]$. By extending the cluster expansion approach to this generic setting, we convert the fluctuation problem as a hypergraph counting problem and thus obtain a new multiple-transition phenomenon. A by-product of our results is a new critical inverse temperature obtained from optimal second moment estimates. In particular, all our fluctuation results hold up to the threshold. Combining with multivariate Stein's method, we also obtain an explicit convergence rate under proper moment assumptions on the general symmetric disorder. Our results have several further implications. First, our approach works for both even and odd pure $p$-spin models. The leading cluster structures in the odd $p$ case are different and more involved than in the even $p$ case. This combinatorially explains the folklore that odd $p$-spin is more complicated than even $p$. Second, in the mixed $p$-spin setting, the cluster structures differ depending on the relation between the minimum effective even and odd $p$-spins: $p_e$ and $p_o$. As an example, at $h=0$, there are three sub-regimes: $p_e&lt;p_o, p_o&lt;p_e&lt;2p_o, p_e\ge 2p_o$, wherein the first and third ones, the mixed model behaves essentially like a pure $p$-spin model, and only in the second regime, it is more like a mixture. This gives another criterion for classifying mean-field spin glass models compared to the work of Auffinger and Ben Arous (Ann.~Probab.~41 (2013), no.~6, 4214--4247), where the idea is based on complexity computations for spherical models. Third, our framework naturally implies a multi-scale fluctuation phenomenon conjectured in the work of Bovier and Schertzer (Probab. Theory Relat. Fields (2024)).</description>

      <title>Parabolic Fractal Geometry of Stable L\'evy Processes with Drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explicitly calculate the Hausdorff dimension of the graph and range of an isotropic stable L\'{e}vy process $X$ plus deterministic drift function $f$. For that purpose we use a restricted version of the genuine Hausdorff dimension which is called the parabolic Hausdorff dimension. It turns out that covers by parabolic cylinders are optimal for treating self-similar processes, since their distinct non-linear scaling between time and space geometrically matches the self-similarity of the processes. We provide explicit formulas for the Hausdorff dimension of the graph and the range of $X+f$. In sum the parabolic Hausdorff dimension of the drift term $f$ alone contributes to the Hausdorff dimension of $X+f$. Further, we derive some formulas and bounds for the parabolic Hausdorff dimension.</description>

      <title>Roots of polynomials under repeated differentiation and repeated applications of fractional differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We start with a random polynomial $P^{N}$ of degree $N$ with independent coefficients and consider a new polynomial $P_{t}^{N}$ obtained by repeated applications of a fraction differential operator of the form $z^{a}% (d/dz)^{b},$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. When $b&gt;0,$ we compute the limiting root distribution $\mu_{t}$ of $P_{t}^{N}$ as $N\rightarrow\infty.$ We show that $\mu_{t}$ is the push-forward of the limiting root distribution of $P^{N}$ under a transport map $T_{t}$. The map $T_{t}$ is defined by flowing along the characteristic curves of the PDE satisfied by the log potential of $\mu_{t}.$ In the special case of repeated differentiation, our results may be interpreted as saying that the roots evolve radially \textit{with constant speed} until they hit the origin, at which point, they cease to exist. For general $a$ and $b,$ the transport map $T_{t}$ has a free probability interpretation as multiplication of an $R$-diagonal operator by an $R$-diagonal "transport operator." As an application, we obtain a push-forward characterization of the free self-convolution semigroup $\oplus$ of radial measures on $\mathbb{C}$.
  We also consider the case $b&lt;0,$ which includes the case of repeated integration. More complicated behavior of the roots can occur in this case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11921v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an open interacting particle system on a finite lattice. The particles perform asymmetric simple exclusion and are randomly created or destroyed at all sites, with rates that grow rapidly near the boundaries. We study the hydrodynamic limit for the particle density at the hyperbolic space-time scale and obtain the entropy solution to a boundary-driven quasilinear conservation law with a relaxation term. Different from the usual boundary conditions introduced in [Bardos, Roux, and Nedelec, (1979), Comm. Part. Diff. Equ], discontinuity (boundary layer) does not formulate at the boundaries due to the strong relaxation scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study in this paper optimal mass transport over a strongly connected, directed graph on a given discrete time interval. Differently from previous literature, we do not assume full knowledge of the initial and final goods distribution over the network nodes. In spite of the meager information, we show that it is possible to characterize the most likely flow in two important cases: The first one is when the initial and/or final distribution is only known on proper subsets of the nodes. The second case is when only some moments of the marginal distributions are known. As an important by-product, we determine the most likely initial and final marginals on the whole state space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a class of positive discrete random variables extending the Conway--Maxwell-Poisson distribution. This class emerges in a natural way from an application in queueing theory and contains distributions exhibiting quite different features. Some of these distributions are characterized by the presence of Bernstein and inverse Bernstein functions. As a byproduct, we give some results on these inverses for which the existing literature is limited. Moreover, we investigate dispersion properties for these count data models, giving necessary and/or sufficient conditions to obtain both over and underdispersion. We also provide neat expressions for the factorial moments of any order. This furnishes us with a compact form also in the case of the Conway--Maxwell-Poisson.</description>

      <title>One-dimensional SRBM with discontinuous state-dependent drift and variance and its stationary distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16764v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A semi-martingale reflecting Brownian motion is a popular process for diffusion approximations of queueing models including their networks. In this paper, we are concerned with the case that it lives on the nonnegative half-line but its variance and drift discontinuously change depending on its position. This reflecting diffusion process naturally arises from a state-dependent single server queue, studied by the author. Our main interest is in its stationary distribution, which is important for application. We define this reflecting diffusion process as the solution of a stochastic integral equation. Its existence is recently shown by Atar, Castiel and Reiman (2022,2023) under a more general condition than we have studied here, and its uniqueness is obtained also by them under one of the conditions of this paper. We here give elementary proofs for both of them. In this paper, we consider its stability, that is, the condition that the reflecting diffusion process has a stationary distribution, and derive its stationary distribution under the stability condition. Our basic tools are the generalized Ito formula for a convex function and local time. Proofs are rather elementary once it is understood how to use the Ito formula and local time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a random uniform sample of $n$ points in a compact region $A$ of Euclidean $d$-space, $d \geq 2$, with a smooth or (when $d=2$) polygonal boundary. Fix $k \in {\bf N}$. Let $T_{n,k}$ be the threshold $r$ at which the geometric graph on these $n$ vertices with distance parameter $r$ becomes $k$-connected. We show that if $d=2$ then $n (\pi/|A|) T_{n,1}^2 - \log n$ is asymptotically standard Gumbel. For $(d,k) \neq (2,1)$, it is $n (\theta_d/|A|) T_{n,k}^d - (2-2/d) \log n - (4-2k-2/d) \log \log n$ that converges in distribution to a nondegenerate limit, where $\theta_d$ is the volume of the unit ball. The limit is Gumbel with scale parameter 2 except when $(d,k)=(2,2)$ where the limit is two component extreme value distributed. The different cases reflect the fact that boundary effects are more more important in some cases than others. We also give similar results for the largest $k$-nearest neighbour link $U_{n,k}$ in the sample, and show $T_{n,k}=U_{n,k}$ with high probability. We provide estimates on rates of convergence and give similar results for Poisson samples in $A$. Finally, we give similar results even for non-uniform samples, with a less explicit sequence of centring constants.</description>

Abstract: This is a report of a scientific project carried out at Ecole Centrale Casablanca in 2019. This work is an entry into the world of Random Walk in a Random Environment (RWRE). We will discuss some intuitive concepts such as recurrence, location, and random potential. We will thereafter focus on providing an "electrical" understanding of this type of walk and finally explore an application of RWRE to graphene conduction.</description>

Abstract: We prove two-sided bounds on the expected values of several geometric functionals of the convex hull of Brownian motion in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and their inverse processes. This extends some recent results of McRedmond and Xu (2017), Jovaleki\'{c} (2021), and Cygan, \v{S}ebek, and the first author (2023) from the plane to higher dimensions. Our main result shows that the average time required for the convex hull in $\mathbb{R}^n$ to attain unit volume is at most $n\sqrt[n]{n!}$. Moreover, all of our bounds capture the correct order of asymptotic growth or decay in the dimension $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.01989v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the semi-flow given by the continuous time shift $\Theta_t:\mathcal{D} \to \mathcal{D} $, $t \geq 0$, acting on the
  $\mathcal{D} $ of \textit{c\`{a}dl\`{a}g} paths $w: [0,\infty) \to S^1$, where $S^1$ is the unitary circle. We equip the space $\mathcal{D} $ with the Skorokhod metric, and we show that the semi-flow is expanding. We also introduce a stochastic semi-group $e^{t\, L}$, $t \geq 0,$ where $L$ acts linearly on continuous functions $f:S^1\to\mathbb{R}$. This stochastic semigroup and an initial vector of probability $\pi$ define an associated stationary shift-invariant probability $\mathbb{P}$ on the Polish space $\mathcal{D} $. Given such $\mathbb{P}$ and an H\"older potential $V:S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$, we define a continuous time Ruelle operator, which is described by a family of linear operators $ \mathbb{L}^t_V$, $t\geq 0,$ acting on continuous functions $\varphi: S^1 \to \mathbb{R}$. More precisely, given any H\"older $V$ and $t\geq 0$, the operator $ \mathbb{L}^t_V$, is defined by
  $\varphi \to \psi(y) = \mathbb{L}^t_V(\varphi)(y)= \int_{w(t)=y} e^{ \int_0^t V(w(s)) ds} \varphi (w(0)) d \mathbb{P}(w).$
  For some specific parameters we show the existence of an eigenvalue $\lambda_V$ and an associated H\"older eigenfunction $\varphi_V&gt;0$.After a coboundary procedure we obtain another stochastic semigroup, with infinitesimal generator $L_V$, and this will define a new probability $\mathbb{P}_V$ on $\mathcal{D}$, which we call the Gibbs (or, equilibrium) probability for the potential $V$. In this case, we define entropy for some shift-invariant probabilities on $\mathcal{D}$, and we consider a variational problem of pressure. Finally, we define entropy production and present our main result: we analyze its relation with time-reversal and symmetry of $L$. We also show that the continuous-time shift $\Theta_t$, acting on the Skorohod space $D$, is expanding.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new model of financial market with stochastic volatility driven by an arbitrary H\"older continuous Gaussian Volterra process. The distinguishing feature of the model is the form of the volatility equation which ensures the solution to be ``sandwiched'' between two arbitrary H\"older continuous functions chosen in advance. We discuss the structure of local martingale measures on this market, investigate integrability and Malliavin differentiability of prices and volatilities as well as study absolute continuity of the corresponding probability laws. Additionally, we utilize Malliavin calculus to develop an algorithm of pricing options with discontinuous payoffs.</description>

      <title>Pathwise Uniform Convergence of Time Discretisation Schemes for SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00411v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we prove convergence rates for time discretisation schemes for semi-linear stochastic evolution equations with additive or multiplicative Gaussian noise, where the leading operator $A$ is the generator of a strongly continuous semigroup $S$ on a Hilbert space $X$, and the focus is on non-parabolic problems. The main results are optimal bounds for the uniform strong error $$\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty} := \Big(\mathbb{E} \sup_{j\in \{0, \ldots, N_k\}} \|U(t_j) - U^j\|^p\Big)^{1/p},$$ where $p \in [2,\infty)$, $U$ is the mild solution, $U^j$ is obtained from a time discretisation scheme, $k$ is the step size, and $N_k = T/k$. The usual schemes such as the exponential Euler, the implicit Euler, and the Crank-Nicolson method, etc. are included as special cases. Under conditions on the nonlinearity and the noise, we show
  - $\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty}\lesssim k \log(T/k)$ (linear equation, additive noise, general $S$);
  - $\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty}\lesssim \sqrt{k} \log(T/k)$ (nonlinear equation, multiplicative noise, contractive $S$);
  - $\mathrm{E}_{k}^{\infty}\lesssim k \log(T/k)$ (nonlinear wave equation, multiplicative noise) for a large class of time discretisation schemes. The logarithmic factor can be removed if the exponential Euler method is used with a (quasi)-contractive $S$. The obtained bounds coincide with the optimal bounds for SDEs. Most of the existing literature is concerned with bounds for the simpler pointwise strong error $$\mathrm{E}_k:=\bigg(\sup_{j\in \{0,\ldots,N_k\}}\mathbb{E} \|U(t_j) - U^{j}\|^p\bigg)^{1/p}.$$ Applications to Maxwell equations, Schr\"odinger equations, and wave equations are included. For these equations, our results improve and reprove several existing results with a unified method and provide the first results known for the implicit Euler and the Crank-Nicolson method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13585v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elliott and Halberstam proved that $\sum_{p&lt;n} 2^{\omega(n-p)}$ is asymptotic to $\phi(n)$. In analogy to the Erd\H{o}s--Kac Theorem, Elliott conjectured that if one restricts the summation to primes $p$ such that $\omega(n-p)\le 2 \log \log n+\lambda(2\log \log n)^{1/2}$ then the sum will be asymptotic to $\phi(n)\int_{-\infty}^{\lambda} e^{-t^2/2}dt/\sqrt{2\pi}$. We show that this conjecture follows from the Bombieri--Vinogradov Theorem. We further prove a related result involving Poisson--Dirichlet distribution, employing deeper lying level of distribution results of the primes.</description>

Abstract: We consider nonnegative solutions of the quasilinear heat equation $\partial_t u = \tfrac{1}{2} u \partial_x^2 u$ in one dimension. Our solutions may vanish and may be unbounded. The equation is then degenerate, and weak solutions are generally nonunique. We introduce a notion of strong solution that ensures uniqueness. For suitable initial data, we prove a lower bound on the time for which a strong solution $u$ exists and $\sqrt{u}$ remains globally Lipschitz in space. In a companion paper, we show that this condition is important in the study of two-dimensional nonlinear stochastic heat equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the geometry and spectral theory of Weil-Petersson random surfaces with genus-$g$ and $n$ cusps in the large-$n$ limit. We show that for a random hyperbolic surface in $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ with $n$ large, the number of small Laplacian eigenvalues is linear in $n$ with high probability. By work of Ballmann, Matthiesen and Mondal [7], this result is optimal up to a multiplicative constant. We also study the relative frequency of simple and non-simple closed geodesics, showing that on random surfaces with many cusps, most closed geodesics with lengths up to $\log(n)$ scales are non-simple. Our main technical contribution is a novel large-$n$ asymptotic formula for the Weil-Petersson volume $V_{g,n}\left(\ell_{1},\dots,\ell_{k}\right)$ of the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}\left(\ell_{1},\dots,\ell_{k}\right)$ of genus-$g$ hyperbolic surfaces with $k$ geodesic boundary components and $n-k$ cusps with $k$ fixed, building on work of Manin and Zograf [31].</description>

      <title>Partially Stochastic Infinitely Deep Bayesian Neural Networks</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we present Partially Stochastic Infinitely Deep Bayesian Neural Networks, a novel family of architectures that integrates partial stochasticity into the framework of infinitely deep neural networks. Our new class of architectures is designed to improve the computational efficiency of existing architectures at training and inference time. To do this, we leverage the advantages of partial stochasticity in the infinite-depth limit which include the benefits of full stochasticity e.g. robustness, uncertainty quantification, and memory efficiency, whilst improving their limitations around computational complexity. We present a variety of architectural configurations, offering flexibility in network design including different methods for weight partition. We also provide mathematical guarantees on the expressivity of our models by establishing that our network family qualifies as Universal Conditional Distribution Approximators. Lastly, empirical evaluations across multiple tasks show that our proposed architectures achieve better downstream task performance and uncertainty quantification than their counterparts while being significantly more efficient.

      <title>Scaling limit of domino tilings on a pentagonal domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the six-vertex model at its free-fermion point with domain wall boundary conditions, which is equivalent to random domino tilings of the Aztec diamond. We compute the scaling limit of a particular non-local correlation function, essentially equivalent to the partition function for the domino tilings of a pentagon-shaped domain, obtained by cutting away a triangular region from a corner of the initial Aztec diamond. We observe a third-order phase transition when the geometric parameters of the obtained pentagonal domain are tuned to have the fifth side exactly tangent to the arctic ellipse of the corresponding initial model.</description>
