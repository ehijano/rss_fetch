      <title>Latent Variable Phillips Curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper re-examines the empirical Phillips curve (PC) model and its usefulness in the context of medium-term inflation forecasting. A latent variable Phillips curve hypothesis is formulated and tested using 3,968 randomly generated factor combinations. Evidence from US core PCE inflation between Q1 1983 and Q1 2025 suggests that latent variable PC models reliably outperform traditional PC models six to eight quarters ahead and stand a greater chance of outperforming a univariate benchmark. Incorporating an MA(1) residual process improves the accuracy of empirical PC models across the board, although the gains relative to univariate models remain small. The findings presented in this paper have two important implications: First, they corroborate a new conceptual view on the Phillips curve theory; second, they offer a novel path towards improving the competitiveness of Phillips curve forecasts in future empirical work.</description>

      <title>The Physics of Price Discovery: Deconvolving Information, Volatility, and the Critical Breakdown of Signal during Retail Herding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building on the finding that Market Cap Normalization ($\SMC$) isolates the ``pure'' directional signal of informed trading \citep{kang2025}, this paper investigates the physics of how that signal is transmitted -- and how it breaks down. We employ \textbf{Tikhonov-regularized deconvolution} to recover the impulse response kernels of investor flows, revealing a dual-channel market structure: Foreign and Institutional investors act as ``architects'' of price discovery (positive permanent impact), while Individual investors act as liquidity providers (negative total impact). However, using \textbf{Multivariate Hawkes Processes}, we demonstrate that this structure is fragile. We find that individual investor order flow exhibits near-critical self-excitation (Branching Ratio $\approx$ 0.998). During periods of high retail herding, the market undergoes a \textbf{phase transition} into a ``critical state.'' In this regime, the signal-to-noise ratio collapses, causing the price impact of sophisticated investors to reverse from positive to negative. These findings suggest that retail contagion acts as a physical barrier that temporarily disables efficient price discovery.</description>

      <title>Distributional Fitting and Tail Analysis of Lead-Time Compositions: Nights vs. Revenue on Airbnb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze daily lead-time distributions for two Airbnb demand metrics, Nights Booked (volume) and Gross Booking Value (revenue), treating each day's allocation across 0-365 days as a compositional vector. The data span 2,557 days from January 2019 through December 2025 in a large North American region. Three findings emerge. First, GBV concentrates more heavily in mid-range horizons: beyond 90 days, GBV tail mass typically exceeds Nights by 20-50%, with ratios reaching 75% at the 180-day threshold during peak seasons. Second, Gamma and Weibull distributions fit comparably well under interval-censored cross-entropy. Gamma wins on 61% of days for Nights and 52% for GBV, with Weibull close behind at 38% and 45%. Lognormal rarely wins (&lt;3%). Nonparametric GAMs achieve 18-80x lower CRPS but sacrifice interpretability. Third, generalized Pareto fits suggest bounded tails for both metrics at thresholds below 150 days, though this may partly reflect right-truncation at 365 days; above 150 days, estimates destabilize. Bai-Perron tests with HAC standard errors identify five structural breaks in the Wasserstein distance series, with early breaks coinciding with COVID-19 disruptions. The results show that volume and revenue lead-time shapes diverge systematically, that simple two-parameter distributions capture daily pmfs adequately, and that tail inference requires care near truncation boundaries.</description>

      <title>Beyond Visual Realism: Toward Reliable Financial Time Series Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative models for financial time series often create data that look realistic and even reproduce stylized facts such as fat tails or volatility clustering. However, these apparent successes break down under trading backtests: models like GANs or WGAN-GP frequently collapse, yielding extreme and unrealistic results that make the synthetic data unusable in practice. We identify the root cause in the neglect of financial asymmetry and rare tail events, which strongly affect market risk but are often overlooked by objectives focusing on distribution matching. To address this, we introduce the Stylized Facts Alignment GAN (SFAG), which converts key stylized facts into differentiable structural constraints and jointly optimizes them with adversarial loss. This multi-constraint design ensures that generated series remain aligned with market dynamics not only in plots but also in backtesting. Experiments on the Shanghai Composite Index (2004--2024) show that while baseline GANs produce unstable and implausible trading outcomes, SFAG generates synthetic data that preserve stylized facts and support robust momentum strategy performance. Our results highlight that structure-preserving objectives are essential to bridge the gap between superficial realism and practical usability in financial generative modeling.</description>

      <title>Demystifying the trend of the healthcare index: Is historical price a key driver?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Healthcare sector indices consolidate the economic health of pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and healthcare service firms. The short-term movements in these indices are closely intertwined with capital allocation decisions affecting research and development investment, drug availability, and long-term health outcomes. This research investigates whether historical open-high-low-close (OHLC) index data contain sufficient information for predicting the directional movement of the opening index on the subsequent trading day. The problem is formulated as a supervised classification task involving a one-step-ahead rolling window. A diverse feature set is constructed, comprising original prices, volatility-based technical indicators, and a novel class of nowcasting features derived from mutual OHLC ratios. The framework is evaluated on data from healthcare indices in the U.S. and Indian markets over a five-year period spanning multiple economic phases, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The results demonstrate robust predictive performance, with accuracy exceeding 0.8 and Matthews correlation coefficients above 0.6. Notably, the proposed nowcasting features have emerged as a key determinant of the market movement. We have employed the Shapley-based explainability paradigm to further elucidate the contribution of the features: outcomes reveal the dominant role of the nowcasting features, followed by a more moderate contribution of original prices. This research offers a societal utility: the proposed features and model for short-term forecasting of healthcare indices can reduce information asymmetry and support a more stable and equitable health economy.</description>

      <title>Market Making in Spot Precious Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15478v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary challenge of market making in spot precious metals is navigating the liquidity that is mainly provided by futures contracts. The Exchange for Physical (EFP) spread, which is the price difference between futures and spot, plays a pivotal role and exhibits multiple modes of relaxation corresponding to the diverse trading horizons of market participants. In this paper, we model the EFP spread using a nested Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, in the spirit of the two-factor Hull-White model for interest rates. We demonstrate the suitability of the framework for maximizing the expected P\&amp;L of a market maker while minimizing inventory risk across both spot and futures. Using a computationally efficient technique to approximate the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation associated with the corresponding stochastic optimal control problem, our methodology facilitates strategy optimization on demand in near real-time, paving the way for advanced algorithmic market making that capitalizes on the co-integration properties intrinsic to the precious metals sector.</description>
