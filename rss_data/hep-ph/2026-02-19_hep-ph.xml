      <title>A compendium of cold-nuclear matter baseline predictions in light-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent light-ion collision programme at RHIC and the LHC provides a unique opportunity to investigate the onset of quark-gluon plasma formation and parton energy loss in small systems. A quantitative interpretation of emerging jet quenching measurements requires precise control over cold nuclear matter (CNM) effects, which modify hard-process cross sections independently of any hot-medium dynamics. In this work, we present a comprehensive set of perturbative QCD baseline calculations for nuclear modification factors ($R_{AA}$) in proton-oxygen (pO), oxygen-oxygen (OO) and neon-neon (NeNe) collisions at LHC energies. The study includes charged hadron, neutral pion, prompt photon, and electroweak-boson production computed at next-to-leading order using a broad set of recent nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs). We demonstrate that CNM effects alone can induce sizeable suppressions in light-ion systems, with large associated nPDF uncertainties that currently limit the quantitative extraction of parton energy loss. To address this limitation, we explore a range of multi-cross-section ratios in which CNM effects and their uncertainties largely cancel. In particular, ratios of neutral pion $R_{OO}$ to prompt photon $R_{OO}$ or charged hadron $R_{OO}$ to $R_{pO}^2$ provide theoretically robust observables with substantially reduced nPDF uncertainties, thereby enhancing sensitivity to possible energy-loss signatures.</description>

      <title>Probing baryon number with missing energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quark portal interactions $qqqN$ with a light singlet fermion $N$ make baryon number testable through missing transverse energy (MET). We find that present LHC data constrain scales up to 10 TeV (MET plus jet) and 15 TeV (MET plus top). With increasing mass, or larger portal couplings, $N$ becomes less long-lived, and gives clean displaced vertex signatures, which encourage dedicated searches. We also narrow down viable mesogenesis models with color triplet scalars to a mass range $\sim y \, (2-3) \, \text{TeV}$ and couplings $y$ to $b$- and second generation quarks, a window that can be scrutinized by HL-LHC. Interactions also induce rare decays of type baryon (meson) to meson (baryon) plus invisible, which complement high-$p_T$ searches and can prove baryon number violation. We explore charm decays $\Lambda_c \to (\pi,K) + \mathrm{invisible}$. Their branching ratios are subject to sizable hadronic uncertainties and require high luminosity flavor facilities such as a Tera-Z facility (FCC-ee, CEPC). Branching ratios of top quarks into one or two $b$-jets plus $N$ can reach few$\times 10^{-6}$.</description>

      <title>Statistics of Daily Modulation in Dark Matter Direct Detection Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-dependent modulation of the event rate in dark matter direct detection experiments, arising from the motion of the Earth with respect to the Galactic rest frame, is a distinctive signature whose observation is crucial for claiming a discovery of dark matter. While annual modulation has been well studied for decades, daily modulation due to the Earth's rotation has attracted increased attention recently due to the identification of anisotropic solid-state detector materials that yield a direction-dependent scattering rate without sacrificing the overall rate. We perform a statistical analysis of daily modulation in dark matter scattering experiments, with the goal of maximizing the statistical significance of a modulating signal in the presence of an unknown background rate, which may be either flat (non-modulating), or modulating over a 24-hour period with a known or unknown phase. In the background-dominated regime, we find that the discovery significance scales as $f_\text{RMS} \sqrt{T}$, where $T$ is the total exposure time and $f_\text{RMS}$ is the root-mean-square modulation amplitude; in particular, the significance continues to improve with exposure rather than saturating due to systematic uncertainties in the background rate. Using anisotropic trans-stilbene detectors for sub-GeV dark matter as a benchmark example, we provide prescriptions for optimizing the significance for a given total detector mass and location. In an example analysis using three detectors, optimizing the detector orientations can reduce the required exposure by a factor of $\sim 5$ for a desired discovery or exclusion significance, even after profiling over an unknown modulating background phase.</description>

      <title>Novel Constraints on Spin-Dependent Light Dark Matter Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the sensitivity of the SNO experiment to light dark matter particles $\chi$ with spin-dependent interactions with nucleons. We show that the pair-production of MeV scale dark matter is possible in heavy water (CANDU) reactors via ${\rm D}(n,\chi\bar\chi)^3{\rm He}$, and calculate the expected rate within the simplest models of $\chi$-nucleon interactions. %Heavy water nuclear reactors serve as an excellent production method for spin-dependent dark matter. Owing to a sizable $Q$-value for this reaction, a large fraction of DM particles produced this way are above the threshold for deuteron disintegration, ${\rm D}(\chi,\chi)np$, which adds to the SNO neutral current signal. Evaluating the CANDU-to-SNO scheme for the production and detection of DM, we derive novel constraints for the $\chi$-nucleon spin-dependent cross sections, showing that cross sections above $\sigma_{\chi p} \sim 10^{-33}\,{\rm cm}^{2}$ are generally excluded if $m_\chi \leq1.5$\,MeV. An isospin-mirror reaction will occur in the Sun, and for the kinematically allowed region it excludes a portion of parameter space with cross sections on the order $10^{-37}\,{\rm cm}^{2}$. We also evaluate the potential sensitivity of small ``near" detectors placed in close proximity to a CANDU reactor to search for a coherent nuclear recoil, finding subdominant sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Towards the inclusion of NLO EW corrections in the MiNLO method in Drell-Yan processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present the first application of the MiNLO method to the calculation of QED NLO corrections to the production of a neutral vector boson in Drell-Yan processes. We consider only the case of initial-state radiation, when the Z boson decays into neutrinos. We illustrate the abelianization procedure of the MiNLO formulae and discuss the impact that it has on the differential cross section. We then propose a variant of the MiNLO formulae in order to circumvent some of the problems that arise when dealing with QED emissions. Since this is a case study, we use ad-hoc parton distribution functions and a larger value of the electromagnetic coupling constant, in order to emphasize potential discrepancies with respect to the expected behavior of the MiNLO formulae. We quantify the uncertainties connected with the proposed method, also for a the physical value of the electromagnetic coupling. The study presented here is a necessary first step towards incorporating full electroweak effects into the MiNNLOPS framework.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Production of Kaons on the Nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of the electromagnetic production of strange quarks began in the 1950s as something of a curiosity that puzzled experimentalists and theorists alike. As the datasets increased, concomitant advances in theoretical models were realized. A paradigm shift occurred in the 1990s with the development of second-generation facilities at ELSA, MAMI, SPring-8, and JLab, which brought nuclear physics experiments forward by orders of magnitude in counting statistics compared to the first-generation efforts. This was an utter boon to strangeness physics investigations, and to date, more than 50 dedicated experiments in kaon photo- and electroproduction have been completed at facilities around the world, leading to a host of experimental observables that have enabled significant advances in the exploration of strongly interacting systems that decay via $s\bar{s}$ quark pair creation. This review was designed to provide the first-ever in-depth overview of both the experimental and theoretical progress in the field of the electromagnetic production of strangeness. This work looks back over 70 years of past developments, discusses ongoing work and near-term plans, and details future possibilities being considered for third-generation facilities. Throughout this work, the primary impacts of these explorations are highlighted, along with connections to a wide range of related phenomenological applications. An important goal of this review is to provide a complete, self-contained guide into this field prepared at a level that is relevant for both new and seasoned scientists, whether experimentalists, phenomenologists, or theorists, to better understand what has been accomplished by so many dedicated folks-each building on what has come before-and to appreciate the exciting future potential for continued studies in this area. A more complete abstract is provided in the paper.</description>

      <title>Is the Standard Model Effective Field Theory Enough for Higgs Pair Production?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Higgs-boson pair production in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) up to dimension six and in the Higgs Effective Field Theory (HEFT) at leading order in the effective theory expansion, and assess which description is appropriate in concrete UV scenarios. Motivated by "Loryon"-inspired models, we compare the Higgs pair production cross sections predicted by the full models to their SMEFT and HEFT counterparts. We identify regimes in which the two EFTs provide comparable descriptions, and clarify the limits required for their couplings to match. We also find that, for parts of parameter space in some of these models, HEFT can reproduce Higgs pair production more accurately than SMEFT, highlighting di-Higgs measurements as a potential probe of non-linear electroweak dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quasi-two-body decays $B^+\to D_s^+ (R\to) K^+K^-$ in the perturbative QCD approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search for the decay $B^+\to D_s^+ K^+K^-$ has been reported by the LHCb Collaboration using $pp$ collision data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $4.8\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, collected at center-of-mass energies of 7, 8, and 13~TeV, in which no amplitude analysis of the $K^+K^-$ subsystem was performed. In this work, we study the resonant contributions to the decay $B^+\to D_s^+ K^+K^-$ within the perturbative QCD (PQCD) factorization framework. Contributions from the $S$-wave resonances $f_0(980)$, $f_0(1370)$, and $f_0(1500)$, the $P$-wave resonance $\phi(1020)$, and the $D$-wave resonances $f_2(1270)$ and $f_2(1525)$ are taken into account. By introducing the corresponding two-meson distribution amplitudes for the $K^+K^-$ system, we perform a complete perturbative analysis of the quasi-two-body decays $B^+\to D_s^+(R\to)K^+K^-$, where $R$ denotes an intermediate resonance, and present the first PQCD predictions for the associated branching fractions. Using the narrow-width approximation, we further extract the branching fractions of the corresponding two-body decays $B^+\to D_s^+R$. Our results are consistent with the available experimental measurements and previous theoretical studies. Finally, we find that direct CP asymmetries vanish for these quasi-two-body decays within the Standard Model, so that any experimentally observed nonzero CP asymmetry would constitute a clear signal of physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>All-path-length and sub-eikonal corrections to momentum broadening in the opacity expansion approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of momentum broadening for high-energy partons traversing the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP), extending the Gyulassy-Levai-Vitev (GLV) formalism to include both all-path-length (APL) and sub-eikonal corrections. Traditional GLV calculations rely on the large separation distance and large formation time approximations, which are valid for large systems, but whose applicability in small systems such as pp and p/dA may fail. We derive analytic expressions for the momentum broadening distributions to first order in the opacity expansion, and perform a numerical investigation to quantify their impact. Our results show that the APL result reduces the low-momentum broadening and the sub-eikonal correction enhances the high-momentum broadening. The combined APL and sub eikonal correction show that the sub-eikonal correction mitigates the effect of the APL correction.</description>

      <title>High Energy Nuclear Optics of polarized nucleons and nuclei: research at complex Nuclotron M- NICA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Refracton of particles (nucleons, nuclei, $\gamma$-quanta) in matter with polarized protons (nuclei) results in revealing coherent quasi-optical phenomenon of nuclear spin precession of particles (nuclei) in the pseudomagnetic field of matter with polarized spins and the phenomenon of birefringence of particles (nuclei) with spin $S \ge 1$. These phenomena can be observed and studied at complex NuclotronM-NICA. The similar effects for $\gamma$-quanta could be observed at LINAC accelerator. Quasi-optical coherent phenomena of spin rotation and dichroism are not caused by strong interactions only, the T-odd P-odd, T-odd P-even, T-even P-odd interactions also contribute. Limits for the value of these contributions at energies available at complex NuclotronM-NICA can be obtained by investigating all these phenomena. When studying polarized particles collisions, it is necessary to consider possible influences of quasi-optical phenomena of spin rotation and spin dichroism caused by nuclear precession and birefringence.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a systematic study of the event characteristics and physics of neutrino-antineutrino discrimination associated with atmospheric neutrino charged-current interactions in large liquid scintillator detectors. This study encompasses the primary neutrino interactions, the sequential second interactions of final-state particles, and the final neutron captures. We carefully investigate the properties of final-state charged leptons and hadrons, providing distinct distributions of inelasticity and captured neutron multiplicity for both neutrino and antineutrino interactions. These distributions are employed to assess the quantitative performance of neutrino-antineutrino discrimination. Our findings lay the groundwork for atmospheric neutrino oscillation studies in large liquid scintillator detectors, particularly in the determination of neutrino mass ordering.</description>

      <title>Quantum Estimation Theory Limits in Neutrino Oscillation Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) neutrino mixing parameters have entered a precision era, enabling increasingly stringent tests of neutrino oscillations. Within the framework of quantum estimation theory, we investigate whether flavor measurements, the only observables currently accessible experimentally, are optimal for extracting the oscillation parameters. We compute the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) and the classical Fisher Information (FI) associated with ideal flavor projections for all oscillation parameters, considering accelerator muon (anti)neutrino and reactor electron antineutrino beams propagating in vacuum. Two main results emerge. First, flavor measurements saturate the QFI at the first oscillation maximum for $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$, and $\theta_{12}$, demonstrating their information-theoretic optimality for these parameters. In contrast, they are far from optimal for $\delta_{CP}$. In particular, only a small fraction of the available information on $\delta_{CP}$ is extracted at the first maximum; the sensitivity improves at the second maximum, in line with the strategy of ESS$\nu$SB, a planned facility. Second, the QFI associated with $\delta_{CP}$ is approximately one order of magnitude smaller than that of the mixing angles, indicating that the neutrino state intrinsically encodes less information about CP violation. Nevertheless, this quantum bound lies well below current experimental uncertainties, implying that the present precision on $\delta_{CP}$ is not fundamentally limited. Our results provide a quantitative framework to disentangle fundamental from practical limitations and establish a benchmark for optimizing future neutrino facilities.</description>

      <title>Isospin dependence of nuclear EMC effect from global QCD analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a new global QCD analysis of unpolarized parton distribution functions (PDFs) in the nucleon from proton, deuteron and $A=3$ data, including recent measurements of $^3$He/$D$ and $^3$H/$D$ cross section ratios from the MARATHON experiment at Jefferson Lab. Simultaneously inferring the PDFs and nucleon off-shell corrections allows both to be determined consistently, without theoretical assumptions about the isospin dependence of nuclear effects. The analysis provides strong evidence for the need of nucleon off-shell corrections to describe the $A=3$ data, and suggests the presence of both isoscalar and isovector nuclear effects in $A \leq 3$ nuclei. We find that the extracted EMC ratios of nuclear to nucleon structure functions for $A=2$ and 3 differ from those naively extrapolated from heavy nuclei down to low $A$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the phenomenon of string breaking in the context of the spatial Wilson loops using the gauge/string duality. In particular, we discuss the impact of light flavors on the pseudopotential. We also introduce the notion of the spatial string breaking distance and estimate it for $SU(3)$ gauge theory in the temperature range $0\,\text{-}\,3\,T_c$.</description>

      <title>Scattering data and correlation function for the $K f_1(1285)$ interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the interaction of a kaon with the $f_1(1285)$ resonance, assuming that the $f_1(1285)$ is a molecular state generated by the $K \bar K^*, \bar K K^*$ interaction, evaluating the scattering amplitude, the scattering length and effective range of the $K f_1$ system. The scattering amplitude develops a resonant structure approximately $10$ MeV below the $K f_1$ threshold, with a width of around $15$ MeV. The corresponding correlation function has the distinctive shape of a system with a bound state close to threshold. We also show that the interaction of the $K f_1$ system is differs significantly from the one obtained assuming that the $f_1(1285)$ is an elementary particle. This provides motivation to continue the search for these observables, already initiated by the measurement of the $p f_1(1285)$ correlation function by the ALICE collaboration.</description>

      <title>Sign-Switching Dark Energy: Smooth Transitions with Recent \textit{DESI DR2} Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sign-switching dark energy provides a novel mechanism for modifying the late-time expansion history of the Universe without invoking additional fields or finely tuned initial conditions. In this work, we investigate a class of background--level cosmological models in which the dark energy contribution changes sign at a transition redshift $z_\dagger$, producing a sharp deviation from standard $\Lambda$CDM dynamics. We confront these models with a comprehensive set of cosmological observations, including \textit{Planck 18} cosmic microwave background (CMB) measurements, \textit{\textit{DESI DR2}} Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data and the \textit{Pantheon+} $\&amp;$ \textit{SH0ES} Type Ia supernova sample (SN). Using a full Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis, we find that the sign-switching scenario significantly alleviates the Hubble tension while obtaining better results when statistically comparing with $\Lambda$CDM, as quantified by the Akaike and Bayesian information Criteria. Although the model is explored only at the background level, the improvement in the inferred Hubble constant demonstrates that sign-switching dark energy offers a promising and physically economical pathway toward resolving late-universe discrepancies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of the tensor polarizability of a nucleus on thebound-state energy levels, and obtain a general formula for the contribution of the tensor polarizability to the energy levels in two-body bound systems. In particular, it is demonstrated that the tensor polarizability leads to mixing between states with different orbital angular momenta. The effect of tensor polarizability is evaluated for the hyperfine-structure components of P states and for the mixing of S and D states in muonic deuterium.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Primordial Black Holes formed by Null Energy Condition Violation during Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A transient violation of the null energy condition (NEC) during inflation provides a novel mechanism for producing primordial black holes (PBHs) and stochastic gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds. In this work, we extend previous studies by computing the GW contributions from both the ringdown phase of PBH formation and subsequent binary mergers. Our results show that this scenario produces a rich, multi-component GW spectrum consisting of primordial GWs, scalar-induced GWs, and GW emissions from PBH ringdown and binary mergers. We demonstrate that these correlated signatures across different frequency bands provide a novel and powerful avenue to probe or constrain NEC violation during inflation through future multi-band GW observations.</description>

      <title>Rapidity dependence of mean transverse momentum fluctuation and decorrelation in baryon-dense medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I study the event-by-event fluctuation and rapidity decorrelation of the mean transverse momentum $\spt$, which has recently been proposed as a sensitive probe of the equation of state at finite baryon density. The investigation reveals that, in a baryon-rich medium, the event-by-event fluctuation of the mean transverse momentum is driven by the combined effects of energy-density and net-baryon-density fluctuations. Consequently, the rapidity dependence of this observable provides a promising handle to probe the three-dimensional structure of both energy and baryon density profiles. Previous studies have shown that $\spt$ decorrelation along rapidity is largely insensitive to shear and bulk viscosity; however, its dependence on baryon diffusion, another key transport coefficient in baryonic matter, has not been explored. I find that baryon diffusion has a negligible impact, establishing this observable as a robust probe of the equation of state. Furthermore, I present predictions for identified hadrons and observe a pronounced splitting in the rapidity decorrelation of mean transverse momentum between protons and antiprotons, indicating different transverse flow dynamics for baryons and antibaryons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effective potential for a scalar theory with $\lambda\phi^4$ interaction, coupled to a massless fermion through Yukawa interaction is calculated by summing over infinite number of two particle irreducible (2PI) diagrams of two different types and a 2PI diagram of a third type using Cornwall, Jackiw and Tomboulis (CJT) method. There is an inversion symmetry present in the effective potential under $\phi\rightarrow -\phi$. At large coupling it exhibits minima below the zero potential line and on either side of the maximum at $\phi=0$. The fermion acquires a mass at any non-trivial, positive minimum breaking the inversion symmetry of the vacuum.</description>

      <title>Recent results on the $\Lambda \rightarrow p\ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$ semileptonic decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice-QCD determination of the $\Lambda \to p$ vector and axial-vector form factors, providing theoretical input for studies of the semileptonic decay $\Lambda \to p\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell$. The calculation is carried out on a single gauge ensemble with physical light, strange, and charm quark masses and delivers a precise determination of the complete set of transition form factors, including second-class contributions.
  Using these form factors, we compute decay rates for both the electronic and muonic channels, as well as their ratio, which offers a sensitive test of lepton-flavor universality and possible non-standard scalar or tensor interactions.
  This decay mode provides a theoretically well-controlled avenue for extracting the CKM matrix element $|V_{us}|$ from the baryon sector.
  Our estimate of $|V_{us}|$ is obtained by combining our recent lattice-QCD results with recent measurements of the relevant branching fraction reported by BESIII and LHCb.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.16694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue the study of flux tubes in confining gauge theories placed in a rigid AdS background, focusing on the three-dimensional case. Our analysis is performed in the large-radius regime, where effective string theory provides a good approximation of the dynamics. Using a combination of techniques, primarily the analytic transcendentality ansatz bootstrap, we compute observables up to two-loop order in the expansion in powers of the string length over the AdS radius, which constitutes the main result of this work. Finally, we employ Pad\'e resummations to explore the possible compatibility of our results with a smooth interpolation of observables between large-radius AdS and small-radius AdS, in which gauge theory is weakly coupled.</description>

      <title>Prompt And Delayed Radio Bangs At Kilohertz By SN 1987A: A Test For Graviton-Photon Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9604047</link>
      <description>arXiv:astro-ph/9604047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   A sequence of prompt and delayed radio signals at tens of kilohertz should reach the Earth (or Jupiter) due to graviton--photon conversion in interstellar as well as local planetary magnetic fields. These radio fluxes may be a detectable probe of a huge gravitational burst expected from Supernovae explosions. The earliest prompt radio signal, coinciding with the neutrino burst, is due to conversion in the terrestrial (or Jovian) magnetic field and is below the micro-Jansky (or milli-Jansky) level for a galactic Supernova like SN1987A. A later radio signal, a ``tail'', due to the same graviton - radio wave conversion in random interstellar fields will maintain a relic radio ``noise'' for hundreds or thousands of years and might even be still detectable by a very sensitive network of satellite antennas at the kilohertz band. Exact solutions are presented here for the graviton-photon conversion in a refractive medium, as well as their consequences for high energy supernovae and the 2.726 K background radiation.</description>

      <title>Precessing Gamma Jets in extended and evaporating galactic halo as a source of GRB</title>

      <description>arXiv:astro-ph/9605166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS) by a relativistic electron beam jet at GeV energies (emitted by a compact object as a NS, BH,...), a NSJ, onto thermal BBR photons (from a nearby stellar companion) may originate a collinear gamma jet (GJ). Due to the binary system interaction the GJ precession would blaze suddenly toward the observer leading to a GRB event. The internal GJ cone structure is ruled by relativistic kinematics into a concentric onion-like sequence of photon rings, the softer in the external boundaries, the harder in the inner cone. The pointing and the crossing of such different GJ photon rings to the detector lead to a GRB hardness spectra evolution nearly corresponding to most observed ones. Moreover expected time integral spectra are also comparable with known GRB spectra. The total energy input of tens of thousands of such NSJ in an extended galactic halo, mainly cosmic rays electrons, should be reflected into the recent observational evidence (COMPTEL) of a diffused relic extended halo. Evidences of such precessing jets are offered by the discover of galactic superluminal sources, recent HH jets, SN1987A outer rings, Hourglass Nebula, planetary Egg Nebula, GROJ1744-28 binary X-rays pulsar.</description>

Abstract:   Most of the known literature on Inverse Compton Scattering (ICS) is based on earliest theoretical attempts and later approximations led by F.C.Jones and J.B.Blumenthal. We found an independent and more general analytical procedure which provide both relativistic and ultrarelativistic limits for ICS. These new analytical expressions can be derived in a straightforward way and they contain the previously reminded Jones' results. Our detailed solutions may be probed by already existing as well future ICS experiments.</description>

      <title>Common femtoscopic hadron-emission source in pp collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The femtoscopic study of pairs of identical pions is particularly suited to investigate the effective source function of particle emission, due to the resulting Bose-Einstein correlation signal. In small collision systems at the LHC, pp in particular, the majority of the pions are produced in resonance decays, which significantly affect the profile and size of the source. In this work, we explicitly model this effect in order to extract the primordial source in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV from charged $\pi - \pi$ correlations measured by ALICE. We demonstrate that the assumption of a Gaussian primordial source is compatible with the data and that the effective source, resulting from modifications due to resonances, is approximately exponential, as found in previous measurements at the LHC. The universality of hadron emission in pp collisions is further investigated by applying the same methodology to characterize the primordial source of K$-$p pairs. The size of the primordial source is evaluated as a function of the transverse mass ($m_{\rm T}$) of the pairs, leading to the observation of a common scaling for both $\pi - \pi$ and K$-$p, suggesting a collective effect. Further, the present results are compatible with the $m_{\rm T}$ scaling of the p$-$p and p$-\Lambda$ primordial source measured by ALICE in high multiplicity pp collisions, providing additional evidence for the presence of a common emission source for all hadrons in small collision systems at the LHC. This will allow the determination of the source function for any hadron-hadron pairs with high precision, granting access to the properties of the possible final-state interaction among pairs of less abundantly produced hadrons, such as strange or charmed particles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As we use the standard model effective field theory to search for signs of new physics beyond the direct reach of the LHC, we often wonder what we may learn from the effective field theory, and what it would look like to make a discovery via effective field theory. This article presents a case study that provides some answers to these questions. We apply the low-energy effective field theory to $e^+e^- \to \mu^+\mu^-$ data below the Z boson mass from the JADE experiment at DESY. The low-energy effective field theory allows the observation of physics beyond QED in the JADE data and furthermore, by matching the Wilson coefficients to the electroweak theory, a rough measurement of the masses of the W and Z bosons is possible. The ability to make this rough measurement challenges the conventional wisdom that an observation of new physics via EFT tells us nothing about the nature of that new physics. A measurement of this quality would have been sufficient to guide the construction of colliders such as the super proton-antiproton synchrotron or the large electron-positron collider, and so we anticipate that a discovery of new physics via effective field theory at the LHC would be similarly sufficient to guide the construction of future colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15245v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation into the anomalous magnetic dipole moment ($a_\tau$) and electric dipole moment ($d_\tau$) of the $\tau$ lepton using the $\gamma\gamma \to \tau^+\tau^-$ process at future lepton colliders, with the Super Tau-Charm Facility serving as a benchmark. By employing transverse-momentum-dependent factorization, we introduce novel observables derived from $\cos2\phi$, $\sin2\phi$, and $\cos4\phi$ azimuthal asymmetries to precisely probe the $\tau$ lepton's electromagnetic structure. Our analysis significantly enhances the precision of $a_\tau$ constraints within the photon-photon fusion process, yielding $\mathrm{Re}(a_\tau) \in [-4.6, 7.0] \times 10^{-3}$ at the $2\sigma$ confidence level, which approaches the precision of the Standard Model prediction. These findings highlight the considerable potential of azimuthal asymmetry measurements for high-precision determinations of fundamental particle properties at future lepton colliders.</description>

      <title>Constraining the new contributions to electron $g-2$ in a radiative neutrino mass model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.08504v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine electron and muon anomalous magnetic dipole moments within a radiative neutrino mass model featuring TeV-scale scalar leptoquarks $S(3,1,-1/3)$ and $R(3,2,1/6)$. We utilize textures with decoupling electron and muon sectors, so that both electron and muon anomalous magnetic dipole moments could receive internal chiral enhancements from different heavy up-type quarks while in the same time evading the stringent $\mu\to e\gamma$ constraint. A successful fit to neutrino oscillation data requires the simultaneous presence of one- and two-loop neutrino mass contributions. This severely constrains the parameter space of the model, which results in a negligible new physics correction to the muon $g-2$. The electron $g-2$ discrepancy implied by the rubidium experiment, on the other hand, can be resolved within $2\sigma$ uncertainty provided that neutrino mass ordering is inverted. Lepton-flavor-violating tau decay rates, such as $\tau\to e\gamma$ and $\tau\to 3e$, are predicted to be within the sensitivities of next-generation experiments.</description>

      <title>Baryon-number-violating nucleon decays in SMEFT extended with a light scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New light particles have received considerable attention in recent years. Baryon-number-violating (BNV) nucleon decays involving such light particles are able to provide stringent constraints. They exhibit distinctive experimental signatures that merit thorough investigation. We systematically investigate BNV nucleon decay with a light scalar in an effective field theory framework. Within this framework, we set stringent bounds on BNV operators using available experimental data and predict the occurrence of several BNV three-body nucleon decays. We further study contributions to dinucleon to dilepton transitions in a nucleus mediated by the scalar, which complements single nucleon decay. Finally, we provide three ultraviolet-complete models that can generate different subsets of BNV operators in leading order. Our theoretical framework will facilitate experimental searches for those exotic nucleon decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the status of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon as a precision probe of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) after the release of the final results from the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (FNAL) Muon $g-2$ experiment and the second White Paper of the Muon $g-2$ Theory Initiative. While the SM prediction requires further improvements by a factor of four to fully leverage the sensitivity achieved in experiment, the FNAL measurement will set the standard for many years to come, and we discuss a variety of features of the experimental campaign that made this achievement possible. In going forward, we discuss current efforts to improve the SM prediction, and imagine how an experiment would have to be devised to surpass 124 ppb in precision.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Heating of Compact Stars Beyond Capture: A Relativistic Framework for Energy Deposition by Particle Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact astrophysical objects, such as neutron stars and white dwarfs, can act as detectors of energetic particle fluxes originating from astrophysical accelerators. While most existing capture and heating calculations assume isotropic very low energetic incident fluxes from the halo dark matter, many realistic sources produce highly directional beams or jets, for which gravitational focusing, trajectory multiplicity, and local energy deposition must be treated consistently. In this work, we develop a general relativistic formalism to compute the local density, capture probability, and energy deposition of particles arriving as directed beams onto compact objects. The framework is based on the mapping of an asymptotic particle flux to local densities through geodesic congruences, allowing for gravitational focusing, multi-stream regions, and optical depth effects to be incorporated in a unified way. The formalism applies to arbitrary particle species and interaction models, and separates capture from through-going energy deposition in a frame-consistent manner. As an explicit application, we consider relativistic particle beams generated in astrophysical jets and evaluate their interaction with two compact objects samples: a white dwarf and a neutron star. In particular, we illustrate the framework using boosted dark matter produced in a list of 324 blazars as a representative case study, computing the resulting fluxes and the associated heating in the selected stars. Additional regimes such as the interaction roof and geometric limit are discussed, highlighting the conditions under which compact objects can efficiently convert incident beam energy into observable heating.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.14489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) in the vacuum as a function of quark flavor number $N_f$ within the chiral limit. By self-consistently solving the coupled DSEs for the quark and gluon propagators in a minimal QCD scheme, we elucidate the nonperturbative dynamics governing dynamical chiral symmetry breaking. Our calculations determine a critical flavor number of $N_f^c=6.81$ which marks the chiral symmetry restoration of quarks. Further analysis reveals the critical exponents of the chiral condensate as $ -\langle\bar{\psi} {\psi}\rangle\sim |N_f-N_f^c|^{0.53(9)}$, characterized the second order feature of this phase transition of chiral symmetry. Additionally, we discuss the implications for the walking regime towards the conformal window at larger flavor.</description>

      <title>Efficient Truncations of SU($N_c$) Lattice Gauge Theory for Quantum Simulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11888v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulations of lattice gauge theories offer the potential to directly study the non-perturbative dynamics of quantum chromodynamics, but naive analyses suggest that they require large computational resources. Large $N_c$ expansions are performed to order 1/$N_c$ to simplify the Hamiltonian of pure SU($N_c$) lattice gauge theories. A reformulation of the electric basis is introduced with a truncation strategy based on the construction of local Krylov subspaces with plaquette operators. Numerical simulations show that these truncated Hamiltonians are consistent with traditional lattice calculations at relatively small couplings. It is shown that the computational resources required for quantum simulation of time evolution generated by these Hamiltonians is 17-19 orders of magnitude smaller than previous approaches.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Axions Revealed via Amplified Modulation of Ellipticity of Laser (CARAMEL)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new axion dark matter detection strategy that employs optical readout of laser-beam ellipticity modulations caused by axion-induced electric fields in a microwave cavity, using electro-optic (EO) crystals, enhanced by externally injected radio-frequency (rf) power. Building upon the variance-based probing method~\cite{Omarov_2023}, we extend this concept to the optical domain: a weak probe laser interacts with an EO crystal coupled to the resonant microwave cavity field at cryogenic temperatures, and the axion-induced electric field is revealed through induced ellipticity. The injected rf signal coherently interferes with that of the axion field, amplifying the optical response and significantly improving sensitivity. While our EO-based method employs a Fabry-P\'erot resonator, we do not require Michelson interferometers. Our method hence enables compact, high-frequency axion searches across the $0.5$--$50\,\mathrm{GHz}$ range. Operating at cryogenic temperatures not only suppresses thermal backgrounds but, critically, allows the probing method to mitigate quantum noise. This approach offers a scalable path forward for axion detection over the $\sim(\text{few}--200)\,\mu\mathrm{eV}$ mass range -- covering the preferred parameter space for post-inflationary Peccei--Quinn axion dark matter -- using compact, tunable systems. \noindent Published in \textit{Phys.

      <title>Interacting Scalar Fields as Dark Energy and Dark Matter in Einstein scalar Gauss Bonnet Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Gauss-Bonnet (GB) coupled scalar field $\phi$, responsible for the late-time cosmic acceleration and interacting with a coherent scalar field $\psi$ through an interaction potential $W(\phi,\psi)$, is considered from the point of view of particle physics for two different models. The non-minimal coupling between the GB curvature term and the field $\phi$ leads to a time-dependent speed of gravitational waves (GWs), which is fixed to unity in order to be consistent with current GW observations, rendering the GB coupling function model-independent. We investigate the dynamical stability of the system by formulating it as an autonomous system, and provide a detailed discussion on the choice of initial conditions required to obtain stable background evolution of the models. We constrain the model parameters using various sets of observational data, including both early- and late-time probes. We incorporate the improved Dark Energy Survey (DES) 5-year Type Ia supernova sample (DES-SN5YR), referred to as DES-Dovekie, which exhibits substantially lower tension with the Pantheon+ supernova sample. We find that both models are physically viable and closely follow the $\Lambda$CDM trend for the Pantheon+ and DES samples. However, upon including the Roman mock data, a significant departure is observed at higher redshifts, yielding statistically strong preference over the flat $\Lambda$CDM model.</description>

      <title>Inflationary Fossils Beyond Perturbation Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we provide the missing link between two approaches aimed at characterizing the effect of long perturbation modes in Inflation. We consider the Inflationary Fossils' approach (arXiv:1203.0302 and related works) that characterizes the power-spectrum of the inflaton field in presence of other long and non dynamical fossil fields, and a technique, appeared in arXiv:2103.09244, that computes, beyond perturbation theory, the power-spectrum of a scalar field in presence of a large fluctuation of a second field. We clarify a few points on the applicability of the non-perturbative technique. We prove in six distinct cases, one involving a violation of the consistency conditions, that the non-perturbative approach, once expanded to first order in the coupling, matches the perturbative result following the Fossils' approach. We believe that this non-perturbative technique extends to all orders the Fossils' approach, resumming infinitely many diagrams of standard in-in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Probing For Non-Gravitational Long-Range Dark Matter Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10701v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark matter remains a mystery in fundamental physics. The only evidence for dark matter's existence is from gravitational interactions. We constructed a precision torsion balance experiment to search for non-gravitational, long-range interactions between ordinary matter in our lab and the Milky Way's dark matter. We find no evidence of such interaction and set strict upper bounds on its strength. These results suggest that dark matter only interacts gravitationally over long distances and constrains a variety of dark matter theories.</description>

      <title>Shadow of rotating black holes with consistent thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum effects in general induce scale dependence in the coupling constants. We explore this possibility in gravity, with a scale-dependent Newton coupling. When applied to Kerr black holes with such a running coupling, the consistency of black hole thermodynamics requires that the Newton coupling have a specific dependence on the black hole parameters. In this work, we consider such a class of Newton couplings and look for the possible observational implications on the highly lensed images of the black holes. In addition to placing constraints on the parameter space of the model through the latest Sgr A* images, we find that the variations in the shape of shadows in a large portion of the parameter space can be qualitatively captured by a quantity solely defined by the event horizon. Most importantly, the consistency of thermodynamics suggests a lower bound on the shadow size, beyond which either horizon disappears, or the shadow cannot keep the standard D-shaped structure. The possibility that the black holes in this model could spin faster than the Kerr bound, and the physical implications of the resulting cuspy shadows, are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Coherent-state boundary conditions as the first-principles origin of background fields in QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: QED formulated in prescribed classical background electromagnetic fields is a standard framework for strong-field and laser\textendash matter interactions. It is usually treated as a theory modified by externally imposed fields, obscuring its precise relation to full QED and, in particular, the role of asymptotic boundary conditions for the gauge field. Starting from an operator-based formulation, we show that QED with background fields is not a distinct theory but arises as a well-defined boundary-condition limit of full QED, in which the classical background field emerges from coherent-state boundary conditions on the quantized electromagnetic field. In this limit, the conventional generating functional used in calculations with prescribed background fields is recovered naturally, while relaxing the boundary conditions allows depletion and backreaction effects to be incorporated within the same framework. The central new result is a rigorous operator-level proof of the equivalence between the fixed background-field approximation and coherent-state asymptotic boundary conditions\textemdash a formulation that, to our knowledge, has not been made explicit in previous approaches. We further demonstrate that the apparent time dependence of background fields does not originate from an explicitly time-dependent Hamiltonian, but instead reflects the choice of picture\textemdash Schr\"{o}dinger versus Heisenberg\textemdash in the underlying quantum theory. Rather than introducing new properties of coherent states, our analysis provides a first-principles reinterpretation of the fixed background-field approximation as a controlled and picture-dependent limit of full QED.</description>

      <title>The collectivity of transverse momentum fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the observable $v_0(p_T)$, which quantifies the relative change of $p_T$ spectra induced by event-by-event density fluctuations in the medium created in heavy-ion collisions. This quantity provides a direct measure of radial flow and serves as a probe of collectivity, complementing anisotropic flow coefficients. Using hydrodynamic model calculations, we predict the behavior of $v_0(p_T)$ and show that the scaled quantity $v_0(p_T)/v_0$ exhibits very little dependence on centrality and transport coefficients. We further find that the apparent influence of transport coefficients$-$particularly bulk viscosity$-$ on $v_0(p_T)$ largely originates from modifications of the event-averaged mean transverse momentum, $\langle p_T \rangle$. By expressing $v_0(p_T)/v_0$ as a function of $p_T/\langle p_T \rangle$, the genuine sensitivity of $v_0(p_T)$ to transport coefficients can be isolated. Moreover, since $v_0(p_T)$ is the $p_T$-differential measure of event-by-event $[p_T]$ fluctuations, it naturally explains the observed $p_T$-cut dependence of $\sigma_{p_T}$ measured by ATLAS collaboration.</description>

      <title>A Universal CMB $B$-Mode Spectrum from Early Causal Tensor Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many early universe scenarios predict post-inflationary tensor perturbations from causality-limited, sub-horizon sources. While the microphysical details may differ, as long as these sources are bounded in duration and correlation length, their tensor power spectra exhibit a universal scaling behavior at small wavenumber: $P_h(k) \propto k^3$, corresponding to white noise on super-horizon scales at the time of production. If these early causal tensor sources (ECTs) exclusively produce gravitational waves before redshift $z \sim 10^5$, this scaling is realized on all of the scales observed in the cosmic microwave background (CMB), and thus yields a universal multipole distribution for the $B$-mode angular power spectrum. Unlike the scale-invariant distributions of inflationary $B$ modes, ECTs generically predict enhanced power on small scales and suppressed power on large scales, which allows these source classes to be distinguished given measurements over a sufficient range of angular scales. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for characterizing ECTs and demonstrate how their universal infrared scaling manifests in low-frequency observables, including CMB $B$ modes and stochastic gravitational wave spectral densities. We illustrate this mapping with representative case studies of this universality class involving first-order phase transitions, topological defects, and enhanced scalar perturbations, which source tensor modes at second order in perturbation theory.</description>

Abstract: We study the localization properties of the low-lying Dirac eigenmodes in QCD near the crossover temperature, using staggered fermions on the lattice. We find that localized low modes, absent at low temperature, appear at a temperature $T_{\mathrm{loc}}$ in the range $155\,\mathrm{MeV}\le T_{\mathrm{loc}}\le 158\,\mathrm{MeV}$, in excellent agreement with the pseudocritical crossover temperature as determined from the chiral condensate and from the light-quark susceptibility.</description>

Abstract: In this work, the production mechanisms of the hyperon resonances $\Lambda(1405)$ and $\Lambda(1520)$ in the $\pi^- p$ scattering are investigated within an effective Lagrangian approach incorporating Regge trajectories. By including contributions from $t$-channel $K^*$ and $u$-channel $\Sigma$ exchanges, we perform global fits to the total and differential cross sections for $\pi^{-} p \rightarrow K\Lambda(1405)$ and $\pi^{-} p \rightarrow K\Lambda(1520)$. The results show good agreement with available experimental data. For the total cross section of $\Lambda(1405)$ production, the $u$-channel contribution is dominant, whereas the $t$-channel contribution plays the primary role in $\Lambda(1520)$ production. Furthermore, the differential cross sections of the two processes exhibit distinctly different shapes, reflecting their distinct underlying reaction mechanisms. An analysis based on the constituent counting rule indicates that $\Lambda(1520)$ is consistent with a conventional three-quark configuration, while $\Lambda(1405)$ shows a clear deviation, suggesting a more exotic structure. Owing to the large branching ratio of $\Lambda^* \to \pi \Sigma$, the Dalitz process $\pi^{-} p \rightarrow K \Lambda^{*} \rightarrow K \pi \Sigma$ is also calculated. Our results demonstrate that reconstructing $\Lambda^*$ via the $K\pi\Sigma$ final state is experimentally feasible. This study provides important theoretical insights into the production dynamics of these hyperon resonances, and suggests future high-precision measurements of the $t$-distribution at large momentum transfer at facilities such as AMBER, J-PARC, HIKE, and HIAF, which can further clarify their reaction mechanisms and structural properties.</description>
