      <title>$k$-Inductive and Interpolation-Inspired Barrier Certificates for Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce two notions of barrier certificates that use multiple functions to provide a lower bound on the probabilistic satisfaction of safety for stochastic dynamical systems. A barrier certificate for a stochastic dynamical system acts as a nonnegative supermartingale, and provides a lower bound on the probability that the system is safe. The promise of such certificates is that their search can be effectively automated. Typically, one may use optimization or SMT solvers to find such barrier certificates of a given fixed template. When such approaches fail, a typical approach is to instead change the template. We propose an alternative approach that we dub interpolation-inspired barrier certificates. An interpolation-inspired barrier certificate consists of a set of functions that jointly provide a lower bound on the probability of satisfying safety. We show how one may find such certificates of a fixed template, even when we fail to find standard barrier certificates of the same template. However, we note that such certificates still need to ensure a supermartingale guarantee for one function in the set. To address this challenge, we consider the use of $k$-induction with these interpolation-inspired certificates. The recent use of $k$-induction in barrier certificates allows one to relax the supermartingale requirement at every time step to a combination of a supermartingale requirement every $k$ steps and a $c$-martingale requirement for the intermediate steps. We provide a generic formulation of a barrier certificate that we dub $k$-inductive interpolation-inspired barrier certificate. The formulation allows for several combinations of interpolation and $k$-induction for barrier certificate. We present two examples among the possible combinations. We finally present sum-of-squares programming to synthesize this set of functions and demonstrate their utility in case studies.</description>

      <title>A Sensor-Driven Optimization Framework for Asset Management in Energy Systems: Implications for Full and Partial Digital Transformation in Hydro Fleets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel prognostics-driven approach to optimize operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) decisions in hydropower systems. Our approach harnesses the insights from sensor data to accurately predict the remaining lifetime distribution of critical generation assets in hydropower systems, i.e., thrust bearings, and use these predictions to optimally schedule O&amp;M actions for a fleet of hydro generators. We consider complex interdependencies across hydro generator failure risks, reservoir, production, and demand management decisions. We propose a stochastic joint O&amp;M scheduling model to tackle the unique challenges of hydropower O&amp;M including the interdependency of generation capacities, the nonlinear nature of power production, operational requirements, and uncertainties. We develop a two-level decomposition-based solution algorithm to effectively handle large-scale cases. The algorithm incorporates a combination of Benders optimality cuts and integer cuts to solve the problem in an efficient manner. We design an experimental framework to evaluate the proposed prognostics-driven O&amp;M scheduling framework, using real-world condition monitoring data from hydropower systems, historical market prices, and water inflow data. The developed framework can be partially implemented for a phased-in approach. Our experiments demonstrate the significant benefits of the sensor-driven O&amp;M framework in improving reliability, availability, effective usage of resources, and system profitability, especially when gradually shifting from traditional time-based maintenance policies to condition-based prognostics-driven maintenance policies.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Games of Control and Cryptocurrency Mining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies Mean Field Games (MFGs) in which agent dynamics are given by jump processes of controlled intensity, with mean-field interaction via the controls and affecting the jump intensities. We establish the existence of MFG equilibria in a general discrete-time setting, and prove a limit theorem as the time discretization goes to zero, establishing equilibria in the continuous-time setting for a class of MFGs of intensity control. This motivates numerical schemes that involve directly solving discrete-time games as opposed to coupled Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Kolmogorov equations. As an example of the general theory, we consider cryptocurrency mining competition, modeled as an MFG both in continuous and discrete time, and illustrate the effectiveness of the discrete-time algorithm to solve it.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Programming for Dynamic Temperature Control of Refrigerated Road Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature control in refrigerated delivery vehicles is critical for preserving product quality, yet existing approaches neglect critical operational uncertainties, such as stochastic door opening durations and heterogeneous initial product temperatures. We propose a framework to optimize cooling policies for refrigerated trucks on fixed routes by explicitly modeling these uncertainties while capturing all relevant thermodynamic interactions in the trailer. To this end, we integrate high-fidelity thermodynamic modeling with a multistage stochastic programming formulation and solve the resulting problem using stochastic dual dynamic programming. In cooperation with industry partners and based on real-world data, we set up computational experiments that demonstrate that our stochastic policy consistently outperforms the best deterministic benchmark by 35% on average while being computationally tractable. In a separate analysis, we show that by fixing the duration of temperature violations, our policy operates with up to $40$\% less fuel than deterministic policies. Our results demonstrate that pallet-level thermal status information is the single most crucial information in the problem and can be used to significantly reduce temperature violations. Knowledge of the timing and length of customer stops is the second most important factor and, together with detailed modeling of thermodynamic interactions, can be used to further significantly reduce violations. Our analysis of the optimal stochastic cooling policy reveals that preemptive cooling before a stop is the key element of an optimal policy. These findings highlight the value of sophisticated control strategies in maintaining the quality of perishable products while reducing the carbon footprint of the industry and improving operational efficiency.</description>

      <title>On the complexity of proximal gradient and proximal Newton-CG methods for \(\ell_1\)-regularized Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose two second-order methods for solving the \(\ell_1\)-regularized composite optimization problem, which are developed based on two distinct definitions of approximate second-order stationary points. We introduce a hybrid proximal gradient and negative curvature method, as well as a proximal Newton-CG method, to find a strong* approximate second-order stationary point and a weak approximate second-order stationary point for \(\ell_1\)-regularized optimization problems, respectively. Comprehensive analyses are provided regarding the iteration complexity, computational complexity, and the local superlinear convergence rates of the first phases of these two methods under specific error bound conditions. Specifically, we demonstrate that the proximal Newton-CG method achieves the best-known iteration complexity for attaining the proposed weak approximate second-order stationary point, which is consistent with the results for finding an approximate second-order stationary point in unconstrained optimization. Through a toy example, we show that our proposed methods can effectively escape the first-order approximate solution. Numerical experiments implemented on the \(\ell_1\)-regularized Student's t-regression problem validate the effectiveness of both methods.</description>

      <title>Markov Kernels, Distances and Optimal Control: A Parable of Linear Quadratic Non-Gaussian Distribution Steering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a controllable linear time-varying (LTV) pair $(\boldsymbol{A}_t,\boldsymbol{B}_t)$ and $\boldsymbol{Q}_{t}$ positive semidefinite, we derive the Markov kernel for the It\^{o} diffusion ${\mathrm{d}}\boldsymbol{x}_{t}=\boldsymbol{A}_{t}\boldsymbol{x}_t {\mathrm{d}} t + \sqrt{2}\boldsymbol{B}_{t}{\mathrm{d}}\boldsymbol{w}_{t}$ with an accompanying killing of probability mass at rate $\frac{1}{2}\boldsymbol{x}^{\top}\boldsymbol{Q}_{t}\boldsymbol{x}$. This Markov kernel is the Green's function for an associated linear reaction-advection-diffusion partial differential equation. Our result generalizes the recently derived kernel for the special case $\left(\boldsymbol{A}_t,\boldsymbol{B}_t\right)=\left(\boldsymbol{0},\boldsymbol{I}\right)$, and depends on the solution of an associated Riccati matrix ODE. A consequence of this result is that the linear quadratic non-Gaussian Schr\"{o}dinger bridge is exactly solvable. This means that the problem of steering a controlled LTV diffusion from a given non-Gaussian distribution to another over a fixed deadline while minimizing an expected quadratic cost can be solved using dynamic Sinkhorn recursions performed with the derived kernel. Our derivation for the $\left(\boldsymbol{A}_t,\boldsymbol{B}_t,\boldsymbol{Q}_t\right)$-parametrized kernel pursues a new idea that relies on finding a state-time dependent distance-like functional given by the solution of a deterministic optimal control problem. This technique breaks away from existing methods, such as generalizing Hermite polynomials or Weyl calculus, which have seen limited success in the reaction-diffusion context. Our technique uncovers a new connection between Markov kernels, distances, and optimal control. This connection is of interest beyond its immediate application in solving the linear quadratic Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity analysis for parametric nonlinear programming: A tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This tutorial provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art in the sensitivity analysis for nonlinear programming. Building upon the fundamental work of Fiacco, it derives the sensitivity of primal-dual solutions for regular nonlinear programs and explores the extent to which Fiacco's framework can be extended to degenerate nonlinear programs with non-unique dual solutions. The survey ends with a discussion on how to adapt the sensitivity analysis for conic programs and approximate solutions obtained from interior-point algorithms.</description>

      <title>Recovering Nesterov accelerated dynamics from Heavy Ball dynamics via time rescaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a real Hilbert space, we consider two classical problems: the global minimization of a smooth and convex function $f$ (i.e., a convex optimization problem) and finding the zeros of a monotone and continuous operator $V$ (i.e., a monotone equation). Attached to the optimization problem, first we study the asymptotic properties of the trajectories generated by a second-order dynamical system which features a constant viscous friction coefficient and a positive, monotonically increasing function $b(\cdot)$ multiplying $\nabla f$. For a generated solution trajectory $y(t)$, we show small $o$ convergence rates dependent on $b(t)$ for $f(y(t)) - \min f$, and the weak convergence of $y(t)$ towards a global minimizer of $f$. In 2015, Su, Boyd and Cand\'es introduced a second-order system which could be seen as the continuous-time counterpart of Nesterov's accelerated gradient. As the first key point of this paper, we show that for a special choice for $b(t)$, these two seemingly unrelated dynamical systems are connected: namely, they are time reparametrizations of each other. Every statement regarding the continuous-time accelerated gradient system may be recovered from its Heavy Ball counterpart.
  As the second key point of this paper, we observe that this connection extends beyond the optimization setting. Attached to the monotone equation involving the operator $V$, we again consider a Heavy Ball-like system which features an additional correction term which is the time derivative of the operator along the trajectory. We establish a time reparametrization equivalence with the Fast OGDA dynamics introduced by Bot, Csetnek and Nguyen in 2022, which can be seen as an analog of the continuous accelerated gradient dynamics, but for monotone operators. Again, every statement regarding the Fast OGDA system may be recovered from a Heavy Ball-like system.</description>

      <title>Continuity Conditions for Piecewise Quadratic Functions on Simplicial Conic Partitions are Equivalent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of continuous-time piecewise linear (PWL) systems based on piecewise quadratic (PWQ) Lyapunov functions typically requires continuity of these functions over a partition of the state space. Several conditions for guaranteeing continuity of PWQ functions over state space partitions can be found in the literature. In this technical note, we show that these continuity conditions are equivalent over so-called simplicial conic partitions. A key element in our proof is a technical lemma, which, in addition to being of independent interest, plays a crucial role in demonstrating the equivalence of these conditions. As a consequence, the choice of which condition to impose can be based solely on practical considerations such as specific application or numerical aspects, without introducing additional conservatism in the analysis.</description>

      <title>Universal differential equations for optimal control problems and its application on cancer therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper highlights a parallel between the forward backward sweeping method for optimal control and deep learning training procedures. We reformulate a classical optimal control problem, constrained by a differential equation system, into an optimization framework that uses neural networks to represent control variables. We demonstrate that this deep learning method adheres to Pontryagin Maximum Principle and mitigates numerical instabilities by employing backward propagation instead of a backward sweep for the adjoint equations. As a case study, we solve an optimal control problem to find the optimal combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy. Our approach holds significant potential across various fields, including epidemiology, ecological modeling, engineering, and financial mathematics, where optimal control under complex dynamic constraints is crucial.</description>

      <title>Solving Multi-Agent Safe Optimal Control with Distributed Epigraph Form MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tasks for multi-robot systems often require the robots to collaborate and complete a team goal while maintaining safety. This problem is usually formalized as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), which targets minimizing a global cost and bringing the mean of constraint violation below a user-defined threshold. Inspired by real-world robotic applications, we define safety as zero constraint violation. While many safe multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms have been proposed to solve CMDPs, these algorithms suffer from unstable training in this setting. To tackle this, we use the epigraph form for constrained optimization to improve training stability and prove that the centralized epigraph form problem can be solved in a distributed fashion by each agent. This results in a novel centralized training distributed execution MARL algorithm named Def-MARL. Simulation experiments on 8 different tasks across 2 different simulators show that Def-MARL achieves the best overall performance, satisfies safety constraints, and maintains stable training. Real-world hardware experiments on Crazyflie quadcopters demonstrate the ability of Def-MARL to safely coordinate agents to complete complex collaborative tasks compared to other methods.</description>

      <title>A function space approach to the shape optimization of the Boussinesq system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a shape optimization problem for a heat-conducting fluid governed by a Boussinesq system. The main goal is to determine an optimal domain shape that yields a temperature distribution as uniform as possible. Initially, we analyze the state problem, prove its well-posedness and establish a local boundary regularity result for the weak solution. We then demonstrate the existence of an optimal shape and derive a first-order optimality condition. This requires the derivation and analysis of the adjoint system associated with the Boussinesq model, as well as a rigorous treatment of the directional derivatives of the objective functional under appropriate domain perturbations. Finally, we present numerical experiments that illustrate and support the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Minimization of Curve Length through Energy Minimization using Finite Difference and Numerical Integration in Real Coordinate Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of determining the minimal length is garnering attention in various fields such as computer vision, robotics, and machine learning. One solution to this problem involves linearly interpolating the solution of a nonlinear optimization problem that approximates the curve's energy minimization problem using finite differences and numerical integration. This method tends to be easier to implement compared to others. However, it was previously unknown whether this approach successfully minimizes the curve's length under the Riemannian metric in real coordinate spaces. In this paper, we prove that the length of a curve obtained by linear interpolation of the solution to an optimization problem, where the energy of the curve is approximated using finite differences and the trapezoidal rule, converges to the minimal curve length at a rate of $1/2$ in terms of the number of points used in the numerical integration. Similarly, we prove that when using the left-point rule, the approximated curve's length likewise converges to the minimal curve length at a rate of $1/2$ in terms of the number of points used in the numerical integration.</description>

Abstract: For quantitative trading risk management purposes, we present a novel idea: the realized local volatility surface. Concisely, it stands for the conditional expected volatility when sudden market behaviors of the underlying occur. One is able to explore risk management usages by following the orthotical Delta-Gamma dynamic hedging framework. The realized local volatility surface is, mathematically, a generalized Wiener measure from historical prices. It is reconstructed via employing high-frequency trading market data. A Stick-Breaking Gaussian Mixture Model is fitted via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, producing a local volatility surface with 95% credible intervals. A practically validated Bayesian nonparametric estimation workflow. Empirical results on TSLA high-frequency data illustrate its ability to capture counterfactual volatility. We also discuss its application in improving volatility-based risk management.</description>

      <title>Observability conditions for neural state-space models with eigenvalues and their roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We operate through the lens of ordinary differential equations and control theory to study the concept of observability in the context of neural state-space models and the Mamba architecture. We develop strategies to enforce observability, which are tailored to a learning context, specifically where the hidden states are learnable at initial time, in conjunction to over its continuum, and high-dimensional. We also highlight our methods emphasize eigenvalues, roots of unity, or both. Our methods effectuate computational efficiency when enforcing observability, sometimes at great scale. We formulate observability conditions in machine learning based on classical control theory and discuss their computational complexity. Our nontrivial results are fivefold. We discuss observability through the use of permutations in neural applications with learnable matrices without high precision. We present two results built upon the Fourier transform that effect observability with high probability up to the randomness in the learning. These results are worked with the interplay of representations in Fourier space and their eigenstructure, nonlinear mappings, and the observability matrix. We present a result for Mamba that is similar to a Hautus-type condition, but instead employs an argument using a Vandermonde matrix instead of eigenvectors. Our final result is a shared-parameter construction of the Mamba system, which is computationally efficient in high exponentiation. We develop a training algorithm with this coupling, showing it satisfies a Robbins-Monro condition under certain orthogonality, while a more classical training procedure fails to satisfy a contraction with high Lipschitz constant.</description>

      <title>Predictive Synthesis of Control Barrier Functions and its Application to Time-Varying Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic method for synthesizing a Control Barrier Function (CBF) that encodes predictive information into a CBF. Unlike other methods, the synthesized CBF can account for changes and time-variations in the constraints even when constructed for time-invariant constraints. This avoids recomputing the CBF when the constraint specifications change. The method provides an explicit characterization of the extended class K function {\alpha} that determines the dynamic properties of the CBF, and {\alpha} can even be explicitly chosen as a design parameter in the controller synthesis. The resulting CBF further accounts for input constraints, and its values can be determined at any point without having to compute the CBF over the entire domain. The synthesis method is based on a finite horizon optimal control problem inspired by Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analysis and does not rely on a nominal control law. The synthesized CBF is time-invariant if the constraints are. The method poses mild assumptions on the controllability of the dynamic system and assumes the knowledge of at least a subset of some control invariant set. The paper provides a detailed analysis of the properties of the synthesized CBF, including its application to time-varying constraints. A simulation study applies the proposed approach to various dynamic systems in the presence of time-varying constraints. The paper is accompanied by an online available parallelized implementation of the proposed synthesis method.</description>

      <title>Gaussian behaviors: representations and data-driven control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a modeling framework for stochastic systems based on Gaussian processes. Finite-length trajectories of the system are modeled as random vectors from a Gaussian distribution, which we call a Gaussian behavior. The proposed model naturally quantifies the uncertainty in the trajectories, yet it is simple enough to allow for tractable formulations. We relate the proposed model to existing descriptions of dynamical systems including deterministic and stochastic behaviors, and linear time-invariant (LTI) state-space models with Gaussian process and measurement noise. Gaussian behaviors can be estimated directly from observed data as the empirical sample covariance under the assumption that the measured trajectories are from independent experiments. The distribution of future outputs conditioned on inputs and past outputs provides a predictive model that can be incorporated in predictive control frameworks. We show that subspace predictive control (SPC) is a certainty-equivalence control formulation with the estimated Gaussian behavior. Furthermore, the regularized data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) method is shown to be a distributionally optimistic formulation that optimistically accounts for uncertainty in the Gaussian behavior. To mitigate the excessive optimism of DeePC, we propose a novel distributionally robust control formulation, and provide a convex reformulation allowing for efficient implementation.</description>

      <title>Branch-and-Bound Algorithms as Polynomial-time Approximation Schemes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Branch-and-bound algorithms (B&amp;B) and polynomial-time approximation schemes (PTAS) are two seemingly distant areas of combinatorial optimization. We intend to (partially) bridge the gap between them while expanding the boundary of theoretical knowledge on the B&amp;B framework. Branch-and-bound algorithms typically guarantee that an optimal solution is eventually found. However, we show that the standard implementation of branch-and-bound for certain knapsack and scheduling problems also exhibits PTAS-like behavior, yielding increasingly better solutions within polynomial time. Our findings are supported by computational experiments and comparisons with benchmark methods. This paper is an extended version of a paper accepted at ICALP 2025.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing flows on generalized graphs that feature multiple entry points and multiple populations, each with varying cost structures. We tackle this problem by considering the multi-population Wardrop equilibrium, defined through variational inequalities. We rigorously analyze the existence and uniqueness of the Wardrop equilibrium. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient numerical method to find the solution. In particular, we reformulate the equilibrium problem as a distributed optimization problem over subgraphs and introduce a novel Hessian Riemannian flow method, a Riemannian-manifold-projected Hessian flow, to efficiently compute a solution. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through examples in urban traffic management, including routing for diverse vehicle types and strategies for minimizing emissions in congested environments.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present the analytical and numerical study of the optimization approach for determining the space-dependent source function in the parabolic inverse source problem using partial boundary measurements. The Lagrangian approach for the solution of the optimization problem is presented, and optimality conditions are derived. The proof of the Fr\'echet differentiability of the regularized Tikhonov functional and the existence result for the solution of the inverse source problem are established. A local stability estimate for the unknown source term is also presented. The numerical examples justify the theoretical investigations using the conjugate gradient method (CGM) in 2D and 3D tests with noisy data.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Adaptive Gradient Algorithms for Nonconvex-PL Minimax Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.03984v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimax optimization recently is widely applied in many machine learning tasks such as generative adversarial networks, robust learning and reinforcement learning. In the paper, we study a class of nonconvex-nonconcave minimax optimization with nonsmooth regularization, where the objective function is possibly nonconvex on primal variable $x$, and it is nonconcave and satisfies the Polyak-Lojasiewicz (PL) condition on dual variable $y$. Moreover, we propose a class of enhanced momentum-based gradient descent ascent methods (i.e., MSGDA and AdaMSGDA) to solve these stochastic nonconvex-PL minimax problems. In particular, our AdaMSGDA algorithm can use various adaptive learning rates in updating the variables $x$ and $y$ without relying on any specifical types. Theoretically, we prove that our methods have the best known sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ only requiring one sample at each loop in finding an $\epsilon$-stationary solution. Some numerical experiments on PL-game and Wasserstein-GAN demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>First- and Second-Order Stochastic Adaptive Regularization with Cubics: High Probability Iteration and Sample Complexity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.13161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present high-probability (and expectation) complexity bounds for two versions of stochastic adaptive regularization methods with cubics (SARC), also known as regularized Newton methods. The first algorithm aims to find first-order stationary points, while the second targets second-order optimality conditions. Both methods employ stochastic zeroth-, first-, and second-order oracles with specific accuracy and reliability requirements. These oracles, which have been previously used with other stochastic adaptive methods like trust-region and line-search algorithms, are applicable to various optimization settings including expected risk minimization and simulation optimization. In this paper, we establish the first high-probability iteration and sample complexity bounds for both first- and second-order SARC algorithms. Our analysis demonstrates that as in the deterministic case, they outperform other stochastic adaptive methods.</description>

      <title>Low solution rank of the matrix LASSO under RIP with consequences for rank-constrained algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12828v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that solutions to the popular convex matrix LASSO problem (nuclear-norm--penalized linear least-squares) have low rank under similar assumptions as required by classical low-rank matrix sensing error bounds. Although the purpose of the nuclear norm penalty is to promote low solution rank, a proof has not yet (to our knowledge) been provided outside very specific circumstances. Furthermore, we show that this result has significant theoretical consequences for nonconvex rank-constrained optimization approaches. Specifically, we show that if (a) the ground truth matrix has low rank, (b) the (linear) measurement operator has the matrix restricted isometry property (RIP), and (c) the measurement error is small enough relative to the nuclear norm penalty, then the (unique) LASSO solution has rank (approximately) bounded by that of the ground truth. From this, we show (a) that a low-rank--projected proximal gradient descent algorithm will converge linearly to the LASSO solution from any initialization, and (b) that the nonconvex landscape of the low-rank Burer-Monteiro--factored problem formulation is benign in the sense that all second-order critical points are globally optimal and yield the LASSO solution.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a particle-based optimization method designed for addressing minimization problems with equality constraints, particularly in cases where the loss function exhibits non-differentiability or non-convexity. The proposed method combines components from consensus-based optimization algorithm with a newly introduced forcing term directed at the constraint set. A rigorous mean-field limit of the particle system is derived, and the convergence of the mean-field limit to the constrained minimizer is established. Additionally, we introduce a stable discretized algorithm and conduct various numerical experiments to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.</description>

Abstract: Bilevel optimization, a well-established field for modeling hierarchical decision-making problems, has recently intersected with sustainability studies and practices, resulting in a series of works focusing on bilevel optimization problems involving multiple decision makers with diverse economic, environmental, and social objectives. This survey offers a comprehensive overview of sustainable bilevel optimization applications. First, we introduce the main concepts related to the nature of bilevel optimization problems and present some typical mathematical formulations for bilevel pricing problems that cover many of the collected applications. Then, we review the most relevant works published in sustainable bilevel optimization, giving a classification based on the application domains and their association with well-known operations research problems, while briefly discussing the proposed solution methodologies. We survey applications on transportation and logistics, production planning and manufacturing, water, waste, and agriculture management, supply chains, and disaster prevention and response. Finally, we outline a list of open questions and opportunities for future research in this domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a partitioned optimization framework (POf) to ease the solving process for optimization problems for which fixing some variables to a tunable value removes some difficulties. The variables space may be continuously partitioned into subsets where these variables are fixed to a given value, so that minimizing the objective function restricted to any of the partition sets is easier than minimizing the objective function over the whole variables space. Then our methodology consists in searching for the partition set minimizing the minimum of the objective function restricted to this set. Indeed, a local solution to the original problem is given by computing this partition set and selecting the minimizer of the objective function restricted to this set. We first formalize this framework and study its theoretical guarantees, and we discuss about a derivative-free optimization (DFO) algorithm able to seek for an optimal partition set. Then we focus on a class of composite optimization problems that may be solved using the POf, and we illustrate in details our methodology on four problems from this class. Finally, we highlight the gain in numerical performance provided by the POf on large-dimensional composite problems by comparing it to two popular DFO solvers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear programs with quadratic regularization are attracting renewed interest due to their applications in optimal transport: unlike entropic regularization, the squared-norm penalty gives rise to sparse approximations of optimal transport couplings. It is well known that the solution of a quadratically regularized linear program over any polytope converges stationarily to the minimal-norm solution of the linear program when the regularization parameter tends to zero. However, that result is merely qualitative. Our main result quantifies the convergence by specifying the exact threshold for the regularization parameter, after which the regularized solution also solves the linear program. Moreover, we bound the suboptimality of the regularized solution before the threshold. These results are complemented by a convergence rate for the regime of large regularization. We apply our general results to the setting of optimal transport, where we shed light on how the threshold and suboptimality depend on the number of data points.</description>

      <title>A proximal splitting algorithm for generalized DC programming with applications in signal recovery</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01535v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The difference-of-convex (DC) program is an important model in nonconvex optimization due to its structure, which encompasses a wide range of practical applications. In this paper, we aim to tackle a generalized class of DC programs, where the objective function is formed by summing a possibly nonsmooth nonconvex function and a differentiable nonconvex function with Lipschitz continuous gradient, and then subtracting a nonsmooth continuous convex function. We develop a proximal splitting algorithm that utilizes proximal evaluation for the concave part and Douglas--Rachford splitting for the remaining components. The algorithm guarantees subsequential convergence to a {\color{black}critical} point of the problem model. Under the widely used Kurdyka--{\L}ojasiewicz property, we establish global convergence of the full sequence of iterates and derive convergence rates for both the iterates and the objective function values, without assuming the concave part is differentiable. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on signal recovery problems with a nonconvex regularization term and exhibits competitive results compared to notable algorithms in the literature on both synthetic data and real-world data.</description>

      <title>Optimality of Linear Policies for Distributionally Robust Linear Quadratic Gaussian Regulator with Stationary Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22826v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that output-feedback linear policies remain optimal for solving the Linear Quadratic Gaussian regulation problem in the face of worst-case process and measurement noise distributions when these are independent, stationary, and known to be within a radius (in the Wasserstein sense) to some reference zero-mean Gaussian noise distributions. Additionally, we establish the existence of a Nash equilibrium of the zero-sum game between a control engineer, who minimizes control cost, and a fictitious adversary, who chooses the noise distributions that maximize this cost. For general (possibly non-Gaussian) reference noise distributions, we establish a quasi closed-form solution for the worst-case distributions against linear policies. Our work provides a less conservative alternative compared to recent work in distributionally robust control.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Algorithm for Bilevel Optimization on Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Existing methods for solving Riemannian bilevel optimization (RBO) problems require prior knowledge of the problem's first- and second-order information and curvature parameter of the Riemannian manifold to determine step sizes, which poses practical limitations when these parameters are unknown or computationally infeasible to obtain. In this paper, we introduce the Adaptive Riemannian Hypergradient Descent (AdaRHD) algorithm for solving RBO problems. To our knowledge, AdaRHD is the first method to incorporate a fully adaptive step size strategy that eliminates the need for problem-specific parameters in RBO problem resolution. We prove that AdaRHD achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/\epsilon)$ iteration complexity for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point, thus matching the complexity of existing non-adaptive methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that substituting exponential mappings with retraction mappings maintains the same complexity bound. Experiments demonstrate that AdaRHD achieves comparable performance to existing non-adaptive approaches while exhibiting greater robustness.</description>

      <title>Revisit Gradient Descent for Geodesically Convex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a seminal work of Zhang and Sra, gradient descent methods for geodesically convex optimization were comprehensively studied. In particular, based on a refined use of the triangle comparison theorem of Toponogov, Zhang and Sra derived a comparison inequality that relates the current iterate, the next iterate and the optimum point. Since their seminal work, numerous follow-ups have studied different downstream usages of their comparison lemma. However, all results along this line relies on strong assumptions, such as bounded domain assumption or curvature bounded below assumption.
  In this work, we introduce the concept of quasilinearization to optimization, presenting a novel framework for analyzing geodesically convex optimization. By leveraging this technique, we establish state-of-the-art convergence rates -- for both deterministic and stochastic settings -- under substantially weaker assumptions than previously required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on numerically solving a shape identification problem related to advection-diffusion processes with space-dependent coefficients using shape optimization techniques. Two boundary-type cost functionals are considered, and their corresponding variations with respect to shapes are derived using the adjoint method, employing the chain rule approach. This involves firstly utilizing the material derivative of the state system and secondly using its shape derivative. Subsequently, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) combined with the Sobolev-gradient-descent algorithm is applied to stably solve the shape reconstruction problem. Numerical experiments in two and three dimensions are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the methods.</description>

      <title>How competitive are pay-as-bid auction games?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the pay-as-bid auction game, a supply function model with discriminatory pricing and asymmetric firms. In this game, strategies are non-decreasing supply functions relating pric to quantity and the exact choice of the strategy space turns out to be a crucial issue: when it includes all non-decreasing continuous functions, pure-strategy Nash equilibria often fail to exist. To overcome this, we restrict the strategy space to the set of Lipschitz-continuous functions and we prove that Nash equilibria always exist (under standard concavity assumptions) and consist of functions that are affine on their own support and have slope equal to the maximum allowed Lipschitz constant. We further show that the Nash equilibrium is unique up to the market-clearing price when the demand is affine and the asymmetric marginal production costs are homogeneous in zero. For quadratic production costs, we derive a closed-form expression and we compute the limit as the allowed Lipschitz constant grows to infinity. Our results show that in the limit the pay-as-bid auction game achieves perfect competition with efficient allocation and induces a lower market-clearing price compared to supply function models based on uniform price auctions.</description>

      <title>Feedback Stackelberg-Nash equilibria in difference games with quasi-hierarchical interactions and inequality constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a class of two-player deterministic finite-horizon difference games with coupled inequality constraints, where each player has two types of decision variables: one involving sequential interactions and the other simultaneous interactions. We refer to this class of games as quasi-hierarchical dynamic games and define a solution concept called the feedback Stackelberg-Nash (FSN) equilibrium. Under separability assumption on cost functions, we provide a recursive formulation of the FSN solution using dynamic programming. We show that the FSN solution can be derived from the parametric feedback Stackelberg solution of an associated unconstrained game involving only sequential interactions, with a specific choice of the parameters that satisfy certain implicit complementarity conditions. For the linear-quadratic case, we show that an FSN solution is obtained by reformulating these complementarity conditions as a single large-scale linear complementarity problem. Finally, we illustrate our results using a dynamic duopoly game with production constraints.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Games on Infinite Strategy Sets: Convergence to Nash Equilibria via Dissipativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08286v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider evolutionary dynamics for population games in which players have a continuum of strategies at their disposal. Models in this setting amount to infinite-dimensional differential equations evolving on the manifold of probability measures. We generalize dissipativity theory for evolutionary games from finite to infinite strategy sets that are compact metric spaces, and derive sufficient conditions for the stability of Nash equilibria under the infinite-dimensional dynamics. The resulting analysis is applicable to a broad class of evolutionary games, and is modular in the sense that the pertinent conditions on the dynamics and the game's payoff structure can be verified independently. By specializing our theory to the class of monotone games, we recover as special cases existing stability results for the Brown-von Neumann-Nash and impartial pairwise comparison dynamics. We also extend our theory to models with dynamic payoffs, further broadening the applicability of our framework. Throughout our analyses, we identify and elaborate on new technical conditions that are key in extending dissipativity theory from finite to infinite strategy sets, such as compactness of the set of Nash equilibria and evolution of dynamic payoffs within a compact positively invariant set. We illustrate our theory using a variety of case studies, including a novel, continuous variant of the war of attrition game.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning has traditionally focused on learning state-dependent policies to solve optimal control problems in a closed-loop fashion. In this work, we introduce the paradigm of open-loop reinforcement learning where a fixed action sequence is learned instead. We present three new algorithms: one robust model-based method and two sample-efficient model-free methods. Rather than basing our algorithms on Bellman's equation from dynamic programming, our work builds on Pontryagin's principle from the theory of open-loop optimal control. We provide convergence guarantees and evaluate all methods empirically on a pendulum swing-up task, as well as on two high-dimensional MuJoCo tasks, significantly outperforming existing baselines.</description>

      <title>A network based approach for unbalanced optimal transport on surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a neural network approach to address the dynamic unbalanced optimal transport problem on surfaces with point cloud representation. For surfaces with point cloud representation, traditional method is difficult to apply due to the difficulty of mesh generating. Neural network is easy to implement even for complicate geometry. Moreover, instead of solving the original dynamic formulation, we consider the Hamiltonian flow approach, i.e. Karush-Kuhn-Tucker system. Based on this approach, we can exploit mathematical structure of the optimal transport to construct the neural network and the loss function can be simplified. Extensive numerical experiments are conducted for surfaces with different geometry. We also test the method for point cloud with noise, which shows stability of this method. This method is also easy to generalize to diverse range of problems.</description>

      <title>Vertical Federated Learning with Missing Features During Training and Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22564v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vertical federated learning trains models from feature-partitioned datasets across multiple clients, who collaborate without sharing their local data. Standard approaches assume that all feature partitions are available during both training and inference. Yet, in practice, this assumption rarely holds, as for many samples only a subset of the clients observe their partition. However, not utilizing incomplete samples during training harms generalization, and not supporting them during inference limits the utility of the model. Moreover, if any client leaves the federation after training, its partition becomes unavailable, rendering the learned model unusable. Missing feature blocks are therefore a key challenge limiting the applicability of vertical federated learning in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose LASER-VFL, a vertical federated learning method for efficient training and inference of split neural network-based models that is capable of handling arbitrary sets of partitions. Our approach is simple yet effective, relying on the sharing of model parameters and on task-sampling to train a family of predictors. We show that LASER-VFL achieves a $\mathcal{O}({1}/{\sqrt{T}})$ convergence rate for nonconvex objectives and, under the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality, it achieves linear convergence to a neighborhood of the optimum. Numerical experiments show improved performance of LASER-VFL over the baselines. Remarkably, this is the case even in the absence of missing features. For example, for CIFAR-100, we see an improvement in accuracy of $19.3\%$ when each of four feature blocks is observed with a probability of 0.5 and of $9.5\%$ when all features are observed.

Abstract: We investigate a nonlinear parabolic partial differential equation whose boundary conditions contain a single control input. This model describes a chemical reaction of the type ``$A \to $ product'', occurring in a dispersed flow tubular reactor. The existence and uniqueness of solutions to the nonlinear Cauchy problem under consideration are established by applying the theory of strongly continuous semigroups of operators. We also prove the stability of the equilibrium of the closed-loop system with a proposed feedback law. Additionally, using Lyapunov's direct method, we evaluate the exponential decay rate of the solutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) problem on surfaces represented by point clouds. Based on alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm, the original UOT problem can be solved by an iteration consists of three steps. The key ingredient is to solve a Poisson equation on point cloud which is solved by tangent radial basis function (TRBF) method. The proposed TRBF method requires only the point cloud and normal vectors to discretize the Poisson equation which simplify the computation significantly. Numerical experiments conducted on point clouds with varying geometry and topology demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Multimodal Transit Frequency and Shared Autonomous Vehicle Fleet Size with Hybrid Metaheuristic and Nonlinear Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) bring competition to traditional transit services but redesigning multimodal transit network can utilize SAVs as feeders to enhance service efficiency and coverage. This paper presents an optimization framework for the joint multimodal transit frequency and SAV fleet size problem, a variant of the transit network frequency setting problem. The objective is to maximize total transit ridership (including SAV-fed trips and subtracting boarding rejections) across multiple time periods under budget constraints, considering endogenous mode choice (transit, point-to-point SAVs, driving) and route selection, while allowing for strategic route removal by setting frequencies to zero. Due to the problem's non-linear, non-convex nature and the computational challenges of large-scale networks, we develop a hybrid solution approach that combines a metaheuristic approach (particle swarm optimization) with nonlinear programming for local solution refinement. To ensure computational tractability, the framework integrates analytical approximation models for SAV waiting times based on fleet utilization, multimodal network assignment for route choice, and multinomial logit mode choice behavior, bypassing the need for computationally intensive simulations within the main optimization loop. Applied to the Chicago metropolitan area's multimodal network, our method illustrates a 33.3% increase in transit ridership through optimized transit route frequencies and SAV integration, particularly enhancing off-peak service accessibility and strategically reallocating resources.</description>

      <title>Obtuse almost-equiangular sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11086v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $t \in [-1, 1)$, a set of points on the $(n-1)$-dimensional unit sphere is called $t$-almost equiangular if among any three distinct points there is a pair with inner product $t$. We propose a semidefinite programming upper bound for the maximum cardinality $\alpha(n, t)$ of such a set based on an extension of the Lov\'asz theta number to hypergraphs. This bound is at least as good as previously known bounds and for many values of $n$ and $t$ it is better.
  We also refine existing spectral methods to show that $\alpha(n, t) \leq 2(n+1)$ for all $n$ and $t \leq 0$, with equality only at $t = -1/n$. This allows us to show the uniqueness of the optimal construction at $t = -1/n$ for $n \leq 5$ and to enumerate all possible constructions for $n \leq 3$ and $t \leq 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hadamard decomposition is a powerful technique for data analysis and matrix compression, which decomposes a given matrix into the element-wise product of two or more low-rank matrices. In this paper, we develop an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, leveraging an alternating optimization approach that decomposes the global non-convex problem into a series of convex sub-problems. To improve performance, we explore advanced initialization strategies inspired by the singular value decomposition (SVD) and incorporate acceleration techniques by introducing momentum-based updates. Beyond optimizing the two-matrix case, we also extend the Hadamard decomposition framework to support more than two low-rank matrices, enabling approximations with higher effective ranks while preserving computational efficiency. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to compare our method with the existing gradient descent-based approaches for the Hadamard decomposition and with traditional low-rank approximation techniques. The results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed method across diverse datasets.</description>
