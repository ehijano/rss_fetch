      <title>Stepping into the Forest: Confronting Interacting Radiation Models for the Hubble Tension with Lyman-$\alpha$ Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models of interacting dark radiation have been shown to alleviate the Hubble tension. Extensions incorporating a coupling between dark matter and dark radiation (DM-DR) have been proposed as combined solutions to both the Hubble and $S_8$ tensions. A key feature of these extended models is a break in the matter power spectrum (MPS), suppressing power for modes that enter the horizon before the DM-DR interactions turn off. In scenarios with a massless mediator, modes that enter before matter-radiation equality get suppressed, whereas for massive mediators, the break is determined by the mediator mass, a free parameter. In this work, we test these models against probes of LSS: weak lensing, CMB lensing, full-shape galaxy clustering, and eBOSS measurements of the 1D Ly$\alpha\,$ forest flux power spectrum. The latter are the most constraining since they probe small scales where many models predict the largest deviations. In fact, already within $\Lambda{\rm CDM}\,$, the eBOSS Ly$\alpha\,$ data are in significant tension with Planck CMB data, with the Ly$\alpha\,$ data preferring a steeper slope of the MPS at $k \sim h \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. We find that the simplest dark radiation models, which improve the Hubble tension, worsen the fit to the Ly$\alpha\,$ data. However, models with DM-DR interactions can simultaneously address both tensions.</description>

      <title>A deep-learning algorithm to disentangle self-interacting dark matter and AGN feedback models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different models of dark matter can alter the distribution of mass in galaxy clusters in a variety of ways. However, so can uncertain astrophysical feedback mechanisms. Here we present a Machine Learning method that ''learns'' how the impact of dark matter self-interactions differs from that of astrophysical feedback in order to break this degeneracy and make inferences on dark matter. We train a Convolutional Neural Network on images of galaxy clusters from hydro-dynamic simulations. In the idealised case our algorithm is 80% accurate at identifying if a galaxy cluster harbours collisionless dark matter, dark matter with ${\sigma}_{\rm DM}/m = 0.1$cm$^2/$g or with ${\sigma}_{DM}/m = 1$cm$^2$/g. Whilst we find adding X-ray emissivity maps does not improve the performance in differentiating collisional dark matter, it does improve the ability to disentangle different models of astrophysical feedback. We include noise to resemble data expected from Euclid and Chandra and find our model has a statistical error of &lt; 0.01cm$^2$/g and that our algorithm is insensitive to shape measurement bias and photometric redshift errors. This method represents a new way to analyse data from upcoming telescopes that is an order of magnitude more precise and many orders faster, enabling us to explore the dark matter parameter space like never before.</description>

      <title>A model-independent treatment of cosmic ladder calibration and $\Omega_k$ measurement through low-$z$ observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Looking at the well-known Hubble tension as a tension in the calibrators of the cosmic distance ladder, i.e. the absolute magnitude $M$ of standard candles such as supernovae of Type Ia (SNIa) and the standard ruler represented by the comoving sound horizon at the baryon-drag epoch, $r_d$, we propose a model-independent method to measure these distance calibrators independently from the cosmic microwave background and the first rungs of the direct distance ladder. To do so, we leverage state-of-the-art data on cosmic chronometers (CCH), SNIa and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) from various galaxy surveys. Taking advantage of the Gaussian Processes Bayesian technique, we reconstruct $M(z)$, $\Omega_k(z)$ and $r_d(z)$ at $z\lesssim2$ and check that no significant statistical evolution is preferred at 68\% C.L. This allows us to treat them as constants and constrain them assuming the metric description of gravity, the cosmological principle and the validity of CCH as reliable cosmic clocks, and SNIa and BAO as optimal standard candles and standard rulers, respectively, but otherwise in a model-independent way. We obtain: $\Omega_k=-0.07^{+0.12}_{-0.15}$, $M=(-19.314^{+0.086}_{-0.108})$ mag and $r_d=(142.3\pm 5.3)$ Mpc. At present, the uncertainties derived are still too large to arbitrate the tension but this is bound to change in the near future with the advent of upcoming surveys and data.</description>

      <title>The Separate Universe approach for multifield inflation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes could constitute part or all of dark matter but they require large inhomogeneities to form in the early universe. These inhomogeneities can strongly backreact on the large scale dynamics of the universe. Stochastic inflation provides a way of studying this backreaction and getting an estimation of the abundance of primordial black holes. Because stochastic inflation focuses on large scale dynamics, it rests on the separate universe approach. However, the validity of this approach has only been checked in single field models, but not in multifield models in which we expect strong boosts in the power spectrum, leading to the formation of primordial black holes. We will check the validity of a separate universe approach in multifield models by matching it with a complete cosmological perturbation theory approach at large scales. In particular, we wish to compare these two paradigms and their differences in the adiabatic and entropic directions of the phase space. This will give us a range of validity and conditions one needs to verify in order to apply the separate universe approach and stochastic inflation in multifield models.</description>

      <title>SubDLe: identification of substructures in cosmological simulations with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of substructures within halos in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations is a fundamental step to identify the simulated counterparts of real objects, namely galaxies. For this reason, substructure finders play a crucial role in extracting relevant information from the simulation outputs. They are based on physically-motivated definitions of substructures, performing multiple steps of particle-by-particle operations, thus computationally expensive. The purpose of this work is to develop a fast algorithm to identify substructures in simulations. The final aim, besides a faster production of subhalo catalogues, is to provide an algorithm fast enough to be applied with a fine time-cadence during the evolution of the simulations. We chose to apply the architecture of a well known Fully Convolutional Network, U-Net, to the identification of substructures within the mass density field of the simulation. We have developed SubDLe (Substructure identification with Deep Learning), an algorithm which combines a 3D generalization of U-Net and a Friends-of-Friends algorithm, and trained it to reproduce the identification of substructures performed by the SubFind algorithm in a set of zoom-in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters. For the feasibility study presented in this work, we have trained and tested SubDLe on galaxy clusters at $z=0$, using a NVIDIA P100 GPU. We focused our tests on the version of the algorithm working on the identification of purely stellar substructures, stellar SubDLe. Our stellar SubDLe is capable of identifying the majority of galaxies in the challenging high-density environment of galaxy clusters in short computing times. This result has interesting implications in view of the possibility of integrating fast subhalo finders within simulation codes, that can take advantage of accelerators available on state-of-art computing nodes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard LambdaCDM cosmology passes demanding tests that establish it as a good approximation to reality. It is incomplete, with open questions and anomalies, but the same is true of all our physical theories. The anomalies in the standard cosmology might guide us to an even better theory. It has happened before.</description>

      <title>Pixel domain implementation of the Minimally Informed CMB MAp foreground Cleaning (MICMAC) method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High fidelity separation of astrophysical foreground contributions from the cosmic microwave background (CMB) signal has been recognized as one of the main challenges of modern CMB data analysis, and one which needs to be addressed in a robust way to ensure that the next generation of CMB polarization experiments lives up to its promise. In this work we consider the non-parametric maximum likelihood CMB cleaning approach recently proposed by some of the authors which has been shown to match the performance of standard parametric techniques for simple foreground models, while superseding it in cases where the foregrounds do not exhibit a simple frequency dependence. We present a new implementation of the method in pixel space, extending its functionalities to account for spatial variability of the properties of the foregrounds. We describe the algorithmic details of our approach and its validation against the original code as well as the parametric method for various experimental set-ups and different models of the foreground components. We argue that the method provides a compelling alternative to other state-of-the-art techniques.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational lensing occurs as the path of light from distant celestial bodies is distorted due to gravitational attraction by other celestial bodies, whose mass is partly invisible, being so-called dark matter. When observed through a gravitational lens, distant galaxies appear distorted. A lot of research activity goes into mapping the dark matter in the universe through graviational lensing. However, the mathematical models are complicated, and calculations both time consuming and tideous, if manual. In this paper we discuss how we may combine the Roulette formalism due to Clarkson with machine learning for automatic, local estimation of the lense potential in strong lenses. We also present a framework of open source software for generating datasets and validating results.

      <title>Resonant or asymmetric: The status of sub-GeV dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-GeV dark matter (DM) particles produced via thermal freeze-out evade many of the strong constraints on heavier DM candidates but at the same time face a multitude of new constraints from laboratory experiments, astrophysical observations and cosmological data. In this work we combine all of these constraints in order to perform frequentist and Bayesian global analyses of fermionic and scalar sub-GeV DM coupled to a dark photon with kinetic mixing. For fermionic DM, we find viable parameter regions close to the dark photon resonance, which expand significantly when including a particle-antiparticle asymmetry. For scalar DM, the velocity-dependent annihilation cross section evades the strongest constraints even in the symmetric case. Using Bayesian model comparison, we show that both asymmetric fermionic DM and symmetric scalar DM are preferred over symmetric fermionic DM due to the reduced fine-tuning penalty. Finally, we explore the discovery prospects of near-future experiments both in the full parameter space and for specific benchmark points. We find that the most commonly used benchmark scenarios are already in tension with existing constraints and propose a new benchmark point that can be targeted with future searches.</description>

      <title>Rescuing thermally under-abundant dark matter with a first-order phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel scenario where thermally under-abundant dark matter (DM) can be revived with a first-order phase transition (FOPT). In the absence of FOPT, thermal DM abundance remains suppressed due to efficient annihilation via mediators. A FOPT brings sharp change to the mass of the mediator at the nucleation temperature such that the final DM relic agrees with observations. We implement this idea in a scenario where DM interacts via a mediator whose initial mass is of same order as DM mass keeping DM annihilation either in allowed or forbidden ballpark. As the mediator mass decreases sharply at the nucleation temperature of the FOPT, the frozen out DM suffers further depletion while keeping final relic within observed limits. DM with sizeable interactions with a light mediator can also give rise to the required self-interactions necessary to solve the small scale structure issues of cold dark matter. While the mechanism is generic to any thermal DM mass, choosing it in the GeV ballpark forces the FOPT to MeV scale which predicts stochastic gravitational waves with nano-Hz frequencies within reach of pulsar timing array (PTA) based experiments like NANOGrav. The existence of light scalar mediator and its mixing with the Higgs keep the scenario verifiable at different particle physics experiments.</description>

      <title>The deceleration parameter in perturbed Bianchi universes with a "tilt"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relative motion effects have long been known to ``contaminate'' the observations. In fact, when looking back to the history of astronomy, one finds a number of examples where relative motions have led to a gross misinterpretation of reality. Using relativistic cosmological perturbation theory it was shown that observers living inside bulk-flow domains that expand slightly slower than their surroundings, can have the illusion of cosmic acceleration, while the host universe is actually decelerating. This claim was originally based on studies of a perturbed tilted Einstein-de Sitter model, primarily for mathematical simplicity. Nevertheless, nothing really changed when the background universe was replaced by a Friedmann cosmology with nonzero pressure and spatial curvature. This raised the possibility that the peculiar-motion effect on the deceleration parameter, as measured locally by the bulk-flow observers, may be generic and independent of the specifics of the host universe. Here, we investigate this possibility, by extending the earlier studies to perturbed Bianchi cosmologies. We find that the picture remains unchanged, unless the Bianchi background has unrealistically high anisotropy. The peculiar-motion effect on the deceleration parameter, as measured by the relatively moving observers, is essentially the same with that reported earlier in a perturbed Einstein-de Sitter universe and in the rest of its Friedmann counterparts.</description>

      <title>Calibration Error in 21-centimeter Global Spectrum Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The redshifted 21 cm line signal is a powerful probe of the cosmic dawn and the epoch of reionization. The global spectrum can potentially be detected with a single antenna and spectrometer. However, this measurement requires an extremely accurate calibration of the instrument to facilitate the separation of the 21 cm signal from the much brighter foregrounds and possible variations in the instrument response. Understanding how the measurement errors propagate in a realistic instrument system and affect system calibration is the focus of this work. We simulate a 21 cm global spectrum observation based on the noise wave calibration scheme. We focus on how measurement errors in reflection coefficients affect the noise temperature and how typical errors impact the recovery of the 21 cm signal, especially in the frequency domain. Results show that for our example set up, a typical vector network analyzer (VNA) measurement error in the magnitude of the reflection coefficients of the antenna, receiver, and open cable, which are 0.001, 0.001, and 0.002 (linear), respectively, would result in a 200 mK deviation on the detected signal, and a typical measurement error of 0.48 degree, 0.78 degree, or 0.15 degree in the respective phases would cause a 40 mK deviation. The VNA measurement error can greatly affect the result of a 21 cm global spectrum experiment using this calibration technique, and such a feature could be mistaken for or be combined with the 21 cm signal</description>

      <title>Manifestation of antiquark nuggets in collisions with the Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Antiquark nuggets are hypothetical compact composite objects conjectured to account for a significant fraction of dark matter in the Universe. In contrast to quark nuggets, these objects consist of antimatter. They may remain undetected if they possess a sufficiently small cross section relative to their mass. In this paper, we investigate the allowed region in the parameter space of this model that is consistent with the observed neutrino flux from the Sun and the Earth, and the non-observation of seismic events with specific signatures of dark matter particles. We found the allowed values of the antibaryon charge number in this model to be in the interval $2\times 10^{24}&lt;A&lt;8\times 10^{25}$, while the probability of nucleon annihilation upon collisions with the antiquark core is constrained by $0.1\lesssim \kappa&lt;0.25$. Although very large values of the antibaryon charge, $A&gt;10^{33}$, are not fully excluded by the present study, we show that they conflict with the non-observation of rare catastrophic explosion-like events on the Earth.</description>

      <title>Strong-lensing cosmography using third-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed exposition of a statistical method for estimating cosmological parameters from the observation of a large number of strongly lensed binary-black-hole (BBH) mergers observable by third-generation gravitational-wave (GW) detectors. This method, first presented in $\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.130.261401}{[1]}$, compares the observed number of strongly lensed GW events and their time delay distribution (between lensed images) with observed events to infer cosmological parameters. We show that the precision of the estimation of the cosmological parameters does not have a strong dependance on the assumed BBH redshift distribution model. An incorrect model for the distribution of lens properties and redshifts can lead to a biased cosmological inference. However, Bayesian model selection can assist in selecting the right model from a set of available parametric models for the distribution of lens redshift and properties. We also present a way to incorporate the effect of contamination in the data due to the limited efficiency of lensing identification methods, so that it will not bias the cosmological inference.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational radiation alone is not efficient in hardening the orbit of a wide binary black hole (BBH). By employing a toy model for the interstellar medium (ISM) surrounding BBHs, here we discuss the effect of this baryonic medium on BBH dynamics. Depending on the BBH's mass, we show that a binary surrounded by an isotropic cold neutral medium (i.e., an asymptotic temperature $T_{\infty} \approx 100$ K) with a time-averaged particle density of $\langle n_H \rangle = \mathcal{O}(1)$ cm$^{-3}$ can play a significant role in hardening the binary orbit over a $\mathcal{O}(10^9)$ yr time scale. Additionally, this causes the black hole's mass to grow at a rate $\propto m^2$. We thus discuss the impact of the ISM on the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) observables and quantify the properties of the ISM under which the latter could act as an additional important pathway for driving a subset of LVK's BBH mergers.</description>

Abstract: The pathway(s) to seeding the massive black holes (MBHs) that exist at the heart of galaxies in the present and distant Universe remains an unsolved problem. Here we categorise, describe and quantitatively discuss the formation pathways of both $\textit{light}$ and $\textit{heavy}$ seeds. We emphasise that the most recent computational models suggest that rather than a bimodal-like mass spectrum between $\textit{light}$ and $\textit{heavy}$ seeds with $\textit{light}$ at one end and $\textit{heavy}$ at the other that instead a continuum exists. $\textit{Light}$ seeds being more ubiquitous and the heavier seeds becoming less and less abundant due the rarer environmental conditions required for their formation. We therefore examine the different mechanisms that give rise to different seed mass spectrums. We show how and why the mechanisms that produce the $\textit{heaviest}$ seeds are also among the rarest events in the Universe and are hence extremely unlikely to be the seeds for the vast majority of the MBH population. We quantify, within the limits of the current large uncertainties in the seeding processes, the expected number densities of the seed mass spectrum. We argue that $\textit{light}$ seeds must be at least $10^{3}$ to $10^{5}$ times more numerous than $\textit{heavy}$ seeds to explain the MBH population as a whole. Based on our current understanding of the seed population this makes $\textit{heavy}$ seeds ($\rm{M_{seed}} &gt; 10^3$ M$_{\odot}$) a significantly more likely pathway given that $\textit{heavy}$ seeds have an abundance pattern than is close to and likely in excess of $10^{-4}$ compared to $\textit{light}$ seeds. Finally, we examine the current state-of-the-art in numerical calculations and recent observations and plot a path forward for near-future advances in both domains.</description>

      <title>A$^3$COSMOS: Measuring the cosmic dust-attenuated star formation rate density at $4 &lt; z &lt; 5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [Abridged] In recent years, conflicting results have provided an uncertain view of the dust-attenuated properties of $z&gt;4$ star-forming galaxies (SFGs). To solve this, we used the deepest data publicly available in COSMOS to build a mass-complete ($&gt;10^{9.5}\,M_{\odot}$) sample of SFGs at $4&lt;z&lt;5$ and measured their dust-attenuated properties by stacking all archival ALMA band 6 and 7 observations available. Combining this information with their rest-frame ultraviolet emission from the COSMOS2020 catalog, we constrained the IRX ($\equiv L_{\rm IR}/L_{\rm UV}$)--$\beta_{\rm UV}$, IRX--$M_\ast$, and SFR--$M_\ast$ relations at $z\sim4.5$. Finally, using these relations and the stellar mass function of SFGs at $z\sim4.5$, we inferred the unattenuated and dust-attenuated SFRD at this epoch. SFGs at $z\sim4.5$ follow an IRX--$\beta_{\rm UV}$ relation that is consistent with that of local starbursts, while they follow a steeper IRX--$M_\ast$ relation than observed locally. The grain properties of dust in these SFGs seems thus similar to those in local starbursts but its mass and geometry result in lower attenuation in low-mass SFGs. SFGs at $z\sim4.5$ lie on a linear SFR--$M_\ast$ relation, whose normalization varies by 0.3 dex, when we exclude or include from our stacks the ALMA primary targets. The cosmic SFRD$(&gt;M_\ast)$ converges at $M_\ast&lt;10^{9}\,M_\odot$ and is dominated by SFGs with $M_\ast\sim10^{9.5-10.5}\,M_\odot$. The fraction of the cosmic SFRD that is attenuated by dust, ${\rm SFRD}_{\rm IR}(&gt;M_\ast)/ {\rm SFRD}(&gt;M_\ast)$, is $90\pm4\%$ for $M_\ast\,=\,10^{10}\,M_\odot$, $68\pm10\%$ for $M_\ast=10^{8.9}\,M_\odot$ (i.e., $0.03\times M^\star$; $M^\star$ being the characteristic stellar mass of SFGs) and this value converges to $60\pm10\%$ for $M_\ast=10^{8}\,M_\odot$. Even at this early epoch, the fraction of the cosmic SFRD that is attenuated by dust remains thus significant.</description>

      <title>Acoustic wake in an isothermal profile: dynamical friction and gravitational wave emission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the motion of a circularly-moving perturber in a self-gravitating, collisional system with spherically symmetric density profile. We concentrate on the singular isothermal sphere which, despite its pathological features, admits a simple polarization function in linear response theory. This allows us to solve for the acoustic wake trailing the perturber and the resulting dynamical friction, in the limit where the self-gravity of the response can be ignored. In steady-state and for subsonic velocities $v_p&lt;c_s$, the dynamical friction torque $F_\varphi\propto v_p^3$ is suppressed for perturbers orbiting in an isothermal sphere relative to the infinite, homogeneous medium expectation $F_\varphi\propto v_p$. For highly supersonic motions, both expectations agree and are consistent with a local approximation to the gravitational torque. At fixed resolution (a given Coulomb logarithm), the response of the system is maximal for Mach numbers near the constant circular velocity of the singular isothermal profile. This resonance maximizes the gravitational wave (GW) emission produced by the trailing acoustic wake. For an inspiral around a massive black hole of mass $10^6 M_\odot$ located at the center of a (truncated) isothermal sphere, this GW signal could be comparable to the vacuum GW emission of the black hole binary at sub-nanohertz frequencies when the small black hole enters the Bondi sphere of the massive one. The exact magnitude of this effect depends on departures from hydrostatic equilibrium and on the viscosity present in any realistic astrophysical fluid, which are not included in our simplified description.</description>

      <title>SMART: spectral energy distributions Markov chain analysis with radiative transfer models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present the publicly available open-source spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting code SMART (Spectral energy distributions Markov chain Analysis with Radiative Transfer models). Implementing a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, SMART fits the ultraviolet to millimetre SEDs of galaxies exclusively with radiative transfer models that currently constitute four types of pre-computed libraries, which describe the starburst, active galactic nucleus (AGN) torus, host galaxy and polar dust components. An important novelty of SMART is that, although it fits SEDs exclusively with radiative transfer models, it takes comparable time to popular energy balance methods to run. Here we describe the key features of SMART and test it by fitting the multi-wavelength SEDs of the 42 local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) that constitute the HERschel Ultraluminous Infrared Galaxy Survey (HERUS) sample. The Spitzer spectroscopy data of the HERUS ULIRGs are included in the fitting at a spectral resolution, which is matched to that of the radiative transfer models. We also present other results that highlight the performance and versatility of SMART. SMART promises to be a useful tool for studying galaxy evolution in the JWST era. SMART is developed in PYTHON and is available at https://github.com/ch-var/SMART.git.</description>

      <title>A path towards constraining the evolution of the interstellar medium and outflows in the Milky Way using APOGEE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the study of the Milky Way has significantly advanced due to extensive spectroscopic surveys of its stars, complemented by astroseismic and astrometric data. However, it remains disjoint from recent advancements in understanding the physics of the Galactic interstellar medium (ISM). This paper introduces a new model for the chemical evolution of the Milky Way that can be constrained on stellar data, because it combines a state-of-the-art ISM model with a Milky Way stellar disc model. Utilizing a dataset of red clump stars from APOGEE, known for their precise ages and metallicities, we concentrate on the last 6 billion years -- a period marked by Milky Way's secular evolution. We examine the oxygen abundance in the low-$\alpha$ disc stars relative to their ages and birth radii, validating or constraining critical ISM parameters that remain largely unexplored in extragalactic observations. The models that successfully reproduce the radius -- metallicity distribution and the age -- metallicity distribution of stars without violating existing ISM observations indicate a need for modest differential oxygen enrichment in Galactic outflows, meaning that the oxygen abundance of outflows is higher than the local ISM abundance, irrespective of outflow mass loading. The models also suggest somewhat elevated ISM gas velocity dispersion levels over the past 6 billion years compared to galaxies of similar mass. The extra turbulence necessary could result from energy from gas accretion onto the Galaxy, supernovae clustering in the ISM, or increased star formation efficiency per freefall time. This work provides a novel approach to constraining the Galactic ISM and outflows, leveraging the detailed insights available from contemporary Milky Way surveys.</description>

      <title>Theoretical bounds on dark Higgs mass in a self-interacting dark matter model with $U(1)'$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the null results of current dark matter searches and the small-scale problems, we study a dark sector charged by a spontaneous broken gauge $U(1)'$. To explore the parameter space of this model, in addition to the consideration of the small-scale data, we also consider the theoretical bounds on the dark Higgs mass, with the upper bound coming from the tree-level perturbative unitarity and the lower bound from the one-loop Linde-Weinberg bound. We deeply examine the dependence of the Linde-Weinberg bound on gauge choice and energy scale. Combining the theoretical and observational constraints, we obtain the following ranges for the parameter space: the dark matter mass is 10-500 GeV, the mediator (dark photon) mass is 0.5-5 MeV, the dark Higgs mass is 0.05-50 MeV, the dark fine-structure constant is 0.001-0.5. We conclude that the dark Higgs in this model cannot be ignored in the phenomenological study of the dark sector.</description>

      <title>Population III star formation in the presence of turbulence, magnetic fields and ionizing radiation feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulence, magnetic fields and radiation feedback are key components that shape the formation of stars, especially in the metal-free environments at high redshifts where Population III stars form. Yet no 3D numerical simulations exist that simultaneously take all of these into account. We present the first suite of radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) simulations of Population III star formation using the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) code FLASH. We include both turbulent magnetic fields and ionizing radiation feedback coupled to primordial chemistry, and resolve the collapse of primordial clouds down to few au. We find that dynamically strong magnetic fields significantly slow down accretion onto protostars, while ionizing feedback is largely unable to regulate gas accretion because the partially ionized \ion{H}{ii} region gets trapped near the star due to insufficient radiative outputs from the star. The maximum stellar mass in the HD and RHD simulations that only yield one star exceeds $100\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$ within the first $5000\,\rm{yr}$. However, in the corresponding MHD and RMHD runs, the maximum mass of Population III star is only $60\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$. In other realizations where we observe widespread fragmentation leading to the formation of Population III star clusters, the maximum stellar mass is further reduced by a factor of few due to fragmentation-induced starvation. We thus conclude that magnetic fields are more important than ionizing feedback in regulating the mass of the star, at least during the earliest stages of Population III star formation, in typical dark matter minihaloes at $z \approx 30$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.18349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We complete the perturbative program for equilibrium thermodynamics of cosmological first-order phase transitions by determining the finite-temperature effective potential of gauge-Higgs theories at next-to-next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^4$LO). The computation of the three-loop effective potential required to reach this order is extended to generic models in dimensionally reduced effective theories in a companion article. Our N$^4$LO result is the last perturbative order before confinement renders electroweak gauge-Higgs theories non-perturbative at four loops. By contrasting our analysis with non-perturbative lattice results, we find a remarkable agreement. As a direct application for predictions of gravitational waves produced by a first-order transition, our computation provides the final fully perturbative results for the phase transition strength and speed of sound.</description>

Abstract: In this work we present 21cmFirstCLASS, a modified version of 21cmFAST, the most popular code in the literature for computing the anisotropies of the 21-cm signal. Our code uses the public cosmic microwave background (CMB) Boltzmann code CLASS, to establish consistent initial conditions at recombination for any set of cosmological parameters and evolves them throughout the dark ages, cosmic dawn, the epoch of heating and reionization. We account for inhomogeneity in the temperature and ionization fields throughout the evolution, crucial for a robust calculation of both the global 21-cm signal and its fluctuations. We demonstrate how future measurements of the CMB and the 21-cm signal can be combined and analyzed with 21cmFirstCLASS to obtain constraints on both cosmological and astrophysical parameters and examine degeneracies between them. As an example application, we show how 21cmFirstCLASS can be used to study cosmological models that exhibit non-linearities already at the dark ages, such as scattering dark matter (SDM). For the first time, we present self-consistent calculations of the 21-cm power spectrum in the presence of SDM during the non-linear epoch of cosmic dawn. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/jordanflitter/21cmFirstCLASS.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermal freeze-out mechanism in its classical form is tightly connected to physics beyond the Standard Model around the electroweak scale, which has been the target of enormous experimental efforts. In this work we study a dark matter model in which freeze-out is triggered by a strong first-order phase transition in a dark sector, and show that this phase transition must also happen close to the electroweak scale, i.e. in the temperature range relevant for gravitational wave searches with the LISA mission. Specifically, we consider the spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)^\prime$ gauge symmetry through the vacuum expectation value of a scalar field, which generates the mass of a fermionic dark matter candidate that subsequently annihilates into dark Higgs and gauge bosons. In this set-up the peak frequency of the gravitational wave background is tightly correlated with the dark matter relic abundance, and imposing the observed value for the latter implies that the former must lie in the milli-Hertz range. A peculiar feature of our set-up is that the dark sector is not necessarily in thermal equilibrium with the Standard Model during the phase transition, and hence the temperatures of the two sectors evolve independently. Nevertheless, the requirement that the universe does not enter an extended period of matter domination after the phase transition, which would strongly dilute any gravitational wave signal, places a lower bound on the portal coupling that governs the entropy transfer between the two sectors. As a result, the predictions for the peak frequency of gravitational waves in the LISA band are robust, while the amplitude can change depending on the initial dark sector temperature.</description>

Abstract: This study explores the impact of cosmic curvature on structure formation through general relativistic first-order perturbation theory. We analyze continuity and Euler equations, incorporating cosmic curvature into Einstein equations. Emphasizing late-time dynamics, we investigate matter density contrast evolution in the presence of cosmic curvature, with a specific focus on sub-hubble scales. Solving the evolution equation, we conduct data analysis using cosmic chronometers, baryon acoustic oscillations, type Ia supernova observations and $f\sigma_8$ data. While constraints on some parameters remain consistent, excluding cosmic curvature tightens constraints on $\Omega_{\rm m0}$ and $\sigma_{\rm 80}$ in $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM models. Intriguingly, the non-phantom behavior of dark energy proves more favorable in both $w$CDM and CPL models across diverse data combinations.</description>

      <title>The galaxy-galaxy strong lensing cross section and the internal distribution of matter in {\Lambda}CDM substructure</title>

Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing offers a powerful probe of the detailed distribution of matter in lenses, while magnifying and bringing faint background sources into view. Observed strong lensing by massive galaxy clusters, which are often in complex dynamical states, has also been used to map their dark matter substructures on smaller scales. Deep high resolution imaging has revealed the presence of strong lensing events associated with these substructures, namely galaxy-scale sub-halos. However, an inventory of these observed galaxy-galaxy strong lensing (GGSL) events is noted to be discrepant with state-of-the-art {\Lambda}CDM simulations. Cluster sub-halos appear to be over-concentrated compared to their simulated counterparts yielding an order of magnitude higher value of GGSL. In this paper, we explore the possibility of resolving this observed discrepancy by redistributing the mass within observed cluster sub-halos in ways that are consistent within the {\Lambda}CDM paradigm of structure formation. Lensing mass reconstructions from data provide constraints on the mass enclosed within apertures and are agnostic to the detailed mass profile within them. Therefore, as the detailed density profile within cluster sub-halos currently remains unconstrained by data, we are afforded the freedom to redistribute the enclosed mass. We investigate if rearranging the mass to a more centrally concentrated density profile helps alleviate the GGSL discrepancy. We report that refitting cluster sub-halos to the ubiquitous {\Lambda}CDM-motivated Navarro-Frenk-White profile, and further modifying them to include significant baryonic components, does not resolve this tension. A resolution to this persisting GGSL discrepancy may require more careful exploration of alternative dark matter models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing is a competitive tool to probe the dark matter and energy content of the universe. However, significant uncertainties can arise from the choice of lens model, and in particular the parameterisation of the line of sight. In this work, we consider the consequences of ignoring the contribution of foreground perturbers in lens modelling. We derive the explicit form of the degeneracy between the foreground shear and the ellipticity of a power law lens, which renders both quantities effectively unmeasurable from strong lensing observables. Nonetheless, we demonstrate that this degeneracy does not affect measurements of the Einstein radius. Foreground tidal effects are also not expected to bias the slope of the potential, and any biases in this slope should not affect the recovery of the Hubble constant. The foreground convergence term adds an additional uncertainty to the measurement of $H_0$, and we show that this uncertainty will be on the order of $1\%$ for lensing systems located along random lines of sight. There is evidence to indicate that the probability of strong lensing is higher towards overdense lines of sight, and this could result in a small systematic bias towards overestimations of $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Suppression of matter density growth at scales exceeding the cosmic screening length</title>

Abstract: One of the main objectives of modern cosmology is to explain the origin and evolution of cosmic structures at different scales. The principal force responsible for the formation of such structures is gravity. In a general relativistic framework, we have shown that matter density contrasts do not grow over time at scales exceeding the cosmic screening length, which corresponds to a cosmological scale of the order of two to three gigaparsecs at the present time, at which gravitational interactions exhibit an exponential cut-off. This is a purely relativistic effect. To demonstrate the suppression of density growth, we have performed N-body simulations in a box with a comoving size of $5.632\,{\rm Gpc}/h$ and obtained the power spectrum of the mass density contrast. We have shown that it becomes independent of time for scales beyond the cosmic screening length as a clear manifestation of the cosmic screening effect.</description>

      <title>The effect of wave dark matter on equal mass black hole mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For dark matter to be detectable with gravitational waves from binary black holes, it must reach higher than average densities in their vicinity. In the case of light (wave-like) dark matter, the density of dark matter between the binary can be significantly enhanced by accretion from the surrounding environment. Here we show that the resulting dephasing effect on the last ten orbits of an equal mass binary is maximized when the Compton wavelength of the scalar particle is comparable to the orbital separation, $2\pi/\mu\sim d$. The phenomenology of the effect is different from the channels that are usually discussed, where dynamical friction (along the orbital path) and radiation of energy and angular momentum drive the dephasing, and is rather dominated by the radial force (the spacetime curvature in the radial direction) towards the overdensity between the black holes. Whilst our numerical studies limit us to scales of the same order, this effect may persist at larger separations and/or particle masses, playing a significant role in the merger history of binaries.</description>
