      <title>Modeling and Analyzing Urban Networks and Amenities with OSMnx</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: OSMnx is a Python package for downloading, modeling, analyzing, and visualizing urban networks and any other geospatial features from OpenStreetMap data. A large and growing body of literature uses it to conduct scientific studies across the disciplines of geography, urban planning, transport engineering, computer science, and others. The OSMnx project has recently developed and implemented many new features, modeling capabilities, and analytical methods. The package now encompasses substantially more functionality than was previously documented in the literature. This article introduces OSMnx's modern capabilities, usage, and design -- in addition to the scientific theory and logic underlying them. It shares lessons learned in geospatial software development and reflects on open science's implications for urban modeling and analysis.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of coherence resonance oscillators subject to L\'evy noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21324v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using methods of numerical simulation, we analyze the influence of L\'evy noise on synchronization of excitable oscillators in the regime of coherence resonance. Three cases are under consideration: forced synchronization of a single FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillator subject to periodic forcing, mutual synchronization of two coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo oscillators and ensembles of locally and globally coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons. It is demonstrated that L\'evy noise provides for transformation of the forced synchronization area such that synchronization can arise or be destroyed through varying the L\'evy noise parameters at fixed frequency and amplitude of the external force. Moreover, the L\'evy noise intrinsic peculiarity can induce the counterintuitive transformation of the synchronization areas such that increasing the external force amplitude gives rise to leaving the synchronization area. In the context of synchronization of coupled oscillators, L\'evy noise is also shown to control the transition to synchronization which can be achieved at lower or higher values of the coupling strength when changing the L\'evy noise parameters. However, such effects are found to be exhibited by ensembles of coupled oscillators, whereas the influence of L\'evy noise on mutual synchronization of two coupled coherence resonance oscillators is minimal and does not lead to significant changes as compared to Gaussian noise.</description>
