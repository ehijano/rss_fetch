      <title>On the discontinuities of Hausdorff dimension in generic dynamical Lagrange spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\varphi_0$ be a $C^2$-conservative diffeomorphism of a compact surface $S$ and let $\Lambda_0$ be a mixing horseshoe of $\varphi_0$. Given a smooth real function $f$ defined in $S$ and some diffeomorphism $\varphi$, close to $\varphi_0$, let $\mathcal{L}_{\varphi, f}$ be the Lagrange spectrum associated to the hyperbolic continuation $\Lambda(\varphi)$ of the horseshoe $\Lambda_0$ and $f$. We show that, for generic choices of $\varphi$ and $f$, if $L_{\varphi, f}$ is the map that gives the Hausdorff dimension of the set $\mathcal{L}_{\varphi, f}\cap (-\infty, t)$ for $t\in \mathbb{R}$, then there are at most two points that can be limit of a infinite sequence of discontinuities of $L_{\varphi, f}$.</description>

      <title>Finding Birkhoff Averages via Adaptive Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many applications, one is interested in classifying trajectories of Hamiltonian systems as invariant tori, islands, or chaos. The convergence rate of ergodic Birkhoff averages can be used to categorize these regions, but many iterations of the return map are needed to implement this directly. Recently, it has been shown that a weighted Birkhoff average can be used to accelerate the convergence, resulting in a useful method for categorizing trajectories.
  In this paper, we show how a modified version the reduced rank extrapolation method (named Birkhoff RRE) can also be used to find optimal weights for the weighted average with a single linear least-squares solve.Using these, we classify trajectories with fewer iterations of the map than the standard weighted Birkhoff average. Furthermore, for the islands and invariant circles, a subsequent eigenvalue problem gives the number of islands and the rotation number. Using these numbers, we find Fourier parameterizations of invariant circles and islands. We show examples of Birkhoff RRE on the standard map and on magnetic field line dynamics.</description>

      <title>Extracting coherent sets in aperiodically driven flows from generators of Mather semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent sets are time-dependent regions in the physical space of nonautonomous flows that exhibit little mixing with their neighborhoods, robustly under small random perturbations of the flow. They thus characterize the global long-term transport behavior of the system. We propose a framework to extract such time-dependent families of coherent sets for nonautonomous systems with an ergodic driving dynamics and (small) Brownian noise in physical space. Our construction involves the assembly and analysis of an operator on functions over the augmented space of the associated skew product that, for each fixed state of the driving, propagates distributions on the corresponding physical-space fibre according to the dynamics. This time-dependent operator has the structure of a semigroup (it is called the Mather semigroup), and we show that a spectral analysis of its generator allows for a trajectory-free computation of coherent families, simultaneously for all states of the driving. Additionally, for quasi-periodically driven torus flows, we propose a tailored Fourier discretization scheme for this generator and demonstrate our method by means of three examples of two-dimensional flows.</description>

      <title>Level-2 IFS Thermodynamic Formalism: Gibbs probabilities in the space of probabilities and the push-forward map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We will denote by $\mathcal{M}$ the space of Borel probabilities on the symbolic space $\Omega=\{1,2...,m\}^\mathbb{N}$. $\mathcal{M}$ is equipped Monge-Kantorovich metric. We consider here the push-forward map $\mathfrak{T}:\mathcal{M} \to \mathcal{M}$ as a dynamical system. The space of Borel probabilities on $\mathcal{M}$ is denoted by $\mathfrak{M}$. Given a continuous function $A: \mathcal{M}\to \mathbb{R}$, an {\it a priori} probability $\Pi_0$ on $\mathcal{M}$, and a certain convolution operation acting on pairs of probabilities on $\mathcal{M}$, we define an associated Level-2 IFS Ruelle operator. We show the existence of an eigenfunction and an eigenprobability $\hat{\Pi}\in\mathfrak{M}$ for such an operator. Under a normalization condition for $A$, we show the existence of some $\mathfrak{T}$-invariant probabilities $\hat{\Pi}\in\mathfrak{M}.$ We are able to define the variational entropy of such $\hat{\Pi}$ and a related maximization pressure problem associated to $A$. In some particular examples, we show how to get eigenprobabilities solutions on $\mathfrak{M}$ for the Level-2 Thermodynamic Formalism problem from eigenprobabilities on $\mathcal{M}$ for the classical (Level-1) Thermodynamic Formalism. These examples highlight the fact that our approach is a natural generalization of the classic case.</description>

      <title>Poissonian Actions of Polish Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define and study Poissonian actions of Polish groups as a framework to Poisson suspensions, characterize them spectrally, and provide a complete characterization of their ergodicity. We further construct 'spatial' Poissonian actions, answering partially a question of Glasner, Tsirelson &amp; Weiss about L\'evy groups. We also construct for every diffeomorphism group an ergodic free spatial probability preserving actions. This constitutes a new class of Polish groups admitting non-essentially countable orbit equivalence relations, obtaining progress on a problem of Kechris.</description>

      <title>Holomorphically conjugate polynomial automorphisms of C^2 are polynomially conjugate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We confirm a conjecture of Friedland and Milnor: if two polynomial automorphisms f and g in Aut(C^2) with dynamical degree &gt;1 are conjugate by some holomorphic diffeomorphism \phi of C^2, then \phi is a polynomial automorphism; thus, f and g are conjugate inside Aut(C^2). We also discuss a number of variations on this result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider discrete ensembles of linear, scalar control systems with single-inputs. Assuming that all the individual systems are unstable, we investigate whether there exist linear feedback control laws that can asymptotically stabilize the ensemble system. We provide necessary/sufficient conditions for feasibility of pole placement in the left half plane and for feedback stabilizability of the ensemble systems.</description>

      <title>On potentials whose level sets are orbits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A level orbit of a mechanical Hamiltonian system is a solution of Newton equation that is contained in a level set of the potential energy. In 2003, Mark Levi asked for a characterization of the smooth potential energy functions on the plane with the property that any point on the plane lies on a level orbit; we call such functions Levi potentials. The basic examples are the radial monotone increasing smooth functions. In this paper we show that any Levi potential that is analytic or has totally path-disconnected critical set must be radial. Nevertheless, we show that every compact convex subset of the plane is the critical set of a Levi potential. A crucial observation for these theorems is that, outside the critical set, the family of level sets of a Levi potential forms a solution of the inverse curvature flow.</description>

      <title>Memory signatures in path curvature of self-avoidant model particles are revealed by time delayed self mutual information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent behavior in active systems is a complex byproduct of local, often pairwise, interactions. One such interaction is self-avoidance, which experimentally can arise as a response to self-generated environmental signals; such experiments have inspired non-Markovian mathematical models. In previous work, we set out to find ``hallmarks of self-avoidant memory" in a particle model for environmentally responsive swimming droplets. In our analysis, we found that transient self-trapping was a spatial hallmark of the particle's self-avoidant memory response. The self-trapping results from the combined effects of behaviors at multiple scales: random reorientations, which occur on the diffusion scale, and the self-avoidant memory response, which occurs on the ballistic (and longer) timescales. In this work, we use the path curvature as it encodes the self-trapping response to estimate an ``effective memory lifetime" by analyzing the decay of its time-delayed mutual information and subsequently determining the longevity of significant nonlinear correlations. This effective memory lifetime (EML) is longer in systems where the curvature is a product of both self-avoidance and random reorientations as compared to systems without self-avoidance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the submodularity of the covolume function in global function fields. The submodular property is often needed in the study of homogeneous dynamics, especially to define a Margulis function. We proved that the covolume function is submodular when the class group of the global function field is trivial.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the imaginary parts of scattering resonances for negatively curved asymptotically hyperbolic surfaces are uniformly bounded away from zero and provide a resolvent bound in the resulting resonance-free strip. This provides an essential spectral gap without the pressure condition. This is done by adapting the methods of [arXiv:1004.3361], [arXiv:1012.4391] and [arXiv:2201.08259] and answers a question posed in [arXiv:1504.06589].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $q$ be an odd prime power. Let $f\in \mathbb{F}_q[x]$ be a polynomial having degree at least $2$, $a\in \mathbb{F}_q$, and denote by $f^n$ the $n$-th iteration of $f$. Let $\chi$ be the quadratic character of $\mathbb{F}_q$, and $\mathcal{O}_f(a)$ the forward orbit of $a$ under iteration by $f$. Suppose that the sequence $(\chi(f^n(a)))_{n\geq 1}$ is periodic, and $m$ is its period. Assuming a mild and generic condition on $f$, we show that, up to a constant, $m$ can be bounded from below by $|\mathcal{O}_f(a)|/q^\frac{2\log_{2}(d)+1}{2\log_2(d)+2}$. More informally, we prove that the period of the appearance of squares in an orbit of an element provides an upper bound for the size of the orbit itself. Using a similar method, we can also prove that, up to a constant, we cannot have more than $q^\frac{2\log_2(d)+1}{2\log_2(d)+2}$ consecutive squares or non-squares in the forward orbit of $a$. In addition, we provide a classification of all polynomials for which our generic condition does not hold.</description>

Abstract: We consider transfer operators for topological Markov shift (TMS) with countable states and with holes which are $2$-cylinders. As main results, if the closed system of the shift has finitely irreducible transition matrix and the potential is a weaker Lipschitz continuous and summable, then we obtain a version of Ruelle-Perron-Frobenius Theorem and quasi-compactness of the associated Ruelle transfer operator. The escape rate of the open system is also calculated. In corollary, it turns out that the Ruelle operator of summable potential on topologically transitive TMS has a spectral gap property. As other example, we apply the main results to the transfer operators associated to graph iterated function systems.</description>

      <title>Equilibria decomposition-based comparison of reaction networks of Wnt signaling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Wnt signaling pathway plays a critical role in various biochemical processes, including embryonic development, tissue homeostasis, and cancer progression. In this paper, we conduct a comparative analysis of $\beta$-catenin-dependent Wnt signaling reaction networks, which we refer to as the Feinberg, Schmitz, and MacLean models, based on the previous study by MacLean et al. (PNAS USA 2015). Our analysis is based on the (unique) finest independent decomposition (FID) of each reaction network and our comparative techniques include equilibria parametrizations (EP) and the newly developed methods of Common Reactions Equilibria (CORE) analysis and Concordance Profile (CP) analysis. Our investigation yields three interesting results concerning the equilibria sets of these models. Firstly, we explore the concept of absolute concentration robustness (ACR), wherein a system exhibits ACR in a specific species if the equilibrium value for that species is the same for any positive equilibrium. Through ACR analysis employing FID and EP, we observe that both the Schmitz and MacLean models lack ACR, whereas the Feinberg model demonstrates ACR in a single species. Second, our analyses using FID and CORE reveal important relationships within the equilibria sets of the augmented Schmitz and MacLean models. Furthermore, FID and CORE identify the lack of a substantial relationship between the equilibria sets of the Feinberg and MacLean models. Hence, these methods detect subtle differences between the Feinberg and MacLean models and also between the Schmitz and MacLean models, which are not evident in the standard reaction network analysis. Finally, based on the concordance levels, CP analysis indicates that the MacLean and Schmitz models are more similar than the MacLean and Feinberg models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain a global rigidity result for abelian partially hyperbolic higher rank actions on certain $2-$step nilmanifolds $X_{\Gamma}$. We show that, under certain natural assumptions, all such actions are $C^{\infty}-$conjugated to an affine model. As a consequence, we obtain a centralizer rigidity result, classifying all possible centralizers for any $C^{1}-$small perturbation of an irreducible, affine partially hyperbolic map on $X_{\Gamma}$. Along the way, we also prove two results of independent interest. We describe fibered partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms on $X_{\Gamma}$ and we show that topological conjugacies between partially hyperbolic actions and higher rank affine actions are $C^{\infty}$.</description>

      <title>Slow decay of correlations for generic mixing automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14585v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\psi(n)\to +0$ and a square-integrable function $f$ be non-zero, then for the typical mixing automorphism $T$ the set $\{n:\, |(T^nf,f) |&gt;\psi( n)\}$ is infinite. The mildly mixing automorphisms $T$ do not have convergences of non-zero averages $\frac 1 {k_n} \sum_{i=1}^{k_n}T^if (x)$ with the rate of $o\left(\frac 1 {k_n}\right)$.</description>

      <title>Measurable Imbeddings, Free Products, and Graph Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16446v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Measurable Imbeddability between groups, which is an order-like generalization of Measure Equivalence that allows the imbedded group to have an infinite measure fundamental domain. We prove if $\Lambda_1$ measurably imbeds into $\Gamma_1$, and $\Lambda_2$ measurably imbeds into $\Gamma_2$ under an additional assumption that lets the corresponding fundamental domains to be arranged in a special way, then $\Lambda_1 * \Lambda_2$ measurably imbeds into $\Gamma_1 * \Gamma_2$. Building upon the techniques we used, we show that the analogous result holds for graph products of groups.</description>
