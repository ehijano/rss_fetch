      <title>Nerve Models of Subdivision Bifiltrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the size of Sheehy's subdivision bifiltrations, up to homotopy. We focus in particular on the subdivision-Rips bifiltration $\mathcal{SR}(X)$ of a metric space $X$, the only density-sensitive bifiltration on metric spaces known to satisfy a strong robustness property. Given a simplicial filtration $\mathcal{F}$ with a total of $m$ maximal simplices across all indices, we introduce a nerve-based simplicial model for its subdivision bifiltration $\mathcal{SF}$ whose $k$-skeleton has size $O(m^{k+1})$. We also show that the $0$-skeleton of any simplicial model of $\mathcal{SF}$ has size at least $m$. We give several applications: For an arbitrary metric space $X$, we introduce a $\sqrt{2}$-approximation to $\mathcal{SR}(X)$, denoted $\mathcal{J}(X)$, whose $k$-skeleton has size $O(|X|^{k+2})$. This improves on the previous best approximation bound of $\sqrt{3}$, achieved by the degree-Rips bifiltration, which implies that $\mathcal{J}(X)$ is more robust than degree-Rips. Moreover, we show that the approximation factor of $\sqrt{2}$ is tight; in particular, there exists no exact model of $\mathcal{SR}(X)$ with poly-size skeleta. On the other hand, we show that for $X$ in a fixed-dimensional Euclidean space with the $\ell_p$-metric, there exists an exact model of $\mathcal{SR}(X)$ with poly-size skeleta for $p\in \{1, \infty\}$, as well as a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximation to $\mathcal{SR}(X)$ with poly-size skeleta for any $p \in (1, \infty)$ and fixed ${\epsilon &gt; 0}$.</description>

      <title>Relative nonhomogeneous Koszul duality for PROPs associated to nonaugmented operads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to show how Positselski's relative nonhomogeneous Koszul duality theory applies when studying the linear category underlying the PROP associated to a (non-augmented) operad of a certain form, in particular assuming that the reduced part of the operad is binary quadratic. In this case, the linear category has both a left augmentation and a right augmentation (corresponding to different units), using Positselski's terminology.
  The general theory provides two associated linear differential graded (DG) categories; indeed, in this framework, one can work entirely within the DG realm, as opposed to the curved setting required for Positselski's general theory. Moreover, DG modules over DG categories are related by adjunctions.
  When the reduced part of the operad is Koszul (working over a field of characteristic zero), the relative Koszul duality theory shows that there is a Koszul-type equivalence between the appropriate homotopy categories of DG modules. This gives a form of Koszul duality relationship between the above DG categories.
  This is illustrated by the case of the operad encoding unital, commutative associative algebras, extending the classical Koszul duality between commutative associative algebras and Lie algebras. In this case, the associated linear category is the linearization of the category of finite sets and all maps. The relative nonhomogeneous Koszul duality theory relates its derived category to the respective homotopy categories of modules over two explicit linear DG categories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we answer two questions of Buchanan-McKean (arXiv:2312.08209) about bordism for manifolds with spin$^h$ structures: we establish a Smith isomorphism between the reduced spin$^h$ bordism of $\mathbb{RP}^\infty$ and pin$^{h-}$ bordism, and we provide a geometric explanation for the isomorphism $\Omega_{4k}^{\mathrm{Spin}^c} \otimes\mathbb Z[1/2] \cong \Omega_{4k}^{\mathrm{Spin}^h} \otimes\mathbb Z[1/2]$. Our proofs use the general theory of twisted spin structures and Smith homomorphisms that we developed in arXiv:2405.04649 joint with Devalapurkar, Liu, Pacheco-Tallaj, and Thorngren, specifically that the Smith homomorphism participates in a long exact sequence with explicit, computable terms.</description>

      <title>Some Properties of the Plaquette Random-Cluster Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the $i$-dimensional plaqutte random-cluster model with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_q$ is dual to a $(d-i)$-dimensional plaquette random cluster model. In addition, we explore boundary conditions, infinite volume limits, and uniqueness for these models. For previously known results, we provide new proofs that rely more on the tools of algebraic topology.</description>

      <title>Local systems in diffeology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.13084v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By making use of Halperin's local systems over simplicial sets and the model structure of the category of diffeological spaces due to Kihara, we introduce a framework of rational homotopy theory for such smooth spaces with arbitrary fundamental groups. As a consequence, we have an equivalence between the homotopy categories of fibrewise rational diffeological spaces and an algebraic category of minimal local systems elaborated by G\'omez-Tato, Halperin and Tanr\'e. In the latter half of this article, a spectral sequence converging to the singular de Rham cohomology of a diffeological adjunction space is constructed with the pullback of relevant local systems. In case of a stratifold obtained by attaching manifolds, the spectral sequence converges to the Souriau--de Rham cohomology algebra of the diffeological space. By using the pullback construction, we also discuss a local system model for a topological homotopy pushout.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.14801v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a Quillen equivalence between the Kan-Quillen model structure and a model structure, derived from a cubical model of homotopy type theory, on the category of cartesian cubical sets with one connection. We thereby identify a second model structure which both constructively models homotopy type theory and presents infinity-groupoids, the first example being the equivariant cartesian model of Awodey-Cavallo-Coquand-Riehl-Sattler.</description>

      <title>Soft random simplicial complexes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13034v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$ can be obtained from the random geometric graph $G(n,r)$ by keeping every edge in $G(n,r)$ with probability $p$. This random graph is a particular case of the soft random graph model introduced by Penrose, in which the probability between 2 vertices is a function that depends on the distance between them. In this article, we define models for random simplicial complexes built over the soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$, which also present randomness in all other dimensions. Furthermore, we study the homology of those random simplicial complexes in different regimes of $n,r$, and $p$ by giving asymptotic formulas for the expectation of the Betti numbers in the sparser regimes, and bounds in the denser regimes.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dimensional Cohomological Phenomena in the Multiparametric Models of Random Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02573v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past two decades, extensive research has been conducted on the (co)homology of various models of random simplicial complexes. So far, it has always been examined merely as a list of groups. This paper expands upon this by describing both the ring structure and the Steenrod-algebra structure of the cohomology of the multiparametric models. For the lower model, we prove that the ring structure is always a.a.s trivial, while, for certain parameters, the Steenrod-algebra a.a.s acts non-trivially. This reveals that complex multi-dimensional topological structures appear as subcomplexes of this model. In contrast, we improve upon a result of Farber and Nowik, and assert that the cohomology of the upper multiparametric model is a.a.s concentrated in a single dimension.</description>

      <title>An obstruction theory for strictly commutative algebras in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is the first in a sequence of articles exploring the relationship between commutative algebras and $E_\infty$-algebras in characteristic $p$ and mixed characteristic. In this paper we lay the groundwork by defining a new class of cohomology operations over $\mathbb F_p$ called cotriple products, generalising Massey products. We compute the secondary cohomology operations for a strictly commutative dg-algebra and the obstruction theories these induce, constructing several counterexamples to characteristic 0 behaviour, one of which answers a question of Campos, Petersen, Robert-Nicoud and Wierstra. We construct some families of higher cotriple products and comment on their behaviour. Finally, we distingush a subclass of cotriple products that we call higher Steenrod operations and conclude with our main theorem, which says that $E_\infty$-algebras can be rectified if and only if the higher Steenrod operations vanish coherently.</description>

      <title>The Asymptotics of the Expected Betti Numbers of Preferential Attachment Clique Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.11259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.11259v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The preferential attachment model is a natural and popular random graph model for a growing network that contains very well-connected ``hubs''. We study the higher-order connectivity of such a network by investigating the topological properties of its clique complex. We concentrate on the expected Betti numbers, a sequence of topological invariants of the complex related to the numbers of holes of different dimensions. We determine the asymptotic growth rates of the expected Betti numbers, and prove that the expected Betti number at dimension 1 grows linearly fast, while those at higher dimensions grow sublinearly fast. Our theoretical results are illustrated by simulations. (Changes are made in this version to generalize Proposition 14 and to streamline proofs. These changes are shown in blue.)</description>

      <title>On P^1-stabilization in unstable motivic homotopy theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze stabilization with respect to ${\mathbb P}^1$ in the Morel--Voevodsky unstable motivic homotopy theory. We introduce a refined notion of cellularity (a.k.a., biconnectivity) in various motivic homotopy categories taking into account both the simplicial and Tate circles. Under suitable cellularity hypotheses, we refine the Whitehead theorem by showing that a map of nilpotent motivic spaces can be seen to be an equivalence if it so after taking (Voevodsky) motives. We then establish a version of the Freudenthal suspension theorem for ${\mathbb P}^1$-suspension, again under suitable cellularity hypotheses. As applications, we resolve Murthy's conjecture on splitting of corank $1$ vector bundles on smooth affine algebras over algebraically closed fields having characteristic $0$ and compute new unstable motivic homotopy of motivic spheres.</description>

      <title>Tautological classes and higher signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a bundle of oriented closed smooth $n$-manifolds $\pi: E \to X$, the tautological class $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k} (E) \in H^{4k-n}(X;\mathbb{Q})$ is defined by fibre integration of the Hirzebruch class $\mathcal{L}_k (T_v E)$ of the vertical tangent bundle. More generally, given a discrete group $G$, a class $u \in H^p(B G;\mathbb{Q})$ and a map $f:E \to B G$, one has tautological classes $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k ,u}(E,f) \in H^{4k+p-n}(X;\mathbb{Q})$ associated to the Novikov higher signatures.
  For odd $n$, it is well-known that $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k}(E)=0$ for all bundles with $n$-dimensional fibres. The aim of this note is to show that the question whether more generally $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k,u}(E,f)=0$ (for odd $n$) depends sensitively on the group $G$ and the class $u$.
  For example, given a nonzero cohomology class $u \in H^2 (B \pi_1 (\Sigma_g);\mathbb{Q})$ of a surface group, we show that always $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k,u}(E,f)=0$ if $g \geq 2$, whereas sometimes $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k,u}(E,f)\neq 0$ if $g=1$.
  The vanishing theorem is obtained by a generalization of the index-theoretic proof that $\kappa_{\mathcal{L}_k}(E)=0$, while the nontriviality theorem follows with little effort from the work of Galatius and Randal-Williams on diffeomorphism groups of even-dimensional manifolds.</description>
