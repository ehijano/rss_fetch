      <title>Physical synchronization of soft self-oscillating limbs for fast and autonomous locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animals achieve robust locomotion by offloading regulation from the brain to physical couplings within the body. Contrarily, locomotion in artificial systems often depends on centralized processors. Here, we introduce a rapid and autonomous locomotion strategy with synchronized gaits emerging through physical interactions between self-oscillating limbs and the environment, without control signals. Each limb is a single soft tube that only requires constant flow of air to perform cyclic stepping motions at frequencies reaching 300 hertz. By combining several of these self-oscillating limbs, their physical synchronization enables tethered and untethered locomotion speeds that are orders of magnitude faster than comparable state-of-the-art. We demonstrate that these seemingly simple devices exhibit autonomy, including obstacle avoidance and phototaxis, opening up avenues for robust and functional robots at all scales.</description>

      <title>Phase separation bursting and symmetry breaking inside an evaporating droplet; formation of a flower-like pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pattern formation inside a liquid phase is a phenomenon involved in many different aspects of life on our planet. The droplet form of a liquid that evaporates can reveal patterns that depend on the chemistry of the droplet and the physical parameters involved. We observed a flower-like deposition pattern of micrometer-sized particles as a result of the evaporation of a droplet containing salt and a non-ionic polymer. We show experimentally that the phase separation of the polymer due to the salting-out effect causes a strong entropic flow, which manifests as vortices. The flow is called phase separation bursting flow, which leads to the axial symmetry breaking and the formation of a radially aligned flower-like pattern. We foresee that understanding the observed flow can provide insights into the fluid physics aspects of phase separation and may have implications for technical applications.</description>

      <title>Programmable self-assembly of core-shell ellipsoids at liquid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ellipsoidal particles confined at liquid interfaces exhibit complex self-assembly behaviour due to quadrupolar capillary interactions induced by meniscus deformation. These interactions cause particles to attract each other in either tip-to-tip or side-to-side configurations. However, controlling their interfacial self-assembly is challenging because it is difficult to predict which of these two states will be preferred. In this study, we demonstrate that introducing a soft shell around hard ellipsoidal particles provides a means to control the self-assembly process, allowing us to switch the preferred configuration between these states. We study their interfacial self-assembly and find that pure ellipsoids without a shell consistently form a "chain-like" side-to-side assembly, regardless of aspect ratio. In contrast, core-shell ellipsoids transition from "flower-like" tip-to-tip to "chain-like" side-to-side arrangements as their aspect ratios increase. The critical aspect ratio for transitioning between these structures increases with shell-to-core ratios. Our experimental findings are corroborated by theoretical calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, which map out the phase diagram of thermodynamically preferred self-assembly structures for core-shell ellipsoids as a function of aspect ratio and shell-to-core ratios. This study shows how to program the self-assembly of anisotropic particles by tuning their physicochemical properties, allowing the deterministic realization of distinct structural configurations.</description>

      <title>Active Brownian particle under stochastic position and orientation resetting in a harmonic trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an exact analytical study of an Active Brownian Particle (ABP) subject to both position and orientation stochastic resetting in a two-dimensional harmonic trap. Utilizing a Fokker-Planck-based renewal approach, we derive the system's exact moments, including the mean parallel displacement, mean squared displacement (MSD), and the fourth-order moment of displacement, and compare these with numerical simulations. To capture deviations from Gaussian behavior, we analyze the excess kurtosis, which reveals rich dynamical crossovers over time. These transitions span from Gaussian behavior (zero excess kurtosis) to two distinct non-Gaussian regimes: an activity-dominated regime (negative excess kurtosis) and a resetting-dominated regime (positive excess kurtosis). Furthermore, we quantify the steady-state phase diagrams by varying three key control parameters: activity, resetting rate, and harmonic trap strength, using steady-state excess kurtosis as the primary metric.</description>

      <title>Flow is slow at the nanoscale: Revisiting the Green-Kubo relation for friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central aim of statistical mechanics is to establish connections between a system's microscopic fluctuations and its macroscopic response to a perturbation. For non-equilibrium transport properties, this amounts to establishing Green-Kubo (GK) relationships. In hydrodynamics, relating such GK expressions for liquid-solid friction to macroscopic slip boundary conditions has remained a long-standing problem due to two challenges: (i) The GK running integral of the force autocorrelation function decays to zero rather than reaching a well-defined plateau value; and (ii) debates persist on whether such a transport coefficient measures an intrinsic interfacial friction or an effective friction in the system. Inspired by ideas from the coarse-graining community, we derive a GK relation for liquid-solid friction where the force autocorrelation is sampled with a constraint of momentum conservation in the liquid. Our expression does not suffer from the "plateau problem" and unambiguously measures an effective friction coefficient, in an analogous manner to Stokes' law. We further establish a link between the derived friction coefficient and the hydrodynamic slip length, enabling a straightforward assessment of continuum hydrodynamics across length scales. We find that continuum hydrodynamics describes the simulation results quantitatively for confinement length all the way down to 1 nm. Our results also make clear that water flow under nano-confinement is orders of magnitude slower compared to the macroscopic case. Our approach amounts to a straightforward modification to the present standard method of quantifying interfacial friction from molecular simulations, making possible a sensible comparison between surfaces of vastly different slippage.</description>

      <title>Influence of particle size polydispersity on dynamical heterogeneities in dense particle packings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of dense particle packings near the jamming transition is characterized by correlated particle motion. The growth of dynamical heterogeneities, or strong spatial variations in the motion of the particles constituting the system, is a hallmark feature of slow glassy dynamics. We report here a systematic confocal microscopy study that characterizes the cooperative dynamics of fluorescently-labelled colloidal particles in dense aqueous suspensions. We demonstrate that jammed particulate suspensions can be fluidized by increasing the width of the particle size distribution. Our molecular dynamics simulations, performed to numerically investigate the effects of continuous-size polydispersity on dense particle packing dynamics, show an excellent match with our experimental results. Besides shedding light on the fundamental aspects of particle-scale dynamics at the jamming-unjamming transition, our findings are significant in the processing of commonly-encountered dense suspensions such as paints, cosmetics, and food.</description>

      <title>Phonons in stringlet-land and the boson peak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Solid materials that deviate from the harmonic crystal paradigm exhibit characteristic anomalies in the specific heat and vibrational density of states (VDOS) with respect to Debye's theory predictions. The boson peak (BP), a low-frequency excess in the VDOS over Debye law $g(\omega) \propto \omega^2$, is certainly the most famous among them; nevertheless, its origin is still subject of fierce debate. Recent simulation works provided strong evidence that localized one-dimensional string-like excitations (stringlets) might be the microscopic origin of the BP. In this work, we study the dynamics of acoustic phonons interacting with a bath of vibrating 1D stringlets with exponentially distributed size, as observed in simulations. We show that stringlets strongly renormalize the phonon propagator and naturally induce a BP anomaly in the vibrational density of states, corresponding to the emergence of a dispersionless BP flat mode. Additionally, phonon-stringlet interactions produce a strong enhancement of sound attenuation and a dip in the speed of sound near the BP frequency, consistent with experimental and simulation data. The qualitative trends of the BP frequency and intensity are predicted within the model and shown to be in good agreement with previous observations. In summary, our results substantiate with a simple theoretical model the recent simulation results by Hu and Tanaka claiming the origin of the BP from stringlet dynamics.</description>

      <title>Size-dependent fracture in elastomers: experiments and continuum modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19997v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elastomeric materials display a complicated set of stretchability and fracture properties that strongly depend on the flaw size, which has long been of interest to engineers and materials scientists. Here, we combine experiments and numerical simulations for a comprehensive understanding of the nonlocal, size-dependent features of fracture in elastomers. We show the size-dependent fracture behavior is quantitatively described through a nonlocal continuum model. The key ingredient of the nonlocal model is the use of an intrinsic length scale associated with a finite fracture process zone, which is inferred from experiments. Of particular importance, our experimental and theoretical approach passes the critical set of capturing key aspects of the size-dependent fracture in elastomers. Applications to a wide range of synthetic elastomers that exhibit moderate (~100%) to extreme stretchability (~1000%) are presented, which is also used to demonstrate the applicability of our approach in elastomeric specimens with complex geometries.</description>

      <title>Interface dynamics of wet active systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the roughening of interfaces in phase-separated active suspensions on substrates. At large length and timescales, we show that the interfacial dynamics belongs to the |q|KPZ universality class discussed in Besse et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 187102 (2023). This holds despite the presence of long-ranged fluid flows. At early times, instead, the roughening exponents are the same as those in the presence of a momentum-conserving fluid. Surprisingly, when the effect of substrate friction can be ignored, the interface becomes random beyond a de Gennes-Taupin lengthscale which depends on the interfacial tension.</description>

      <title>Periodic potential can enormously boost free particle transport induced by active fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01465v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active fluctuations are detected in a growing number of systems due to self-propulsion mechanisms or collisions with active environment. They drive the system far from equilibrium and can induce phenomena which at equilibrium states are forbidden by e.g. fluctuation-dissipation relations and detailed balance symmetry. Understanding of their role in living matter is emerging as a challenge for physics. Here we demonstrate a paradoxical effect in which a free particle transport induced by active fluctuations can be boosted by many orders of magnitude when the particle is additionally subjected to a periodic potential. In contrast, within the realm of only thermal fluctuations the velocity of a free particle exposed to a bias is reduced when the periodic potential is switched on. The presented mechanism is significant for understanding nonequilibrium environments such as living cells where it can explain from a fundamental point of view why spatially periodic structures known as microtubules are necessary to generate impressively effective intracellular transport. Our findings can be readily corroborated experimentally e.g. in a setup comprising a colloidal particle in an optically generated periodic potential.</description>
