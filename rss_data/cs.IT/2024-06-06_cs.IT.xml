      <title>Robust Communication and Computation using Deep Learning via Joint Uncertainty Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The convergence of communication and computation, along with the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence, stand as key empowering pillars for the sixth-generation of communication systems (6G). This paper considers a network of one base station serving a number of devices simultaneously using spatial multiplexing. The paper then presents an innovative deep learning-based approach to simultaneously manage the transmit and computing powers, alongside computation allocation, amidst uncertainties in both channel and computing states information. More specifically, the paper aims at proposing a robust solution that minimizes the worst-case delay across the served devices subject to computation and power constraints. The paper uses a deep neural network (DNN)-based solution that maps estimated channels and computation requirements to optimized resource allocations. During training, uncertainty samples are injected after the DNN output to jointly account for both communication and computation estimation errors. The DNN is then trained via backpropagation using the robust utility, thus implicitly learning the uncertainty distributions. Our results validate the enhanced robust delay performance of the joint uncertainty injection versus the classical DNN approach, especially in high channel and computational uncertainty regimes.</description>

      <title>New MDS codes of non-GRS type and NMDS codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maximum distance separable (MDS) and near maximum distance separable (NMDS) codes have been widely used in various fields such as communication systems, data storage, and quantum codes due to their algebraic properties and excellent error-correcting capabilities. This paper focuses on a specific class of linear codes and establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for them to be MDS or NMDS. Additionally, we employ the well-known Schur method to demonstrate that they are non-equivalent to generalized Reed-Solomon codes.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Multi-User Semantic Communication via Transfer Learning and Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication, notable for ensuring quality of service by jointly optimizing source and channel coding, effectively extracts data semantics, reduces transmission length, and mitigates channel noise. However, most studies overlook multi-user scenarios and resource availability, limiting real-world application. This paper addresses this gap by focusing on downlink communication from a base station to multiple users with varying computing capacities. Users employ variants of Swin transformer models for source decoding and a simple architecture for channel decoding. We propose a novel training regimen, incorporating transfer learning and knowledge distillation to improve low-computing users' performance. Extensive simulations validate the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Determining the Weight Spectrum of the Reed--Muller Codes RM(m-6,m)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The weight spectra of the Reed-Muller codes $RM(r,m)$ were unknown for $r=3,...,m-5$. In IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory 2024, Carlet determined the weight spectrum of $RM(m-5,m)$ for $m\ge10$ using the Maiorana-McFarland construction, where the result was tried to be extended to $RM(m-6,m)$, but many problems occurred and much work needed to be done. In this paper, we propose a novel way of constructing Reed--Muller codewords and determine the weight spectrum of $RM(m-6,m)$ for $m\ge12$, which gives a positive answer to an open question on the weight spectrum of $RM(m-c,m)$ for $c=6$. Moreover, we put forward a conjecture and verify it for some cases. If the conjecture is true, then that open question can be completely solved.</description>

      <title>MSE-Based Training and Transmission Optimization for MIMO ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system under typical block-fading channels. As a non-trivial extension to most existing works on ISAC, both the training and transmission signals sent by the ISAC transmitter are exploited for sensing. Specifically, we develop two training and transmission design schemes to minimize a weighted sum of the mean-squared errors (MSEs) of data transmission and radar target response matrix (TRM) estimation. For the former, we first optimize the training signal for simultaneous communication channel and radar TRM estimation. Then, based on the estimated instantaneous channel state information (CSI), we propose an efficient majorization-minimization (MM)-based robust ISAC transmission design, where a semi-closed form solution is obtained in each iteration. For the second scheme, the ISAC transmitter is assumed to have statistical CSI only for reducing the feedback overhead. With CSI statistics available, we integrate the training and transmission design into one single problem and propose an MM-based alternating algorithm to find a high-quality solution. In addition, we provide alternative structured and low-complexity solutions for both schemes under certain special cases. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the radar performance is significantly improved compared to the existing scheme that integrates sensing into the transmission stage only. Moreover, it is verified that the investigated two schemes have advantages in terms of communication and sensing performances, respectively.</description>

      <title>The {\alpha}-Lomax Distribution: A Compound Channel Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose the {\alpha}-Lomax distribution as a new compound fading channel model. This new distribution generalizes the recently introduced Lomax fading channel model. It is worth noting that the Lomax distribution is a decreasing function, while the {\alpha}-Lomax is a unimodal function, offering greater flexibility in modeling wireless fading channels. In particular, we derive closed-form expressions for the probability density function and cumulative distribution function for the instantaneous signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Additionally, we provide closed-form expressions for several fundamental performance metrics, including outage probability, average bit error rate, and channel capacity. Furthermore, we derive closed-form expression for the average block-length error rate in short-packet communications. Moreover, we fit the PDF of the proposed channel model to empirical data obtained from a device-to-device communication system. We also offer simple and accurate approximations for these expressions in the high SNR regime.</description>

      <title>Coding Over Coupon Collector Channels for Combinatorial Motif-Based DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Encoding information in combinations of pre-synthesised deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) strands (referred to as motifs) is an interesting approach to DNA storage that could potentially circumvent the prohibitive costs of nucleotide-by-nucleotide DNA synthesis. Based on our analysis of an empirical data set from HelixWorks, we propose two channel models for this setup (with and without interference) and analyse their fundamental limits. We propose a coding scheme that approaches those limits by leveraging all information available at the output of the channel, in contrast to earlier schemes developed for a similar setup by Preuss et al. We highlight an important connection between channel capacity curves and the fundamental trade-off between synthesis (writing) and sequencing (reading), and offer a way to mitigate an exponential growth in decoding complexity with the size of the motif library.</description>

      <title>TSpec-LLM: An Open-source Dataset for LLM Understanding of 3GPP Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding telecom standards involves sorting through numerous technical documents, such as those produced by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. While large language models (LLMs) can assist with the extensive 3GPP knowledge base, an inclusive dataset is crucial for their effective pre-training and fine-tuning. In this paper, we introduce \textit{TSpec-LLM}, an open-source comprehensive dataset covering all 3GPP documents from Release 8 to Release 19 (1999--2023). To evaluate its efficacy, we first select a representative sample of 3GPP documents, create corresponding technical questions, and assess the baseline performance of various LLMs. We then incorporate a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework to enhance LLM capabilities by retrieving relevant context from the \textit{TSpec-LLM} dataset. Our evaluation shows that using a naive-RAG framework on \textit{TSpec-LLM} improves the accuracy of GPT-3.5, Gemini 1.0 Pro, and GPT-4 from 44\%, 46\%, and 51\% to 71\%, 75\%, and 72\%, respectively.</description>

      <title>Ensembling Portfolio Strategies for Long-Term Investments: A Distribution-Free Preference Framework for Decision-Making and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of ensembling multiple strategies for sequential portfolios to outperform individual strategies in terms of long-term wealth. Due to the uncertainty of strategies' performances in the future market, which are often based on specific models and statistical assumptions, investors often mitigate risk and enhance robustness by combining multiple strategies, akin to common approaches in collective learning prediction. However, the absence of a distribution-free and consistent preference framework complicates decisions of combination due to the ambiguous objective. To address this gap, we introduce a novel framework for decision-making in combining strategies, irrespective of market conditions, by establishing the investor's preference between decisions and then forming a clear objective. Through this framework, we propose a combinatorial strategy construction, free from statistical assumptions, for any scale of component strategies, even infinite, such that it meets the determined criterion. Finally, we test the proposed strategy along with its accelerated variant and some other multi-strategies. The numerical experiments show results in favor of the proposed strategies, albeit with small tradeoffs in their Sharpe ratios, in which their cumulative wealths eventually exceed those of the best component strategies while the accelerated strategy significantly improves performance.</description>

      <title>Untrained Neural Nets for Snapshot Compressive Imaging: Theory and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) recovers high-dimensional (3D) data cubes from a single 2D measurement, enabling diverse applications like video and hyperspectral imaging to go beyond standard techniques in terms of acquisition speed and efficiency. In this paper, we focus on SCI recovery algorithms that employ untrained neural networks (UNNs), such as deep image prior (DIP), to model source structure. Such UNN-based methods are appealing as they have the potential of avoiding the computationally intensive retraining required for different source models and different measurement scenarios. We first develop a theoretical framework for characterizing the performance of such UNN-based methods. The theoretical framework, on the one hand, enables us to optimize the parameters of data-modulating masks, and on the other hand, provides a fundamental connection between the number of data frames that can be recovered from a single measurement to the parameters of the untrained NN. We also employ the recently proposed bagged-deep-image-prior (bagged-DIP) idea to develop SCI Bagged Deep Video Prior (SCI-BDVP) algorithms that address the common challenges faced by standard UNN solutions. Our experimental results show that in video SCI our proposed solution achieves state-of-the-art among UNN methods, and in the case of noisy measurements, it even outperforms supervised solutions.</description>

      <title>Privacy Preserving Semi-Decentralized Mean Estimation over Intermittently-Connected Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of privately estimating the mean of vectors distributed across different nodes of an unreliable wireless network, where communications between nodes can fail intermittently. We adopt a semi-decentralized setup, wherein to mitigate the impact of intermittently connected links, nodes can collaborate with their neighbors to compute a local consensus, which they relay to a central server. In such a setting, the communications between any pair of nodes must ensure that the privacy of the nodes is rigorously maintained to prevent unauthorized information leakage. We study the tradeoff between collaborative relaying and privacy leakage due to the data sharing among nodes and, subsequently, propose PriCER: Private Collaborative Estimation via Relaying -- a differentially private collaborative algorithm for mean estimation to optimize this tradeoff. The privacy guarantees of PriCER arise (i) implicitly, by exploiting the inherent stochasticity of the flaky network connections, and (ii) explicitly, by adding Gaussian perturbations to the estimates exchanged by the nodes. Local and central privacy guarantees are provided against eavesdroppers who can observe different signals, such as the communications amongst nodes during local consensus and (possibly multiple) transmissions from the relays to the central server. We substantiate our theoretical findings with numerical simulations. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/rajarshisaha95/private-collaborative-relaying.</description>

      <title>Predictability Analysis of Regression Problems via Conditional Entropy Estimations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of machine learning, regression problems are pivotal due to their ability to predict continuous outcomes. Traditional error metrics like mean squared error, mean absolute error, and coefficient of determination measure model accuracy. The model accuracy is the consequence of the selected model and the features, which blurs the analysis of contribution. Predictability, in the other hand, focus on the predictable level of a target variable given a set of features. This study introduces conditional entropy estimators to assess predictability in regression problems, bridging this gap. We enhance and develop reliable conditional entropy estimators, particularly the KNIFE-P estimator and LMC-P estimator, which offer under- and over-estimation, providing a practical framework for predictability analysis. Extensive experiments on synthesized and real-world datasets demonstrate the robustness and utility of these estimators. Additionally, we extend the analysis to the coefficient of determination \(R^2 \), enhancing the interpretability of predictability. The results highlight the effectiveness of KNIFE-P and LMC-P in capturing the achievable performance and limitations of feature sets, providing valuable tools in the development of regression models. These indicators offer a robust framework for assessing the predictability for regression problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intersecting codes are linear codes where every two nonzero codewords have non-trivially intersecting support. In this article we expand on the theory of this family of codes, by showing that nondegenerate intersecting codes correspond to sets of points (with multiplicites) in a projective space that are not contained in two hyperplanes. This correspondence allows the use of geometric arguments to demonstrate properties and provide constructions of intersecting codes. We improve on existing bounds on their length and provide explicit constructions of short intersecting codes. Finally, generalizing a link between coding theory and the theory of the Davenport constant (a combinatorial invariant of finite abelian groups), we provide new asymptotic bounds on the weighted $2$-wise Davenport constant. These bounds then yield results on factorizations in rings of algebraic integers and related structures.</description>

      <title>Digital Twin Aided RIS Communication: Robust Beamforming and Interference Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) are envisioned to play a key role in future wireless communication networks. However, channel estimation in RIS-aided wireless networks is challenging due to their passive nature and the large number of reflective elements, leading to high channel estimation overhead. Additionally, conventional methods like beam sweeping, which do not rely on explicit channel state information, often struggle in managing interference in multi-user networks. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages digital twins (DTs) of the physical environments to approximate channels using electromagnetic 3D models and ray tracing, thus relaxing the need for channel estimation and extensive over-the-air computations in RIS-aided wireless networks. To address the digital twins channel approximation errors, we further refine this approach with a DT-specific robust transmission design that reliably meets minimum desired rates. The results show that our method secures these rates over 90% of the time, significantly outperforming beam sweeping, which achieves these rates less than 8% of the time due to its poor management of transmitting power and interference.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Characterization of Wireless Channels Conditioned on Side Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Statistical prior channel knowledge, such as the wide-sense-stationary-uncorrelated-scattering (WSSUS) property, and additional side information both can be used to enhance physical layer applications in wireless communication. Generally, the wireless channel's strongly fluctuating path phases and WSSUS property characterize the channel by a zero mean and Toeplitz-structured covariance matrices in different domains. In this work, we derive a framework to comprehensively categorize side information based on whether it preserves or abandons these statistical features conditioned on the given side information. To accomplish this, we combine insights from a generic channel model with the representation of wireless channels as probabilistic graphs. Additionally, we exemplify several applications, ranging from channel modeling to estimation and clustering, which demonstrate how the proposed framework can practically enhance physical layer methods utilizing machine learning (ML).</description>

Abstract: Suppose that $P$ is a property that may be satisfied by a random code $C \subset \Sigma^n$. For example, for some $p \in (0,1)$, ${P}$ might be the property that there exist three elements of $C$ that lie in some Hamming ball of radius $pn$. We say that $R^*$ is the threshold rate for ${P}$ if a random code of rate $R^* + \epsilon$ is very likely to satisfy ${P}$, while a random code of rate $R^* - \epsilon$ is very unlikely to satisfy ${P}$. While random codes are well-studied in coding theory, even the threshold rates for relatively simple properties like the one above are not well understood.
  We characterize threshold rates for a rich class of properties. These properties, like the example above, are defined by the inclusion of specific sets of codewords which are also suitably "symmetric". For properties in this class, we show that the threshold rate is in fact equal to the lower bound that a simple first-moment calculation obtains. Our techniques not only pin down the threshold rate for the property ${P}$ above, they give sharp bounds on the threshold rate for list-recovery in several parameter regimes, as well as an efficient algorithm for estimating the threshold rates for list-recovery in general.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hamming weights and minimal shifts of Orlik-Terao algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note we show that the minimum distance of a linear code equals one plus the smallest shift in the first step of the minimal graded free resolution of the Orlik-Terao algebra (i.e., the initial degree of the Orlik-Tearo ideal) constructed from any parity-check matrix of the linear code. We move forward with this connection and we prove that the second generalized Hamming weight equals one or two plus the smallest shift at second step in the minimal graded free resolution of the same algebra. Via a couple of examples we show that this ambivalence is the best result one can get if one uses Orlik-Terao algebras to characterize the second generalized Hamming weight.</description>

      <title>Optimal 1-bit Error Exponent for 2-hop Relaying with Binary-Input Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of relaying a single bit over a tandem of binary-input channels, with the goal of attaining the highest possible error exponent in the exponentially decaying error probability. Our previous work gave an exact characterization of the best possible error exponent in various special cases, including when the two channels are identical, but the general case was left as an open problem. We resolve this open problem by deriving a new converse bound that matches our existing achievability bound.</description>

      <title>An algebraic characterization of binary CSS-T codes and cyclic CSS-T codes for quantum fault tolerance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CSS-T codes were recently introduced as quantum error-correcting codes that respect a transversal gate. A CSS-T code depends on a CSS-T pair, which is a pair of binary codes $(C_1, C_2)$ such that $C_1$ contains $C_2$, $C_2$ is even, and the shortening of the dual of $C_1$ with respect to the support of each codeword of $C_2$ is self-dual. In this paper, we give new conditions to guarantee that a pair of binary codes $(C_1, C_2)$ is a CSS-T pair. We define the poset of CSS-T pairs and determine the minimal and maximal elements of the poset. We provide a propagation rule for nondegenerate CSS-T codes. We apply some main results to Reed-Muller, cyclic, and extended cyclic codes. We characterize CSS-T pairs of cyclic codes in terms of the defining cyclotomic cosets. We find cyclic and extended cyclic codes to obtain quantum codes with better parameters than those in the literature.</description>

      <title>Punctured Low-Bias Codes Behave Like Random Linear Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.11725v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random linear codes are a workhorse in coding theory, and are used to show the existence of codes with the best known or even near-optimal trade-offs in many noise models. However, they have little structure besides linearity, and are not amenable to tractable error-correction algorithms.
  In this work, we prove a general derandomization result applicable to random linear codes. Namely, in settings where the coding-theoretic property of interest is "local" (in the sense of forbidding certain bad configurations involving few vectors -- code distance and list-decodability being notable examples), one can replace random linear codes (RLCs) with a significantly derandomized variant with essentially no loss in parameters. Specifically, instead of randomly sampling coordinates of the (long) Hadamard code (which is an equivalent way to describe RLCs), one can randomly sample coordinates of any code with low bias. Over large alphabets, the low bias requirement can be weakened to just large distance. Furthermore, large distance suffices even with a small alphabet in order to match the current best known bounds for RLC list-decodability.
  In particular, by virtue of our result, all current (and future) achievability bounds for list-decodability of random linear codes extend automatically to random puncturings of any low-bias (or large alphabet) "mother" code. We also show that our punctured codes emulate the behavior of RLCs on stochastic channels, thus giving a derandomization of RLCs in the context of achieving Shannon capacity as well. Thus, we have a randomness-efficient way to sample codes achieving capacity in both worst-case and stochastic settings that can further inherit algebraic or other algorithmically useful structural properties of the mother code.</description>

      <title>Join Size Bounds using Lp-Norms on Degree Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14075v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the output size of a query is a fundamental yet longstanding problem in database query processing. Traditional cardinality estimators used by database systems can routinely underestimate the true output size by orders of magnitude, which leads to significant system performance penalty. Recently, upper bounds have been proposed that are based on information inequalities and incorporate sizes and max-degrees from input relations, yet they their main benefit is limited to cyclic queries, because they degenerate to rather trivial formulas on acyclic queries.
  We introduce a significant extension of the upper bounds, by incorporating $\ell_p$-norms of the degree sequences of join attributes. Our bounds are significantly lower than previously known bounds, even when applied to acyclic queries. These bounds are also based on information theory, they come with a matching query evaluation algorithm, are computable in exponential time in the query size, and are provably tight when all degrees are "simple".</description>

      <title>Degree Heterogeneity in Higher-Order Networks: Inference in the Hypergraph $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02818v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-model for random graphs is commonly used for representing pairwise interactions in a network with degree heterogeneity. Going beyond pairwise interactions, Stasi et al. (2014) introduced the hypergraph $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-model for capturing degree heterogeneity in networks with higher-order (multi-way) interactions. In this paper we initiate the rigorous study of the hypergraph $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-model with multiple layers, which allows for hyperedges of different sizes across the layers. To begin with, we derive the rates of convergence of the maximum likelihood (ML) estimate and establish their minimax rate optimality. We also derive the limiting distribution of the ML estimate and construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals for the model parameters. Next, we consider the goodness-of-fit problem in the hypergraph $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-model. Specifically, we establish the asymptotic normality of the likelihood ratio (LR) test under the null hypothesis, derive its detection threshold, and also its limiting power at the threshold. Interestingly, the detection threshold of the LR test turns out to be minimax optimal, that is, all tests are asymptotically powerless below this threshold. The theoretical results are further validated in numerical experiments. In addition to developing the theoretical framework for estimation and inference for hypergraph $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-models, the above results fill a number of gaps in the graph $\boldsymbol{\beta}$-model literature, such as the minimax optimality of the ML estimates and the non-null properties of the LR test, which, to the best of our knowledge, have not been studied before.</description>

      <title>The Rate-Distortion-Perception-Classification Tradeoff: Joint Source Coding and Modulation via Inverse-Domain GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14792v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework leverages deep learning to learn from data the best codes for source and channel coding. When the output signal, rather than being binary, is directly mapped onto the IQ domain (complex-valued), we call the resulting framework joint source coding and modulation (JSCM). We consider a JSCM scenario and show the existence of a strict tradeoff between channel rate, distortion, perception, and classification accuracy, a tradeoff that we name RDPC. We then propose two image compression methods to navigate that tradeoff: the RDPCO algorithm which, under simple assumptions, directly solves the optimization problem characterizing the tradeoff, and an algorithm based on an inverse-domain generative adversarial network (ID-GAN), which is more general and achieves extreme compression. Simulation results corroborate the theoretical findings, showing that both algorithms exhibit the RDPC tradeoff. They also demonstrate that the proposed ID-GAN algorithm effectively balances image distortion, perception, and classification accuracy, and significantly outperforms traditional separation-based methods and recent deep JSCM architectures in terms of one or more of these metrics.</description>

      <title>Learning Regularities from Data using Spiking Functions: A Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep neural networks trained in an end-to-end manner are proven to be efficient in a wide range of machine learning tasks. However, there is one drawback of end-to-end learning: The learned features and information are implicitly represented in neural network parameters, which cannot be used as regularities, concepts or knowledge to explicitly represent the data probability distribution. To resolve this issue, we propose in this paper a new machine learning theory, which defines in mathematics what are regularities. Briefly, regularities are concise representations of the non-random features, or 'non-randomness' in the data probability distribution. Combining this with information theory, we claim that regularities can also be regarded as a small amount of information encoding a large amount of information. Our theory is based on spiking functions. That is, if a function can react to, or spike on specific data samples more frequently than random noise inputs, we say that such a function discovers non-randomness from the data distribution. Also, we say that the discovered non-randomness is encoded into regularities if the function is simple enough. Our theory also discusses applying multiple spiking functions to the same data distribution. In this process, we claim that the 'best' regularities, or the optimal spiking functions, are those who can capture the largest amount of information from the data distribution, and then encode the captured information in the most concise way. Theorems and hypotheses are provided to describe in mathematics what are 'best' regularities and optimal spiking functions. Finally, we propose a machine learning approach, which can potentially obtain the optimal spiking functions regarding the given dataset in practice.</description>
