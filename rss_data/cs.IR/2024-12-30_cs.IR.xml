      <title>Position-aware Graph Transformer for Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collaborative recommendation fundamentally involves learning high-quality user and item representations from interaction data. Recently, graph convolution networks (GCNs) have advanced the field by utilizing high-order connectivity patterns in interaction graphs, as evidenced by state-of-the-art methods like PinSage and LightGCN. However, one key limitation has not been well addressed in existing solutions: capturing long-range collaborative filtering signals, which are crucial for modeling user preference. In this work, we propose a new graph transformer (GT) framework -- \textit{Position-aware Graph Transformer for Recommendation} (PGTR), which combines the global modeling capability of Transformer blocks with the local neighborhood feature extraction of GCNs. The key insight is to explicitly incorporate node position and structure information from the user-item interaction graph into GT architecture via several purpose-designed positional encodings. The long-range collaborative signals from the Transformer block are then combined linearly with the local neighborhood features from the GCN backbone to enhance node embeddings for final recommendations. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PGTR method when implemented on various GCN-based backbones across four real-world datasets, and the robustness against interaction sparsity as well as noise.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Self-supervised Learning for Social Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, researchers have attempted to exploit social relations to improve the performance in recommendation systems. Generally, most existing social recommendation methods heavily depends on substantial domain knowledge and expertise in primary recommendation tasks for designing useful auxiliary tasks. Meanwhile, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) recently has received considerable attention in the field of recommendation, since it can provide self-supervision signals in assisting the improvement of target recommendation systems by constructing self-supervised auxiliary tasks from raw data without human-annotated labels. Despite the great success, these SSL-based social recommendations are insufficient to adaptively balance various self-supervised auxiliary tasks, since assigning equal weights on various auxiliary tasks can result in sub-optimal recommendation performance, where different self-supervised auxiliary tasks may contribute differently to improving the primary social recommendation across different datasets. To address this issue, in this work, we propose Adaptive Self-supervised Learning for Social Recommendations (AdasRec) by taking advantage of various self-supervised auxiliary tasks. More specifically, an adaptive weighting mechanism is proposed to learn adaptive weights for various self-supervised auxiliary tasks, so as to balance the contribution of such self-supervised auxiliary tasks for enhancing representation learning in social recommendations. The adaptive weighting mechanism is used to assign different weights on auxiliary tasks to achieve an overall weighting of the entire auxiliary tasks and ultimately assist the primary recommendation task, achieved by a meta learning optimization problem with an adaptive weighting network. Comprehensive experiments on various real-world datasets are constructed to verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of Generative Information Retrieval Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative information retrieval methods retrieve documents by directly generating their identifiers. Much effort has been devoted to developing effective generative IR models. Less attention has been paid to the robustness of these models. It is critical to assess the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization of generative IR models, i.e., how would such models generalize to new distributions? To answer this question, we focus on OOD scenarios from four perspectives in retrieval problems: (i)query variations; (ii)unseen query types; (iii)unseen tasks; and (iv)corpus expansion. Based on this taxonomy, we conduct empirical studies to analyze the OOD robustness of representative generative IR models against dense retrieval models. Our empirical results indicate that the OOD robustness of generative IR models is in need of improvement. By inspecting the OOD robustness of generative IR models we aim to contribute to the development of more reliable IR models. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/Davion-Liu/GR_OOD}.</description>

      <title>Attack-in-the-Chain: Bootstrapping Large Language Models for Attacks Against Black-box Neural Ranking Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural ranking models (NRMs) have been shown to be highly effective in terms of retrieval performance. Unfortunately, they have also displayed a higher degree of sensitivity to attacks than previous generation models. To help expose and address this lack of robustness, we introduce a novel ranking attack framework named Attack-in-the-Chain, which tracks interactions between large language models (LLMs) and NRMs based on chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to generate adversarial examples under black-box settings. Our approach starts by identifying anchor documents with higher ranking positions than the target document as nodes in the reasoning chain. We then dynamically assign the number of perturbation words to each node and prompt LLMs to execute attacks. Finally, we verify the attack performance of all nodes at each reasoning step and proceed to generate the next reasoning step. Empirical results on two web search benchmarks show the effectiveness of our method.</description>

      <title>Musings About the Future of Search: A Return to the Past?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When you have a question, the most effective way to have the question answered is to directly connect with experts on the topic and have a conversation with them. Prior to the invention of writing, this was the only way. Although effective, this solution exhibits scalability challenges. Writing allowed knowledge to be materialized, preserved, and replicated, enabling the development of different technologies over the centuries to connect information seekers with relevant information. This progression ultimately culminated in the ten-blue-links web search paradigm we're familiar with, just before the recent emergence of generative AI. However, we often forget that consuming static content is an imperfect solution. With the advent of large language models, it has become possible to develop a superior experience by allowing users to directly engage with experts. These interactions can of course satisfy information needs, but expert models can do so much more. This coming future requires reimagining search.</description>

      <title>Don't Lose Yourself: Boosting Multimodal Recommendation via Reducing Node-neighbor Discrepancy in Graph Convolutional Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of multimedia contents has led to the emergence of multimodal recommendation systems. It has attracted increasing attention in recommendation systems because its full utilization of data from different modalities alleviates the persistent data sparsity problem. As such, multimodal recommendation models can learn personalized information about nodes in terms of visual and textual. To further alleviate the data sparsity problem, some previous works have introduced graph convolutional networks (GCNs) for multimodal recommendation systems, to enhance the semantic representation of users and items by capturing the potential relationships between them. However, adopting GCNs inevitably introduces the over-smoothing problem, which make nodes to be too similar. Unfortunately, incorporating multimodal information will exacerbate this challenge because nodes that are too similar will lose the personalized information learned through multimodal information. To address this problem, we propose a novel model that retains the personalized information of ego nodes during feature aggregation by Reducing Node-neighbor Discrepancy (RedN^nD). Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that RedN^nD achieves state-of-the-art performance on accuracy and robustness, with significant improvements over existing GCN-based multimodal frameworks.</description>

      <title>Jasper and Stella: distillation of SOTA embedding models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A crucial component of many deep learning applications (such as FAQ and RAG) is dense retrieval, in which embedding models are used to convert raw text to numerical vectors and then get the most similar text by MIPS (Maximum Inner Product Search). Some text embedding benchmarks (e.g. MTEB, BEIR, and AIR-Bench) have been established to evaluate embedding models accurately. Thanks to these benchmarks, we can use SOTA models; however, the deployment and application of these models in industry were hampered by their large vector dimensions and numerous parameters. To alleviate this problem, 1) we present a distillation technique that can enable a smaller student model to achieve good performance. 2) Inspired by MRL we present a training approach of reducing the vector dimensions based on its own vectors or its teacher vectors. 3) We do simple yet effective alignment training between images and text to make our model a multimodal encoder. We trained Stella and Jasper models using the technologies above and achieved high scores on the MTEB leaderboard. We release the model and data at Hugging Face Hub (https://huggingface.co/infgrad/jasper_en_vision_language_v1) and the training logs are at https://api.wandb.ai/links/dunnzhang0/z8jqoqpb.</description>

      <title>Towards Popularity-Aware Recommendation: A Multi-Behavior Enhanced Framework with Orthogonality Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Top-$K$ recommendation involves inferring latent user preferences and generating personalized recommendations accordingly, which is now ubiquitous in various decision systems. Nonetheless, recommender systems usually suffer from severe \textit{popularity bias}, leading to the over-recommendation of popular items. Such a bias deviates from the central aim of reflecting user preference faithfully, compromising both customer satisfaction and retailer profits. Despite the prevalence, existing methods tackling popularity bias still have limitations due to the considerable accuracy-debias tradeoff and the sensitivity to extensive parameter selection, further exacerbated by the extreme sparsity in positive user-item interactions.
  In this paper, we present a \textbf{Pop}ularity-aware top-$K$ recommendation algorithm integrating multi-behavior \textbf{S}ide \textbf{I}nformation (PopSI), aiming to enhance recommendation accuracy and debias performance simultaneously. Specifically, by leveraging multiple user feedback that mirrors similar user preferences and formulating it as a three-dimensional tensor, PopSI can utilize all slices to capture the desiring user preferences effectively. Subsequently, we introduced a novel orthogonality constraint to refine the estimated item feature space, enforcing it to be invariant to item popularity features thereby addressing our model's sensitivity to popularity bias. Comprehensive experiments on real-world e-commerce datasets demonstrate the general improvements of PopSI over state-of-the-art debias methods with a marginal accuracy-debias tradeoff and scalability to practical applications. The source code for our algorithm and experiments is available at \url{https://github.com/Eason-sys/PopSI}.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Multi-Stage Language Models for Effective Text Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient text retrieval is critical for applications such as legal document analysis, particularly in specialized contexts like Japanese legal systems. Existing retrieval methods often underperform in such domain-specific scenarios, necessitating tailored approaches. In this paper, we introduce a novel two-phase text retrieval pipeline optimized for Japanese legal datasets. Our method leverages advanced language models to achieve state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving retrieval efficiency and accuracy. To further enhance robustness and adaptability, we incorporate an ensemble model that integrates multiple retrieval strategies, resulting in superior outcomes across diverse tasks. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating strong performance on both Japanese legal datasets and widely recognized benchmarks like MS-MARCO. Our work establishes new standards for text retrieval in domain-specific and general contexts, providing a comprehensive solution for addressing complex queries in legal and multilingual environments.</description>

      <title>RecLM: Recommendation Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern recommender systems aim to deeply understand users' complex preferences through their past interactions. While deep collaborative filtering approaches using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at capturing user-item relationships, their effectiveness is limited when handling sparse data or zero-shot scenarios, primarily due to constraints in ID-based embedding functions. To address these challenges, we propose a model-agnostic recommendation instruction-tuning paradigm that seamlessly integrates large language models with collaborative filtering. Our proposed Recommendation Language Model (RecLM) enhances the capture of user preference diversity through a carefully designed reinforcement learning reward function that facilitates self-augmentation of language models. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate significant advantages of our approach across various settings, and its plug-and-play compatibility with state-of-the-art recommender systems results in notable performance enhancements.</description>

      <title>From Interets to Insights: An LLM Approach to Course Recommendations Using Natural Language Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most universities in the United States encourage their students to explore academic areas before declaring a major and to acquire academic breadth by satisfying a variety of requirements. Each term, students must choose among many thousands of offerings, spanning dozens of subject areas, a handful of courses to take. The curricular environment is also dynamic, and poor communication and search functions on campus can limit a student's ability to discover new courses of interest. To support both students and their advisers in such a setting, we explore a novel Large Language Model (LLM) course recommendation system that applies a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) method to the corpus of course descriptions. The system first generates an 'ideal' course description based on the user's query. This description is converted into a search vector using embeddings, which is then used to find actual courses with similar content by comparing embedding similarities. We describe the method and assess the quality and fairness of some example prompts. Steps to deploy a pilot system on campus are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of the information explosion era, the importance of recommendation systems in various applications is increasingly significant. Traditional collaborative filtering algorithms are widely used due to their effectiveness in capturing user behavior patterns, but they encounter limitations when dealing with cold start problems and data sparsity. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong natural language understanding and generation capabilities, provide a new breakthrough for recommendation systems. This study proposes an enhanced recommendation method that combines collaborative filtering and LLMs, aiming to leverage collaborative filtering's advantage in modeling user preferences while enhancing the understanding of textual information about users and items through LLMs to improve recommendation accuracy and diversity. This paper first introduces the fundamental theories of collaborative filtering and LLMs, then designs a recommendation system architecture that integrates both, and validates the system's effectiveness through experiments. The results show that the hybrid model based on collaborative filtering and LLMs significantly improves precision, recall, and user satisfaction, demonstrating its potential in complex recommendation scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) and the growing demand for personalized content, recommendation systems have become critical in enhancing user experience and driving engagement. Collaborative filtering algorithms, being core to many recommendation systems, have garnered significant attention for their efficiency and interpretability. However, traditional collaborative filtering approaches face numerous challenges when integrated into large-scale LLM-based systems, including high computational costs, severe data sparsity, cold start problems, and lack of scalability. This paper investigates the optimization and scalability of collaborative filtering algorithms in large language models, addressing these limitations through advanced optimization strategies. Firstly, we analyze the fundamental principles of collaborative filtering algorithms and their limitations when applied in LLM-based contexts. Next, several optimization techniques such as matrix factorization, approximate nearest neighbor search, and parallel computing are proposed to enhance computational efficiency and model accuracy. Additionally, strategies such as distributed architecture and model compression are explored to facilitate dynamic updates and scalability in data-intensive environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computational music research plays a critical role in advancing music production, distribution, and understanding across various musical styles worldwide. Despite the immense cultural and religious significance, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church (EOTC) chants are relatively underrepresented in computational music research. This paper contributes to this field by introducing a new dataset specifically tailored for analyzing EOTC chants, also known as Yaredawi Zema. This work provides a comprehensive overview of a 10-hour dataset, 369 instances, creation, and curation process, including rigorous quality assurance measures. Our dataset has a detailed word-level temporal boundary and reading tone annotation along with the corresponding chanting mode label of audios. Moreover, we have also identified the chanting options associated with multiple chanting notations in the manuscript by annotating them accordingly. Our goal in making this dataset available to the public 1 is to encourage more research and study of EOTC chants, including lyrics transcription, lyric-to-audio alignment, and music generation tasks. Such research work will advance knowledge and efforts to preserve this distinctive liturgical music, a priceless cultural artifact for the Ethiopian people.</description>

      <title>FOR: Finetuning for Object Level Open Vocabulary Image Retrieval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As working with large datasets becomes standard, the task of accurately retrieving images containing objects of interest by an open set textual query gains practical importance. The current leading approach utilizes a pre-trained CLIP model without any adaptation to the target domain, balancing accuracy and efficiency through additional post-processing. In this work, we propose FOR: Finetuning for Object-centric Open-vocabulary Image Retrieval, which allows finetuning on a target dataset using closed-set labels while keeping the visual-language association crucial for open vocabulary retrieval. FOR is based on two design elements: a specialized decoder variant of the CLIP head customized for the intended task, and its coupling within a multi-objective training framework. Together, these design choices result in a significant increase in accuracy, showcasing improvements of up to 8 mAP@50 points over SoTA across three datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that FOR is also effective in a semi-supervised setting, achieving impressive results even when only a small portion of the dataset is labeled.</description>

Abstract: As data retrieval demands become increasingly complex, traditional search methods often fall short in addressing nuanced and conceptual queries. Vector similarity search has emerged as a promising technique for finding semantically similar information efficiently. However, its effectiveness diminishes when handling intricate queries with contextual nuances. This paper explores a hybrid approach combining vector similarity search with Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance search accuracy and relevance. The proposed two-step solution first employs vector similarity search to shortlist potential matches, followed by an LLM for context-aware ranking of the results. Experiments on structured datasets demonstrate that while vector similarity search alone performs well for straightforward queries, the LLM-assisted approach excels in processing complex queries involving constraints, negations, or conceptual requirements. By leveraging the natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs, this method improves the accuracy of search results for complex tasks without sacrificing efficiency. We also discuss real-world applications and propose directions for future research to refine and scale this technique for diverse datasets and use cases.

      <title>Bootstrap Your Own Context Length</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a bootstrapping approach to train long-context language models by exploiting their short-context capabilities only. Our method utilizes a simple agent workflow to synthesize diverse long-context instruction tuning data, thereby eliminating the necessity for manual data collection and annotation. The proposed data synthesis workflow requires only a short-context language model, a text retriever, and a document collection, all of which are readily accessible within the open-source ecosystem. Subsequently, language models are fine-tuned using the synthesized data to extend their context lengths. In this manner, we effectively transfer the short-context capabilities of language models to long-context scenarios through a bootstrapping process. We conduct experiments with the open-source Llama-3 family of models and demonstrate that our method can successfully extend the context length to up to 1M tokens, achieving superior performance across various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Effective and secure federated online learning to rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19069v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online Learning to Rank (OLTR) optimises ranking models using implicit user feedback, such as clicks. Unlike traditional Learning to Rank (LTR) methods that rely on a static set of training data with relevance judgements to learn a ranking model, OLTR methods update the model continually as new data arrives. Thus, it addresses several drawbacks such as the high cost of human annotations, potential misalignment between user preferences and human judgments, and the rapid changes in user query intents. However, OLTR methods typically require the collection of searchable data, user queries, and clicks, which poses privacy concerns for users.
  Federated Online Learning to Rank (FOLTR) integrates OLTR within a Federated Learning (FL) framework to enhance privacy by not sharing raw data. While promising, FOLTR methods currently lag behind traditional centralised OLTR due to challenges in ranking effectiveness, robustness with respect to data distribution across clients, susceptibility to attacks, and the ability to unlearn client interactions and data. This thesis presents a comprehensive study on Federated Online Learning to Rank, addressing its effectiveness, robustness, security, and unlearning capabilities, thereby expanding the landscape of FOLTR.</description>

      <title>Reversed in Time: A Novel Temporal-Emphasized Benchmark for Cross-Modal Video-Text Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cross-modal (e.g. image-text, video-text) retrieval is an important task in information retrieval and multimodal vision-language understanding field. Temporal understanding makes video-text retrieval more challenging than image-text retrieval. However, we find that the widely used video-text benchmarks have shortcomings in comprehensively assessing abilities of models, especially in temporal understanding, causing large-scale image-text pre-trained models can already achieve comparable zero-shot performance with video-text pre-trained models. In this paper, we introduce RTime, a novel temporal-emphasized video-text retrieval dataset. We first obtain videos of actions or events with significant temporality, and then reverse these videos to create harder negative samples. We then recruit annotators to judge the significance and reversibility of candidate videos, and write captions for qualified videos. We further adopt GPT-4 to extend more captions based on human-written captions. Our RTime dataset currently consists of 21k videos with 10 captions per video, totalling about 122 hours. Based on RTime, we propose three retrieval benchmark tasks: RTime-Origin, RTime-Hard, and RTime-Binary. We further enhance the use of harder-negatives in model training, and benchmark a variety of video-text models on RTime. Extensive experiment analysis proves that RTime indeed poses new and higher challenges to video-text retrieval. We release our RTime dataset\footnote{\url{https://github.com/qyr0403/Reversed-in-Time}} to further advance video-text retrieval and multimodal understanding research.</description>

      <title>Personalized Dynamic Music Emotion Recognition with Dual-Scale Attention-Based Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic Music Emotion Recognition (DMER) aims to predict the emotion of different moments in music, playing a crucial role in music information retrieval. The existing DMER methods struggle to capture long-term dependencies when dealing with sequence data, which limits their performance. Furthermore, these methods often overlook the influence of individual differences on emotion perception, even though everyone has their own personalized emotional perception in the real world. Motivated by these issues, we explore more effective sequence processing methods and introduce the Personalized DMER (PDMER) problem, which requires models to predict emotions that align with personalized perception. Specifically, we propose a Dual-Scale Attention-Based Meta-Learning (DSAML) method. This method fuses features from a dual-scale feature extractor and captures both short and long-term dependencies using a dual-scale attention transformer, improving the performance in traditional DMER. To achieve PDMER, we design a novel task construction strategy that divides tasks by annotators. Samples in a task are annotated by the same annotator, ensuring consistent perception. Leveraging this strategy alongside meta-learning, DSAML can predict personalized perception of emotions with just one personalized annotation sample. Our objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance in both traditional DMER and PDMER.</description>

      <title>Large Language Model Simulator for Cold-Start Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommending cold items remains a significant challenge in billion-scale online recommendation systems. While warm items benefit from historical user behaviors, cold items rely solely on content features, limiting their recommendation performance and impacting user experience and revenue. Current models generate synthetic behavioral embeddings from content features but fail to address the core issue: the absence of historical behavior data. To tackle this, we introduce the LLM Simulator framework, which leverages large language models to simulate user interactions for cold items, fundamentally addressing the cold-start problem. However, simply using LLM to traverse all users can introduce significant complexity in billion-scale systems. To manage the computational complexity, we propose a coupled funnel ColdLLM framework for online recommendation. ColdLLM efficiently reduces the number of candidate users from billions to hundreds using a trained coupled filter, allowing the LLM to operate efficiently and effectively on the filtered set. Extensive experiments show that ColdLLM significantly surpasses baselines in cold-start recommendations, including Recall and NDCG metrics. A two-week A/B test also validates that ColdLLM can effectively increase the cold-start period GMV.</description>

      <title>LEARN: Knowledge Adaptation from Large Language Model to Recommendation for Practical Industrial Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03988v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Contemporary recommendation systems predominantly rely on ID embedding to capture latent associations among users and items. However, this approach overlooks the wealth of semantic information embedded within textual descriptions of items, leading to suboptimal performance and poor generalizations. Leveraging the capability of large language models to comprehend and reason about textual content presents a promising avenue for advancing recommendation systems. To achieve this, we propose an Llm-driven knowlEdge Adaptive RecommeNdation (LEARN) framework that synergizes open-world knowledge with collaborative knowledge. We address computational complexity concerns by utilizing pretrained LLMs as item encoders and freezing LLM parameters to avoid catastrophic forgetting and preserve open-world knowledge. To bridge the gap between the open-world and collaborative domains, we design a twin-tower structure supervised by the recommendation task and tailored for practical industrial application. Through experiments on the real large-scale industrial dataset and online A/B tests, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in industry application. We also achieve state-of-the-art performance on six Amazon Review datasets to verify the superiority of our method.</description>

      <title>Lusifer: LLM-based User SImulated Feedback Environment for online Recommender systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training reinforcement learning-based recommender systems is often hindered by the lack of dynamic and realistic user interactions. To address this limitation, we introduce Lusifer, a novel environment leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate simulated user feedback. Lusifer synthesizes user profiles and interaction histories to simulate responses and behaviors toward recommended items, with profiles updated after each rating to reflect evolving user characteristics. Utilizing the MovieLens dataset as a proof of concept, we limited our implementation to the last 40 interactions for each user, representing approximately 39% and 22% of the training sets, to focus on recent user behavior. For consistency and to gain insights into the performance of traditional methods with limited data, we implemented baseline approaches using the same data subset. Our results demonstrate that Lusifer accurately emulates user behavior and preferences, even with reduced training data having an RMSE of 1.3 across various test sets. This paper presents Lusifer's operational pipeline, including prompt generation and iterative user profile updates, and compares its performance against baseline methods. The findings validate Lusifer's ability to produce realistic dynamic feedback and suggest that it offers a scalable and adjustable framework for user simulation in online reinforcement learning recommender systems for future studies, particularly when training data is limited.</description>

      <title>When SparseMoE Meets Noisy Interactions: An Ensemble View on Denoising Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12730v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning user preferences from implicit feedback is one of the core challenges in recommendation. The difficulty lies in the potential noise within implicit feedback. Therefore, various denoising recommendation methods have been proposed recently. However, most of them overly rely on the hyperparameter configurations, inevitably leading to inadequacies in model adaptability and generalization performance. In this study, we propose a novel Adaptive Ensemble Learning (AEL) for denoising recommendation, which employs a sparse gating network as a brain, selecting suitable experts to synthesize appropriate denoising capacities for different data samples. To address the ensemble learning shortcoming of model complexity and ensure sub-recommender diversity, we also proposed a novel method that stacks components to create sub-recommenders instead of directly constructing them. Extensive experiments across various datasets demonstrate that AEL outperforms others in kinds of popular metrics, even in the presence of substantial and dynamic noise. Our code is available at https://github.com/cpu9xx/AEL.</description>

      <title>PoTable: Programming Standardly on Table-based Reasoning Like a Human Analyst</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Table-based reasoning has garnered substantial research interest, particularly in its integration with Large Language Model (LLM) which has revolutionized the general reasoning paradigm. Numerous LLM-based studies introduce symbolic tools (e.g., databases, Python) as assistants to extend human-like abilities in structured table understanding and complex arithmetic computations. However, these studies can be improved better in simulating human cognitive behavior when using symbolic tools, as they still suffer from limitations of non-standard logical splits and constrained operation pools. In this study, we propose PoTable as a novel table-based reasoning method that simulates a human tabular analyst, which integrates a Python interpreter as the real-time executor accompanied by an LLM-based operation planner and code generator. Specifically, PoTable follows a human-like logical stage split and extends the operation pool into an open-world space without any constraints. Through planning and executing in each distinct stage, PoTable standardly completes the entire reasoning process and produces superior reasoning results along with highly accurate, steply commented and completely executable programs. Accordingly, the effectiveness and explainability of PoTable are fully demonstrated. Extensive experiments over three evaluation datasets from two public benchmarks on two backbones show the outstanding performance of our approach. In particular, GPT-based PoTable achieves over 4% higher absolute accuracy than runner-ups on all evaluation datasets.</description>

      <title>Future Sight and Tough Fights: Revolutionizing Sequential Recommendation with FENRec</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) systems predict user preferences by analyzing time-ordered interaction sequences. A common challenge for SR is data sparsity, as users typically interact with only a limited number of items. While contrastive learning has been employed in previous approaches to address the challenges, these methods often adopt binary labels, missing finer patterns and overlooking detailed information in subsequent behaviors of users. Additionally, they rely on random sampling to select negatives in contrastive learning, which may not yield sufficiently hard negatives during later training stages. In this paper, we propose Future data utilization with Enduring Negatives for contrastive learning in sequential Recommendation (FENRec). Our approach aims to leverage future data with time-dependent soft labels and generate enduring hard negatives from existing data, thereby enhancing the effectiveness in tackling data sparsity. Experiment results demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance across four benchmark datasets, with an average improvement of 6.16\% across all metrics.</description>

      <title>MixRec: Heterogeneous Graph Collaborative Filtering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13825v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For modern recommender systems, the use of low-dimensional latent representations to embed users and items based on their observed interactions has become commonplace. However, many existing recommendation models are primarily designed for coarse-grained and homogeneous interactions, which limits their effectiveness in two critical dimensions. Firstly, these models fail to leverage the relational dependencies that exist across different types of user behaviors, such as page views, collects, comments, and purchases. Secondly, they struggle to capture the fine-grained latent factors that drive user interaction patterns. To address these limitations, we present a heterogeneous graph collaborative filtering model MixRec that excels at disentangling users' multi-behavior interaction patterns and uncovering the latent intent factors behind each behavior. Our model achieves this by incorporating intent disentanglement and multi-behavior modeling, facilitated by a parameterized heterogeneous hypergraph architecture. Furthermore, we introduce a novel contrastive learning paradigm that adaptively explores the advantages of self-supervised data augmentation, thereby enhancing the model's resilience against data sparsity and expressiveness with relation heterogeneity. To validate the efficacy of MixRec, we conducted extensive experiments on three public datasets. The results clearly demonstrate its superior performance, significantly outperforming various state-of-the-art baselines. Our model is open-sourced and available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/MixRec.</description>

      <title>LLMs for Knowledge Graph Construction and Reasoning: Recent Capabilities and Future Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13168v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an exhaustive quantitative and qualitative evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) for Knowledge Graph (KG) construction and reasoning. We engage in experiments across eight diverse datasets, focusing on four representative tasks encompassing entity and relation extraction, event extraction, link prediction, and question-answering, thereby thoroughly exploring LLMs' performance in the domain of construction and inference. Empirically, our findings suggest that LLMs, represented by GPT-4, are more suited as inference assistants rather than few-shot information extractors. Specifically, while GPT-4 exhibits good performance in tasks related to KG construction, it excels further in reasoning tasks, surpassing fine-tuned models in certain cases. Moreover, our investigation extends to the potential generalization ability of LLMs for information extraction, leading to the proposition of a Virtual Knowledge Extraction task and the development of the corresponding VINE dataset. Based on these empirical findings, we further propose AutoKG, a multi-agent-based approach employing LLMs and external sources for KG construction and reasoning. We anticipate that this research can provide invaluable insights for future undertakings in the field of knowledge graphs. The code and datasets are in https://github.com/zjunlp/AutoKG.</description>

      <title>A Text is Worth Several Tokens: Text Embedding from LLMs Secretly Aligns Well with The Key Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17378v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text embeddings from large language models (LLMs) have achieved excellent results in tasks such as information retrieval, semantic textual similarity, etc. In this work, we show an interesting finding: when feeding a text into the LLM-based embedder, the obtained text embedding will be able to be aligned with the key tokens in the input text. We first fully analyze this phenomenon on eight LLM-based embedders and show that this phenomenon is universal and is not affected by model architecture, training strategy, and embedding method. With a deeper analysis, we find that the main change in embedding space between these embedders and their LLM backbones is in the first principal component. By adjusting the first principal component, we can align text embedding with the key tokens. Finally, we give several examples to demonstrate the vast application potential of this finding: (1) we propose a simple and practical sparse retrieval method based on the aligned tokens, which can achieve 80% of the dense retrieval effect of the same model while reducing the computation significantly; (2) we show that our findings provide a novel perspective to help understand novel technologies (e.g., instruction-following embedding) and fuzzy concepts (e.g., semantic relatedness vs. similarity) in this field.</description>

      <title>CAPER: Enhancing Career Trajectory Prediction using Temporal Knowledge Graph and Ternary Relationship</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15620</link>

Abstract: The problem of career trajectory prediction (CTP) aims to predict one's future employer or job position. While several CTP methods have been developed for this problem, we posit that none of these methods (1) jointly considers the mutual ternary dependency between three key units (i.e., user, position, and company) of a career and (2) captures the characteristic shifts of key units in career over time, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the job movement patterns in the labor market. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel solution, named as CAPER, that solves the challenges via sophisticated temporal knowledge graph (TKG) modeling. It enables the utilization of a graph-structured knowledge base with rich expressiveness, effectively preserving the changes in job movement patterns. Furthermore, we devise an extrapolated career reasoning task on TKG for a realistic evaluation. The experiments on a real-world career trajectory dataset demonstrate that CAPER consistently and significantly outperforms four baselines, two recent TKG reasoning methods, and five state-of-the-art CTP methods in predicting one's future companies and positions--i.e., on average, yielding 6.80% and 34.58% more accurate predictions, respectively. The codebase of CAPER is available at https://github.com/Bigdasgit/CAPER.</description>

      <title>TableRAG: Million-Token Table Understanding with Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04739v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in language models (LMs) have notably enhanced their ability to reason with tabular data, primarily through program-aided mechanisms that manipulate and analyze tables. However, these methods often require the entire table as input, leading to scalability challenges due to the positional bias or context length constraints. In response to these challenges, we introduce TableRAG, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework specifically designed for LM-based table understanding. TableRAG leverages query expansion combined with schema and cell retrieval to pinpoint crucial information before providing it to the LMs. This enables more efficient data encoding and precise retrieval, significantly reducing prompt lengths and mitigating information loss. We have developed two new million-token benchmarks from the Arcade and BIRD-SQL datasets to thoroughly evaluate TableRAG's effectiveness at scale. Our results demonstrate that TableRAG's retrieval design achieves the highest retrieval quality, leading to the new state-of-the-art performance on large-scale table understanding.</description>

      <title>RAGONITE: Iterative Retrieval on Induced Databases and Verbalized RDF for Conversational QA over KGs with RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17690v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conversational question answering (ConvQA) is a convenient means of searching over RDF knowledge graphs (KGs), where a prevalent approach is to translate natural language questions to SPARQL queries. However, SPARQL has certain shortcomings: (i) it is brittle for complex intents and conversational questions, and (ii) it is not suitable for more abstract needs. Instead, we propose a novel two-pronged system where we fuse: (i) SQL-query results over a database automatically derived from the KG, and (ii) text-search results over verbalizations of KG facts. Our pipeline supports iterative retrieval: when the results of any branch are found to be unsatisfactory, the system can automatically opt for further rounds. We put everything together in a retrieval augmented generation (RAG) setup, where an LLM generates a coherent response from accumulated search results. We demonstrate the superiority of our proposed system over several baselines on a knowledge graph of BMW automobiles.</description>
