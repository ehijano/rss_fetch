      <title>Near-infrared fluorescent nanoprobes for irreversibility in nonequilibrium actomyosin networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Actomyosin networks operate far from equilibrium, yet detecting the onset of motor-driven irreversible dynamics remains challenging. Here, we embed near-infrared (NIR) fluorescent single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) within reconstituted actin networks, and use their nonphotobleaching emission to optically report ATP-powered myosin contractile activity. G-actin-dispersed SWCNTs are incorporated into polymerized F-actin without perturbing network assembly, enabling long-term, single-emitter fluorescence monitoring. Upon myosin addition, the NIR fluorescence levels of individual SWCNTs exhibit enhanced temporal fluctuations, and population-level statistics reveal deviations from equilibrium behaviour. The index of dispersion (IOD) distributions shift and broaden relative to equilibrium baselines, and the Kullback-Leibler divergence between IOD distributions systematically increases with increasing motor activity. Stationarity analysis further shows a dose-dependent increase in the fraction of nonstationary fluorescence traces, indicating the emergence of irreversible, time-evolving dynamics. These results establish SWCNTs as minimally invasive optical probes of irreversibility in nonequilibrium actomyosin assemblies, with broad applicability to other active biopolymer systems.</description>

      <title>Towards an active matter theory of plant morphogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plant morphogenesis relies on dynamic growth deformations at the cell and tissue scales driven by osmotic fluxes. A mechanistic understanding of this phenomenon demands a physical framework that integrates cell imbibition, tissue mechanics, and water fluxes, as well as their biophysical and molecular regulations, within a theory of plant active matter capturing the open-system and out-of-equilibrium properties of tissues. Building on historical insights into growth geometry, physics, and mechanics, combined with recent experimental results, we outline the key challenges in modelling plant growth and propose steps towards a unified physical theory of plant morphogenesis, in which biological regulation, mechanical forces, and water fluxes interact to shape biological form through the fundamental principles of living matter.</description>

      <title>A Frenet frame analysis of protein geometry: hints for secondary structure assignments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deepens into the analysis of the protein secondary structure using Frenet frame to describe the curvature and torsion of the discrete curve formed by the protein $\alpha$-carbons. We show how a simple criterion based on the evaluation of the curvature and torsion of the discrete curve can be useful to pinpoint the presence of some secondary and supersecondary structures in proteins. Moreover, the description of proteins as fixed points of an effective action inspired by an $U(1)$ gauge model is strongly supported by the curvature and torsion observed over a large dataset of proteins in the Protein Data Bank.</description>

      <title>On the role of nuclear quantum effects on the stability of peptides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) arising from the light mass of hydrogen can influence the structure and stability of hydrogen-bonded biomolecules, yet their role in determining peptide and protein folding remains unclear. Experiments show that substituting H$_2$O with D$_2$O often stabilizes folded states, but the microscopic mechanism associated with this phenomena remains unresolved. Through ab initio-level path-integral molecular dynamics simulations enabled by machine-learning interatomic potentials, we address the fundamental question of the role of NQEs in peptides by investigating both their overall impact and isotope substitution effects. Overall, NQEs systematically destabilize compact three-dimensional structures across peptide systems, independent of secondary structure type or side-chain interactions. Contrary to the conventional picture that places central importance on hydrogen bonds, we find that the dominant destabilization instead arises from the quantum C-H vibrations. In addition, we reveal microscopic insights into the stabilization of folded peptides upon H$_2$O to D$_2$O substitution, showing that the H/D isotope substitution of active peptide hydrogens, previously considered unimportant, produces free-energy changes within the range of experimentally observed shifts. These findings provide a new interpretation of isotope effects in biological systems, indicating that seemingly small H$\to$D substitutions within peptides can be as important as, or even outweigh, solvent contributions.</description>

      <title>Fluctuating Environments Favor Extreme Dormancy Strategies and Penalize Intermediate Ones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dormancy is a widespread adaptive strategy that enables populations to persist in fluctuating environments, yet how its benefits depend on the temporal structure of environmental variability remains unclear. We examine how dormancy interacts with environmental correlation times using a delayed-logistic model in which dormant individuals reactivate after a fixed lag while birth rates fluctuate under temporally correlated stochasticity. Numerical simulations and analytical calculations show that the combination of demographic memory and colored multiplicative noise generates a strongly non-monotonic dependence of fitness on dormancy duration, with three distinct performance regimes. Very short dormancy maximizes linear growth but amplifies fluctuations and extinction risk. Very long dormancy buffers environmental variability, greatly increasing mean extinction times despite slower growth. Strikingly, we find a broad band of intermediate dormancy durations that is maladaptive, simultaneously reducing both growth and persistence due to a mismatch between delay times and environmental autocorrelation. An evolutionary agent-based model confirms bistability between short- and long-dormancy strategies, which avoid intermediate lag times and evolve toward stable extremes. These results show that dormancy duration is not merely a life-history parameter but an adaptive mechanism tuned to environmental timescales, and that intermediate "dangerous middle" strategies can be inherently disfavored. More broadly, this work identifies a generic mechanism by which demographic delays interacting with correlated environmental variability produce a non-monotonic fitness landscape that selects for extreme timing strategies.</description>

      <title>Evolution of robust cell differentiation under epigenetic feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20651v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In multi-cellular organisms, cells differentiate into multiple types as they divide. States of these cell types, as well as their numbers, are known to be robust to external perturbations; as conceptualized by Waddington's epigenetic landscape where cells embed themselves in valleys corresponding to final cell types. How is such robustness achieved by developmental dynamics and evolution? To address this question, we consider a model of cells with gene expression dynamics and epigenetic feedback, governed by a gene regulation network. By evolving the network to achieve more cell types, we identified three major differentiation processes exhibiting different properties regarding their variance, attractors, stability, and robustness. The first of these, type A, exhibits chaos and long-lived oscillatory dynamics that slowly transition until reaching a steady state. The second, type B, follows a channeled annealing process where the epigenetic changes in combination with noise shift the cells towards varying final cell states that increase the stability. Lastly, type C exhibits a quenching process where cell fate is quickly decided by falling into pre-existing fixed points while cell trajectories are separated through periodic attractors or saddle points. We find types A and B to correspond well with Waddington's landscape while being robust. Finally, the dynamics of type B demonstrate a differentiation process that uses a directed shifting of fixed points, visualized through the dimensional reduction of gene-expression states. Correspondence with the experimental data of gene expression variance through differentiation is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Anti-aligning Self-propelled Model of Two Species: Emergence of Self-organized Heterogeneous Aligned and Clustered Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-propelled particles with anti-aligning interactions generally do not form a polar order. However, in this Letter, we show that when multiple types of such particles coexist and interact through aligning interactions between different species, a global polar order can emerge through the formation of elongated clusters with alternating domains of each species. By developing a mean-field theory, we reveal the conditions for cluster formation and characterize the resulting patterns. Our findings highlight the critical role of inter-species interactions in the emergence of complex ordered states.</description>
