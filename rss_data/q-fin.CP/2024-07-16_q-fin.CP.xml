      <title>Machine learning in weekly movement prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To predict the future movements of stock markets, numerous studies concentrate on daily data and employ various machine learning (ML) models as benchmarks that often vary and lack standardization across different research works. This paper tries to solve the problem from a fresh standpoint by aiming to predict the weekly movements, and introducing a novel benchmark of random traders. This benchmark is independent of any ML model, thus making it more objective and potentially serving as a commonly recognized standard. During training process, apart from the basic features such as technical indicators, scaling laws and directional changes are introduced as additional features, furthermore, the training datasets are also adjusted by assigning varying weights to different samples, the weighting approach allows the models to emphasize specific samples. On back-testing, several trained models show good performance, with the multi-layer perception (MLP) demonstrating stability and robustness across extensive and comprehensive data that include upward, downward and cyclic trends. The unique perspective of this work that focuses on weekly movements, incorporates new features and creates an objective benchmark, contributes to the existing literature on stock market prediction.</description>

      <title>FinDKG: Dynamic Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models for Detecting Global Trends in Financial Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic knowledge graphs (DKGs) are popular structures to express different types of connections between objects over time. They can also serve as an efficient mathematical tool to represent information extracted from complex unstructured data sources, such as text or images. Within financial applications, DKGs could be used to detect trends for strategic thematic investing, based on information obtained from financial news articles. In this work, we explore the properties of large language models (LLMs) as dynamic knowledge graph generators, proposing a novel open-source fine-tuned LLM for this purpose, called the Integrated Contextual Knowledge Graph Generator (ICKG). We use ICKG to produce a novel open-source DKG from a corpus of financial news articles, called FinDKG, and we propose an attention-based GNN architecture for analysing it, called KGTransformer. We test the performance of the proposed model on benchmark datasets and FinDKG, demonstrating superior performance on link prediction tasks. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of the KGTransformer on FinDKG for thematic investing, showing it can outperform existing thematic ETFs.</description>

      <title>The Blockchain Risk Parity Line: Moving From The Efficient Frontier To The Final Frontier Of Investments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We engineer blockchain based risk managed portfolios by creating three funds with distinct risk and return profiles: 1) Alpha - high risk portfolio; 2) Beta - mimics the wider market; and 3) Gamma - represents the risk free rate adjusted to beat inflation. Each of the sub-funds (Alpha, Beta and Gamma) provides risk parity because the weight of each asset in the corresponding portfolio is set to be inversely proportional to the risk derived from investing in that asset. This can be equivalently stated as equal risk contributions from each asset towards the overall portfolio risk.
  We provide detailed mechanics of combining assets - including mathematical formulations - to obtain better risk managed portfolios. The descriptions are intended to show how a risk parity based efficient frontier portfolio management engine - that caters to different risk appetites of investors by letting each individual investor select their preferred risk-return combination - can be created seamlessly on blockchain.
  Any Investor - using decentralized ledger technology - can select their desired level of risk, or return, and allocate their wealth accordingly among the sub funds, which balance one another under different market conditions. This evolution of the risk parity principle - resulting in a mechanism that is geared to do well under all market cycles - brings more robust performance and can be termed as conceptual parity.
  We have given several numerical examples that illustrate the various scenarios that arise when combining Alpha, Beta and Gamma to obtain Parity.
  The final investment frontier is now possible - a modification to the efficient frontier, thus becoming more than a mere theoretical construct - on blockchain since anyone from anywhere can participate at anytime to obtain wealth appreciation based on their financial goals.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Money Market Interest Rate Strategy Utilizing Control Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) money markets have seen explosive growth in recent years, with billions of dollars borrowed in various cryptocurrency assets. Key to the safety of money markets is the implementation of interest rates that determine the cost of borrowing, and govern counterparty exposure and return. In traditional markets, interest rates are set by risk managers, portfolio managers, the Federal Reserve, and a myriad of other sources depending on the market function. DeFi enables an algorithmic approach that typically relies on interest rates being directly dependent on market utilization. The benefit of algorithmic interest rate management is the system's continual response to market behaviors in real time, and thus an inherent ability to mitigate risks on behalf of protocols and users. These interest rate strategies target an optimal utilization based on the protocol's risk threshold, but historically lack the ability to compensate for excessive or diminished utilization over time. This research investigates contemporary DeFi interest rate management strategies and their limitations. Furthermore, this paper introduces a time-weighted approach to interest rate management that implements a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control system to constantly adapt to market utilization patterns, addressing observed limitations.</description>
