      <title>Optimal sensor placement under model uncertainty in the weak-constraint 4D-Var framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In data assimilation, the model may be subject to uncertainties and errors. The weak-constraint data assimilation framework enables incorporating model uncertainty in the dynamics of the governing equations. % We propose a new framework for near-optimal sensor placement in the weak-constrained setting. This is achieved by first deriving a design criterion based on the expected information gain, which involves the Kullback-Leibler divergence from the forecast prior to the posterior distribution. An explicit formula for this criterion is provided, assuming that the model error and background are independent and Gaussian and the dynamics are linear. % We discuss algorithmic approaches to efficiently evaluate this criterion through randomized approximations.
  To provide further insight and flexibility in computations, we also provide alternative expressions for the criteria. %t We provide an algorithm to find near-optimal experimental designs using column subset selection, including a randomized algorithm that avoids computing the adjoint of the forward operator. % Through numerical experiments in one and two spatial dimensions, we show the effectiveness of our proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Multipoint stress mixed finite element methods for elasticity on cuboid grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop multipoint stress mixed finite element methods for linear elasticity with weak stress symmetry on cuboid grids, which can be reduced to a symmetric and positive definite cell-centered system. The methods employ the lowest-order enhanced Raviart-Thomas finite element space for the stress and piecewise constant displacement. The vertex quadrature rule is employed to localize the interaction of stress degrees of freedom, enabling local stress elimination around each vertex. We introduce two methods. The first method uses a piecewise constant rotation, resulting in a cell-centered system for the displacement and rotation. The second method employs a continuous piecewise trilinear rotation and the vertex quadrature rule for the asymmetry bilinear forms, allowing for further elimination of the rotation and resulting in a cell-centered system for the displacement only. Stability and error analysis is performed for both methods. For the stability analysis of the second method, a new auxiliary H-curl conforming matrix-valued space is constructed, which forms an exact sequence with the stress space. A matrix-matrix inf-sup condition is shown for the curl of this auxiliary space and the trilinear rotation space. First-order convergence is established for all variables in their natural norms, as well as second-order superconvergence of the displacement at the cell centers. Numerical results are presented to verify the theory.</description>

      <title>The multi-index Monte Carlo method for semilinear stochastic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) are often difficult to solve numerically due to their low regularity and high dimensionality. These challenges limit the practical use of computer-aided studies and pose significant barriers to statistical analysis of SPDEs. In this work, we introduce a highly efficient multi-index Monte Carlo method (MIMC) designed to approximate statistics of mild solutions to semilinear parabolic SPDEs. Key to our approach is the proof of a multiplicative convergence property for coupled solutions generated by an exponential integrator numerical solver, which we incorporate with MIMC. We further describe theoretically how the asymptotic computational cost of MIMC can be bounded in terms of the input accuracy tolerance, as the tolerance goes to zero. Notably, our methodology illustrates that for an SPDE with low regularity, MIMC offers substantial performance improvements over other viable methods. Numerical experiments comparing the performance of MIMC with the multilevel Monte Carlo method on relevant test problems validate our theoretical findings. These results also demonstrate that MIMC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art multilevel Monte Carlo, thereby underscoring its potential as a robust and tractable tool for solving semilinear parabolic SPDEs.</description>

      <title>Mass lumping and stabilization for immersogeometric analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trimmed (multi-patch) geometries are the state-of-the-art technology in computer-aided design for industrial applications such as automobile crashworthiness. In this context, fast solution techniques extensively rely on explicit time integration schemes in conjunction with mass lumping techniques that substitute the consistent mass with a (usually diagonal) approximation. For smooth isogeometric discretizations, Leidinger [1] first showed that mass lumping removed the dependency of the critical time-step on the size of trimmed elements. This finding has attracted considerable attention but has unfortunately overshadowed another more subtle effect: mass lumping may disastrously impact the accuracy of low frequencies and modes, potentially inducing spurious oscillations in the solution. In this article, we provide compelling evidence for this phenomenon and later propose a stabilization technique based on polynomial extensions that restores a level of accuracy comparable to boundary-fitted discretizations.</description>

      <title>Anderson acceleration of a Picard solver for the Oldroyd-B model of viscoelastic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an iterative nonlinear solver for the Oldroyd-B system describing incompressible viscoelastic fluid flow. We establish a range of attributes of the fixed-point-based solver, together with the conditions under which it becomes contractive and examining the smoothness properties of its corresponding fixed-point function. Under these properties, we demonstrate that the solver meets the necessary conditions for recent Anderson acceleration (AA) framework, thereby showing that AA enhances the solver's linear convergence rate. Results from two benchmark tests illustrate how AA improves the solver's ability to converge as the Weissenberg number is increased.</description>

      <title>Boundary element formulation of the Mild-Slope Equation for harmonic water waves propagating over unidirectional variable bathymetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a boundary element formulation for the solution of the Mild-Slope equation in wave propagation problems with variable water depth in one direction. Based on the Green's function approximation proposed by Belibassakis \cite{Belibassakis2000}, a complete fundamental-solution kernel is developed and combined with a boundary element scheme for the solution of water wave propagation problems in closed and open domains where the bathymetry changes arbitrarily and smoothly in a preferential direction. The ability of the proposed formulation to accurately represent wave phenomena like refraction, reflection, diffraction and shoaling, is demonstrated with the solution of some example problems, in which arbitrary geometries and variable seabed profiles with slopes up to 1:3 are considered. The obtained results are also compared with theoretical solutions, showing an excellent agreement that demonstrates its potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a conforming setting for a mixed formulation of linear elasticity with symmetric stress that has normal-normal continuous components across faces of tetrahedral meshes. We provide a stress element for this formulation with 30 degrees of freedom that correspond to standard boundary conditions. The resulting scheme converges quasi-optimally and is locking free. Numerical experiments illustrate the performance.</description>

      <title>A coupled finite and boundary spectral element method for linear water-wave propagation problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coupled boundary spectral element method (BSEM) and spectral element method (SEM) formulation for the propagation of small-amplitude water waves over variable bathymetries is presented in this work. The wave model is based on the mild-slope equation (MSE), which provides a good approximation of the propagation of water waves over irregular bottom surfaces with slopes up to 1:3. In unbounded domains or infinite regions, space can be divided into two different areas: a central region of interest, where an irregular bathymetry is included, and an exterior infinite region with straight and parallel bathymetric lines. The SEM allows us to model the central region, where any variation of the bathymetry can be considered, while the exterior infinite region is modelled by the BSEM which, combined with the fundamental solution presented by Cerrato et al. [A. Cerrato, J. A. Gonz\'alez, L. Rodr\'iguez-Tembleque, Boundary element formulation of the mild-slope equation for harmonic water waves propagating over unidirectional variable bathymetries, Eng. Anal. Boundary Elem. 62 (2016) 22-34.] can include bathymetries with straight and parallel contour lines. This coupled model combines important advantages of both methods; it benefits from the flexibility of the SEM for the interior region and, at the same time, includes the fulfilment of the Sommerfeld's radiation condition for the exterior problem, that is provided by the BSEM. The solution approximation inside the elements is constructed by high order Legendre polynomials associated with Legendre-Gauss-Lobatto quadrature points, providing a spectral convergence for both methods. The proposed formulation has been validated in three different benchmark cases with different shapes of the bottom surface. The solutions exhibit the typical p-convergence of spectral methods.</description>

      <title>Parameter Choices for Sparse Multi-Parameter Regularization with the $\ell_1$ Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a multi-parameter regularization approach using the $\ell_1$ norm, designed to better adapt to complex data structures and problem characteristics while offering enhanced flexibility in promoting sparsity in regularized solutions. As data volumes grow, sparse representations of learned functions become critical for reducing computational costs during function operations. We investigate how the selection of multiple regularization parameters influences the sparsity of regularized solutions. Specifically, we characterize the relationship between these parameters and the sparsity of solutions under transform matrices, enabling the development of an iterative scheme for selecting parameters that achieve prescribed sparsity levels. Special attention is given to scenarios where the fidelity term is non-differentiable, and the transform matrix lacks full row rank. In such cases, the regularized solution, along with two auxiliary vectors arising in the sparsity characterization, are essential components of the multi-parameter selection strategy. To address this, we propose a fixed-point proximity algorithm that simultaneously determines these three vectors. This algorithm, combined with our sparsity characterization, forms the basis of a practical multi-parameter selection strategy. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, yielding regularized solutions with both predetermined sparsity levels and satisfactory approximation accuracy.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Implementation of Edge-Based Discretization without Forming Dual Control Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows that lumped directed-area vectors at edges and dual control volumes required to implement the edge-based discretization can be computed without explicitly defining the dual control volume around each node for triangular and tetrahedral grids. It is a simpler implementation because there is no need to form a dual control volume by connecting edge-midpoints, face centroids, and element centroids, and also reduces the time for computing lumped directed-area vectors for a given grid, especially for tetrahedral grids. The speed-up achieved by the proposed algorithm may not be large enough to greatly impact the overall simulation time, but the proposed algorithm is expected to serve as a major stepping stone towards extending the edge-based discretization to four dimensions and beyond (e.g., space-time simulations). Efficient algorithms for computing lumped directed-area vectors and dual volumes without forming dual volumes are presented, and their implementations are described and compared with traditional algorithms in terms of complexity as well as actual computing time for a given grid.</description>

      <title>Partitioned solution strategies for coupled BEM-FEM acoustic fluid-structure interaction problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates two FEM-BEM coupling formulations for acoustic fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems, using the Finite Element Method (FEM) to model the structure and the Boundary Element Method (BEM) to represent a linear acoustic fluid. The coupling methods described interconnect fluid and structure using classical or localized Lagrange multipliers, allowing the connection of non-matching interfaces. First coupling technique is the well known mortar method, that uses classical multipliers and is compared with a new formulation of the method of localized Lagrange multipliers (LLM) for FSI applications with non-matching interfaces. The proposed non-overlapping domain decomposition technique uses a classical non-symmetrical acoustic BEM formulation for the fluid, although a symmetric Galerkin BEM formulation could be used as well. A comparison between the localized methodology and the mortar method in highly non conforming interface meshes is presented. Furthermore, the methodology proposes an iterative preconditioned and projected bi-conjugate gradient solver which presents very good scalability properties in the solution of this kind of problems.</description>

      <title>Improved monolithic multigrid methods for high-order Taylor-Hood discretizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical simulation of incompressible fluid flows has been an active topic of research in Scientific Computing for many years, with many contributions to both discretizations and linear and nonlinear solvers. In this work, we propose an improved relaxation scheme for higher-order Taylor-Hood discretizations of the incompressible Stokes and Navier-Stokes equations, demonstrating its efficiency within monolithic multigrid preconditioners for the linear(ized) equations. The key to this improvement is an improved patch construction for Vanka-style relaxation introducing, for the first time, overlap in the pressure degrees of freedom within the patches. Numerical results demonstrate significant improvement in both multigrid iterations and time-to-solution for the linear Stokes case, on both triangular and quadrilateral meshes. For the nonlinear Navier-Stokes case, we show similar improvements, including in the number of nonlinear iterations needed in an inexact Newton method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for solving H(curl)-elliptic hemivariational inequalities. By selecting an appropriate numerical flux, we construct an Interior Penalty Discontinuous Galerkin (IPDG) scheme. A comprehensive numerical analysis of the IPDG method is conducted, addressing key aspects such as consistency, boundedness, stability, and the existence, uniqueness, uniform boundedness of the numerical solutions. Building on these properties, we establish a priori error estimates, demonstrating the optimal convergence order of the numerical solutions under suitable solution regularity assumptions. Finally, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the theoretically predicted convergence order and to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>TT-LSQR For Tensor Least Squares Problems and Application to Data Mining *</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are interested in the numerical solution of the tensor least squares problem \[
  \min_{\mathcal{X}} \| \mathcal{F} - \sum_{i =1}^{\ell} \mathcal{X} \times_1 A_1^{(i)} \times_2 A_2^{(i)} \cdots \times_d A_d^{(i)} \|_F, \] where $\mathcal{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{m_1 \times m_2 \times \cdots \times m_d}$, $\mathcal{F}\in\mathbb{R}^{n_1\times n_2 \times \cdots \times n_d}$ are tensors with $d$ dimensions, and the coefficients $A_j^{(i)}$ are tall matrices of conforming dimensions. We first describe a tensor implementation of the classical LSQR method by Paige and Saunders, using the tensor-train representation as key ingredient. We also show how to incorporate sketching to lower the computational cost of dealing with the tall matrices $A_j^{(i)}$. We then use this methodology to address a problem in information retrieval, the classification of a new query document among already categorized documents, according to given keywords.</description>

      <title>Towards Stable Second-Kind Boundary Integral Equations for Transient Wave Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the stable discretisation of the double layer boundary integral operator for the wave equation in $1d$. For this, we show that the boundary integral formulation is $L^2$-elliptic and also inf-sup stable in standard energy spaces. This turns out to be a particular case of a recent result on the inf-sup stability of boundary integral operators for the wave equation and contributes to its further understanding. Moreover, we present the first BEM discretisations of second-kind operators for the wave equation for which stability is guaranteed and a complete numerical analysis is offered. We validate our theoretical findings with numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a numerical algorithm for an inverse problem on determining fractional orders of time derivatives simultaneously in a coupled subdiffusion system. Following the theoretical uniqueness, we reformulate the order inverse problem as a discrete minimization problem, so that we derive a concise Gauss-Newton iterative method. Abundant numerical tests demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Parametric Autoresonance with Time-Delayed Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10105v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how a constant time delay influences a parametric autoresonant system. This is a nonlinear system driven by a parametrically chirped force with a negative delay-feedback that maintains adiabatic phase locking with the driving frequency. This phase locking results in a continuous amplitude growth, regardless of parameter changes. Our study reveals a critical threshold for delay strength; above this threshold, autoresonance is sustained, while below it, autoresonance diminishes. We examine the interplay between time delay and autoresonance stability, using multi-scale perturbation methods to derive analytical results, which are corroborated by numerical simulations. Ultimately, the goal is to understand and control autoresonance stability through the time-delay parameters.</description>

      <title>Super Quantum Mechanics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Super Quantum Mechanics (SQM) as a theory that considers states in Hilbert space subject to multiple quadratic constraints. Traditional quantum mechanics corresponds to a single quadratic constraint of wavefunction normalization. In its simplest form, SQM considers states in the form of unitary operators, where the quadratic constraints are conditions of unitarity. In this case, the stationary SQM problem is a quantum inverse problem with multiple applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence. The SQM stationary problem is equivalent to a new algebraic problem that we address in this paper. The SQM non-stationary problem considers the evolution of a quantum system, distinct from the explicit time dependence of the Hamiltonian, $H(t)$. Several options for the SQM dynamic equation are considered, and quantum circuits of 2D type are introduced, which transform one quantum system into another. Although no known physical process currently describes such dynamics, this approach naturally bridges direct and inverse quantum mechanics problems, allowing for the development of a new type of computer algorithm. Beyond computer modeling, the developed theory could be directly applied if or when a physical process capable of solving an inverse quantum problem in a single measurement act (analogous to wavefunction measurement in traditional quantum mechanics) is discovered in the future.</description>

      <title>Fast Solvers for Discrete Diffusion Models: Theory and Applications of High-Order Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have emerged as a powerful generative modeling framework for discrete data with successful applications spanning from text generation to image synthesis. However, their deployment faces challenges due to the high dimensionality of the state space, necessitating the development of efficient inference algorithms. Current inference approaches mainly fall into two categories: exact simulation and approximate methods such as $\tau$-leaping. While exact methods suffer from unpredictable inference time and redundant function evaluations, $\tau$-leaping is limited by its first-order accuracy. In this work, we advance the latter category by tailoring the first extension of high-order numerical inference schemes to discrete diffusion models, enabling larger step sizes while reducing error. We rigorously analyze the proposed schemes and establish the second-order accuracy of the $\theta$-trapezoidal method in KL divergence. Empirical evaluations on GPT-2 level text and ImageNet-level image generation tasks demonstrate that our method achieves superior sample quality compared to existing approaches under equivalent computational constraints.</description>

      <title>On the study of frequency control and spectral bias in Wavelet-Based Kolmogorov Arnold networks: A path to physics-informed KANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral bias, the tendency of neural networks to prioritize learning low-frequency components of functions during the initial training stages, poses a significant challenge when approximating solutions with high-frequency details. This issue is particularly pronounced in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), widely used to solve differential equations that describe physical phenomena. In the literature, contributions such as Wavelet Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (Wav-KANs) have demonstrated promising results in capturing both low- and high-frequency components. Similarly, Fourier features (FF) are often employed to address this challenge. However, the theoretical foundations of Wav-KANs, particularly the relationship between the frequency of the mother wavelet and spectral bias, remain underexplored. A more in-depth understanding of how Wav-KANs manage high-frequency terms could offer valuable insights for addressing oscillatory phenomena encountered in parabolic, elliptic, and hyperbolic differential equations. In this work, we analyze the eigenvalues of the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of Wav-KANs to enhance their ability to converge on high-frequency components, effectively mitigating spectral bias. Our theoretical findings are validated through numerical experiments, where we also discuss the limitations of traditional approaches, such as standard PINNs and Fourier features, in addressing multi-frequency problems.</description>

      <title>Representation of solutions of the one-dimensional Dirac equation in terms of Neumann series of Bessel functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A representation of solutions of the one-dimensional Dirac equation is obtained. The solutions are represented as Neumann series of Bessel functions. The representations are shown to be uniformly convergent with respect to the spectral parameter. Explicit formulas for the coefficients are obtained via a system of recursive integrals. The result is based on the Fourier-Legendre series expansion of the transmutation kernel. An efficient numerical method for solving initial-value and spectral problems based on this approach is presented with a numerical example. The method can compute large sets of eigendata with non-deteriorating accuracy.</description>

      <title>Sub-Sequential Physics-Informed Learning with State Space Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are a kind of deep-learning-based numerical solvers for partial differential equations (PDEs). Existing PINNs often suffer from failure modes of being unable to propagate patterns of initial conditions. We discover that these failure modes are caused by the simplicity bias of neural networks and the mismatch between PDE's continuity and PINN's discrete sampling. We reveal that the State Space Model (SSM) can be a continuous-discrete articulation allowing initial condition propagation, and that simplicity bias can be eliminated by aligning a sequence of moderate granularity. Accordingly, we propose PINNMamba, a novel framework that introduces sub-sequence modeling with SSM. Experimental results show that PINNMamba can reduce errors by up to 86.3\% compared with state-of-the-art architecture. Our code is available at https://github.com/miniHuiHui/PINNMamba.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores challenges in training Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), emphasizing the role of the loss landscape in the training process. We examine difficulties in minimizing the PINN loss function, particularly due to ill-conditioning caused by differential operators in the residual term. We compare gradient-based optimizers Adam, L-BFGS, and their combination \al{}, showing the superiority of \al{}, and introduce a novel second-order optimizer, NysNewton-CG (NNCG), which significantly improves PINN performance. Theoretically, our work elucidates the connection between ill-conditioned differential operators and ill-conditioning in the PINN loss and shows the benefits of combining first- and second-order optimization methods. Our work presents valuable insights and more powerful optimization strategies for training PINNs, which could improve the utility of PINNs for solving difficult partial differential equations.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to the Initial Value Problem with a complete validated algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Initial Value Problem (IVP) is concerned with finding solutions to a system of autonomous ordinary differential equations (ODE)
  \begin{equation}
  \textbf{x}' = \textbf{f}(\textbf{x})
  \end{equation} with given initial condition $\textbf{x}(0)\in B_0$ for some box $B_0\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$. Here $\textbf{f}:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ and $\textbf{x}:[0,1]\to\mathbb{R}^n$ where $\textbf{f}$ and $\textbf{x}$ are $C^1$-continuous. Let $\texttt{IVP}_\textbf{f}(B_0)$ denote the set of all such solutions $\textbf{x}$. Despite over 40 years of development to design a validated algorithm for the IVP problem, no complete algorithm currently exists.
  In this paper, we introduce a novel way to exploit the theory of $\textbf{logarithmic norms}$: we introduce the concept of a $\textbf{radical transform}$ $\pi:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^n$ to convert the above $(\textbf{x},\textbf{f})$-system into another system $\textbf{y}' = \textbf{g}(\textbf{y})$ so that the $(\textbf{y},\textbf{g})$-space has negative logarithmic norm in any desired small enough neighborhood.
  Based on such radical transform steps, we construct a complete validated algorithm for the following $\textbf{End-Enclosure Problem}$:
  \begin{equation} INPUT: (\textbf{f}, B_0,\varepsilon), \qquad\qquad OUTPUT: (\underline{B}_0,B_1)
  \end{equation} where $B_0\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is a box, $\varepsilon&gt;0$, such that $\underline{B}_0\subseteq B_0$, the diameter of $B_1$ is at most $\varepsilon$, and $B_1$ is an end-enclosure for $\texttt{IVP}(\underline{B}_0)$, i.e., for all $\textbf{x}\in \texttt{IVP}(\underline{B}_0)$, $\textbf{x}(1)\in B_1$.
  A preliminary implementation of our algorithm shows promise.</description>

      <title>Muti-Fidelity Prediction and Uncertainty Quantification with Laplace Neural Operators for Parametric Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laplace Neural Operators (LNOs) have recently emerged as a promising approach in scientific machine learning due to the ability to learn nonlinear maps between functional spaces. However, this framework often requires substantial amounts of high-fidelity (HF) training data, which is often prohibitively expensive to acquire. To address this, we propose multi-fidelity Laplace Neural Operators (MF-LNOs), which combine a low-fidelity (LF) base model with parallel linear/nonlinear HF correctors and dynamic inter-fidelity weighting. This allows us to exploit correlations between LF and HF datasets and achieve accurate inference of quantities of interest even with sparse HF data. We further incorporate a modified replica exchange stochastic gradient Langevin algorithm, which enables a more effective posterior distribution estimation and uncertainty quantification in model predictions. Extensive validation across four canonical dynamical systems (the Lorenz system, Duffing oscillator, Burgers equation, and Brusselator reaction-diffusion system) demonstrates the framework's effectiveness. The results show significant improvements, with testing losses reduced by 40% to 80% compared to traditional approaches. This validates MF-LNO as a versatile tool for surrogate modeling in parametric PDEs, offering significant improvements in data efficiency and uncertainty-aware prediction.</description>

      <title>Worth Their Weight: Randomized and Regularized Block Kaczmarz Algorithms without Preprocessing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the ever growing amounts of data leveraged for machine learning and scientific computing, it is increasingly important to develop algorithms that sample only a small portion of the data at a time. In the case of linear least-squares, the randomized block Kaczmarz method (RBK) is an appealing example of such an algorithm, but its convergence is only understood under sampling distributions that require potentially prohibitively expensive preprocessing steps. To address this limitation, we analyze RBK when the data is sampled uniformly, showing that its iterates converge in a Monte Carlo sense to a $\textit{weighted}$ least-squares solution. Unfortunately, for general problems the condition number of the weight matrix and the variance of the iterates can become arbitrarily large. We resolve these issues by incorporating regularization into the RBK iterations. Numerical experiments, including examples arising from natural gradient optimization, suggest that the regularized algorithm, ReBlocK, outperforms minibatch stochastic gradient descent for realistic problems that exhibit fast singular value decay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic differential equations have proved to be a valuable governing framework for many real-world systems which exhibit ``noise'' or randomness in their evolution. One quality of interest in such systems is the shape of their equilibrium probability distribution, if such a thing exists. In some cases a straightforward integral equation may yield this steady-state distribution, but in other cases the equilibrium distribution exists and yet that integral equation diverges. Here we establish a new equilibrium-analysis technique based on the logic of finite-timestep simulation which allows us to glean information about the equilibrium regardless -- in particular, a relationship between the raw moments of the equilibrium distribution. We utilize this technique to extract information about one such equilibrium resistant to direct definition.</description>

      <title>Extending the Lattice Boltzmann Method to Non-linear Solid Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work outlines a Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) for geometrically and constitutively nonlinear solid mechanics to simulate large deformations under dynamic loading conditions. The method utilizes the moment chain approach, where the nonlinear constitutive law is incorporated via a forcing term. Stress and deformation measures are expressed in the reference configuration. Finite difference schemes are employed for gradient and divergence computations, and Neumann- and Dirichlet-type boundary conditions are introduced.
  Numerical studies are performed to assess the proposed method and illustrate its capabilities. Benchmark tests for weakly dynamic uniaxial tension and simple shear across a range of Poisson's ratios demonstrate the feasibility of the scheme and serve as validation of the implementation. Furthermore, a dynamic test case involving the propagation of bending waves in a cantilever beam highlights the potential of the method to model complex dynamic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Diffusion at Absolute Zero: Langevin Sampling Using Successive Moreau Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we propose a novel method for sampling from Gibbs distributions of the form $\pi(x)\propto\exp(-U(x))$ with a potential $U(x)$. In particular, inspired by diffusion models we propose to consider a sequence $(\pi^{t_k})_k$ of approximations of the target density, for which $\pi^{t_k}\approx \pi$ for $k$ small and, on the other hand, $\pi^{t_k}$ exhibits favorable properties for sampling for $k$ large. This sequence is obtained by replacing parts of the potential $U$ by its Moreau envelopes. Sampling is performed in an Annealed Langevin type procedure, that is, sequentially sampling from $\pi^{t_k}$ for decreasing $k$, effectively guiding the samples from a simple starting density to the more complex target. In addition to a theoretical analysis we show experimental results supporting the efficacy of the method in terms of increased convergence speed and applicability to multi-modal densities $\pi$.</description>

Abstract: Mathematical modelling of coupled flow systems containing a free-flow region in contact with a porous medium is challenging, especially for arbitrary flow directions to the fluid--porous interface. Transport processes in the free flow and porous medium are typically described by distinct equations: the Stokes equations and Darcy's law, respectively, with an appropriate set of coupling conditions at the common interface. Classical interface conditions based on the Beavers--Joseph condition are not accurate for general flows. Several generalisations are recently developed for arbitrary flows at the interface, some of them are however only theoretically formulated and still need to be validated.
  In this manuscript, we propose an alternative to couple free flow and porous-medium flow, namely, the hybrid-dimensional Stokes--Brinkman--Darcy model. Such formulation incorporates the averaged Brinkman equations within a complex interface between the free-flow and porous-medium regions. The complex interface acts as a buffer zone facilitating storage and transport of mass and momentum and the model is applicable for arbitrary flow directions. We validate the proposed hybrid-dimensional model against the pore-scale resolved model in multiple examples and compare numerical simulation results also with the classical and generalised coupling conditions from the literature. The proposed hybrid-dimensional model demonstrates its applicability to describe arbitrary coupled flows and shows its advantages in comparison to other generalised coupling conditions.</description>

      <title>Can message-passing GNN approximate triangular factorizations of sparse matrices?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01397v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fundamental limitations of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for learning sparse matrix preconditioners. While recent works have shown promising results using GNNs to predict incomplete factorizations, we demonstrate that the local nature of message passing creates inherent barriers for capturing non-local dependencies required for optimal preconditioning. We introduce a new benchmark dataset of matrices where good sparse preconditioners exist but require non-local computations, constructed using both synthetic examples and real-world matrices. Our experimental results show that current GNN architectures struggle to approximate these preconditioners, suggesting the need for new architectural approaches beyond traditional message passing networks. We provide theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to explain these limitations, with implications for the broader use of GNNs in numerical linear algebra.</description>

      <title>Assessing the use of Diffusion models for motion artifact correction in brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging generally requires long exposure times, while being sensitive to patient motion, resulting in artifacts in the acquired images, which may hinder their diagnostic relevance. Despite research efforts to decrease the acquisition time, and designing efficient acquisition sequences, motion artifacts are still a persistent problem, pushing toward the need for the development of automatic motion artifact correction techniques. Recently, diffusion models have been proposed as a solution for the task at hand. While diffusion models can produce high-quality reconstructions, they are also susceptible to hallucination, which poses risks in diagnostic applications. In this study, we critically evaluate the use of diffusion models for correcting motion artifacts in 2D brain MRI scans. Using a popular benchmark dataset, we compare a diffusion model-based approach with state-of-the-art methods consisting of Unets trained in a supervised fashion on motion-affected images to reconstruct ground truth motion-free images. Our findings reveal mixed results: diffusion models can produce accurate predictions or generate harmful hallucinations in this context, depending on data heterogeneity and the acquisition planes considered as input.</description>

      <title>Efficient approximation of high-frequency Helmholtz solutions by Gaussian coherent states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.04851v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce new finite-dimensional spaces specifically designed to approximate the solutions to high-frequency Helmholtz problems with smooth variable coefficients in dimension $d$. These discretization spaces are spanned by Gaussian coherent states, that have the key property to be localised in phase space. We carefully select the Gaussian coherent states spanning the approximation space by exploiting the (known) micro-localisation properties of the solution. For a large class of source terms (including plane-wave scattering problems), this choice leads to discrete spaces that provide a uniform approximation error for all wavenumber $k$ with a number of degrees of freedom scaling as $k^{d-1/2}$, which we rigorously establish. In comparison, for discretization spaces based on (piecewise) polynomials, the number of degrees of freedom has to scale at least as $k^d$ to achieve the same property. These theoretical results are illustrated by one-dimensional numerical examples, where the proposed discretization spaces are coupled with a least-squares variational formulation.</description>

      <title>Construction of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation using the Newton-Kaczmarz method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.08194v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that any continuous multivariate function can be represented exactly by a composition functions of a single variable - the so-called Kolmogorov-Arnold representation. It can be a convenient tool for tasks where it is required to obtain a predictive model that maps some vector input of a black box system into a scalar output. In this case, the representation may not be exact, and it is more correct to refer to such structure as the Kolmogorov-Arnold model (or, as more recently popularised, 'network'). Construction of such model based on the recorded input-output data is a challenging task. In the present paper, it is suggested to decompose the underlying functions of the representation into continuous basis functions and parameters. It is then proposed to find the parameters using the Newton-Kaczmarz method for solving systems of non-linear equations. The algorithm is then modified to support parallelisation. The paper demonstrates that such approach is also an excellent tool for data-driven solution of partial differential equations. Numerical examples show that for the considered model, the Newton-Kaczmarz method for parameter estimation is efficient and more robust with respect to the section of the initial guess than the straightforward application of the Gauss-Newton method. Finally, the Kolmogorov-Arnold model is compared to the MATLAB's built-in neural networks on a relatively large-scale problem (25 inputs, datasets of 10 million records), significantly outperforming the multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) in this particular problem (4-10 minutes vs. 4-8 hours of training time, as well as higher accuracy, lower CPU usage, and smaller memory footprint).</description>

      <title>Numerical schemes for a multi-species quantum BGK model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the numerical implementation of the quantum Bhatnagar- Gross-Krook (BGK) model for gas mixtures consisting of classical and quantum particles (fermions, bosons). We consider the model proposed by Bae, Klingenberg, Pirner, and Yun in 2021 and implement an Implicit-Explicit (IMEX) scheme due to the stiffness of the collision operator. A major obstacle is updating the parameters of quantum local equilibrium, which requires computing by inverting the relation between density and energy at every grid point in space and time. We address this difficulty by using the Lagrange multiplier method to minimize a potential function subject to constraints defined by specific moment equalities. Moreover, we analyze the convergence of mean velocity and temperature between the species both analytically and numerically. When a quantum component is included, we observe that the converging quantity is physical temperature, not the kinetic temperature. This differs from the mixture of classical species.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Methods for Shape Optimization Problems in Liquid Crystal Tactoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.04022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropic fluids, such as nematic liquid crystals, can form non-spherical equilibrium shapes known as tactoids. Predicting the shape of these structures as a function of material parameters is challenging and paradigmatic of a broader class of problems that combine shape and order. Here, we consider a discrete shape optimization approach with finite elements to find the configuration of two-dimensional and three-dimensional tactoids using the Landau--de Gennes framework and a Q-tensor representation. Efficient solution of the resulting constrained energy minimization problem is achieved using a quasi-Newton and nested iteration algorithm. Numerical validation is performed with benchmark solutions and compared against experimental data and earlier work. We explore physically motivated subproblems, whereby the shape and order are separately held fixed, respectively, to explore the role of both and examine material parameter dependence of the convergence. Nested iteration significantly improves both the computational cost and convergence of numerical solutions of these highly deformable materials.</description>

      <title>Local Reduced-Order Modeling for Electrostatic Plasmas by Physics-Informed Solution Manifold Decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18493v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite advancements in high-performance computing and modern numerical algorithms, computational cost remains prohibitive for multi-query kinetic plasma simulations. In this work, we develop data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) for collisionless electrostatic plasma dynamics, based on the kinetic Vlasov-Poisson equation. Our ROM approach projects the equation onto a linear subspace defined by the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) modes. We introduce an efficient tensorial method to update the nonlinear term using a precomputed third-order tensor. We capture multiscale behavior with a minimal number of POD modes by decomposing the solution manifold into multiple time windows and creating temporally local ROMs. We consider two strategies for decomposition: one based on the physical time and the other based on the electric field energy. Applied to the 1D1V Vlasov-Poisson simulations, that is, prescribed E-field, Landau damping, and two-stream instability, we demonstrate that our ROMs accurately capture the total energy of the system both for parametric and time extrapolation cases. The temporally local ROMs are more efficient and accurate than the single ROM. In addition, in the two-stream instability case, we show that the energy-windowing reduced-order model (EW-ROM) is more efficient and accurate than the time-windowing reduced-order model (TW-ROM). With the tensorial approach, EW-ROM solves the equation approximately 90 times faster than Eulerian simulations while maintaining a maximum relative error of 7.5% for the training data and 11% for the testing data.</description>

Abstract: The growth factor in Gaussian elimination measures how large the entries of an LU factorization can be relative to the entries of the original matrix. It is a key parameter in error estimates, and one of the most fundamental topics in numerical analysis. We produce an upper bound of $n^{0.2079 \ln n +0.91}$ for the growth factor in Gaussian elimination with complete pivoting -- the first improvement upon Wilkinson's original 1961 bound of $2 \, n ^{0.25\ln n +0.5}$.</description>

Abstract: The Golub-Welsch algorithm [ Math. Comp., 23: 221-230 (1969)] has long been assumed symmetric for estimating quadratic forms. Recent research indicates that asymmetric quadrature nodes may be more often and the existence of a practical symmetric quadrature for estimating matrix quadratic form is even doubtful.This paper derives a sufficient condition for symmetric quadrature nodes for estimating quadratic forms involving the Jordan-Wielandt matrices which frequently arise from many applications. The condition is closely related to how to construct an initial vector for the underlying Lanczos process. Applications of such constructive results are demonstrated by estimating the Estrada index in complex network analysis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13123v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incomplete factorizations have long been popular general-purpose algebraic preconditioners for solving large sparse linear systems of equations. Guaranteeing the factorization is breakdown free while computing a high quality preconditioner is challenging. A resurgence of interest in using low precision arithmetic makes the search for robustness more important and more challenging. In this paper, we focus on ill-conditioned symmetric positive definite problems and explore a number of approaches for preventing and handling breakdowns: prescaling of the system matrix, a look-ahead strategy to anticipate breakdown as early as possible, the use of global shifts, and a modification of an idea developed in the field of numerical optimization for the complete Cholesky factorization of dense matrices. Our numerical simulations target highly ill-conditioned sparse linear systems with the goal of computing the factors in half precision arithmetic and then achieving double precision accuracy using mixed precision refinement. We also consider the often overlooked issue of growth in the sizes of entries in the factors that can occur when using any precision and can render the computed factors ineffective as preconditioners.</description>

Abstract: Mixed methods for linear elasticity with strongly symmetric stresses of lowest order are studied in this paper. On each simplex, the stress space has piecewise linear components with respect to its Alfeld split (which connects the vertices to barycenter), generalizing the Johnson-Mercier two-dimensional element to higher dimensions. Further reductions in the stress space in the three-dimensional case (to 24 degrees of freedom per tetrahedron) are possible when the displacement space is reduced to local rigid displacements. Proofs of optimal error estimates of numerical solutions and improved error estimates via postprocessing and the duality argument are presented.</description>

Abstract: This work investigates the online machine learning problem of prediction with expert advice in an adversarial setting through numerical analysis of, and experiments with, a related partial differential equation. The problem is a repeated two-person game involving decision-making at each step informed by $n$ experts in an adversarial environment. The continuum limit of this game over a large number of steps is a degenerate elliptic equation whose solution encodes the optimal strategies for both players. We develop numerical methods for approximating the solution of this equation in relatively high dimensions ($n\leq 10$) by exploiting symmetries in the equation and the solution to drastically reduce the size of the computational domain. Based on our numerical results we make a number of conjectures about the optimality of various adversarial strategies, in particular about the non-optimality of the COMB strategy.</description>

Abstract: We develop a high order accurate numerical method for solving the elastic wave equation in second-order form. We hybridize the computationally efficient Cartesian grid formulation of finite differences with geometrically flexible discontinuous Galerkin methods on unstructured grids by a penalty based technique. At the interface between the two methods, we construct projection operators for the pointwise finite difference solutions and discontinuous Galerkin solutions based on piecewise polynomials. In addition, we optimize the projection operators for both accuracy and spectrum. We prove that the overall discretization conserves a discrete energy, and verify optimal convergence in numerical experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to introduce a new methodology for constructing morphings between shapes that have identical topology. The morphings are obtained by deforming a reference shape, through the resolution of a sequence of linear elasticity equations, onto every target shape. In particular, our approach does not assume any knowledge of a boundary parametrization, and the computation of the boundary deformation is not required beforehand. Furthermore, constraints can be imposed on specific points, lines and surfaces in the reference domain to ensure alignment with their counterparts in the target domain after morphing. Additionally, we show how the proposed methodology can be integrated in an offline and online paradigm, which is useful in reduced-order modeling involving variable shapes. This framework facilitates the efficient computation of the morphings in various geometric configurations, thus improving the versatility and applicability of the approach. The robustness and computational efficiency of the methodology is illustrated on two-dimensional test cases, including the regression problem of the drag and lift coefficients of airfoils of non-parameterized variable shapes.</description>

      <title>Three-precision iterative refinement with parameter regularization and prediction for solving large sparse linear systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04229v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a novel mixed-precision iterative refinement algorithm, GADI-IR, within the general alternating-direction implicit (GADI) framework, designed for efficiently solving large-scale sparse linear systems. By employing low-precision arithmetic, particularly half-precision (FP16), for computationally intensive inner iterations, the method achieves substantial acceleration while maintaining high numerical accuracy. Key challenges such as overflow in FP16 and convergence issues for low precision are addressed through careful backward error analysis and the application of a regularization parameter $\alpha$. Furthermore, the integration of low-precision arithmetic into the parameter prediction process, using Gaussian process regression (GPR), significantly reduces computational time without degrading performance. The method is particularly effective for large-scale linear systems arising from discretized partial differential equations and other high-dimensional problems, where both accuracy and efficiency are critical. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the use of FP16 and mixed-precision strategies not only accelerates computation but also ensures robust convergence, making the approach advantageous for various applications. The results highlight the potential of leveraging lower-precision arithmetic to achieve superior computational efficiency in high-performance computing.</description>

      <title>A posteriori error estimates for the Lindblad master equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We are interested in the simulation of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space. To simulate the solution of this equation, the standard approach involves two sequential approximations: first, we truncate the Hilbert space to derive a differential equation in a finite-dimensional subspace. Then, we use discrete time-step to obtain a numerical solution to the finite-dimensional evolution.
  In this paper, we establish bounds for these two approximations that can be explicitely computed to guarantee the accuracy of the numerical results. Through numerical examples, we demonstrate the efficiency of our method, empirically highlighting the tightness of the upper bound. While adaptive time-stepping is already a common practice in the time discretization of the Lindblad equation, we extend this approach by showing how to dynamically adjust the truncation of the Hilbert space. This enables fully adaptive simulations of the density matrix. For large-scale simulations, this approach significantly reduces computational time and relieves users of the challenge of selecting an appropriate truncation.</description>

Abstract: In this article, the time-discretization of the fluid structure interaction model in the three-dimensional boundary domain is taken into account, which explains the mechanical interaction between the blood flow and the Hookean elasticity. The interface between the two phases is given by a soft transition layer and spreads to the finite thickness. On the implicit Euler scheme for this discretization, We derive a variety of priori estimates and then use the Faedo-Galerkin method to prove the local well-poseedness results.</description>

      <title>A New Approach for Fourier Extension Based on Weighted Generalized Inverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the Fourier extension from a new perspective of solving the compact operator equation with perturbed data. By converting the approximation target from the best approximate solution to the weighted best approximate solution, the oscillation in the extended region has been overcome. The error estimation of the solution is theoretically established. Furthermore, we point out the difficulties faced by the original weighted operator in calculation due to the limitation of machine precision and propose an effective correction operator. The relevant parameters involved in the method are further tested, and finally the effectiveness of the method is verified through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Towards a Foundation Model for Partial Differential Equations: Multi-Operator Learning and Extrapolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foundation models, such as large language models, have demonstrated success in addressing various language and image processing tasks. In this work, we introduce a multi-modal foundation model for scientific problems, named PROSE-PDE. Our model, designed for bi-modality to bi-modality learning, is a multi-operator learning approach which can predict future states of spatiotemporal systems while concurrently learning the underlying governing equations of the physical system. Specifically, we focus on multi-operator learning by training distinct one-dimensional time-dependent nonlinear constant coefficient partial differential equations, with potential applications to many physical applications including physics, geology, and biology. More importantly, we provide three extrapolation studies to demonstrate that PROSE-PDE can generalize physical features through the robust training of multiple operators and that the proposed model can extrapolate to predict PDE solutions whose models or data were unseen during the training. Furthermore, we show through systematic numerical experiments that the utilization of the symbolic modality in our model effectively resolves the well-posedness problems with training multiple operators and thus enhances our model's predictive capabilities.</description>

      <title>Learning from Linear Algebra: A Graph Neural Network Approach to Preconditioner Design for Conjugate Gradient Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15557v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large linear systems are ubiquitous in modern computational science and engineering. The main recipe for solving them is the use of Krylov subspace iterative methods with well-designed preconditioners. Recently, GNNs have been shown to be a promising tool for designing preconditioners to reduce the overall computational cost of iterative methods by constructing them more efficiently than with classical linear algebra techniques. Preconditioners designed with these approaches cannot outperform those designed with classical methods in terms of the number of iterations in CG. In our work, we recall well-established preconditioners from linear algebra and use them as a starting point for training the GNN to obtain preconditioners that reduce the condition number of the system more significantly than classical preconditioners. Numerical experiments show that our approach outperforms both classical and neural network-based methods for an important class of parametric partial differential equations. We also provide a heuristic justification for the loss function used and show that preconditioners obtained by learning with this loss function reduce the condition number in a more desirable way for CG.</description>

      <title>Scalable diffusion posterior sampling in infinite-dimensional inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models (SDMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for sampling from the posterior distribution in Bayesian inverse problems. However, existing methods often require multiple evaluations of the forward mapping to generate a single sample, resulting in significant computational costs for large-scale inverse problems. To address this issue, we propose a scalable diffusion posterior sampling (SDPS) method to bypass forward mapping evaluations during sampling by shifting computational effort to an offline training phase, where a task-dependent score is learned based on the forward mapping. Crucially, the conditional posterior score is then derived from this trained score using affine transformations, ensuring no conditional score approximation is needed. The approach is shown to generalize to infinite-dimensional diffusion models and is validated through rigorous convergence analysis and high-dimensional CT imaging experiments.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for fast and accurate statistical computation of fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generative AI algorithm for addressing the pressing task of fast, accurate, and robust statistical computation of three-dimensional turbulent fluid flows. Our algorithm, termed as GenCFD, is based on an end-to-end conditional score-based diffusion model. Through extensive numerical experimentation with a set of challenging fluid flows, we demonstrate that GenCFD provides an accurate approximation of relevant statistical quantities of interest while also efficiently generating high-quality realistic samples of turbulent fluid flows and ensuring excellent spectral resolution. In contrast, ensembles of deterministic ML algorithms, trained to minimize mean square errors, regress to the mean flow. We present rigorous theoretical results uncovering the surprising mechanisms through which diffusion models accurately generate fluid flows. These mechanisms are illustrated with solvable toy models that exhibit the mathematically relevant features of turbulent fluid flows while being amenable to explicit analytical formulae. Our codes are publicly available at https://github.com/camlab-ethz/GenCFD.</description>

Abstract: We investigate when the algebraic numerical range is a $C$-spectral set in a Banach algebra. While providing several counterexamples based on classical ideas as well as combinatorial Banach spaces, we discuss positive results for matrix algebras and provide an absolute constant in the case of complex $2\times2$-matrices with the induced $1$-norm. Furthermore, we discuss positive results for infinite-dimensional Banach algebras, including the Calkin algebra.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Perfusion Reconstruction with Time Separation Technique in Cone-Beam CT Dynamic Liver Perfusion Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16450v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The success of embolisation, a minimally invasive treatment of liver cancer, could be evaluated in the operational room with cone-beam CT by acquiring a dynamic perfusion scan. The reconstruction algorithm must address the issues of low temporal sampling and higher noise levels inherent in cone-beam CT systems, compared to conventional CT. Therefore, a model-based perfusion reconstruction based on the time separation technique (TST) was applied. TST uses basis functions to model time attenuation curves. These functions are either analytical or based on prior knowledge, extracted using singular value decomposition from CT perfusion data. To explore how well the prior knowledge can model perfusion dynamics and what the potential limitations are, the dynamic CBCT perfusion scan was simulated under different noise levels. The TST method was compared to static reconstruction. It was demonstrated that a set consisting of only four basis functions results in perfusion maps that preserve relevant information, denoises the data, and outperforms static reconstruction under higher noise levels. TST with prior knowledge would not only outperform static reconstruction, but also the TST with analytical basis functions. Furthermore, it has been shown that only eight CBCT rotations, unlike previously assumed ten, are sufficient to obtain the perfusion maps comparable to the reference CT perfusion maps. This contributes to saving dose and reconstruction time. The real dynamic CBCT perfusion scan, reconstructed under the same conditions as the simulated scan, shows potential for maintaining the accuracy of the perfusion maps. By visual inspection, the embolised region was matching to that in corresponding CT perfusion maps. Further analysis of a larger cohort of patient data is needed to draw final conclusions regarding the expected advantages of the time separation technique.</description>

      <title>An accelerated gradient method with adaptive restart for convex multiobjective optimization problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07863v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, based on the continuous time approach, we propose an accelerated gradient method with adaptive residual restart for convex multiobjective optimization problems. For the first, we derive rigorously the continuous limit of the multiobjective accelerated proximal gradient method by Tanabe et al. [Comput. Optim. Appl., 2023]. It is a second-order ordinary differential equation (ODE) that involves a special projection operator and can be viewed as an extension of the ODE by Su et al. [J. Mach. Learn. Res., 2016] for Nesterov acceleration. Then, we introduce a novel accelerated multiobjective gradient (AMG) flow with tailored time scaling that adapts automatically to the convex case and the strongly convex case, and the exponential decay rate of a merit function along with the solution trajectory of AMG flow is established via the Lyapunov analysis. After that, we consider an implicit-explicit time discretization and obtain an accelerated multiobjective gradient method with a convex quadratic programming subproblem. The fast sublinear rate and linear rate are proved respectively for convex and strongly convex problems. In addition, we present an efficient residual based adaptive restart technique to overcome the oscillation issue and improve the convergence significantly. Numerical results are provided to validate the practical performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of tensor networks (TNs) to the simulation of material deformations within the framework of linear elasticity. Material simulations are essential computational tools extensively used in both academic research and industrial applications. TNs, originally developed in quantum mechanics, have recently shown promise in solving partial differential equations (PDEs) due to their potential for exponential speedups over classical algorithms. Our study successfully employs TNs to solve linear elasticity equations with billions of degrees of freedom, achieving exponential reductions in both memory usage and computational time. These results demonstrate the practical viability of TNs as a powerful classical backend for executing quantum-inspired algorithms with significant efficiency gains. This work is based on our research conducted with IKERLAN.</description>
