      <title>Mean Field Analysis of Mutual Insurance Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mutual insurance company (MIC) is a type of consumer cooperative owned by its policyholders. By purchasing insurance from an MIC, policyholders effectively become member-owners of the company and are entitled to a share of the surplus, which is determined by their own collective claims and premium contributions. This sharing mechanism creates an interactive environment in which individual insurance strategies are influenced by the actions of others. Given that mutual insurers account for nearly one-third of the global insurance market, the analysis of members' behavior under such a sharing mechanism is of both practical and theoretical importance. This article presents a first dynamic study of members' behavior in the prevalent mutual insurance market under the large-population limit. With members' wealth processes depending on the law of the insurance strategies, we model the surplus-sharing mechanism using an extended mean field game (MFG) framework and address the fundamental question of how strategic interactions in this setting influence individual decisions. Mathematically, we establish the global-in-time existence and uniqueness of the mean field forward-backward stochastic differential equation (MF-FBSDE) characterizing the Nash equilibrium strategy, employing techniques to accommodate realistic insurance constraints. Computationally, we develop a modified deep BSDE algorithm capable of solving the extended MFG problem with an additional fixed-point structure on the control. Utilizing this scheme, we examine how structural features of the MIC's design, such as the composition of risk classes and surplus-sharing proportions, reshape members' decisions and wealth through collective interactions, underscoring the central role of these mechanisms in MICs.</description>

      <title>Sharpening Shapley Allocation: from Basel 2.5 to FRTB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Risk allocation, the decomposition of a portfolio-wide risk measure into component contributions, is a fundamental problem in financial risk management due to the non-additive nature of risk measures, the layered organizational structures of financial institutions and the range of possible allocation strategies characterized by different rationales and properties.
  In this work, we conduct a systematic review of the major risk allocation strategies typically used in finance, comparing their theoretical properties, practical advantages, and limitations. To this scope we set up a specific testing framework, including both simplified settings, designed to highlight basic intrinsic behaviours, and realistic financial portfolios under different risk regulations, i.e. Basel 2.5 and FRTB. Furthermore, we develop and test novel practical solutions to manage the issue of negative risk allocations and of multi-level risk allocation in the layered organizational structure of financial institutions, while preserving the additivity property. Finally, we devote particular attention to the computational aspects of risk allocation.
  Our results show that, in this context, the Shapley allocation strategy offers the best compromise between simplicity, mathematical properties, risk representation and computational cost. The latter is still acceptable even in the challenging case of many business units, provided that an efficient Monte Carlo simulation is employed, which offers excellent scaling and convergence properties. While our empirical applications focus on market risk, our methodological framework is fully general and applicable to other financial context such as valuation risk, liquidity risk, credit risk, and counterparty credit risk.</description>

      <title>Static marginal expected shortfall: Systemic risk measurement under dependence uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19953v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Measuring the contribution of a bank or an insurance company to overall systemic risk is a key concern, particularly in the aftermath of the 2007--2009 financial crisis and the 2020 downturn. In this paper, we derive worst-case and best-case bounds for the marginal expected shortfall (MES) -- a key measure of systemic risk contribution -- under the assumption that individual firms' risk distributions are known but their dependence structure is not. We further derive tighter MES bounds when partial information on companies' risk exposures, and thus their dependence, is available. To represent this partial information, we employ three standard factor models: additive, minimum-based, and multiplicative background risk models. Additionally, we propose an alternative set of improved MES bounds based on a linear relationship between firm-specific and market-wide risks, consistent with the Capital Asset Pricing Model in finance and the Weighted Insurance Pricing Model in insurance. Finally, empirical analyses demonstrate the practical relevance of the theoretical bounds for industry practitioners and policymakers.</description>

      <title>Compensation-based risk-sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19511v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the mathematical problem of allocating payouts (compensations) in an endowment contingency fund using a risk-sharing rule that satisfies full allocation. Besides the participants, an administrator manages the fund by collecting ex-ante contributions to establish the fund and distributing ex-post payouts to members. Two types of administrators are considered. An 'active' administrator both invests in the fund and receives the payout of the fund when no participant receives a payout. A 'passive' administrator performs only administrative tasks and neither invests in nor receives a payout from the fund. We analyze the actuarial fairness of both compensation-based risk-sharing schemes and provide general conditions under which fairness is achieved. The results extend earlier work by Denuit and Robert (2025) and Dhaene and Milevsky (2024), who focused on payouts based on Bernoulli distributions, by allowing for general non-negative loss distributions.</description>

      <title>On the Estimation of Own Funds for Life Insurers: A Study of Direct, Indirect, and Control Variate Methods in a Risk-Neutral Pricing Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Solvency Capital Requirement (SCR) calculation under Solvency II is computationally intensive, relying on the market-consistent estimation of own funds. While regulation mandates the direct estimation method, it results in the same estimate as the indirect method under consistent assumptions as shown by Girard (2002). This paper studies their comparative properties to offer new insights into their practical performance. First, we provide a straightforward proof that the direct and indirect estimators for own funds converge to the same value. Second, we introduce a novel family of mixed estimators that encompasses the direct and indirect methods as its edge cases. Third, we leverage these estimators to develop powerful variance reduction techniques, constructing a single control variate from the direct and indirect estimators and a multi-control variate framework using subsets of the mixed family. These techniques can be combined with existing methods like Least-Squares Monte Carlo. We evaluate the estimators on three simplified asset-liability management models of a German life insurer, Bauer's model MUST and IS case by Bauer, Kiesel et al. (2006), and openIRM by Wolf et al. (2025). Our analysis confirms that neither the direct nor indirect estimator is universally superior, though the indirect method consistently outperforms the direct one in more realistic settings. The proposed control variate techniques show significant potential, in some cases reducing variance to one-tenth of that from the standard direct estimator. However, we also identify scenarios where improvements are marginal, highlighting the model-dependent nature of their efficacy.

      <title>FCOC: A Fractal-Chaotic Co-driven Framework for Financial Volatility Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Fractal-Chaotic Oscillation Co-driven (FCOC) framework, a novel paradigm for financial volatility forecasting that systematically resolves the dual challenges of feature fidelity and model responsiveness. FCOC synergizes two core innovations: our novel Fractal Feature Corrector (FFC), engineered to extract high-fidelity fractal signals, and a bio-inspired Chaotic Oscillation Component (COC) that replaces static activations with a dynamic processing system. Empirically validated on the S\&amp;P 500 and DJI, the FCOC framework demonstrates profound and generalizable impact. The framework fundamentally transforms the performance of previously underperforming architectures, such as the Transformer, while achieving substantial improvements in key risk-sensitive metrics for state-of-the-art models like Mamba. These results establish a powerful co-driven approach, where models are guided by superior theoretical features and powered by dynamic internal processors, setting a new benchmark for risk-aware forecasting.</description>

      <title>Optimal Quoting under Adverse Selection and Price Reading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Over the past decade, many dealers have implemented algorithmic models to automatically respond to RFQs and manage flows originating from their electronic platforms. In parallel, building on the foundational work of Ho and Stoll, and later Avellaneda and Stoikov, the academic literature on market making has expanded to address trade size distributions, client tiering, complex price dynamics, alpha signals, and the internalization versus externalization dilemma in markets with dealer-to-client and interdealer-broker segments. In this paper, we tackle two critical dimensions: adverse selection, arising from the presence of informed traders, and price reading, whereby the market maker's own quotes inadvertently reveal the direction of their inventory. These risks are well known to practitioners, who routinely face informed flows and algorithms capable of extracting signals from quoting behavior. Yet they have received limited attention in the quantitative finance literature, beyond stylized toy models with limited actionability. Extending the existing literature, we propose a tractable and implementable framework that enables market makers to adjust their quotes with greater awareness of informational risk.</description>
