      <title>Modelling parametric uncertainty in PDEs models via Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an approach enabling one to employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for uncertainty quantification. Our approach is applicable to systems where observations are scarce (or even lacking), these being typical situations associated with subsurface water bodies. Our novel physics-informed neural network under uncertainty (PINN-UU) integrates the space-time domain across which processes take place and uncertain parameter spaces within a unique computational domain. PINN-UU is then trained to satisfy the relevant physical principles (e.g., mass conservation) in the defined input domain. We employ a stage training approach via transfer learning to accommodate high-dimensional solution spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PINN-UU in a scenario associated with reactive transport in porous media, showcasing its reliability, efficiency, and applicability to sensitivity analysis. PINN-UU emerges as a promising tool for robust uncertainty quantification, with broad applicability to groundwater systems. As such, it can be considered as a valuable alternative to traditional methods such as multi-realization Monte Carlo simulations based on direct solvers or black-box surrogate models.</description>

      <title>Identification of the parameters of complex constitutive models: Least squares minimization vs. Bayesian updating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study the common least-squares minimization approach is compared to the Bayesian updating procedure. In the content of material parameter identification the posterior parameter density function is obtained from its prior and the likelihood function of the measurements. By using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm \cite{Hastings1970}, the global density function including local peaks can be computed. Thus this procedure enables an accurate evaluation of the global parameter quality. However, the computational effort is remarkable larger compared to the minimization approach. Thus several methodologies for an efficient approximation of the likelihood function are discussed in the present study.</description>

      <title>Scalable learning of potentials to predict time-dependent Hartree-Fock dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to learn the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) inter-electronic potential of a molecule from its electron density dynamics. Though the entire TDHF Hamiltonian, including the inter-electronic potential, can be computed from first principles, we use this problem as a testbed to develop strategies that can be applied to learn \emph{a priori} unknown terms that arise in other methods/approaches to quantum dynamics, e.g., emerging problems such as learning exchange-correlation potentials for time-dependent density functional theory. We develop, train, and test three models of the TDHF inter-electronic potential, each parameterized by a four-index tensor of size up to $60 \times 60 \times 60 \times 60$. Two of the models preserve Hermitian symmetry, while one model preserves an eight-fold permutation symmetry that implies Hermitian symmetry. Across seven different molecular systems, we find that accounting for the deeper eight-fold symmetry leads to the best-performing model across three metrics: training efficiency, test set predictive power, and direct comparison of true and learned inter-electronic potentials. All three models, when trained on ensembles of field-free trajectories, generate accurate electron dynamics predictions even in a field-on regime that lies outside the training set. To enable our models to scale to large molecular systems, we derive expressions for Jacobian-vector products that enable iterative, matrix-free training.</description>

      <title>A Pipeline for Data-Driven Learning of Topological Features with Applications to Protein Stability Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to learn interpretable topological features of biomolecular data and demonstrate the efficacy of parsimonious models trained on topological features in predicting the stability of synthetic mini proteins. We compare models that leverage automatically-learned structural features against models trained on a large set of biophysical features determined by subject-matter experts (SME). Our models, based only on topological features of the protein structures, achieved 92%-99% of the performance of SME-based models in terms of the average precision score. By interrogating model performance and feature importance metrics, we extract numerous insights that uncover high correlations between topological features and SME features. We further showcase how combining topological features and SME features can lead to improved model performance over either feature set used in isolation, suggesting that, in some settings, topological features may provide new discriminating information not captured in existing SME features that are useful for protein stability prediction.</description>

      <title>A model for efficient dynamical ranking in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a physics-inspired method for inferring dynamic rankings in directed temporal networks - networks in which each directed and timestamped edge reflects the outcome and timing of a pairwise interaction. The inferred ranking of each node is real-valued and varies in time as each new edge, encoding an outcome like a win or loss, raises or lowers the node's estimated strength or prestige, as is often observed in real scenarios including sequences of games, tournaments, or interactions in animal hierarchies. Our method works by solving a linear system of equations and requires only one parameter to be tuned. As a result, the corresponding algorithm is scalable and efficient. We test our method by evaluating its ability to predict interactions (edges' existence) and their outcomes (edges' directions) in a variety of applications, including both synthetic and real data. Our analysis shows that in many cases our method's performance is better than existing methods for predicting dynamic rankings and interaction outcomes.</description>

      <title>When Pearson $\chi^2$ and other divisible statistics are not goodness-of-fit tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09195v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thousands of experiments are analyzed and papers are published each year involving the statistical analysis of grouped data. While this area of statistics is often perceived - somewhat naively - as saturated, several misconceptions still affect everyday practice, and new frontiers have so far remained unexplored. Researchers must be aware of the limitations affecting their analyses and what are the new possibilities in their hands. Motivated by this need, the article introduces a unifying approach to the analysis of grouped data which allows us to study the class of divisible statistics - that includes Pearson's $\chi^2$, the likelihood ratio as special cases - with a fresh perspective. The contributions collected in this manuscript span from modeling and estimation to distribution-free goodness-of-fit tests. Perhaps the most surprising result presented here is that, in a sparse regime, all tests proposed in the literature are dominated by a class of weighted linear statistics.</description>
