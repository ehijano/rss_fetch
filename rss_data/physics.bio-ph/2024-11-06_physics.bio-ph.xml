      <title>Target search on networks-within-networks with applications to protein-DNA interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for understanding node target search in systems organized as hierarchical networks-within-networks. Our work generalizes traditional search models on complex networks, where the mean-first passage time is typically inversely proportional to the node degree. However, real-world search processes often span multiple network layers, such as moving from an external environment into a local network, and then navigating several internal states. This multilayered complexity appears in scenarios such as international travel networks, tracking email spammers, and the dynamics of protein-DNA interactions in cells. Our theory addresses these complex systems by modeling them as a three-layer multiplex network: an external source layer, an intermediate spatial layer, and an internal state layer. We derive general closed-form solutions for the steady-state flux through a target node, which serves as a proxy for inverse mean-first passage time. Our results reveal a universal relationship between search efficiency and network-specific parameters. This work extends the current understanding of multiplex networks by focusing on systems with hierarchically connected layers. Our findings have broad implications for fields ranging from epidemiology to cellular biology and provide a more comprehensive understanding of search dynamics in complex, multilayered environments.</description>

      <title>MA^2: A Self-Supervised and Motion Augmenting Autoencoder for Gait-Based Automatic Disease Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ground reaction force (GRF) is the force exerted by the ground on a body in contact with it. GRF-based automatic disease detection (ADD) has become an emerging medical diagnosis method, which aims to learn and identify disease patterns corresponding to different gait pressures based on deep learning methods. Although existing ADD methods can save doctors time in making diagnoses, training deep models still struggles with the cost caused by the labeling engineering for a large number of gait diagnostic data for subjects. On the other hand, the accuracy of the deep model under the unified benchmark GRF dataset and the generalization ability on scalable gait datasets need to be further improved. To address these issues, we propose MA2, a GRF-based self-supervised and motion augmenting auto-encoder, which models the ADD task as an encoder-decoder paradigm. In the encoder, we introduce an embedding block including the 3-layer 1D convolution for extracting the token and a mask generator to randomly mask out the sequence of tokens to maximize the model's potential to capture high-level, discriminative, intrinsic representations. whereafter, the decoder utilizes this information to reconstruct the pixel sequence of the origin input and calculate the reconstruction loss to optimize the network. Moreover, the backbone of an auto-encoder is multi-head self-attention that can consider the global information of the token from the input, not just the local neighborhood. This allows the model to capture generalized contextual information. Extensive experiments demonstrate MA2 has SOTA performance of 90.91% accuracy on 1% limited pathological GRF samples with labels, and good generalization ability of 78.57% accuracy on scalable Parkinson disease dataset.</description>

      <title>Constitutive Models for Active Skeletal Muscle: Review, Comparison, and Application in a Novel Continuum Shoulder Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shoulder joint is one of the functionally and anatomically most sophisticated articular systems in the human body. Both complex movement patterns and the stabilization of the highly mobile joint rely on intricate three-dimensional interactions among various components. Continuum-based finite element models can capture such complexity, and are thus particularly relevant in shoulder biomechanics. Considering their role as active joint stabilizers and force generators, skeletal muscles require special attention regarding their constitutive description. In this contribution, we propose a constitutive description to model active skeletal muscle within complex musculoskeletal systems, focusing on a novel continuum shoulder model. We thoroughly review existing material models before analyzing three selected ones in detail: an active-stress, an active-strain, and a generalized active-strain approach. To establish a basis for comparison, we identify the material parameters based on experimental stress-strain data obtained under various active and passive loading conditions. We discuss the concepts to incorporate active contractile behavior from a mathematical and physiological perspective, address analytical and numerical challenges arising from the mathematical formulations, and analyze the included biophysical principles of force generation in terms of physiological correctness and relevance for human shoulder modeling. Based on these insights, we present an improved constitutive model combining the studied models' most promising and relevant features. Using the example of a fusiform muscle, we investigate force generation, deformation, and kinematics during active isometric and free contractions. Eventually, we demonstrate the applicability of the suggested material model in a novel continuum mechanical model of the human shoulder.</description>

      <title>Extreme events at the onset of epileptic-like chimeras in small-world networks of FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the dynamics of complex networks of FitzHugh-Nagumo excitable oscillators, focusing on the impact of coupling strength, network size, and randomness on their collective dynamics. Considering Watts-Strogatz small-world network connectivities, the system exhibits three distinct dynamical phases: chaotic, intermittent, and synchronized, with the intermittent phase displaying transient, epileptic-like chimera states. We analyse the transition to synchronisation by means of the master stability function, and show that peaks in the proportion of extreme events of synchronisation, which correlate with the behaviour of the largest Lyapunov exponent of the system, precede the transitions between the distinct dynamical regimes and mark the onset of epileptic-like chimera states. Our findings contribute to a broader understanding of synchronisation in excitable systems real neural networks and offer insights into the conditions that may lead to pathological epileptic-like states. Furthermore, we discus the potential use of extreme events to study real neural data.</description>

      <title>Epithelial layer fluidization by curvature-induced unjamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transition of an epithelial layer from a stationary, quiescent state to a highly migratory, dynamic state is required for wound healing, development, and regeneration. This transition, known as the unjamming transition (UJT), is responsible for epithelial fluidization and collective migration. Previous theoretical models have primarily focused on the UJT in flat epithelial layers, neglecting the effects of strong surface curvature characteristic of the epithelium in vivo. In this study, we investigate the role of surface curvature on tissue plasticity and cellular migration using a vertex model embedded on a spherical surface. Our findings reveal that increasing curvature promotes the UJT by reducing the energy barriers to cellular rearrangements. Higher curvature favors cell intercalation, mobility, and self-diffusivity, resulting in epithelial structures that are malleable and migratory when small, but become more rigid and stationary as they grow. As such, the greater is the curvature the stronger becomes the tendency for curvature-induced unjamming to emerge as a novel mechanism promoting epithelial layer fluidization, malleability, and remodeling. Conversely, the lesser the curvature, as in tissue development and growth, the stronger becomes the tendency for jamming to emerge as a mechanism of progressive epithelial layer solidification and stabilization. Together, these results provide a conceptual framework to better understand how cell shape, cell propulsion, and tissue geometry contribute to tissue malleability, remodeling, and stabilization.</description>

      <title>Models of Animal Behavior as Active Particle Systems with Nonreciprocal Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active particle systems of interacting self-propelled particles offer a versatile framework for modeling complex systems. When employed to describe aspects of animal behavior, the complexity of animal movement and decision-making often requires the use of unique types of effective interactions between the particles -- notably nonreciprocal effective forces that do not obey the usual conservation laws of Newtonian mechanics. Here we review two recent empirically-motivated models, of two very different types of animal behavior, where the behavior is described in terms of active particles which interact through nonreciprocal effective forces. The first model describes the dynamics of animal contests, wherein typically two rivals fight over a localized resource. The uniquely shaped effective potentials between the model's 'contestant particles' manifest the adversarial nature of contest interactions and capture the dynamical essence of contest behavior in space and time. The second model describes the stabilization of cohesive swarms through long-range and adaptive gravity-like attraction. This 'adaptive gravity' model explains the observed mass and velocity profiles of laboratory midge swarms. These examples demonstrate that theoretical models that use the framework of active particles to describe animal behavior can expand the scope of active-particle research, as well as explain complex phenomena in animal behavior.</description>

      <title>xSCYTE: Express Single-frame Cytometer through Tomographic Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.03627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid, comprehensive, and accurate cell phenotyping without compromising viability, is crucial to many important biomedical applications, including stem-cell therapy, drug screening, and liquid biopsy. Typical image cytometry methods acquire two-dimensional (2D) fluorescence images, where the fluorescence labelling process may damage living cells, and the information from 2D images is not comprehensive enough for precise cell analysis. Although three-dimensional (3D) label-free image cytometry holds great promise, its high throughput development faces several technical challenges. Here, we report eXpress Single-frame CYtometer through Tomographic phasE (xSCYTE), which reconstructs 3D Refractive Index (RI) maps of cells with diffraction-limited resolution. With these high-speed and high-precision imaging capabilities empowered by artificial intelligence, we envision xSCYTE may open up many new avenues of biomedical investigations and industries, such as multi-omic assays and quality control during cellular therapeutic manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Stochastic trade-offs and the emergence of diversification in E. coli evolution experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11033v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Laboratory experiments with bacterial colonies, under well-controlled conditions often lead to evolutionary diversification, where at least two ecotypes emerge from an initially monomorphic population. Empirical evidence suggests that such ''evolutionary branching'' occurs stochastically, even under fixed and stable conditions. This stochastic nature is characterized by: (i) occurrence in a significant fraction, but not all, of experimental settings, (ii) emergence at widely varying times, and (iii) variable relative abundances of the resulting subpopulations across experiments. Theoretical approaches to understanding evolutionary branching under these conditions have been previously developed within the (deterministic) framework of ''adaptive dynamics''. Here, we advance the understanding of the stochastic nature of evolutionary outcomes by introducing the concept of ''stochastic trade-offs'' as opposed to ''hard'' ones. The key idea is that the stochasticity of mutations occurs in a high-dimensional trait space and this translates into variability that is constrained to a flexible tradeoff curve. By incorporating this additional source of stochasticity, we are able to account for the observed empirical variability and make predictions regarding the likelihood of evolutionary branching under different conditions. This approach effectively bridges the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations, providing insights into when and how evolutionary branching is more likely to occur in laboratory experiments.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of femtosecond laser interaction with the central nervous system in zebrafish</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05453v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the photodamage mechanism underlying the highly nonlinear dynamic of femtosecond laser pulses at the second transparent window of tissue is crucial for label-free microscopy. Here, we report the identification of two cavitation regimes from 1030 nm pulses when interacting with the central nervous system in zebrafish. We show that at low repetition rates, the damage is confined due to plasma-based ablation and sudden local temperature rise. At high repetition rates, the damage becomes collateral due to plasma-mediated photochemistry. Furthermore, we investigate the role of fluorescence labels with linear and nonlinear absorption pathways in optical breakdown. To verify our findings, we examined cell death and cellular responses to tissue damage, including the recruitment of fibroblasts and immune cells after irradiation. These findings contribute to advancing the emerging nonlinear optical microscopy techniques and provide a strategy for inducing precise, and localized injuries using near-infrared femtosecond laser pulses.</description>
