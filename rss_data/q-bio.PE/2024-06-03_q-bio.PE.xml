      <title>Life history shapes variation in egg composition in the blue tit Cyanistes caeruleus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maternal investment directly shapes early developmental conditions and therefore has longterm fitness consequences for the offspring. In oviparous species prenatal maternal investment is fixed at the time of laying. To ensure the best survival chances for most of their offspring, females must equip their eggs with the resources required to perform well under various circumstances, yet the actual mechanisms remain unknown. Here we describe the blue tit egg albumen and yolk proteomes and evaluate their potential to mediate maternal effects. We show that variation in egg composition (proteins, lipids, carotenoids) primarily depends on laying order and female age. Egg proteomic profiles are mainly driven by laying order, and investment in the egg proteome is functionally biased among eggs. Our results suggest that maternal effects on egg composition result from both passive and active (partly compensatory) mechanisms, and that variation in egg composition creates diverse biochemical environments for embryonic development.</description>

      <title>Weak-Form Inference for Hybrid Dynamical Systems in Ecology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Species subject to predation and environmental threats commonly exhibit variable periods of population boom and bust over long timescales. Understanding and predicting such behavior, especially given the inherent heterogeneity and stochasticity of exogenous driving factors over short timescales, is an ongoing challenge. A modeling paradigm gaining popularity in the ecological sciences for such multi-scale effects is to couple short-term continuous dynamics to long-term discrete updates. We develop a data-driven method utilizing weak-form equation learning to extract such hybrid governing equations for population dynamics and to estimate the requisite parameters using sparse intermittent measurements of the discrete and continuous variables. The method produces a set of short-term continuous dynamical system equations parametrized by long-term variables, and long-term discrete equations parametrized by short-term variables, allowing direct assessment of interdependencies between the two time scales. We demonstrate the utility of the method on a variety of ecological scenarios and provide extensive tests using models previously derived for epizootics experienced by the North American spongy moth (Lymantria dispar dispar).</description>

      <title>Investigation of P. Vivax Elimination via Mass Drug Administration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasmodium vivax is the most geographically widespread malaria parasite due to its ability to remain dormant (as a hypnozoite) in the human liver and subsequently reactivate. Given the majority of P. vivax infections are due to hypnozoite reactivation, targeting the hypnozoite reservoir with a radical cure is crucial for achieving P. vivax elimination. Stochastic effects can strongly influence dynamics when disease prevalence is low or when the population size is small. Hence, it is important to account for this when modelling malaria elimination.cWe use a stochastic multiscale model of P. vivax transmission to study the impacts of multiple rounds of mass drug administration (MDA) with a radical cure, accounting for superinfection and hypnozoite dynamics. Our results indicate multiple rounds of MDA with a high-efficacy drug are needed to achieve a substantial probability of elimination. This work has the potential to help guide P. vivax elimination strategies by quantifying elimination probabilities for an MDA approach.</description>

      <title>Effect of antibody levels on the spread of disease in multiple infections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are complex interactions between antibody levels and epidemic propagation, the antibody level of an individual influences the probability of infection, and the spread of the virus influences the antibody level of each individual. There exist some viruses that, in their natural state, cause antibody levels in an infected individual to gradually decay. When these antibody levels decay to a certain point, the individual can be reinfected, such as with COVID 19. To describe their interaction, we introduce a novel mathematical model that incorporates the presence of an antibody retention rate to investigate the infection patterns of individuals who survive multiple infections. The model is composed of a system of stochastic differential equations to derive the equilibrium point and threshold of the model and presents rich experimental results of numerical simulations to further elucidate the propagation properties of the model. We find that the antibody decay rate strongly affects the propagation process, and also that different network structures have different sensitivities to the antibody decay rate, and that changes in the antibody decay rate cause stronger changes in the propagation process in Barabasi Albert networks. Furthermore, we investigate the stationary distribution of the number of infection states and the final antibody levels, and find that they both satisfy the normal distribution, but the standard deviation is small in the Barabasi Albert network. Finally, we explore the effect of individual antibody differences and decay rates on the final population antibody levels, and uncover that individual antibody differences do not affect the final mean antibody levels. The study offers valuable insights for epidemic prevention and control in practical applications.</description>

      <title>An iterated learning model of language change that mixes supervised and unsupervised learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The iterated learning model is an agent-based model of language change in which language is transmitted from a tutor to a pupil which itself becomes a tutor to a new pupil, and so on. Languages that are stable, expressive, and compositional arise spontaneously as a consequence of a language transmission bottleneck. Previous models have implemented an agent's mapping from signals to meanings using an artificial neural network decoder, but have relied on an unrealistic and computationally expensive process of obversion to implement the associated encoder, mapping from meanings to signals. Here, a new model is presented in which both decoder and encoder are neural networks, trained separately through supervised learning, and trained together through unsupervised learning in the form of an autoencoder. This avoids the substantial computational burden entailed in obversion and introduces a mixture of supervised and unsupervised learning as observed during human development.</description>

      <title>Good Modelling Software Practices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In socio-environmental sciences, models are frequently used as tools to represent, understand, project and predict the behaviour of these complex systems. Along the modelling chain, Good Modelling Practices have been evolving that ensure -- amongst others -- that models are transparent and replicable. Whenever such models are represented in software, good modelling meets Good software Practices, such as a tractable development workflow, good code, collaborative development and governance, continuous integration and deployment, and Good Scientific Practices, such as attribution of copyrights and acknowledgement of intellectual property, publication of a software paper and archiving. Too often in existing socio-environmental model software, these practices have been regarded as an add-on to be considered at a later stage only; in fact, many modellers have shied away from publishing their model as open source out of fear that having to add good practices is too demanding. We here argue for making a habit of following a list of simple and not so simple practices early on in the implementation of the model life cycle. We contextualise cherry-picked and hands-on practices for supporting Good Modelling Practices, and we demonstrate their application in the example context of the Viable North Sea fisheries socio-ecological systems model.</description>

      <title>An Information Theory Treatment of Animal Movement Tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16290v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Position recordings of the two-dimensional tracks of animals moving over landscapes has progressed over the past three decades from hourly to second-by-second locations. Track segmentation methods for analyzing the behavioral information in such relocation data has lagged somewhat behind, with scales of analysis currently at the sub-hourly to minute level. A new approach is needed to bring segmentation analysis down to a second-by-second level. Here, a fine-scale approach is presented that rests heavily on concepts from Shannon's Information Theory. In this paper, we first briefly review and update concepts relating to movement path segmentation. We then discuss how cluster analysis can be used to organize the smallest viable statistical movement elements (StaMEs), which are $\mu$ steps long, and to code the next level of movement elements called ``words'' that are $m \mu$ steps long. Centroids of these word clusters are identified as canonical activity modes (CAMs). Unlike current behavioral change point analysis and hidden Markov model segmentation schemes, the approach presented here allows us to provide entropy measures for movement paths, compute the coding efficiencies of derived StaMEs and CAMs, and to assess error rates in the allocation of strings of $m$ StaMEs to CAM types. In addition our approach allows us to employ the Jensen-Shannon divergence measure to assess and compare the best choices for the various parameters (number of steps in a StaME, number of StaME types, number of StaMEs in a word, number of CAM types), as well as the best clustering methods for generating segments that can then be used to interpret and predict sequences of higher order segments. The theory presented here provides another tool in our toolbox for dealing with the effects of global change on the movement and redistribution of animals across altered landscapes.</description>

      <title>Methods to Estimate Cryptic Sequence Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Complexity is a signature quality of interest in artificial life systems. Alongside other dimensions of assessment, it is common to quantify genome sites that contribute to fitness as a complexity measure. However, limitations to the sensitivity of fitness assays in models with implicit replication criteria involving rich biotic interactions introduce the possibility of difficult-to-detect ``cryptic'' adaptive sites, which contribute small fitness effects below the threshold of individual detectability or involve epistatic redundancies. Here, we propose three knockout-based assay procedures designed to quantify cryptic adaptive sites within digital genomes. We report initial tests of these methods on a simple genome model with explicitly configured site fitness effects. In these limited tests, estimation results reflect ground truth cryptic sequence complexities well. Presented work provides initial steps toward development of new methods and software tools that improve the resolution, rigor, and tractability of complexity analyses across alife systems, particularly those requiring expensive in situ assessments of organism fitness.</description>

      <title>A multitype Galton-Watson model for rejuvenating cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We employ the framework of multitype Galton-Watson processes to model a population of dividing cells. The cellular type is represented by its biological age, defined as the count of harmful proteins hosted by the cell. The stochastic evolution of the biological age of a cell is modeled as a discrete Markov chain with a finite state space $\{0,1,\ldots,n\}$, where $n$ signifies the absorbing state corresponding to the senescent state of the cell. Consequently, the set of individual types in the multitype Galton-Watson process becomes $\{0,\ldots,n-1\}$. In our setting, a dividing cell may undergo rejuvenation meaning that its biological ages reduces due to transfer of harmful proteins to the daughter cell. For the proposed model, we define and study several biologically meaningful features, such as rejuvenation states, expected replicative lifespan, population growth rate, stable biological age distribution, and the population average of the biological age.</description>

      <title>A soluble model for synchronized rhythmic activity in ant colonies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11391v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Synchronization is one of the most striking instances of collective behavior, occurring in many natural phenomena. For example, in some ant species, ants are inactive within the nest most of the time, but their bursts of activity are highly synchronized and involve the entire nest population. Here we revisit a simulation model that generates this synchronized rhythmic activity through autocatalytic behavior, i.e., active ants can activate inactive ants, followed by a period of rest. We derive a set of delay differential equations that provide an accurate description of the short- and medium-time simulations for large ant colonies. Analysis of the fixed-point solutions, complemented by numerical integration of the equations, indicates the existence of stable limit-cycle solutions when the rest period is greater than a threshold and the event of spontaneous activation of inactive ants is very unlikely, so that most of the arousal of ants is done by active ants. Furthermore, we argue that the persistent oscillations observed in the simulations for colonies of finite size are due to resonant amplification of demographic noise.</description>
