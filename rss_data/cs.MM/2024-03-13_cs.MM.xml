      <title>Text-to-Audio Generation Synchronized with Videos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent times, the focus on text-to-audio (TTA) generation has intensified, as researchers strive to synthesize audio from textual descriptions. However, most existing methods, though leveraging latent diffusion models to learn the correlation between audio and text embeddings, fall short when it comes to maintaining a seamless synchronization between the produced audio and its video. This often results in discernible audio-visual mismatches. To bridge this gap, we introduce a groundbreaking benchmark for Text-to-Audio generation that aligns with Videos, named T2AV-Bench. This benchmark distinguishes itself with three novel metrics dedicated to evaluating visual alignment and temporal consistency. To complement this, we also present a simple yet effective video-aligned TTA generation model, namely T2AV. Moving beyond traditional methods, T2AV refines the latent diffusion approach by integrating visual-aligned text embeddings as its conditional foundation. It employs a temporal multi-head attention transformer to extract and understand temporal nuances from video data, a feat amplified by our Audio-Visual ControlNet that adeptly merges temporal visual representations with text embeddings. Further enhancing this integration, we weave in a contrastive learning objective, designed to ensure that the visual-aligned text embeddings resonate closely with the audio features. Extensive evaluations on the AudioCaps and T2AV-Bench demonstrate that our T2AV sets a new standard for video-aligned TTA generation in ensuring visual alignment and temporal consistency.</description>

      <title>AesopAgent: Agent-driven Evolutionary System on Story-to-Video Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Agent and AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content) technologies have recently made significant progress. We propose AesopAgent, an Agent-driven Evolutionary System on Story-to-Video Production. AesopAgent is a practical application of agent technology for multimodal content generation. The system integrates multiple generative capabilities within a unified framework, so that individual users can leverage these modules easily. This innovative system would convert user story proposals into scripts, images, and audio, and then integrate these multimodal contents into videos. Additionally, the animating units (e.g., Gen-2 and Sora) could make the videos more infectious. The AesopAgent system could orchestrate task workflow for video generation, ensuring that the generated video is both rich in content and coherent. This system mainly contains two layers, i.e., the Horizontal Layer and the Utility Layer. In the Horizontal Layer, we introduce a novel RAG-based evolutionary system that optimizes the whole video generation workflow and the steps within the workflow. It continuously evolves and iteratively optimizes workflow by accumulating expert experience and professional knowledge, including optimizing the LLM prompts and utilities usage. The Utility Layer provides multiple utilities, leading to consistent image generation that is visually coherent in terms of composition, characters, and style. Meanwhile, it provides audio and special effects, integrating them into expressive and logically arranged videos. Overall, our AesopAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance compared with many previous works in visual storytelling. Our AesopAgent is designed for convenient service for individual users, which is available on the following page: https://aesopai.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Content-aware Masked Image Modeling Transformer for Stereo Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing learning-based stereo image codec adopt sophisticated transformation with simple entropy models derived from single image codecs to encode latent representations. However, those entropy models struggle to effectively capture the spatial-disparity characteristics inherent in stereo images, which leads to suboptimal rate-distortion results. In this paper, we propose a stereo image compression framework, named CAMSIC. CAMSIC independently transforms each image to latent representation and employs a powerful decoder-free Transformer entropy model to capture both spatial and disparity dependencies, by introducing a novel content-aware masked image modeling (MIM) technique. Our content-aware MIM facilitates efficient bidirectional interaction between prior information and estimated tokens, which naturally obviates the need for an extra Transformer decoder. Experiments show that our stereo image codec achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on two stereo image datasets Cityscapes and InStereo2K with fast encoding and decoding speed.</description>

      <title>GaussianImage: 1000 FPS Image Representation and Compression by 2D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) recently achieved great success in image representation and compression, offering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds with 10-1000 FPS, assuming sufficient GPU resources are available. However, this requirement often hinders their use on low-end devices with limited memory. In response, we propose a groundbreaking paradigm of image representation and compression by 2D Gaussian Splatting, named GaussianImage. We first introduce 2D Gaussian to represent the image, where each Gaussian has 8 parameters including position, covariance and color. Subsequently, we unveil a novel rendering algorithm based on accumulated summation. Remarkably, our method with a minimum of 3$\times$ lower GPU memory usage and 5$\times$ faster fitting time not only rivals INRs (e.g., WIRE, I-NGP) in representation performance, but also delivers a faster rendering speed of 1500-2000 FPS regardless of parameter size. Furthermore, we integrate existing vector quantization technique to build an image codec. Experimental results demonstrate that our codec attains rate-distortion performance comparable to compression-based INRs such as COIN and COIN++, while facilitating decoding speeds of approximately 1000 FPS. Additionally, preliminary proof of concept shows that our codec surpasses COIN and COIN++ in performance when using partial bits-back coding.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Compressed Frame Sizes For Ultra-Fast Video Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifying videos into distinct categories, such as Sport and Music Video, is crucial for multimedia understanding and retrieval, especially when an immense volume of video content is being constantly generated. Traditional methods require video decompression to extract pixel-level features like color, texture, and motion, thereby increasing computational and storage demands. Moreover, these methods often suffer from performance degradation in low-quality videos. We present a novel approach that examines only the post-compression bitstream of a video to perform classification, eliminating the need for bitstream decoding. To validate our approach, we built a comprehensive data set comprising over 29,000 YouTube video clips, totaling 6,000 hours and spanning 11 distinct categories. Our evaluations indicate precision, accuracy, and recall rates consistently above 80%, many exceeding 90%, and some reaching 99%. The algorithm operates approximately 15,000 times faster than real-time for 30fps videos, outperforming traditional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm by seven orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>GRACE: Loss-Resilient Real-Time Video through Neural Codecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12333v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In real-time video communication, retransmitting lost packets over high-latency networks is not viable due to strict latency requirements. To counter packet losses without retransmission, two primary strategies are employed -- encoder-based forward error correction (FEC) and decoder-based error concealment. The former encodes data with redundancy before transmission, yet determining the optimal redundancy level in advance proves challenging. The latter reconstructs video from partially received frames, but dividing a frame into independently coded partitions inherently compromises compression efficiency, and the lost information cannot be effectively recovered by the decoder without adapting the encoder. We present a loss-resilient real-time video system called GRACE, which preserves the user's quality of experience (QoE) across a wide range of packet losses through a new neural video codec. Central to GRACE's enhanced loss resilience is its joint training of the neural encoder and decoder under a spectrum of simulated packet losses. In lossless scenarios, GRACE achieves video quality on par with conventional codecs (e.g., H.265). As the loss rate escalates, GRACE exhibits a more graceful, less pronounced decline in quality, consistently outperforming other loss-resilient schemes. Through extensive evaluation on various videos and real network traces, we demonstrate that GRACE reduces undecodable frames by 95% and stall duration by 90% compared with FEC, while markedly boosting video quality over error concealment methods. In a user study with 240 crowdsourced participants and 960 subjective ratings, GRACE registers a 38% higher mean opinion score (MOS) than other baselines.</description>

      <title>$\mathbf{C}^2$Former: Calibrated and Complementary Transformer for RGB-Infrared Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16175v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Object detection on visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) images, as an emerging solution to facilitate robust detection for around-the-clock applications, has received extensive attention in recent years. With the help of IR images, object detectors have been more reliable and robust in practical applications by using RGB-IR combined information. However, existing methods still suffer from modality miscalibration and fusion imprecision problems. Since transformer has the powerful capability to model the pairwise correlations between different features, in this paper, we propose a novel Calibrated and Complementary Transformer called $\mathrm{C}^2$Former to address these two problems simultaneously. In $\mathrm{C}^2$Former, we design an Inter-modality Cross-Attention (ICA) module to obtain the calibrated and complementary features by learning the cross-attention relationship between the RGB and IR modality. To reduce the computational cost caused by computing the global attention in ICA, an Adaptive Feature Sampling (AFS) module is introduced to decrease the dimension of feature maps. Because $\mathrm{C}^2$Former performs in the feature domain, it can be embedded into existed RGB-IR object detectors via the backbone network. Thus, one single-stage and one two-stage object detector both incorporating our $\mathrm{C}^2$Former are constructed to evaluate its effectiveness and versatility. With extensive experiments on the DroneVehicle and KAIST RGB-IR datasets, we verify that our method can fully utilize the RGB-IR complementary information and achieve robust detection results. The code is available at https://github.com/yuanmaoxun/Calibrated-and-Complementary-Transformer-for-RGB-Infrared-Object-Detection.git.</description>

      <title>Language Model Beats Diffusion -- Tokenizer is Key to Visual Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are the dominant models for generative tasks in language, they do not perform as well as diffusion models on image and video generation. To effectively use LLMs for visual generation, one crucial component is the visual tokenizer that maps pixel-space inputs to discrete tokens appropriate for LLM learning. In this paper, we introduce MAGVIT-v2, a video tokenizer designed to generate concise and expressive tokens for both videos and images using a common token vocabulary. Equipped with this new tokenizer, we show that LLMs outperform diffusion models on standard image and video generation benchmarks including ImageNet and Kinetics. In addition, we demonstrate that our tokenizer surpasses the previously top-performing video tokenizer on two more tasks: (1) video compression comparable to the next-generation video codec (VCC) according to human evaluations, and (2) learning effective representations for action recognition tasks.</description>

      <title>D$^2$-JSCC: Digital Deep Joint Source-channel Coding for Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic communications (SemCom) have emerged as a new paradigm for supporting sixth-generation applications, where semantic features of data are transmitted using artificial intelligence algorithms to attain high communication efficiencies. Most existing SemCom techniques utilize deep neural networks (DNNs) to implement analog source-channel mappings, which are incompatible with existing digital communication architectures. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel framework of digital deep joint source-channel coding (D$^2$-JSCC) targeting image transmission in SemCom. The framework features digital source and channel codings that are jointly optimized to reduce the end-to-end (E2E) distortion. First, deep source coding with an adaptive density model is designed to encode semantic features according to their distributions. Second, digital channel coding is employed to protect encoded features against channel distortion. To facilitate their joint design, the E2E distortion is characterized as a function of the source and channel rates via the analysis of the Bayesian model and Lipschitz assumption on the DNNs. Then to minimize the E2E distortion, a two-step algorithm is proposed to control the source-channel rates for a given channel signal-to-noise ratio. Simulation results reveal that the proposed framework outperforms classic deep JSCC and mitigates the cliff and leveling-off effects, which commonly exist for separation-based approaches.</description>
