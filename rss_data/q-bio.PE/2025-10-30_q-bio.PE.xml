      <title>Evaluating the effectiveness of Stochastic CTMC and deterministic models in correlating rabies persistence in human and dog populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rabies continues to pose a significant zoonotic threat, particularly in areas with high populations of domestic dogs that serve as viral reservoirs. This study conducts a comparative analysis of Stochastic Continuous-Time Markov Chain (CTMC) and deterministic models to gain insights into rabies persistence within human and canine populations. By employing a multitype branching process, the stochastic threshold for rabies persistence was determined, revealing important insights into how stochasticity influences extinction probabilities. The stochastic model utilized 10,000 sample paths to estimate the probabilities of rabies outbreaks, offering a rigorous assessment of the variability in disease occurrences. Additionally, the study introduces a novel mathematical formulation of rabies transmission dynamics, which includes environmental reservoirs, free-ranging dogs, and domestic dogs as essential transmission factors. The basic reproduction number ($\mathcal{R}_0$) was derived and analyzed within stochastic frameworks, effectively bridging the gap between these two modeling approaches. Numerical simulations confirmed that the results from the stochastic model closely aligned with those from the deterministic model, while also highlighting the importance of stochasticity in scenarios with low infection rates. Ultimately, the study advocates for a comprehensive approach to rabies control that integrates both the predictable trends identified through deterministic models and the impact of random events emphasized by stochastic models.</description>

      <title>Quenched coalescent for diploid population models with selfing and overlapping generations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general diploid population model with self-fertilization and possible overlapping generations, and study the genealogy of a sample of $n$ genes as the population size $N$ tends to infinity. Unlike traditional approach in coalescent theory which considers the unconditional (annealed) law of the gene genealogies averaged over the population pedigree, here we study the conditional (quenched) law of gene genealogies given the pedigree. We focus on the case of high selfing probability and obtain that this conditional law converges to a random probability measure, given by the random law of a system of coalescing random walks on an exchangeable fragmentation-coalescence process of \cite{berestycki04}. This system contains the system of coalescing random walks on the ancestral recombination graph as a special case, and it sheds new light on the site-frequency spectrum (SFS) of genetic data by specifying how SFS depends on the pedigree. The convergence result is proved by means of a general characterization of weak convergence for random measures on the Skorokhod space with paths taking values in a locally compact Polish space.</description>
