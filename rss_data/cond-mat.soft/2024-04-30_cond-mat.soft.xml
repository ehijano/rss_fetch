      <title>Patterns of active dipolar particles in external magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active particles with a (magnetic) dipole moment are of interest for steering self-propelled motion, but also result in novel collective effects due to their dipole-dipole interaction. Here systems of active dipolar particles are studied with Brownian dynamics simulations to systematically characterize the different patterns they form, specifically in the presence of an external (magnetic) field. The combination of three types of order - clustering, orientational alignment and chain formation - is used to classify the patterns observed in these systems. In the presence of an external field, oriented chains and bands are found to be dominant. These structures show some similarities with columnar cluster seen in (passive) ferrofluids and display columnar spacing and number of lanes per cluster that both decrease with increasing field strength.</description>

      <title>Exact Analytical Solution of the Flory-Huggins Model and Extensions to Multicomponent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Flory-Huggins theory describes the phase separation of solutions containing polymers. Although it finds widespread application from polymer physics to materials science to biology, the concentrations that coexist in separate phases at equilibrium have not been determined analytically, and numerical techniques are required that restrict the theory's ease of application. In this work, we derive an implicit analytical solution to the Flory-Huggins theory of one polymer in a solvent by applying a procedure that we call the implicit substitution method. While the solutions are implicit and in the form of composite variables, they can be mapped explicitly to a phase diagram in composition space. We apply the same formalism to multicomponent polymeric systems, where we find analytical solutions for polydisperse mixtures of polymers of one type. Finally, while complete analytical solutions are not possible for arbitrary mixtures, we propose computationally efficient strategies to map out coexistence curves for systems with many components of different polymer types.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Origin of Water's Thermal Conductivity Maximum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermal conductivity of water features a maximum (TCM) as a function of temperature at constant pressure. By examining why molecular force fields succeed or fail to reproduce the maximum and interpreting our results using the Bridgman equation, we show that water's TCM is connected with its compressibility minimum. Using Stillinger-Weber potentials for tetrahedral liquids, we interpolate between the behaviour of simple liquids and highly tetrahedral materials such as carbon. Together with two vanishing limits at low/high tetrahedrality, we identify three regimes for the TCM: when it originates from either the compressibility minimum or density maximum, or both. Thus, the TCM exists in a "Goldilocks Zone" of tetrahedral order. We provide a thermodynamic explanation for the TCM of not only water, but tetrahedral liquids in general.</description>

      <title>Ideal noncrystals: A possible new class of ordered matter without apparent broken symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Order and disorder constitute two fundamental and opposite themes in condensed matter physics and materials science. Crystals are considered the epitome of order characterized by long-range translational order. The discovery of quasicrystals, with no periodicity but rotational symmetries forbidden for crystals, leads to a paradigm shift in solid-state physics. Moving one step forward, it is intriguing to ask whether ordered matter exists without apparent symmetry breaking. The same question may arise in the pursuit of how ordered amorphous (noncrystalline) solids can be. Here we report the finding of ideal noncrystals in two dimensions, which are disordered in the conventional sense without Bragg peaks but highly ordered according to the steric order. We find that such ideal noncrystals have vibrational modes the same as phonons following the Debye law. The elastic responses are fully affine, which is again characteristic of crystals, and the spatial fluctuations of local volume fractions approach hyperuniformity. Therefore, ideal noncrystals represent an anomalous form of matter with a mixed nature of noncrystalline structure but crystal-like properties. Since such states are found to be thermodynamically favorable, we identify them as a possible new class of ordered matter without apparent broken symmetry. Our results thus extend the scope of the ordered state of matter and may impact the understanding of entropy-driving ordering also in generic amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>Simulating Crystallization in a Colloidal System Using State Predictive Information Bottleneck based Enhanced Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate crystal nucleation in supersaturated colloid suspensions using enhanced molecular dynamics simulations augmented with machine learning techniques. The simulations reveal that crystallization in the model colloidal system studied here, with particles interacting through a repulsive screened Coulomb Yukawa potential, proceeds from vapor to dense liquid droplet to crystalline phases across multiple high barriers. Employing a one-dimensional reaction coordinate derived from the State Predictive Information Bottleneck framework, our simulations capture backand-forth phase transitions across multiple barriers effectively in biased metadynamics simulations. We obtain relative free energy differences between different phases and also quantify the roles of different molecular level features in driving the phase changes.</description>

      <title>Suppressed self-diffusion of nanoscale constituents of a complex liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to understand and ultimately control the transformations and properties of various nanoscale systems, from proteins to synthetic nanomaterial assemblies, hinges on the ability to directly elucidate their dynamics on their characteristic length and time scales. Here, we use MHz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to directly elucidate the characteristic microsecond-dynamics of density fluctuations of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), not only in a colloidal dispersion but also in a liquid phase consisting of densely packed, yet mobile, NCs with no long-range order. By carefully disentangling X-ray induced effects, we find the wavevector-dependent fluctuation rates in the liquid phase are suppressed relative to those in the colloidal phase and to those in experiments and hydrodynamic theories of densely packed repulsive particles. We show that the suppressed rates are due to a substantial decrease in the self-diffusion of NCs in the liquid phase, which we attribute to explicit attractive interactions. Via comparison with simulations, we find that the extracted strength of the attractions explains the stability of the liquid phase, in contrast to the gelation observed via XPCS in many other charged colloidal systems. This work opens the door to elucidating fast, condensed phase dynamics in a variety of complex fluids and other nanoscale soft matter systems, such as densely packed proteins and non-equilibrium self-assembly processes.</description>

      <title>Plastic instability of annular crystalline membrane in circular confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanical instabilities of two-dimensional membranes has strong connection to the subjects of structure instabilities, morphology control and materials failures. In this work, we investigate the plastic mechanism developed in the annular crystalline membrane system for adapting to the shrinking space, which is caused by the controllable gradual expansion of the inner boundary. In the process of plastic deformation, we find the continuous generation of dislocations at the inner boundary, and their collective migration to the outer boundary; this neat dynamic scenario of dislocation current captures the complicated reorganization process of the particles. We also reveal the characteristic vortex structure arising from the interplay of topological defects and the displacement field. These results may find applications in the precise control of structural instabilities in packings of particulate matter and covalently bonded systems.</description>

      <title>Why Some Metal Ions Spontaneously Form Nanoparticles in Water Microdroplets? Disentangling the Contributions of Air-Water Interface and Bulk Redox Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water microdroplets containing 100 micromolar HAuCl4 have been shown to reduce gold ions into gold nanoparticles spontaneously. It has been suggested that this chemical transformation is driven by ultrahigh electric fields at the air-water interface, albeit without mechanistic insight. We investigated the fate of several metallic salts in water, methanol, ethanol, and acetonitrile in bulk and microdroplets. This revealed that when HAuCl4 (or PtCl4) is added to bulk water (or methanol or ethanol), metal NPs appear spontaneously. Over time, the nanoparticles grow in bulk, as evidenced by the solution's changing colors. If the same bulk solution is sprayed pneumatically and collected, the NP size has no significant enhancement. Interestingly, the reduction of metal ions is accompanied by the oxidation of water (or alcohols); however, these redox reactions are minimal in acetonitrile. We establish that the spontaneous reduction of metal ions is (i) not limited to water or gold ions, (ii) not driven by the air-water interface of microdroplets, and (iii) appears to be a general phenomenon for solvents containing hydroxyl groups. These results advance our understanding of liquids in general and should be relevant in soil chemistry, biogeochemistry, electrochemistry, and green chemistry.</description>

      <title>Diffusiophoresis of ionic catalytic particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A migration of charged particles relative to a solvent, caused by a gradient of salt concentration and termed a diffusiophoresis, is of much interest being exploited in many fields. Existing theories deal with diffusiophoresis of passive inert particles. In this paper, we extend prior models by focusing on a particle, which is both passive and catalytic, by postulating an uniform ion release over its surface. We derive an expression for a particle velocity depending on a dimensionless ion flux (Damkohler number Da) and show that a charged region is formed at distances of the order of the particle size, provided the diffusion coefficients of anions and cations are unequal. When Da becomes large enough, the contribution of this (outer) region to the particle velocity dominates. In this case the speed of catalytic passive particles augments linearly with Da and is inversely proportional to the square of electrolyte concentration. As a result, they always migrate towards a high concentration region and in dilute solutions become much faster than inert (non-catalytic) ones.</description>

      <title>Stability and Elasticity of Ultrathin Sphere-Patterned Block Copolymer Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sphere-patterned ultrathin block copolymers films are potentially interesting for a variety of applications in nanotechnology. We use self-consistent field theory to investigate the elastic response of sphere monolayer films with respect to in-plane shear, in-plane extension and compression deformations, and with respect to bending. The relations between the in-plane elastic moduli is roughly compatible with the expectations for two-dimensional elastic systems with hexagonal symmetry, with one notable exception: The pure shear and the simple shear moduli differ from each other by roughly 20%. Even more importantly, the bending constants are found to be negative, indicating that free-standing block copolymer membranes made of only sphere mono-layer are inherently unstable above the glass transition. Our results are discussed in view of experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Rheology of Lanthanide Binding Peptide Surfactants at the Air-Water Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Peptide surfactants (PEPS) are studied to capture and retain rare earth elements (REEs) at air-water interfaces to enable REE separations. Peptide sequences, designed to selectively bind REEs, depend crucially on the position of ligands within their binding loop domain. These ligands form a coordination sphere that wraps and retains the cation. We study variants of lanthanide binding tags (LBTs) designed to complex strongly with Tb$^{3+}$. The peptide LBT$^{5-}$ (with net charge -5) is known to bind Tb$^{3+}$ and adsorb with more REE cations than peptide molecules, suggesting that undesired non-specific Coulombic interactions occur. Rheological characterization of interfaces of LBT$^{5-}$ and Tb$^{3+}$ solutions reveal the formation of an interfacial gel. To probe whether this gelation reflects chelation among intact adsorbed LBT$^{5-}$:Tb$^{3+}$ complexes or destruction of the binding loop, we study a variant, LBT$^{3-}$, designed to form net neutral LBT$^{3-}$:Tb$^{3+}$ complexes. Solutions of LBT$^{3-}$ and Tb$^{3+}$ form purely viscous layers in the presence of excess Tb$^{3+}$, indicating that each peptide binds a single REE in an intact coordination sphere. We introduce the variant RR-LBT$^{3-}$ with net charge -3 and anionic ligands outside of the coordination sphere. We find that such exposed ligands promote interfacial gelation. Thus, a nuanced requirement for interfacial selectivity of PEPS is proposed: that anionic ligands outside of the coordination sphere must be avoided to prevent the non-selective recruitment of REE cations. This view is supported by simulation, including interfacial molecular dynamics simulations, and interfacial metadynamics simulations of the free energy landscape of the binding loop conformational space.</description>

      <title>Experimental and Theoretical Bulk Phase Diagram and Interfacial Tension of Ouzo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ouzo is a well-known drink in Mediterranean countries, with ingredients water, alcohol and trans-anethole oil. The oil is insoluble in water, but completely soluble in alcohol, so when water is added to the spirit, the available alcohol is depleted and the mixture exhibits spontaneous emulsification. This process is commonly known as the louche or Ouzo effect. Although the phase boundaries of this archetypal ternary mixture are well known, the properties of coexisting phases have not previously been studied. Here, we present a detailed experimental investigation into the phase behaviour, including tie-lines connecting coexisting phases, determination of the critical point (also called the plait point in ternary systems) and measurements of the surface tension and density for varying alcohol concentrations. Additionally, we present a theory for the thermodynamics and phase diagram of the system. With suitable selection of the interaction parameters, the theory captures nearly all features of the experimental work. This simple model can be used to determine both bulk and non-uniform (e.g. interfacial) properties, paving the way for a wide range of future applications of the model to ternary mixtures in general. We show how our accurate equilibrium phase diagram can be used to provide improved understanding of non-equilibrium phenomena.</description>

      <title>A statistical analysis of the first stages of freezing and melting of Lennard-Jones particles: Number and size distributions of transient nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The freezing/melting transition is at the heart of many natural and industrial processes. In the classical picture, the transition proceeds via the nucleation of the new phase, which has to overcome a barrier associated to the free energy cost of the growing nucleus. The total nucleation rate is also influenced by a kinetic factor which somehow depends on the number of attempts to create a nucleus, that translates into a significant density of proto-nuclei in the system. These transient tiny nuclei are not accessible to experiments, but they can be observed in molecular simulations, and their number and size distributions can be acquired and analysed. The number distributions are carefully characterized as a function of the system size, showing limited finite size effects. It is also shown that the proto-nuclei do exist even in the stable phase, in agreement with the fact that the volume contribution to their free energy is negligible in the first stages of nucleation. Moreover, the number and size distributions vary continuously between the stable and the metastable phases, in particular when crossing the coexistence temperature. The size distributions associated to \emph{any} nucleus and to the \emph{largest} one have also been calculated, and their relation recently established for bubbles in a liquid [J. Puibasset, J. Chem. Phys. 157, 191102 (2022)] has been shown to apply here. This is an important relation for free energy barrier calculations with biased molecular simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Onsager's variational principle (OVP) provides us with a systematic way to derive dynamical equations for various soft matter and active matter. By reformulating the Onsager-Machlup variational principle (OMVP), which is a time-global principle, we propose a new method to incorporate thermal fluctuations. To demonstrate the utility of the statistical formulation of OMVP (SOMVP), we obtain the diffusion constant of a Brownian particle embedded in a viscous fluid only by maximizing the modified Onsager-Machlup integral for the surrounding fluid. We also apply our formulation to a Brownian particle in a steady shear flow, which is a typical example of a non-equilibrium system. Possible extensions of our formulation to internally driven active systems are discussed.</description>

      <title>Patterning of 2D second harmonic generation active arrays in ferroelectric nematic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals exhibit unique non-linear optical properties, with the potential to become transformative materials for photonic applications. A promising direction relies on the fabrication of tailored polar orientational patterns via photoalignment, thus shaping the non-linear optical susceptibility through thin slabs of the ferroelectric fluid. Here, we explore the fabrication of 2D periodic SHG active arrays in ferroelectric nematic fluids, for different materials, cell thicknesses and motifs. Based on polarizing optical microscopy observations in combination with optical simulations, second harmonic generation microscopy and interferometry, the 3D structure of the motifs are revealed. Two different 2D periodic patterns are explored, showing that the balance between flexoelectric and electrostatic energy can lead to different domain structures, an effect which is rooted in the difference between the flexoelectric properties of the materials. It is shown that by combining the surface-inscribed alignment with different spontaneous degrees of twist, 2D SHG active arrays can be obtained in the micrometre scale, in which adjacent areas exhibit maximum SHG signals at opposite angles.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of nonlinear perturbations in the dynamics of planar crack fronts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of crack fronts with asperities is central to the criteria of fracture in heterogeneous materials and for the prediction of fracture surface formation. It is known how dynamic crack fronts respond to small, 1st-order, perturbations. Large and localized disturbances to crack motion, however, induce dynamic and geometric nonlinear effects that are beyond the existing linear theories. Because the determination of the 3D elastic fields surrounding perturbed crack fronts is a necessary step towards any theoretical study of crack front dynamics, we develop a 2nd-order perturbation theory for the asymptotic fields of planar crack fronts. Based on previous work, we consider two models of fracture. In the so-called scalar elastic model, which is analogous to anti-plane (Mode III) fracture, the stress and displacement fields are obtained through matched asymptotic expansions. A self-consistent expansion is used to resolve the fields near tensile (Mode I) crack fronts. Both methods can be extended to higher perturbation orders. The main results of this work are the explicit 2nd-order expressions of the local dynamic energy-release-rates for perturbations of straight fronts. These general formulae recover the known energy-release-rates of curved quasi-static fronts and of straight dynamic fronts.</description>

      <title>Colloidal dispersions of sterically and electrostatically stabilized PbS quantum dots: the effect of stabilization mechanism on structure factors, second virial coefficients, and film-forming properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrostatically stabilized nanocrystals (NCs) and, in particular, quantum dots (QDs) hold promise for forming strongly coupled superlattices due to their compact and electronically conductive surface ligands. However, studies on the colloidal dispersion and interparticle interactions of electrostatically stabilized sub-10 nm NCs have been limited, hindering the optimization of colloidal stability and self-assembly. In this study, we employed small-angle X ray scattering (SAXS) experiments to investigate the interparticle interactions and arrangement of PbS QDs with thiostannate ligands (PbS-Sn2S64-) in polar solvents. The study reveals significant deviations from ideal solution behavior in electrostatically stabilized QD dispersions. Our results demonstrate that PbS-Sn2S64- QDs exhibit long-range interactions within the solvent, in contrast to the short-range steric repulsion characteristic of PbS QDs with oleate ligands (PbS-OA). Introducing highly charged multivalent electrolytes screens electrostatic interactions between charged QDs, reducing the length scale of the repulsive interactions. Furthermore, we calculate the second virial (B2) coefficients from SAXS data, providing insights into how surface chemistry, solvent, and size influence pair potentials. Finally, we explore the influence of long-range interparticle interactions of PbS-Sn2S64- QDs on the morphology of films produced by drying or spin-coating colloidal solutions. The long-range repulsive term of PbS-Sn2S64- QDs promotes the formation of amorphous films, and screening the electrostatic repulsion by addition of an electrolyte enables the formation of a crystalline film. These findings highlight the critical role of NC-NC interactions in tailoring the properties of functional nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Interfaces as transport barriers in two-dimensional Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of interfaces as transport barriers in binary-fluid turbulence by employing Lagrangian tracer particles. The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) system of partial differential equations provides a natural theoretical framework for our investigations. For specificity, we utilize the two-dimensional (2D) CHNS system. We capture efficiently interfaces and their fluctuations in 2D binary-fluid turbulence by using extensive pseudospectral direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of the 2D CHNS equations. We begin with $n$ tracers within a droplet of one phase and examine their dispersal into the second phase. The tracers remain within the droplet for a long time before emerging from it, so interfaces act as transport barriers in binary-fluid turbulence. We show that the fraction of the number of particles inside the droplet decays exponentially and is characterized by a decay time $\tau_{\xi}\sim R_0^{3/2}$ that increases with $R_0$, the radius of the initially circular droplet. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the average first-passage time $\langle \tau \rangle$ for tracers inside a droplet is orders of magnitude larger than it is for transport out of a hypothetical circle with the same radius as the initially circular droplet. We examine the roles of the Okubo-Weiss parameter $\Lambda$, the fluctuations of the droplet perimeter, and the probability distribution function of $\cos(\theta)$, with $\theta$ the angle between the fluid velocity and the normal to a droplet interface, in trapping tracers inside droplets. We mention possible generalisations of our study.</description>

      <title>Micro-swimmer collective dynamics in Brinkman flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suspensions of swimming micro-organisms are known to undergo intricate collective dynamics as a result of hydrodynamic and collision interactions. Micro-swimmers, such as bacteria and micro-algae, naturally live and have evolved in complex habitats that include impurities, obstacles and interfaces. To elucidate their dynamics in a heterogeneous environment, we consider a continuum theory where the the micro-swimmers are embedded in a Brinkman wet porous medium, which models viscous flow with an additional resistance or friction due to the presence of smaller stationary obstacles. The conservation equation for the swimmer configurations includes advection and rotation by the immersing fluid, and is coupled to the viscous Brinkman fluid flow with an active stress due to the swimmers' motion in it. Resistance alters individual swimmer locomotion and the way it disturbs the surrounding fluid, and thus it alters its hydrodynamic interactions with others and and such affects collective dynamics.The entropy analysis and the linear stability analysis of the system of equations both reveal that resistance delays and hinders the onset and development of the collective swimming instabilities, and can completely suppress it if sufficiently large. Simulations of the full nonlinear system confirm these. We contrast the results with previous theoretical studies on micro-swimmers in homogeneous viscous flow, and discuss relevant experimental realizations.</description>

      <title>Casimir force within Ising chain with competing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive exact results for the critical Casimir force (CCF) within the one-dimensional Ising model with periodic boundary conditions (PBC's) and long-range equivalent-neighbor ferromagnetic interactions of strength $J_{l}/N&gt;0$ superimposed on the nearest-neighbor interactions of strength $J_{s}$ which could be either ferromagnetic ($J_{s}&gt;0$) or antiferromagnetic ($J_{s}&lt;0$). In the infinite system limit the model, also known as the Nagle-Kardar model, exhibits in the plane $(K_s=\beta J_s,K_l=\beta J_l)$ a critical line $2 K_l=\exp{\left(-2 K_s\right)}, K_s&gt;-\ln3/4$, which ends at a tricritical point $(K_l=-\sqrt{3}/2, K_s=-\ln3/4)$. The critical Casimir amplitudes are: $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (cr)}=1/4$ at the critical line, and $\Delta_{\rm Cas}^{\rm (tr)}=1/3$ at the tricritical point. Quite unexpectedly, with the imposed PBC's the CCF exhibits very unusual behavior as a function of temperature and magnetic field. It is repulsive near the critical line and tricritical point, decaying rapidly with separation from those two singular regimes fast away from them and becoming attractive, displaying in which the maximum amplitude of the attraction exceeds the maximum amplitude of repulsion. This represents a violation of the widely-accepted "boundary condition rule", which holds that the CCF is attractive for equivalent BC's and repulsive for conflicting BC's independently of the actual bulk universality class of the phase transition under investigation.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation of a bilayer composed by surfactants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the properties of lipid bilayer fluctuations using molecular dynamics. We modeled the surfactant as a diatomic molecule, constructed a bilayer in the solvent, and observed the Fourier spectrum of its fluctuations. The results showed that $q^4$ behavior was dominant at the high temperature, whereas a crossover from $q^4$ to $q^2$ was observed at the low temperature. This behavior is complementary to the results for monolayer membranes, where $q^2$ behavior was dominant when the interfacial tension was high, whereas a crossover from $q^2$ to $q^4$ was observed when the interfacial tension was lowered~[S. Kikuchi and H. Watanabe, J. Chem. Phys., $\bm{158}$ 12 (2023)]. These results suggest that the restoring force is dominated by elasticity at high temperatures and by interfacial tension at low temperatures. We also observed radial distribution functions to investigate the structure of surfactants in lipid bilayers. The structure of the surfactant depends on temperature in the direction horizontal to the interface, while it does not depend on temperature in the direction perpendicular to the interface. This result suggests that lipid bilayers increase fluctuations while maintaining the membrane structure in high temperature.</description>

      <title>Odd viscosity suppresses intermittency in direct turbulent cascades</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intermittency refers to the broken self-similarity of turbulent flows caused by anomalous spatio-temporal fluctuations. In this Letter, we ask how intermittency is affected by a non-dissipative viscosity, known as odd viscosity, which appears in parity-breaking fluids such as magnetized polyatomic gases, electron fluids under magnetic field and spinning colloids or grains. Using a combination of Navier-Stokes simulations and theory, we show that intermittency is suppressed by odd viscosity at small scales. This effect is caused by parity-breaking waves, induced by odd viscosity, that break the multiple scale invariances of the Navier-Stokes equations. Building on this insight, we construct a two-channel helical shell model that reproduces the basic phenomenology of turbulent odd-viscous fluids including the suppression of anomalous scaling. Our findings illustrate how a fully developed direct cascade that is entirely self-similar can emerge below a tunable length scale, paving the way for designing turbulent flows with adjustable levels of intermittency.</description>

      <title>Correlations between two vortices in dry active matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It was recently shown that wet active matter may form synchronized rotating vortices in a square lattice, similar to an antiferromagnetic Ising model (by considering rotation direction as spin projections). In this letter, we investigate whether such a correlated state occurs for a model of dry active matter. We achieve that by numerically simulating the dynamics of a system of active particles in the presence of two identical circular obstacles. Then, we measure the rotation velocity correlation function of both vortices as a function of the obstacle diameter, their shortest separation, called gap, and the particle density. We find that, like the observations of vortex formation in wet active matter, both vortices can synchronize their rotations in either opposite or in the same direction; we call such regimes as antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic, respectively. We show that, for the antiferromagnetic case, both vortices keep their motion correlated by exchanging particles through the region in between them, analogously to synchronized cogs; on the other hand, for the ferromagnetic regime, both vortices merge in a single rotating cluster, similar to a belt strapped around the obstacles. Additionallly, we observe the emergence of uncorrelated states at the transition between correlated states, in which only a single vortex is present, or in the large gap regime, in which the vortices are nearly independent on each other.</description>

Abstract: The fluctuations of a nonequilibrium bath enable dynamics inaccessible to any equilibrium system. Exploiting the driven dynamics of active matter in order to do useful work has become a topic of significant experimental and theoretical interest. Due to the unique modalities controlling self-assembly, the interplay between passive solutes and the particles in an active bath has been studied as a potential driving force to guide assembly of otherwise non-interacting objects. Here, we investigate and characterize the microscopic origins of the attractive and repulsive interactions between passive solutes in an active bath. We show that, while assembly does not occur dynamically for achiral active baths, chiral active particles can produce stable and robust assembly forces. We both explain the observed oscillatory force profile for active Brownian particles and demonstrate that chiral active motion leads to fluxes consistent with an odd diffusion tensor that, when appropriately tuned, produces long-ranged assembly forces.</description>

      <title>Filled Colloidal Gel Rheology: Strengthening, Stiffening, and Tunability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.08751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Filler-induced strengthening is ubiquitous in materials science and is particularly well-established in polymeric nanocomposites. Despite having similar constituents, colloidal gels with solid filling exhibit distinct rheology, which is of practical interest to industry (e.g., lithium-ion batteries) yet remains poorly understood. We show, using experiments and simulations, that filling monotonically enhances the yield stress (i.e., strength) of colloidal gels while the elastic modulus (i.e., stiffness) first increases and then decreases. The latter softening effect results from a frustrated gel matrix at dense filling, evidenced by a growing inter-phase pressure. This structural frustration is, however, not detrimental to yielding resistance. Instead, fillers offer additional mechanical support to the gel backbone via percolating force chains, decreasing the yield strain at the same time. We develop a mechanistic picture of this phenomenology that leads us to a novel `filler-removal protocol,' making individual control over the strength and brittleness of a composite gel possible.</description>

      <title>pyMBE: the Python-based Molecule Builder for ESPResSo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14954v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Python-based Molecule Builder for ESPResSo (pyMBE), an open source software to design custom Coarse-Grained (CG) models, as well as pre-defined models of polyelectrolytes, peptides and globular proteins in the Extensible Simulation Package for Research on Soft Matter (ESPResSo). The Python interface of \espresso offers a flexible framework, capable of building custom CG models from scratch. As a downside, building CG models from scratch is error-prone, especially for newcomers in the field of CG modeling, or for molecules with complex architectures. The pyMBE module builds CG models in \espresso using a hierarchical bottom-up approach, providing a robust tool to automate the setup of CG models and helping new users prevent common mistakes. ESPResSo features the constant pH (cpH) and grand-reaction (G-RxMC) methods, which have been designed to study chemical reaction equilibria in macromolecular systems with many reactive species. However, setting up these methods for systems which contain several types of reactive groups is an error-prone task, especially for beginners. The pyMBE module enables the automatic setup of cpH and G-RxMC simulations in \espresso, lowering the barrier for newcomers and opening the door to investigate complex systems not studied with these methods yet. To demonstrate some of the applications of pyMBE, we showcase several case studies where we successfully reproduce previously published simulations of charge-regulating peptides and globular proteins in bulk solution and weak polyelectrolytes in dialysis. The pyMBE module is publicly available as a GitHub repository (https://github.com/pyMBE-dev/pyMBE) which includes its source code and various sample and test scripts, including the ones that we used to generate the data presented in this article.</description>

      <title>Enumerating low-frequency nonphononic vibrations in computer glasses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In addition to Goldstone phonons that generically emerge in the low-frequency vibrational spectrum of any solid, crystalline or glassy, structural glasses also feature other low-frequency vibrational modes. The nature and statistical properties of these modes -- often termed `excess modes' -- have been the subject of decades-long investigation. Studying them, even using well-controlled computer glasses, has proven challenging due to strong spatial hybridization effects between phononic and nonphononic excitations, which hinder quantitative analyses of the nonphononic contribution ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)$ to the total spectrum ${\cal D}(\omega)$, per frequency $\omega$. Here, using recent advances indicating that ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)\!=\!{\cal D}(\omega)-{\cal D}_{\rm D}(\omega)$, where ${\cal D}_{\rm D}(\omega)$ is Debye's spectrum of phonons, we present a simple and straightforward scheme to enumerate nonphononic modes in computer glasses. Our analysis establishes that nonphononic modes in computer glasses indeed make an additive contribution to the total spectrum, including in the presence of strong hybridizations. Moreover, it cleanly reveals the universal ${\cal D}_{\rm G}(\omega)\!\sim\!\omega^4$ tail of the nonphononic spectrum, and opens the way for related analyses of experimental spectra of glasses.</description>

      <title>Deep-learning Optical Flow Outperforms PIV in Obtaining Velocity Fields from Active Nematics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based optical flow (DLOF) extracts features in adjacent video frames with deep convolutional neural networks. It uses those features to estimate the inter-frame motions of objects at the pixel level. In this article, we evaluate the ability of optical flow to quantify the spontaneous flows of MT-based active nematics under different labeling conditions. We compare DLOF against the commonly used technique, particle imaging velocimetry (PIV). We obtain flow velocity ground truths either by performing semi-automated particle tracking on samples with sparsely labeled filaments, or from passive tracer beads. We find that DLOF produces significantly more accurate velocity fields than PIV for densely labeled samples. We show that the breakdown of PIV arises because the algorithm cannot reliably distinguish contrast variations at high densities, particularly in directions parallel to the nematic director. DLOF overcomes this limitation. For sparsely labeled samples, DLOF and PIV produce results with similar accuracy, but DLOF gives higher-resolution fields. Our work establishes DLOF as a versatile tool for measuring fluid flows in a broad class of active, soft, and biophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic crossovers in supercritical fluids</title>

Abstract: Can liquid-like and gas-like states be distinguished beyond the critical point, where the liquid-gas phase transition no longer exists and conventionally only a single supercritical fluid phase is defined? Recent experiments and simulations report strong evidence of dynamical crossovers above the critical temperature and pressure. Despite using different criteria, many existing theoretical explanations consider a single crossover line separating liquid-like and gas-like states in the supercritical fluid phase. We argue that such a single-line scenario is inconsistent with the supercritical behavior of the Ising model, which has two crossover lines due to its symmetry, violating the universality principle of critical phenomena. To reconcile the inconsistency, we define two thermodynamic crossover lines in supercritical fluids as boundaries of liquid-like, indistinguishable, and gas-like states. Near the critical point, the two crossover lines follow critical scalings with exponents of the Ising universality class, supported by calculations of theoretical models and analyses of experimental data from the standard database. The upper line agrees with crossovers independently estimated from the inelastic X-ray scattering data of supercritical argon, and from the small-angle neutron scattering data of supercritical carbon dioxide. The lower line is verified by the equation of states for the compressibility factor. This work provides a fundamental framework for understanding supercritical physics in general phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: In previous work [Phys. Rev. X 5, 021020 (2015)], it was shown that stealthy hyperuniform systems can be regarded as hard spheres in Fourier-space in the sense that the the structure factor is exactly zero in a spherical region around the origin in analogy with the pair-correlation function of real-space hard spheres. In this work, we exploit this correspondence to confirm that the densest Fourier-space hard-sphere system is that of a Bravais lattice. This is in contrast to real-space hard-spheres, whose densest configuration is conjectured to be disordered. We also extend the virial series previously suggested for disordered stealthy hyperuniform systems to higher dimensions in order to predict spatial decorrelation as function of dimension. This prediction is then borne out by numerical simulations of disordered stealthy hyperuniform ground states in dimensions $d=2$-$8$.</description>
