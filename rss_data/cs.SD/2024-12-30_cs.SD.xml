      <title>Simi-SFX: A similarity-based conditioning method for controllable sound effect synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generating sound effects with controllable variations is a challenging task, traditionally addressed using sophisticated physical models that require in-depth knowledge of signal processing parameters and algorithms. In the era of generative and large language models, text has emerged as a common, human-interpretable interface for controlling sound synthesis. However, the discrete and qualitative nature of language tokens makes it difficult to capture subtle timbral variations across different sounds. In this research, we propose a novel similarity-based conditioning method for sound synthesis, leveraging differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP). This approach combines the use of latent space for learning and controlling audio timbre with an intuitive guiding vector, normalized within the range [0,1], to encode categorical acoustic information. By utilizing pre-trained audio representation models, our method achieves expressive and fine-grained timbre control. To benchmark our approach, we introduce two sound effect datasets--Footstep-set and Impact-set--designed to evaluate both controllability and sound quality. Regression analysis demonstrates that the proposed similarity score effectively controls timbre variations and enables creative applications such as timbre interpolation between discrete classes. Our work provides a robust and versatile framework for sound effect synthesis, bridging the gap between traditional signal processing and modern machine learning techniques.</description>

      <title>MRI2Speech: Speech Synthesis from Articulatory Movements Recorded by Real-time MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous real-time MRI (rtMRI)-based speech synthesis models depend heavily on noisy ground-truth speech. Applying loss directly over ground truth mel-spectrograms entangles speech content with MRI noise, resulting in poor intelligibility. We introduce a novel approach that adapts the multi-modal self-supervised AV-HuBERT model for text prediction from rtMRI and incorporates a new flow-based duration predictor for speaker-specific alignment. The predicted text and durations are then used by a speech decoder to synthesize aligned speech in any novel voice. We conduct thorough experiments on two datasets and demonstrate our method's generalization ability to unseen speakers. We assess our framework's performance by masking parts of the rtMRI video to evaluate the impact of different articulators on text prediction. Our method achieves a $15.18\%$ Word Error Rate (WER) on the USC-TIMIT MRI corpus, marking a huge improvement over the current state-of-the-art.

      <title>Advancing NAM-to-Speech Conversion with Novel Methods and the MultiNAM Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current Non-Audible Murmur (NAM)-to-speech techniques rely on voice cloning to simulate ground-truth speech from paired whispers. However, the simulated speech often lacks intelligibility and fails to generalize well across different speakers. To address this issue, we focus on learning phoneme-level alignments from paired whispers and text and employ a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system to simulate the ground-truth. To reduce dependence on whispers, we learn phoneme alignments directly from NAMs, though the quality is constrained by the available training data. To further mitigate reliance on NAM/whisper data for ground-truth simulation, we propose incorporating the lip modality to infer speech and introduce a novel diffusion-based method that leverages recent advancements in lip-to-speech technology. Additionally, we release the MultiNAM dataset with over $7.96$ hours of paired NAM, whisper, video, and text data from two speakers and benchmark all methods on this dataset. Speech samples and the dataset are available at \url{https://diff-nam.github.io/DiffNAM/}</description>

      <title>Attention-Enhanced Short-Time Wiener Solution for Acoustic Echo Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC) is an essential speech signal processing technology that removes echoes from microphone inputs to facilitate natural-sounding full-duplex communication. Currently, deep learning-based AEC methods primarily focus on refining model architectures, frequently neglecting the incorporation of knowledge from traditional filter theory. This paper presents an innovative approach to AEC by introducing an attention-enhanced short-time Wiener solution. Our method strategically harnesses attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of double-talk interference, thereby optimizing the efficiency of knowledge utilization. The derivation of the short-term Wiener solution, which adapts classical Wiener solutions to finite input causality, integrates established insights from filter theory into this method. The experimental outcomes corroborate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, surpassing other baseline models in performance and generalization.

      <title>Robust Target Speaker Direction of Arrival Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multi-speaker environments the direction of arrival (DOA) of a target speaker is key for improving speech clarity and extracting target speaker's voice. However, traditional DOA estimation methods often struggle in the presence of noise, reverberation, and particularly when competing speakers are present. To address these challenges, we propose RTS-DOA, a robust real-time DOA estimation system. This system innovatively uses the registered speech of the target speaker as a reference and leverages full-band and sub-band spectral information from a microphone array to estimate the DOA of the target speaker's voice. Specifically, the system comprises a speech enhancement module for initially improving speech quality, a spatial module for learning spatial information, and a speaker module for extracting voiceprint features. Experimental results on the LibriSpeech dataset demonstrate that our RTS-DOA system effectively tackles multi-speaker scenarios and established new optimal benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Leave-One-EquiVariant: Alleviating invariance-related information loss in contrastive music representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contrastive learning has proven effective in self-supervised musical representation learning, particularly for Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks. However, reliance on augmentation chains for contrastive view generation and the resulting learnt invariances pose challenges when different downstream tasks require sensitivity to certain musical attributes. To address this, we propose the Leave One EquiVariant (LOEV) framework, which introduces a flexible, task-adaptive approach compared to previous work by selectively preserving information about specific augmentations, allowing the model to maintain task-relevant equivariances. We demonstrate that LOEV alleviates information loss related to learned invariances, improving performance on augmentation related tasks and retrieval without sacrificing general representation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a variant of LOEV, LOEV++, which builds a disentangled latent space by design in a self-supervised manner, and enables targeted retrieval based on augmentation related attributes.</description>

      <title>BSDB-Net: Band-Split Dual-Branch Network with Selective State Spaces Mechanism for Monaural Speech Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the complex spectrum-based speech enhancement(SE) methods have achieved significant performance, coupling amplitude and phase can lead to a compensation effect, where amplitude information is sacrificed to compensate for the phase that is harmful to SE. In addition, to further improve the performance of SE, many modules are stacked onto SE, resulting in increased model complexity that limits the application of SE. To address these problems, we proposed a dual-path network based on compressed frequency using Mamba. First, we extract amplitude and phase information through parallel dual branches. This approach leverages structured complex spectra to implicitly capture phase information and solves the compensation effect by decoupling amplitude and phase, and the network incorporates an interaction module to suppress unnecessary parts and recover missing components from the other branch. Second, to reduce network complexity, the network introduces a band-split strategy to compress the frequency dimension. To further reduce complexity while maintaining good performance, we designed a Mamba-based module that models the time and frequency dimensions under linear complexity. Finally, compared to baselines, our model achieves an average 8.3 times reduction in computational complexity while maintaining superior performance. Furthermore, it achieves a 25 times reduction in complexity compared to transformer-based models.</description>

      <title>CoheDancers: Enhancing Interactive Group Dance Generation through Music-Driven Coherence Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dance generation is crucial and challenging, particularly in domains like dance performance and virtual gaming. In the current body of literature, most methodologies focus on Solo Music2Dance. While there are efforts directed towards Group Music2Dance, these often suffer from a lack of coherence, resulting in aesthetically poor dance performances. Thus, we introduce CoheDancers, a novel framework for Music-Driven Interactive Group Dance Generation. CoheDancers aims to enhance group dance generation coherence by decomposing it into three key aspects: synchronization, naturalness, and fluidity. Correspondingly, we develop a Cycle Consistency based Dance Synchronization strategy to foster music-dance correspondences, an Auto-Regressive-based Exposure Bias Correction strategy to enhance the fluidity of the generated dances, and an Adversarial Training Strategy to augment the naturalness of the group dance output. Collectively, these strategies enable CohdeDancers to produce highly coherent group dances with superior quality. Furthermore, to establish better benchmarks for Group Music2Dance, we construct the most diverse and comprehensive open-source dataset to date, I-Dancers, featuring rich dancer interactions, and create comprehensive evaluation metrics. Experimental evaluations on I-Dancers and other extant datasets substantiate that CoheDancers achieves unprecedented state-of-the-art performance. Code will be released.</description>

      <title>Personalized Dynamic Music Emotion Recognition with Dual-Scale Attention-Based Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic Music Emotion Recognition (DMER) aims to predict the emotion of different moments in music, playing a crucial role in music information retrieval. The existing DMER methods struggle to capture long-term dependencies when dealing with sequence data, which limits their performance. Furthermore, these methods often overlook the influence of individual differences on emotion perception, even though everyone has their own personalized emotional perception in the real world. Motivated by these issues, we explore more effective sequence processing methods and introduce the Personalized DMER (PDMER) problem, which requires models to predict emotions that align with personalized perception. Specifically, we propose a Dual-Scale Attention-Based Meta-Learning (DSAML) method. This method fuses features from a dual-scale feature extractor and captures both short and long-term dependencies using a dual-scale attention transformer, improving the performance in traditional DMER. To achieve PDMER, we design a novel task construction strategy that divides tasks by annotators. Samples in a task are annotated by the same annotator, ensuring consistent perception. Leveraging this strategy alongside meta-learning, DSAML can predict personalized perception of emotions with just one personalized annotation sample. Our objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance in both traditional DMER and PDMER.</description>

      <title>Improving Generalization for AI-Synthesized Voice Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI-synthesized voice technology has the potential to create realistic human voices for beneficial applications, but it can also be misused for malicious purposes. While existing AI-synthesized voice detection models excel in intra-domain evaluation, they face challenges in generalizing across different domains, potentially becoming obsolete as new voice generators emerge. Current solutions use diverse data and advanced machine learning techniques (e.g., domain-invariant representation, self-supervised learning), but are limited by predefined vocoders and sensitivity to factors like background noise and speaker identity. In this work, we introduce an innovative disentanglement framework aimed at extracting domain-agnostic artifact features related to vocoders. Utilizing these features, we enhance model learning in a flat loss landscape, enabling escape from suboptimal solutions and improving generalization. Extensive experiments on benchmarks show our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 5.12% improvement in the equal error rate metric in intra-domain and 7.59% in cross-domain evaluations.</description>

      <title>ETTA: Elucidating the Design Space of Text-to-Audio Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant progress in Text-To-Audio (TTA) synthesis, enabling users to enrich their creative workflows with synthetic audio generated from natural language prompts. Despite this progress, the effects of data, model architecture, training objective functions, and sampling strategies on target benchmarks are not well understood. With the purpose of providing a holistic understanding of the design space of TTA models, we set up a large-scale empirical experiment focused on diffusion and flow matching models. Our contributions include: 1) AF-Synthetic, a large dataset of high quality synthetic captions obtained from an audio understanding model; 2) a systematic comparison of different architectural, training, and inference design choices for TTA models; 3) an analysis of sampling methods and their Pareto curves with respect to generation quality and inference speed. We leverage the knowledge obtained from this extensive analysis to propose our best model dubbed Elucidated Text-To-Audio (ETTA). When evaluated on AudioCaps and MusicCaps, ETTA provides improvements over the baselines trained on publicly available data, while being competitive with models trained on proprietary data. Finally, we show ETTA's improved ability to generate creative audio following complex and imaginative captions -- a task that is more challenging than current benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Intra- and Inter-modal Context Interaction Modeling for Conversational Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational Speech Synthesis (CSS) aims to effectively take the multimodal dialogue history (MDH) to generate speech with appropriate conversational prosody for target utterance. The key challenge of CSS is to model the interaction between the MDH and the target utterance. Note that text and speech modalities in MDH have their own unique influences, and they complement each other to produce a comprehensive impact on the target utterance. Previous works did not explicitly model such intra-modal and inter-modal interactions. To address this issue, we propose a new intra-modal and inter-modal context interaction scheme-based CSS system, termed III-CSS. Specifically, in the training phase, we combine the MDH with the text and speech modalities in the target utterance to obtain four modal combinations, including Historical Text-Next Text, Historical Speech-Next Speech, Historical Text-Next Speech, and Historical Speech-Next Text. Then, we design two contrastive learning-based intra-modal and two inter-modal interaction modules to deeply learn the intra-modal and inter-modal context interaction. In the inference phase, we take MDH and adopt trained interaction modules to fully infer the speech prosody of the target utterance's text content. Subjective and objective experiments on the DailyTalk dataset show that III-CSS outperforms the advanced baselines in terms of prosody expressiveness. Code and speech samples are available at https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/I3CSS.</description>

      <title>Towards Expressive Video Dubbing with Multiscale Multimodal Context Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic Video Dubbing (AVD) generates speech aligned with lip motion and facial emotion from scripts. Recent research focuses on modeling multimodal context to enhance prosody expressiveness but overlooks two key issues: 1) Multiscale prosody expression attributes in the context influence the current sentence's prosody. 2) Prosody cues in context interact with the current sentence, impacting the final prosody expressiveness. To tackle these challenges, we propose M2CI-Dubber, a Multiscale Multimodal Context Interaction scheme for AVD. This scheme includes two shared M2CI encoders to model the multiscale multimodal context and facilitate its deep interaction with the current sentence. By extracting global and local features for each modality in the context, utilizing attention-based mechanisms for aggregation and interaction, and employing an interaction-based graph attention network for fusion, the proposed approach enhances the prosody expressiveness of synthesized speech for the current sentence. Experiments on the Chem dataset show our model outperforms baselines in dubbing expressiveness. The code and demos are available at \textcolor[rgb]{0.93,0.0,0.47}{https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/M2CI-Dubber}.</description>

      <title>Computational Analysis of Yaredawi YeZema Silt in Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church Chants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite its musicological, cultural, and religious significance, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church (EOTC) chant is relatively underrepresented in music research. Historical records, including manuscripts, research papers, and oral traditions, confirm Saint Yared's establishment of three canonical EOTC chanting modes during the 6th century. This paper attempts to investigate the EOTC chants using music information retrieval (MIR) techniques. Among the research questions regarding the analysis and understanding of EOTC chants, Yaredawi YeZema Silt, namely the mode of chanting adhering to Saint Yared's standards, is of primary importance. Therefore, we consider the task of Yaredawi YeZema Silt classification in EOTC chants by introducing a new dataset and showcasing a series of classification experiments for this task. Results show that using the distribution of stabilized pitch contours as the feature representation on a simple neural network-based classifier becomes an effective solution. The musicological implications and insights of such results are further discussed through a comparative study with the previous ethnomusicology literature on EOTC chants. By making this dataset publicly accessible, we aim to promote future exploration and analysis of EOTC chants and highlight potential directions for further research, thereby fostering a deeper understanding and preservation of this unique spiritual and cultural heritage.</description>

      <title>Structured Speaker-Deficiency Adaptation of Foundation Models for Dysarthric and Elderly Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-intensive fine-tuning of speech foundation models (SFMs) to scarce and diverse dysarthric and elderly speech leads to data bias and poor generalization to unseen speakers. This paper proposes novel structured speaker-deficiency adaptation approaches for SSL pre-trained SFMs on such data. Speaker and speech deficiency invariant SFMs were constructed in their supervised adaptive fine-tuning stage to reduce undue bias to training data speakers, and serves as a more neutral and robust starting point for test time unsupervised adaptation. Speech variability attributed to speaker identity and speech impairment severity, or aging induced neurocognitive decline, are modelled using separate adapters that can be combined together to model any seen or unseen speaker. Experiments on the UASpeech dysarthric and DementiaBank Pitt elderly speech corpora suggest structured speaker-deficiency adaptation of HuBERT and Wav2vec2-conformer models consistently outperforms baseline SFMs using either: a) no adapters; b) global adapters shared among all speakers; or c) single attribute adapters modelling speaker or deficiency labels alone by statistically significant WER reductions up to 3.01% and 1.50% absolute (10.86% and 6.94% relative) on the two tasks respectively. The lowest published WER of 19.45% (49.34% on very low intelligibility, 33.17% on unseen words) is obtained on the UASpeech test set of 16 dysarthric speakers.</description>

      <title>Indonesian-English Code-Switching Speech Synthesizer Utilizing Multilingual STEN-TTS and Bert LID</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multilingual text-to-speech systems convert text into speech across multiple languages. In many cases, text sentences may contain segments in different languages, a phenomenon known as code-switching. This is particularly common in Indonesia, especially between Indonesian and English. Despite its significance, no research has yet developed a multilingual TTS system capable of handling code-switching between these two languages. This study addresses Indonesian-English code-switching in STEN-TTS. Key modifications include adding a language identification component to the text-to-phoneme conversion using finetuned BERT for per-word language identification, as well as removing language embedding from the base model. Experimental results demonstrate that the code-switching model achieves superior naturalness and improved speech intelligibility compared to the Indonesian and English baseline STEN-TTS models.</description>

      <title>Attacking Voice Anonymization Systems with Augmented Feature and Speaker Identity Difference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the First VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge within the ICASSP 2025 Signal Processing Grand Challenge, which aims to develop speaker verification systems capable of determining whether two anonymized speech signals are from the same speaker. However, differences between feature distributions of original and anonymized speech complicate this task. To address this challenge, we propose an attacker system that combines Data Augmentation enhanced feature representation and Speaker Identity Difference enhanced classifier to improve verification performance, termed DA-SID. Specifically, data augmentation strategies (i.e., data fusion and SpecAugment) are utilized to mitigate feature distribution gaps, while probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) is employed to further enhance speaker identity difference. Our system significantly outperforms the baseline, demonstrating exceptional effectiveness and robustness against various voice anonymization systems, ultimately securing a top-5 ranking in the challenge.</description>

      <title>Causal Speech Enhancement with Predicting Semantics based on Quantized Self-supervised Learning Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time speech enhancement (SE) is essential to online speech communication. Causal SE models use only the previous context while predicting future information, such as phoneme continuation, may help performing causal SE. The phonetic information is often represented by quantizing latent features of self-supervised learning (SSL) models. This work is the first to incorporate SSL features with causality into an SE model. The causal SSL features are encoded and combined with spectrogram features using feature-wise linear modulation to estimate a mask for enhancing the noisy input speech. Simultaneously, we quantize the causal SSL features using vector quantization to represent phonetic characteristics as semantic tokens. The model not only encodes SSL features but also predicts the future semantic tokens in multi-task learning (MTL). The experimental results using VoiceBank + DEMAND dataset show that our proposed method achieves 2.88 in PESQ, especially with semantic prediction MTL, in which we confirm that the semantic prediction played an important role in causal SE.</description>

      <title>VoiceDiT: Dual-Condition Diffusion Transformer for Environment-Aware Speech Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present VoiceDiT, a multi-modal generative model for producing environment-aware speech and audio from text and visual prompts. While aligning speech with text is crucial for intelligible speech, achieving this alignment in noisy conditions remains a significant and underexplored challenge in the field. To address this, we present a novel audio generation pipeline named VoiceDiT. This pipeline includes three key components: (1) the creation of a large-scale synthetic speech dataset for pre-training and a refined real-world speech dataset for fine-tuning, (2) the Dual-DiT, a model designed to efficiently preserve aligned speech information while accurately reflecting environmental conditions, and (3) a diffusion-based Image-to-Audio Translator that allows the model to bridge the gap between audio and image, facilitating the generation of environmental sound that aligns with the multi-modal prompts. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that VoiceDiT outperforms previous models on real-world datasets, showcasing significant improvements in both audio quality and modality integration.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning-Based Delayless Subband Adaptive Filter using Complex Self-Attention for Active Noise Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active noise control typically employs adaptive filtering to generate secondary noise, where the least mean square algorithm is the most widely used. However, traditional updating rules are linear and exhibit limited effectiveness in addressing nonlinear environments and nonstationary noise. To tackle this challenge, we reformulate the active noise control problem as a meta-learning problem and propose a meta-learning-based delayless subband adaptive filter with deep neural networks. The core idea is to utilize a neural network as an adaptive algorithm that can adapt to different environments and types of noise. The neural network will train under noisy observations, implying that it recognizes the optimized updating rule without true labels. A single-headed attention recurrent neural network is devised with learnable feature embedding to update the adaptive filter weight efficiently, enabling accurate computation of the secondary source to attenuate the unwanted primary noise. In order to relax the time constraint on updating the adaptive filter weights, the delayless subband architecture is employed, which will allow the system to be updated less frequently as the downsampling factor increases. In addition, the delayless subband architecture does not introduce additional time delays in active noise control systems. A skip updating strategy is introduced to decrease the updating frequency further so that machines with limited resources have more possibility to board our meta-learning-based model. Extensive multi-condition training ensures generalization and robustness against various types of noise and environments. Simulation results demonstrate that our meta-learning-based model achieves superior noise reduction performance compared to traditional methods.</description>

      <title>MERT: Acoustic Music Understanding Model with Large-Scale Self-supervised Training</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.00107v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for training generalisable models on large-scale data in the fields of vision, text, and speech. Although SSL has been proven effective in speech and audio, its application to music audio has yet to be thoroughly explored. This is partially due to the distinctive challenges associated with modelling musical knowledge, particularly tonal and pitched characteristics of music. To address this research gap, we propose an acoustic Music undERstanding model with large-scale self-supervised Training (MERT), which incorporates teacher models to provide pseudo labels in the masked language modelling (MLM) style acoustic pre-training. In our exploration, we identified an effective combination of teacher models, which outperforms conventional speech and audio approaches in terms of performance. This combination includes an acoustic teacher based on Residual Vector Quantisation - Variational AutoEncoder (RVQ-VAE) and a musical teacher based on the Constant-Q Transform (CQT). Furthermore, we explore a wide range of settings to overcome the instability in acoustic language model pre-training, which allows our designed paradigm to scale from 95M to 330M parameters. Experimental results indicate that our model can generalise and perform well on 14 music understanding tasks and attain state-of-the-art (SOTA) overall scores.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating dances that are both lifelike and well-aligned with music continues to be a challenging task in the cross-modal domain. This paper introduces PopDanceSet, the first dataset tailored to the preferences of young audiences, enabling the generation of aesthetically oriented dances. And it surpasses the AIST++ dataset in music genre diversity and the intricacy and depth of dance movements. Moreover, the proposed POPDG model within the iDDPM framework enhances dance diversity and, through the Space Augmentation Algorithm, strengthens spatial physical connections between human body joints, ensuring that increased diversity does not compromise generation quality. A streamlined Alignment Module is also designed to improve the temporal alignment between dance and music. Extensive experiments show that POPDG achieves SOTA results on two datasets. Furthermore, the paper also expands on current evaluation metrics. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/Luke-Luo1/POPDG.</description>

      <title>The Codecfake Dataset and Countermeasures for the Universally Detection of Deepfake Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the proliferation of Audio Language Model (ALM) based deepfake audio, there is an urgent need for generalized detection methods. ALM-based deepfake audio currently exhibits widespread, high deception, and type versatility, posing a significant challenge to current audio deepfake detection (ADD) models trained solely on vocoded data. To effectively detect ALM-based deepfake audio, we focus on the mechanism of the ALM-based audio generation method, the conversion from neural codec to waveform. We initially constructed the Codecfake dataset, an open-source, large-scale collection comprising over 1 million audio samples in both English and Chinese, focus on ALM-based audio detection. As countermeasure, to achieve universal detection of deepfake audio and tackle domain ascent bias issue of original sharpness aware minimization (SAM), we propose the CSAM strategy to learn a domain balanced and generalized minima. In our experiments, we first demonstrate that ADD model training with the Codecfake dataset can effectively detects ALM-based audio. Furthermore, our proposed generalization countermeasure yields the lowest average equal error rate (EER) of 0.616% across all test conditions compared to baseline models. The dataset and associated code are available online.</description>

      <title>WMCodec: End-to-End Neural Speech Codec with Deep Watermarking for Authenticity Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in speech spoofing necessitate stronger verification mechanisms in neural speech codecs to ensure authenticity. Current methods embed numerical watermarks before compression and extract them from reconstructed speech for verification, but face limitations such as separate training processes for the watermark and codec, and insufficient cross-modal information integration, leading to reduced watermark imperceptibility, extraction accuracy, and capacity. To address these issues, we propose WMCodec, the first neural speech codec to jointly train compression-reconstruction and watermark embedding-extraction in an end-to-end manner, optimizing both imperceptibility and extractability of the watermark. Furthermore, We design an iterative Attention Imprint Unit (AIU) for deeper feature integration of watermark and speech, reducing the impact of quantization noise on the watermark. Experimental results show WMCodec outperforms AudioSeal with Encodec in most quality metrics for watermark imperceptibility and consistently exceeds both AudioSeal with Encodec and reinforced TraceableSpeech in extraction accuracy of watermark. At bandwidth of 6 kbps with a watermark capacity of 16 bps, WMCodec maintains over 99% extraction accuracy under common attacks, demonstrating strong robustness.</description>

      <title>CosyVoice 2: Scalable Streaming Speech Synthesis with Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10117v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In our previous work, we introduced CosyVoice, a multilingual speech synthesis model based on supervised discrete speech tokens. By employing progressive semantic decoding with two popular generative models, language models (LMs) and Flow Matching, CosyVoice demonstrated high prosody naturalness, content consistency, and speaker similarity in speech in-context learning. Recently, significant progress has been made in multi-modal large language models (LLMs), where the response latency and real-time factor of speech synthesis play a crucial role in the interactive experience. Therefore, in this report, we present an improved streaming speech synthesis model, CosyVoice 2, which incorporates comprehensive and systematic optimizations. Specifically, we introduce finite-scalar quantization to improve the codebook utilization of speech tokens. For the text-speech LM, we streamline the model architecture to allow direct use of a pre-trained LLM as the backbone. In addition, we develop a chunk-aware causal flow matching model to support various synthesis scenarios, enabling both streaming and non-streaming synthesis within a single model. By training on a large-scale multilingual dataset, CosyVoice 2 achieves human-parity naturalness, minimal response latency, and virtually lossless synthesis quality in the streaming mode. We invite readers to listen to the demos at https://funaudiollm.github.io/cosyvoice2.</description>

Abstract: Respiratory sound contains crucial information for the early diagnosis of fatal lung diseases. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been a growing interest in contact-free medical care based on electronic stethoscopes. To this end, cutting-edge deep learning models have been developed to diagnose lung diseases; however, it is still challenging due to the scarcity of medical data. In this study, we demonstrate that the pretrained model on large-scale visual and audio datasets can be generalized to the respiratory sound classification task. In addition, we introduce a straightforward Patch-Mix augmentation, which randomly mixes patches between different samples, with Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST). We further propose a novel and effective Patch-Mix Contrastive Learning to distinguish the mixed representations in the latent space. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ICBHI dataset, outperforming the prior leading score by an improvement of 4.08%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite the impressive progress of multimodal generative models, video-to-audio generation still suffers from limited performance and limits the flexibility to prioritize sound synthesis for specific objects within the scene. Conversely, text-to-audio generation methods generate high-quality audio but pose challenges in ensuring comprehensive scene depiction and time-varying control. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel video-and-text-to-audio generation method, called \ours, where video serves as a conditional control for a text-to-audio generation model. Especially, our method estimates the structural information of sound (namely, energy) from the video while receiving key content cues from a user prompt. We employ a well-performing text-to-audio model to consolidate the video control, which is much more efficient for training multimodal diffusion models with massive triplet-paired (audio-video-text) data. In addition, by separating the generative components of audio, it becomes a more flexible system that allows users to freely adjust the energy, surrounding environment, and primary sound source according to their preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that our method shows superiority in terms of quality, controllability, and training efficiency.

Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) systems rely on speech input and emotional labels annotated by humans. However, various emotion databases collect perceptional evaluations in different ways. For instance, the IEMOCAP dataset uses video clips with sounds for annotators to provide their emotional perceptions. However, the most significant English emotion dataset, the MSP-PODCAST, only provides speech for raters to choose the emotional ratings. Nevertheless, using speech as input is the standard approach to training SER systems. Therefore, the open question is the emotional labels elicited by which scenarios are the most effective for training SER systems. We comprehensively compare the effectiveness of SER systems trained with labels elicited by different modality stimuli and evaluate the SER systems on various testing conditions. Also, we introduce an all-inclusive label that combines all labels elicited by various modalities. We show that using labels elicited by voice-only stimuli for training yields better performance on the test set, whereas labels elicited by voice-only stimuli.</description>

      <title>Differential privacy enables fair and accurate AI-based analysis of speech disorders while protecting patient data</title>

Abstract: Speech pathology has impacts on communication abilities and quality of life. While deep learning-based models have shown potential in diagnosing these disorders, the use of sensitive data raises critical privacy concerns. Although differential privacy (DP) has been explored in the medical imaging domain, its application in pathological speech analysis remains largely unexplored despite the equally critical privacy concerns. This study is the first to investigate DP's impact on pathological speech data, focusing on the trade-offs between privacy, diagnostic accuracy, and fairness. Using a large, real-world dataset of 200 hours of recordings from 2,839 German-speaking participants, we observed a maximum accuracy reduction of 3.85% when training with DP with high privacy levels. To highlight real-world privacy risks, we demonstrated the vulnerability of non-private models to explicit gradient inversion attacks, reconstructing identifiable speech samples and showcasing DP's effectiveness in mitigating these risks. To generalize our findings across languages and disorders, we validated our approach on a dataset of Spanish-speaking Parkinson's disease patients, leveraging pretrained models from healthy English-speaking datasets, and demonstrated that careful pretraining on large-scale task-specific datasets can maintain favorable accuracy under DP constraints. A comprehensive fairness analysis revealed minimal gender bias at reasonable privacy levels but underscored the need for addressing age-related disparities. Our results establish that DP can balance privacy and utility in speech disorder detection, while highlighting unique challenges in privacy-fairness trade-offs for speech data. This provides a foundation for refining DP methodologies and improving fairness across diverse patient groups in real-world deployments.</description>

      <title>Mamba for Streaming ASR Combined with Unimodal Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper works on streaming automatic speech recognition (ASR). Mamba, a recently proposed state space model, has demonstrated the ability to match or surpass Transformers in various tasks while benefiting from a linear complexity advantage. We explore the efficiency of Mamba encoder for streaming ASR and propose an associated lookahead mechanism for leveraging controllable future information. Additionally, a streaming-style unimodal aggregation (UMA) method is implemented, which automatically detects token activity and streamingly triggers token output, and meanwhile aggregates feature frames for better learning token representation. Based on UMA, an early termination (ET) method is proposed to further reduce recognition latency. Experiments conducted on two Mandarin Chinese datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves competitive ASR performance in terms of both recognition accuracy and latency.</description>

      <title>Building a Taiwanese Mandarin Spoken Language Model: A First Attempt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This technical report presents our initial attempt to build a spoken large language model (LLM) for Taiwanese Mandarin, specifically tailored to enable real-time, speech-to-speech interaction in multi-turn conversations. Our end-to-end model incorporates a decoder-only transformer architecture and aims to achieve seamless interaction while preserving the conversational flow, including full-duplex capabilities allowing simultaneous speaking and listening. The paper also details the training process, including data preparation with synthesized dialogues and adjustments for real-time interaction. We also developed a platform to evaluate conversational fluency and response coherence in multi-turn dialogues. We hope the release of the report can contribute to the future development of spoken LLMs in Taiwanese Mandarin.</description>
