      <title>FedRAIN-Lite: Federated Reinforcement Algorithms for Improving Idealised Numerical Weather and Climate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-grid parameterisations in climate models are traditionally static and tuned offline, limiting adaptability to evolving states. This work introduces FedRAIN-Lite, a federated reinforcement learning (FedRL) framework that mirrors the spatial decomposition used in general circulation models (GCMs) by assigning agents to latitude bands, enabling local parameter learning with periodic global aggregation. Using a hierarchy of simplified energy-balance climate models, from a single-agent baseline (ebm-v1) to multi-agent ensemble (ebm-v2) and GCM-like (ebm-v3) setups, we benchmark three RL algorithms under different FedRL configurations. Results show that Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) consistently outperforms both static and single-agent baselines, with faster convergence and lower area-weighted RMSE in tropical and mid-latitude zones across both ebm-v2 and ebm-v3 setups. DDPG's ability to transfer across hyperparameters and low computational cost make it well-suited for geographically adaptive parameter learning. This capability offers a scalable pathway towards high-complexity GCMs and provides a prototype for physically aligned, online-learning climate models that can evolve with a changing climate.

      <title>Resolvent model-based analyses of coherent structures in Langmuir turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the coherent structures in Langmuir turbulence, a state of the ocean surface boundary layer driven by the interactions between water waves and wind-induced shear, via a resolvent framework. Langmuir turbulence is characterised by multiscale vortical structures, notably counter-rotating roll pairs known as Langmuir circulations. While classic linear stability analyses of the Craik-Leibovich equations have revealed key instability mechanisms underlying Langmuir circulations, the vortical rolls characteristic of Langmuir turbulence, the present work incorporates the turbulent mean state and varying eddy viscosity using data from large-eddy simulation (LES) to investigate the turbulence dynamics of fully developed Langmuir turbulence. Scale-dependent resolvent analyses reveal a new formation mechanism of two-dimensional circulating rolls and three-dimensional turbulent coherent vortices through linear amplification of sustained harmonic forcing. Moreover, the integrated energy spectra predicted by the principal resolvent modes in response to broadband harmonic forcing capture the dominant spanwise length scales that are consistent with the LES data. These results demonstrate the feasibility of resolvent analyses in capturing key features of multiscale turbulence-wave interactions in the statistical equilibrium state of Langmuir turbulence.</description>

      <title>AtmosMJ: Revisiting Gating Mechanism for AI Weather Forecasting Beyond the Year Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09733v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of Large Weather Models (LWMs) has marked a turning point in data-driven forecasting, with many models now outperforming traditional numerical systems in the medium range. However, achieving stable, long-range autoregressive forecasts beyond a few weeks remains a significant challenge. Prevailing state-of-the-art models that achieve year-long stability, such as SFNO and DLWP-HPX, have relied on transforming input data onto non-standard spatial domains like spherical harmonics or HEALPix meshes. This has led to the prevailing assumption that such representations are necessary to enforce physical consistency and long-term stability. This paper challenges that assumption by investigating whether comparable long-range performance can be achieved on the standard latitude-longitude grid. We introduce AtmosMJ, a deep convolutional network that operates directly on ERA5 data without any spherical remapping. The model's stability is enabled by a novel Gated Residual Fusion (GRF) mechanism, which adaptively moderates feature updates to prevent error accumulation over long recursive simulations. Our results demonstrate that AtmosMJ produces stable and physically plausible forecasts for about 500 days. In quantitative evaluations, it achieves competitive 10-day forecast accuracy against models like Pangu-Weather and GraphCast, all while requiring a remarkably low training budget of 5.7 days on a V100 GPU. Our findings suggest that efficient architectural design, rather than non-standard data representation, can be the key to unlocking stable and computationally efficient long-range weather prediction.</description>
