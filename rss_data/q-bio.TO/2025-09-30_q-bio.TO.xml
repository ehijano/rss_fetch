      <title>Load Transfer along Continuous Collagen Fibers Reduces the Importance of Wall Thickness Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mechanical response of biological soft tissues is influenced by wall heterogeneity, including spatial variations in wall thickness. Traditional models for homogeneous soft tissues under uniaxial loading predict higher stretch and stress in thinner regions. In fact, large gradients in stretch and stress are predicted to be induced by spatial variations in wall thickness. In prior studies, the role of collagen fibers in regions of thickness transition has been largely neglected or only considered in terms of their effect on anisotropy. Here, we explore the role of collagen fibers as primary load-bearing components across regions of varying wall thickness, using a three-dimensional representative volume element (RVE) model incorporating explicit collagen fiber architecture and a gradual thickness gradient. We examined two distinct collagen fiber configurations across the thickness transition: one featuring abrupt fiber termination and another with fiber continuity. Finite element analysis (FEA) under uniaxial tension revealed that load transfer by continuous fibers across the specimen markedly reduced the importance of the change in wall thickness, with stretch differentials dropping from ~20% (fiber-termination network) to 0.68% (continuous fibers) and stress differentials dropping from ~65% (fiber-termination network) to 2.3% (continuous fibers). Fiber tortuosity delayed the point at which mechanical response was governed by fiber structure. These findings demonstrate the critical role of fiber continuity in reducing stretch and stress gradients across regions of varying wall thickness and clarify the importance of accurately representing fiber architecture when modeling soft tissues with heterogeneous wall thickness.</description>

      <title>Millennium Pathways for Tractography: 40 grand challenges to shape the future of tractography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the spirit of the historic Millennium Prize Problems that heralded a new era for mathematics, the newly formed International Society for Tractography (IST) has launched the Millennium Pathways for Tractography, a community-driven roadmap designed to shape the future of the field. Conceived during the inaugural Tract-Anat Retreat, this initiative reflects a collective vision for advancing tractography over the coming decade and beyond. The roadmap consists of 40 grand challenges, developed by international experts and organized into seven categories spanning three overarching themes: neuroanatomy, tractography methods, and clinical applications. By defining shared short-, medium-, and long-term goals, these pathways provide a structured framework to confront fundamental limitations, promote rigorous validation, and accelerate the translation of tractography into a robust tool for neuroscience and medicine. Ultimately, the Millennium Pathways aim to guide and inspire future research and collaboration, ensuring the continued scientific and clinical relevance of tractography well into the future.</description>
