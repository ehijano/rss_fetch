      <title>Design and Reprogrammability of Zero Modes in 2D Materials from a Single Element</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical extremal materials, a class of metamaterials that exist at the bounds of elastic theory, possess the extraordinary capability to engineer any desired elastic behavior by harnessing mechanical zero modes -- deformation modes that demand minimal or no elastic energy. However, the potential for arbitrary construction and reprogramming of metamaterials remains largely unrealized, primarily due to significant challenges in qualitatively transforming zero modes within the confines of existing metamaterial design frameworks. In this work, we show a method for explicitly defining and in situ reprogramming zero modes of two-dimensional extremal materials by employing straight-line mechanisms (SLMs) and planar symmetry, which prescribe and coordinate the zero modes, respectively. We design, test, and reprogram centimeter-scale isotropic, orthotropic, and chiral extremal materials by reorienting the SLMs in place, enabling these materials to smoothly and reversibly interpolate between extremal modalities (e.g., unimode to bimode) and material properties (e.g., negative to positive Poisson's ratios) without changing the metamaterial's global structure. Our methodology provides a straightforward and explicit strategy for the design and tuning of all varieties of two-dimensional extremal materials, enabling arbitrary and dynamic mechanical metamaterial construction to completely cover the gamut of elastic properties.</description>

      <title>Generating multi-scale NMC particles with radial grain architectures using spatial stochastics and GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding structure-property relationships of Li-ion battery cathodes is crucial for optimizing rate-performance and cycle-life resilience. However, correlating the morphology of cathode particles, such as in NMC811, and their inner grain architecture with electrode performance is challenging, particularly, due to the significant length-scale difference between grain and particle sizes. Experimentally, it is currently not feasible to image such a high number of particles with full granular detail to achieve representivity. A second challenge is that sufficiently high-resolution 3D imaging techniques remain expensive and are sparsely available at research institutions. To address these challenges, a stereological generative adversarial network (GAN)-based model fitting approach is presented that can generate representative 3D information from 2D data, enabling characterization of materials in 3D using cost-effective 2D data. Once calibrated, this multi-scale model is able to rapidly generate virtual cathode particles that are statistically similar to experimental data, and thus is suitable for virtual characterization and materials testing through numerical simulations. A large dataset of simulated particles with inner grain architecture has been made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Non-contact excitation of multi-GHz lithium niobate electromechanical resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The demand for high-performance electromechanical resonators is ever-growing across diverse applications, ranging from sensing and time-keeping to advanced communication devices. Among the electromechanical materials being explored, thin-film lithium niobate stands out for its strong piezoelectric properties and low acoustic loss. However, in nearly all existing lithium niobate electromechanical devices, the configuration is such that the electrodes are in direct contact with the mechanical resonator. This configuration introduces an undesirable mass-loading effect, giving rise to spurious modes and additional damping. Here, we present an electromechanical platform that mitigates this challenge by leveraging a flip-chip bonding technique to separate the electrodes from the mechanical resonator. By offloading the electrodes from the resonator, our approach yields a substantial increase in the quality factor of these resonators, paving the way for enhanced performance and reliability for their device applications.</description>

      <title>Leaf Electronics: Nature-Based Substrates and Electrodes for Organic Electronic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The need to reduce the environmental impact of inorganic electronic systems is pressing. Although the field of organic electronics provides a potential solution to this issue, research and optimization is still majorly carried out on glass or plastic substrates. Additionally, the fabrication of organic devices requiring transparent electrodes is fraught with complex techniques and expensive materials which limit widespread implementation and sustainability goals. Here, we show that the quasi-fractal lignocellulose structures extracted from natural leaves can be successfully modified to be used as biodegradable substrates as well as electrodes for optoelectronic applications. Chemically coating the microstructures of these leaf skeletons with metals results in quasi-transparent, flexible electrodes having sheet resistances below 1 ohm/sq. and a concomitant current carrying capacity as high as 6 A over a 2.5*2.5 cm2 leaf electrode, all while maintaining broadband optical transmittance values of around 80%.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Polarization Conversion and Anomalous Reflection with Anisotropic Printed-Circuit-Board (PCB) Metagratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a semianalytical synthesis scheme for designing realistic printed-circuit-board- (PCB) based metagratings (MGs), capable of simultaneous beam steering and polarization conversion. These low-profile structures, comprised of sparse periodic arrangements of subwavelength polarizable particles (meta-atoms), oriented by insightful analytical models leading to fabrication-ready designs, have gained growing interest in recent years, demonstrating exceptional diffraction engineering capabilities with very high efficiencies. Herein, to facilitate cross-polarization coupling, we introduce a tilted dogbone meta-atom, going beyond the popular vertical (loaded wire) or recently proposed horizontal (dipole) configurations used in common PCB MG manifestations at microwaves, strictly susceptible to either transverse electric (TE) or transverse magnetic (TM) fields, respectively. As shown, the anisotropy introduced by the in-plane rotation of the dogbones, integrated into the MG analytical model in the form of a rotated dipole line, serves as an additional degree of freedom that can be leveraged to nonlocally manipulate the polarization and trajectory of the incident fields. Verified experimentally, the resultant semianalytical synthesis framework enables valuable physical insights, opening the door to integration of efficient anisotropic MGs in applications requiring both polarization and wavefront control, such as satellite, radar and advanced antenna systems.</description>

      <title>Fabrication of n+ contact on p-type high pure Ge by cathodic electrodeposition of Li and impedance analysis of n+/p diode at low temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fabrication of diode by forming n-type electrical contact on germanium (Ge) and its AC impedance analysis is important for radiation detection in the form of pulses. In this work lithium (Li) metal has been electro-deposited on p-type Ge single crystal from molten lithium nitrate at 260{\deg}C. The depth of Li diffusion in Ge was successfully varied by changing the electroplating time as determined by sheet resistance (SR) measurement after successive lapping of Ge surface. Li is found to diffuse up to 500 micron inside Ge by heat treatment of as deposited Li/Ge at 350{\deg}C for 1 hour. A stable n-type electrical contact on Ge with SR ~1 ohm/square and impurity concentration ~3.7x10^15/cm^3 is developed by Li incorporation in p-type Ge crystal showing net carrier concentration ~3.4x10^10/cm^3 and SR ~100 Kohm/square. Acceptor concentration determined from the 1/C^2 vs V plot shows similar temperature dependence as found by Hall measurement. The fabricated n+/p junction exhibit ideal diode characteristics with gradual increase in cut off voltage at low temperatures. Under forward bias, junction capacitance mainly comprises of diffusion capacitance (~10 micro.F) showing strong frequency dependence and the impedance is partly resistive resulting in semicircular Cole-Cole plot. Imaginary impedance spectra reveal that the relaxation time for the diffusion of majority carriers decreases at higher temperatures and increased forward voltages. The diode is purely capacitive under reverse bias showing a line parallel to the y-axis in the Cole-Cole plot with frequency independent (100Hz-100MHz) depletion capacitance ~10pF.</description>

      <title>Real Space Imaging of Field-Driven Decision-Making in Nanomagnetic Galton Boards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A possible spintronic route to hardware implementation for decision making involves injecting a domain wall into a bifurcated magnetic nanostrip resembling a Y-shaped junction. A decision is made when the domain wall chooses a particular path through the bifurcation. Recently, it was shown that a structure like a nanomagnetic Galton Board, which is essentially an array of interconnected Y-shaped junctions, produces outcomes that are stochastic and therefore relevant to artificial neural networks. However, the exact mechanism leading to the robust nature of randomness is unknown. Here, we directly image the decision-making process in nanomagnetic Galton Boards using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. We identify that the stochasticity in nanomagnetic Galton Boards arises as a culmination of: (1) topology of the injected domain wall, (2) local disorder, and (3) strength of the applied field. Our results pave the way to a detailed understanding of stochasticity in nanomagnetic networks.</description>

      <title>Laser-scanning of induction-melted Al alloys: are they representative of additively manufactured ones?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bottleneck of alloy design for powder-based additive manufacturing (AM) resides in powder production-an expensive and time-consuming process hindering the rapid closed-loop design iterations. This study analyzed an expedited experimental workflow, i.e., multipath laser scanning of induction-melted samples, to mimic rapid solidification of AM to serve as an alternative approach to downselect from the design space. Using Al-Ni-Zr-Er model alloy, we compared the microstructural features between the laser-scanned sample and the laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) one. Our results showed that the microstructure morphology is the same for both samples. SEM (&lt; x12000 magnification) shows differences in Zr and Er distribution justified by the repeated reheating for additional layers in the 3D-printed sample. Nonetheless, phase distribution was nearly the same at a high magnification scale under STEM (&gt; x80000). Phase sizes were also compared -- the laser-scanned sample resembles 3D-printed with an average size difference of 15% in Al grain, 14% in Al-Ni-Er ternary precipitates, and 4% in L12 nanoprecipitates. Cooling rates for the two samples were estimated by Rosenthal equation. The higher rate of the 3D-printed sample compared with that of the laser-scanned sample explains its slightly finer phases. The mechanical properties of the two samples were evaluated by microhardness tests. The hardness of the laser-scanned sample was found to be 21% less than that of the 3D-printed sample. The potential reasons were discussed. The study also showed that a similar difference in hardness was observed when the experiments were repeated on a printable benchmark Al alloy showcasing only 1% absolute error. Thus, laser-scanned samples can serve as a predictor of the hardness of LPBF samples, and their highly similar microstructure at high magnification allows their applications in rapid screening tests.</description>

      <title>Res-U2Net: Untrained Deep Learning for Phase Retrieval and Image Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional deep learning-based image reconstruction methods require a large amount of training data which can be hard to obtain in practice. Untrained deep learning methods overcome this limitation by training a network to invert a physical model of the image formation process. Here we present a novel untrained Res-U2Net model for phase retrieval. We use the extracted phase information to determine changes in an object's surface and generate a mesh representation of its 3D structure. We compare the performance of Res-U2Net phase retrieval against UNet and U2Net using images from the GDXRAY dataset.</description>

      <title>Event-Based Simulation of Stochastic Memristive Devices for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we build a general model of memristors suitable for the simulation of event-based systems, such as hardware spiking neural networks, and more generally, neuromorphic computing systems. We extend an existing general model of memristors - the Generalised Metastable Switch Model - to an event-driven setting, eliminating errors associated discrete time approximation, as well as offering potential improvements in terms of computational efficiency for simulation. We introduce the notion of a volatility state variable, to allow for the modelling of memory-dependent and dynamic switching behaviour, succinctly capturing and unifying a variety of volatile phenomena present in memristive devices, including state relaxation, structural disruption, Joule heating, and drift acceleration phenomena. We supply a drift dataset for titanium dioxide memristors and introduce a linear conductance model to simulate the drift characteristics, motivated by a proposed physical model of filament growth. We then demonstrate an approach for fitting the parameters of the event-based model to the drift model.</description>

      <title>TPDH-Graphene as a New Anodic Material for Lithium Ion Battery: DFT-Based Investigations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The potential of tetra-penta-deca-hexagonal graphene (TPDH-gr), a recently proposed 2D carbon allotrope as an anodic material in lithium ion batteries (LIB), was investigated through density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The results indicate that Li-atom adsorption is moderate (around 0.70 eV), allowing for easy desorption. Moreover, energy barrier, diffusion coefficient, and open circuit voltage (OCV) calculations show rapid Li atom diffusion on the TPDH-gr surface, stable intercalation of lithium atoms, and good performance during the charge and discharge cycles of the LIB. These findings, combined with the intrinsic metallic nature of TPDH-gr, indicate that this new 2D carbon allotrope is a promising candidate for use as an anodic LIB material.</description>

      <title>A Unified Model for Probing Solar Cell Dynamics via Cyclic Voltammetry and Impedance Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in emerging solar cell technologies such as hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites, there are still significant limitations related to the stability of the devices and their non-ideal electrical behavior under certain external stimuli. We present a conceptual framework for characterizing photovoltaic devices by integrating cyclic voltammetry (CV) and impedance spectroscopy (IS). This framework is constructed from a microscopic, multi-mode perspective that explicitly accounts for drift, diffusion, displacement, and memory contributions. We derive comprehensive analytical expressions for current-voltage relationships and complex admittance. Our model reveals the inseparable connection between hysteresis behaviors in current-voltage characteristics observed in CV and the apparent capacitive and inductive behaviors seen in IS spectral analysis. We demonstrate how CV and IS naturally complement each other, providing a deeper microscopic understanding of device performance and limitations. Additionally, we establish the relationship between intrinsic material parameters and experimentally accessible extrinsic parameters such as light intensity, temperature, DC bias, voltage amplitude, and frequency. This framework enables unprecedented optimization of solar cell performance, marking a significant advancement towards sustainability.</description>

      <title>Birefringence-free photoelastic modulator with centimeter-square aperture operating at 2.7 MHz with sub-watt drive power</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoelastic modulators are optical devices with a broad range of applications. These devices typically utilize a transverse interaction mechanism between acoustic and optical waves, resulting in a fundamental trade-off between the input aperture and the modulation frequency. Commercially available modulators with centimeter square apertures have operating frequencies in the vicinity of 50 kHz. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a birefringence-free photoelastic modulator operating at approximately 2.7 MHz with a centimeter square aperture, increasing the operating frequency substantially compared to existing approaches. Using the modulator and polarizers, we demonstrate close to $\pi$ radians polarization modulation amplitude with sub-watt drive power, translating to nearly 100% intensity modulation efficiency at the fundamental (2.7 MHz) and second harmonic (5.4 MHz) frequencies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The natural vibrational frequencies of biological particles such as viruses and bacteria encode critical information about their mechanical and biological states as they interact with their local environment and undergo structural evolution. However, detecting and tracking these vibrations within a biological context at the single particle level has remained elusive. In this study, we track the vibrational motions of single, unlabeled virus particles under ambient conditions using ultrafast spectroscopy. The ultrasonic spectrum of an 80-100 nm lentiviral pseudovirus reveals vibrational modes in the 19-22 GHz range sensitive to virus morphology and 2-10 GHz modes with nanosecond dephasing times reflecting viral envelope protein interactions. By tracking virus trajectories over minutes, we observe acoustic mode coupling mediated by the local environment. Single particle tracking allows capture of viral disassembly through correlated mode softening and dephasing. The sensitivity, high resolution, and speed of this approach promise deeper insights into biological dynamics and early-stage diagnostics at the single microorganism level.</description>

      <title>Continuous broadband Rydberg receiver using AC Stark shifts and Floquet States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the continuous broadband microwave receivers based on AC Stark shifts and Floquet States of Rydberg levels in a cesium atomic vapor cell. The resonant transition frequency of two adjacent Rydberg states 78$S_{1/2}$ and 78$P_{1/2}$ is tuned based on AC Stark effect of 70~MHz Radio frequency (RF) field that is applied outside the vapor cell. Meanwhile, the Rydberg states also exhibit Floquet even-order sidebands that are used to extend the bandwidths further. We achieve microwave electric field measurements over 1.172~GHz of continuous frequency range. The sensitivity of the Rydberg receiver with heterodyne technique in the absence of RF field is 280.2~nVcm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$, while it is dramatically decreased with tuning the resonant transition frequency in the presence of RF field. Surprisingly, the sensitivity can be greatly improved if the microwave field couples the Floquet sideband transition. The achieving of continuous frequency and high sensitivity microwave detection will promote the application of Rydberg receiver in the radar technique and wireless communication.</description>

      <title>Broadband radar absorption in high-filling factor magnetic composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electromagnetic properties and microwave absorption capabilities are studied under real radar conditions for layer-type composite samples consisting of a polymeric matrix and a magnetic powder filler, either metallic or ceramic. The effect of the filler type and the filling factor is investigated. The obtained results show remarkable broadband microwave absorption, which make these materials suitable for stealth technology. The experimentally measured absorptions reach -40 dB, while model-based predictions suggest that these systems could overpass the barrier of -50 dB. The experimental results are supported by models, both for single and bilayer systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic single-input control of multi-state multi-transition soft robotic actuator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soft robotics is an attractive and rapidly emerging field, in which actuation is coupled with the elastic response of the robot's structure to achieve complex deformation patterns. A crucial challenge is the need for multiple control inputs, which adds significant complication to the system. We propose a novel concept of single-input control of an actuator composed of interconnected bi-stable elements. Dynamic response of the actuator and pre-designed differences between the elements are exploited to facilitate any desired multi-state transition, using a single dynamic input. We show formulation and analysis of the control system's dynamics and pre-design of its multiple equilibrium states, as well as their stability. Then we fabricate and demonstrate experimentally on single-input control of two- and four-element actuators, where the latter can achieve transitions between up to 48 desired states. Our work paves the way for next-generation soft robotic actuators with minimal actuation and maximal dexterity.</description>

      <title>In-situ localization of damage in a Zn-Al-Mg coating deposited on steel by continuous hot-dip galvanizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zn-Al-Mg coatings are characterized by a complex microstructure with dendritic and eutectic phases. This heterogeneous phase distribution contributes to multiple deformation and damage mechanisms. The presence of brittle phases promotes crack initiation and propagation. This study reveals a new deformation and damage mechanism of a Zn-Al-Mg coating, where twinning can induce crack initiation in the eutectic region. The chronology of different events leading to crack initiation and propagation is clearly established by in-situ tensile testing in a scanning electron microscope, which helps to establish a detailed characterization of the mechanical behavior of the coating.</description>

      <title>Coherent Acoustic Phonons in Plasmonic Nanoparticles: Elastic Properties and Dissipation at Low Temperatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We studied the frequency and quality factor of mechanical plasmonic nanoresonators as a function of temperature, ranging from ambient to 4 K. Our investigation focused on individual gold nanorods and nanodisks of various sizes. We observed that oscillation frequencies increase linearly as temperature decreases until saturation is reached at cryogenic temperatures. This behavior is explained by the temperature dependence of the elastic modulus, with a Debye temperature compatible with reported bulk values for gold. To describe the behavior of the quality factor, we developed a model considering the nanostructures as anelastic solids, identifying a dissipation peak around 150 K due to a thermally activated process, likely of the Niblett-Wilks mechanism type. Importantly, our findings suggest that external dissipation factors are more critical to improving quality factors than internal friction, which can be increased by modifying the nanoresonator's environment. Our results enable the design of structures with high vibration frequencies and quality factors by effectively controlling external losses.</description>

Abstract: This paper reports on the investigation of cavitated silver paste produced by cavitation technology as a cost-effective alternative to traditional three-roll milling (TRM). Cavitation, utilizing high-frequency sound waves, enhances metal paste dispersion, reduces oxidation, extends shelf life, and minimizes waste. Passivated Emitter and Rear Cell (PERC) solar cells made with cavitated silver paste achieved a 21% energy conversion efficiency, slightly lower than the 22% efficiency of conventional paste. Cavitated paste produced finer gridlines, reducing silver usage and costs but increasing contact resistance, leading to a lower fill factor. Despite this, cavitation technology shows promise for more efficient and cost-effective solar cell production. Further research is needed to optimize efficiency and resistance, highlighting the potential for cavitation technology in commercial applications.</description>

      <title>Agile Free-Form Signal Filtering with a Chaotic-Cavity-Backed Non-Local Programmable Metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00054v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Filter synthesis is an inverse problem that is traditionally approached rationally by considering spatially disjoint resonators, approximating them as lumped elements, and engineering the coupling of selected pairs. This approach strongly limits the design space, making it challenging to build extremely tunable filters. Here, we demonstrate agile free-form signal filtering with an alternative purely-optimization-based design paradigm using a programmable system with many spatially overlapping modes. We back a programmable metallic metasurface with a quasi-2D chaotic cavity, inducing strong non-local interactions between all meta-elements and the connected ports. Thereby, the metasurface efficiently controls the transfer function between the ports. Our all-metallic device has unique advantages: ultra-wideband (UWB) tunability (7.5-13.5GHz), low loss, compactness, guaranteed linearity under high signal-power levels. First, we experimentally confirm theoretical predictions about reflectionless and transmissionless scattering modes; we also experimentally observe transmissionless exceptional points. Second, we impose diverse types of transfer function zeros at desired frequencies within an UWB range. Third, we achieve low-loss reflectionless programmable signal routing. Fourth, we investigate the trade-off between routing fidelity and bandwidth, achieving 20dB discrimination over 10MHz bandwidth. Fifth, we demonstrate UWB tunable multi-band filters that reject (&lt;-24dB) or pass (&gt;-1dB) signals in specified bands whose centers, widths and number are reprogrammable.</description>

      <title>3D photophoretic aircraft made from ultralight porous materials can carry kg-scale payloads in the mesosphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that photophoretic aircraft would greatly benefit from a three-dimensional (3D) hollow geometry that pumps ambient air through sidewalls to create a high-speed jet. To identify optimal geometries, we developed a theoretical expression for the lift force based on both Stokes (low-Re) and momentum (high-Re) theory and validated it using finite-element fluid-dynamics simulations. We then systematically varied geometric parameters, including Knudsen pump porosity, to minimize the operating altitude or maximize the payload. Assuming that the large vehicles can be made from previously demonstrated nanocardboard material, the minimum altitude is 55 km while the payload can reach 1 kilogram for 3D structures with 10-meter diameter at 80 km altitude. In all cases, the maximum areal density of the sidewalls cannot exceed a few grams per square meter, demonstrating the need for ultralight porous materials.</description>

Abstract: A two-terminal quantum spin-Hall heat engine and refrigerator with embedded Majorana bound states (MBS) are analyzed for optimality in thermoelectric performance. The occurrence of MBS can enhance the performance to rival, as well as outperform, some modern nanoscale quantum heat engines and quantum refrigerators. The optimal performance of this MBS quantum heat engine and quantum refrigerator can be further enhanced by an Aharonov-Bohm flux.</description>

      <title>Stochastic modeling of superconducting qudits in the dispersive regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The field of superconducting quantum computing, based on Josephson junctions, has recently seen remarkable strides in scaling the number of logical qubits. In particular, the fidelities of one- and two-qubit gates have reached the breakeven point with the novel error mitigation and correction methods. Parallel to these advances is the effort to expand the Hilbert space within a single junction or device by employing high-dimensional qubits, otherwise known as qudits. Research has demonstrated the possibility of driving higher-order transitions in a transmon or designing innovative multimode superconducting circuits, termed multimons. These advances can significantly expand the computational basis while simplifying the interconnects in a large-scale quantum processor. In this work we extend the measurement theory of a conventional superconducting qubit to that of a qudit, focusing on modeling the dispersive quadrature measurement in an open quantum system. Under the Markov assumption, the qudit Lindblad and stochastic master equations are formulated and analyzed; in addition, both the ensemble-averaged and the quantum-jump approach of decoherence analysis are detailed with analytical and numerical comparisons. We verify our stochastic model with a series of experimental results on a transmon-type qutrit, verifying the validity of our high-dimensional formalism.</description>

      <title>Shot noise-mitigated secondary electron imaging with ion count-aided microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07003v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern science is dependent on imaging on the nanoscale, often achieved through processes that detect secondary electrons created by a highly focused incident charged particle beam. Multiple types of measurement noise limit the ultimate trade-off between the image quality and the incident particle dose, which can preclude useful imaging of dose-sensitive samples. Existing methods to improve image quality do not fundamentally mitigate the noise sources. Furthermore, barriers to assigning a physically meaningful scale make the images qualitative. Here we introduce ion count-aided microscopy (ICAM), which is a quantitative imaging technique that uses statistically principled estimation of the secondary electron yield. With a readily implemented change in data collection, ICAM substantially reduces source shot noise. In helium ion microscopy, we demonstrate 3x dose reduction and a good match between these empirical results and theoretical performance predictions. ICAM facilitates imaging of fragile samples and may make imaging with heavier particles more attractive.</description>

      <title>Microstructural and Transport Characteristics of Triply Periodic Bicontinuous Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D bicontinuous two-phase materials are increasingly gaining interest because of their unique multifunctional characteristics and advancements in techniques to fabricate them. Due to their complex topological and structural properties, it still has been nontrivial to develop explicit microstructure-dependent formulas to predict accurately their physical properties. A primary goal of the present paper is to ascertain various microstructural and transport characteristics of five different models of triply periodic bicontinuous porous materials at a porosity $\phi_1=1/2$: those in which the two-phase interfaces are the Schwarz P, Schwarz D and Schoen G minimal surfaces as well as two different pore-channel structures. We ascertain their spectral densities, pore-size distribution functions, local volume-fraction variances, and hyperuniformity order metrics and then use this information to estimate certain effective transport properties via closed-form microstructure-property formulas. Specifically, we estimate the recently introduced time-dependent diffusion spreadability exactly from the spectral density. Moreover, we accurately estimate the fluid permeability of such porous materials from the second moment of the pore-size function and the formation factor, a measure of the tortuosity of the pore space. We also rigorously bound the permeability from above using the spectral density. For the five models with identical cubic unit cells, we find that the permeability, inverse of the specific surface, hyperuniformity order metric, pore-size second moment and long-time spreadability behavior are all positively correlated and rank order the structures in exactly the same way. We also conjecture what structures maximize the fluid permeability for arbitrary porosities and show that this conjecture must be true in the extreme porosity limits by identifying the corresponding optimal structures.</description>

      <title>High-power and narrow-linewidth laser on thin-film lithium niobate enabled by photonic wire bonding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) has emerged as a promising platform for the realization of high performance chip-scale optical systems, spanning a range of applications from optical communications to microwave photonics. Such applications rely on the integration of multiple components onto a single platform. However, while many of these components have already been demonstrated on the TFLN platform, to date, a major bottleneck of the platform is the existence of a tunable, high-power, and narrow-linewidth on-chip laser. Here, we address this problem using photonic wire bonding to integrate optical amplifiers with a thin-film lithium niobate feedback circuit, and demonstrate an extended cavity diode laser yielding high on-chip power of 78 mW, side mode suppression larger than 60 dB and wide wavelength tunability over 43 nm. The laser frequency stability over short timescales shows an ultra-narrow intrinsic linewidth of 550 Hz. Long-term recordings indicate a high passive stability of the photonic wire bonded laser with 58 hours of mode-hop-free operation, with a trend in the frequency drift of only 4.4 MHz/h. This work verifies photonic wire bonding as a viable integration solution for high performance on-chip lasers, opening the path to system level upscaling and Watt-level output powers.</description>

      <title>Nonvolatile reconfigurable polarization rotator at datacom wavelengths based on a Sb2Se3/Si waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Silicon photonics has become a key platform for photonic integrated circuits (PICs) due to its high refractive index and compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor manufacturing. However, the inherent birefringence in silicon waveguides requires efficient polarization management. Here, we report a reconfigurable polarization rotator (PR) using a Sb2Se3/Si waveguide operating at datacom wavelengths (1310 nm), providing nonvolatile switching with zero static power consumption. The polarization conversion relies on the interference of hybrid electric-magnetic (EH) modes, which can be reconfigured by changing the Sb2Se3 state between amorphous and crystalline. Our experimental device exhibits a polarization conversion efficiency (PCE) and a polarization extinction ratio (PER) as high as -0.08 dB and 17.65 dB, respectively, in a compact footprint of just 21$\mu$m length. Therefore, the proposed reconfigurable PR offers a compact and energy-efficient solution for polarization management in silicon photonics, with potential applications in data communication networks and emerging applications benefiting from polarization information encodings, such as optical neural networks and quantum computing.</description>
