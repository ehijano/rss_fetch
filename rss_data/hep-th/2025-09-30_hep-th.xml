      <title>Entanglement and apparent thermality in simulated black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the apparent thermality of Hawking radiation in the semi-classical limit of quantum black holes using the mean-field limit of a chiral spin-chain simulator, which models fermions propagating on a black hole space-time in the continuum. In this free-theory regime, no genuine thermalisation occurs. Nevertheless, we show that a bipartition across the event horizon yields a reduced density matrix whose mode occupations follow an apparent thermal Fermi-Dirac distribution. In contrast, partitions away from the horizon do not exhibit thermal behaviour, reflecting the absence of true equilibration. Our results demonstrate that Hawking radiation appears thermal only with respect to horizon bipartitions in free theories, while true thermal behaviour emerges only in the presence of interactions deep in the black hole interior.</description>

      <title>Making the Case for Massive Islands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been established in both high and low spacetime dimensions that existing constructions of entanglement islands, at least in the study of black holes, are all in the context of massive gravity. In fact, later studies realized that the graviton mass is not an accident and it is necessary for the consistency of the holographic interpretation for entanglement islands. An important lesson we learned from these studies is that the graviton mass is a manifestation of the deep relationship between quantum entanglement and emergent geometry (EPR=ER). Nevertheless, various interesting questions and counter-arguments exist regarding whether this connection is of any relevance, either by modifying the definition of entanglement islands or denying the graviton mass as a physically relevant concept. In this paper, we will revisit the necessity of graviton mass for the consistency of entanglement islands and address the above questions in and out of the literature. Since the calculations in higher dimensions are already well understood, we will start with a demonstration of massive islands in a frequently used lower dimensional model, AdS$_{2}$ Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity coupled with transparent conformal matter fields, for which the relationship between energy dissipation and the graviton mass manifests. We will then discuss the necessity of graviton mass for entanglement islands in general situations and clarify the physical meaning of graviton mass. In the end, we will comment on the attempts to construct entanglement islands in massless gravity and suggest the search for a new type of entanglement wedges in holography.
  The purpose of this paper is to summarize the recent progress, clarifying potential confusions and convey key messages to both experts and non-experts in the field.</description>

      <title>Rolling with modular symmetry: quintessence and de Sitter in heterotic orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modular invariance is a fundamental symmetry in string compactifications, constraining both the structure of the effective theory and the dynamics of moduli and matter fields. It has also gained renewed importance in the context of swampland conjectures and, independently, flavour physics. We investigate a modular-invariant scalar potential arising from heterotic orbifolds, where the flavour structure and moduli dynamics are jointly shaped by the underlying geometry. Focusing on a string-inspired, two-moduli truncation, we uncover a rich vacuum structure featuring anti-de Sitter minima and unstable de Sitter saddle points. We identify large regions in moduli space supporting multifield hilltop quintessence consistent with observations. All solutions satisfy refined swampland de Sitter bounds. Our results illustrate how modular symmetry can guide the construction of controlled, string-motivated quintessence scenarios within consistent effective theories.</description>

      <title>Gauging the Standard Model 1-form symmetry via gravitational instantons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the fate of the Standard Model (SM) $\mathbb Z_6^{(1)}$ electric $1$-form global symmetry in the background of gravitational instantons, focusing on Eguchi-Hanson (EH) geometries. We show that EH instantons support quantized $\mathbb Z_6^{(1)}$ fluxes localized on their $S^2$ bolt, inducing fractional topological charge without backreacting on the geometry. The requirement that quark and lepton wavefunctions be globally well-defined under parallel transport imposes boundary conditions, removing ill-defined fermion zero modes; the surviving spectrum is confirmed by an explicit solution of the Dirac equation and by the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem. The Euclidean path integral in the EH background can be interpreted as a transition amplitude from an entangled state between two identical halves of space to the vacuum. Summing over all $\mathbb{Z}_6^{(1)}$ flux sectors in the path integral gauges the SM $1$-form symmetry; thus, it cannot persist as an exact global symmetry in the semiclassical limit of gravity. We further show that these fluxes induce baryon- and lepton-number violating processes, which are exponentially suppressed due to the smallness of the hypercharge coupling constant.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Covariance of the $4d$ Nonlinear Higher-Spin Equations via BRST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a BRST extension of the higher-spin gauge theory in $AdS_4$ with the BRST operator associated with the local Lorentz symmetry. Our construction supports manifest local Lorentz covariance and is applicable both to any homotopy scheme of the perturbative analysis including the recently proposed differential homotopy and to the variety of further extended higher-spin models in $AdS_3$ and $AdS_4$ with higher differential forms and Coxeter higher-spin algebras.</description>

      <title>Causal Theories of Relativistic Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first-order textbook formulations of relativistic viscous hydrodynamics are unstable and acausal. These shortcomings may be rectified by using effective theories which maintain stability and causality. In this dissertation, which is intended to also serve as an introduction to the field, causal theories of relativistic hydrodynamics are developed and explored. Conditions are obtained for a linearized analysis to predict the non-linear causality of a theory, and constraints are found on short-wavelength dispersion relations as a consequence of ensuring stability in all reference frames. First-order causal theories of hydrodynamics are extracted from kinetic theory and holography descriptions. Finally, causal theories describing charged plasmas (one-form magnetohydrodynamics), and describing superfluids are developed.</description>

      <title>Path Integral Derivations Of K-Theoretic Donaldson Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider 5d $\mathcal{N}=1$ SU(2) super Yang-Mills theory on $X\times S^1$, with $X$ a closed smooth four-manifold. A partial topological twisting along $X$ renders the theory formally independent of the metric on $X$. The theory depends on the spin structure and the circumference $R$ of $S^1$. The coefficients of the $R$-expansion of the partition function are Witten indices, which are identified with $L^2$-indices of Dirac operators on moduli spaces of instantons. The partition function encodes BPS indices for instanton particles on a spatial manifold $X$, and these indices are special cases of K-theoretic Donaldson invariants. When the 't Hooft flux of the gauge theory is nonzero and $X$ is not spin, the 5d theory can be anomalous, but this anomaly can be canceled by coupling to a line bundle with connection for the global $U(1)$ ``instanton number symmetry''. For $b_2^+(X)&gt;0$ we can derive the partition function from integration over the Coulomb branch of the effective 4d low-energy theory. When $X$ is toric we can also use equivariant localization with respect to the $\mathbb{C}^* \times \mathbb{C}^*$ symmetry. The two methods lead to the same results for the wall-crossing formula. We also determine path integrals for four-manifolds with $b_2^+(X)&gt;1$. Our results agree with those for algebraic surfaces by G\"ottsche, Kool, Nakajima, Yoshioka, and Williams, but apply to a larger class of manifolds. When the circumference of the circle is tuned to special values, the path integral is associated with the 5d superconformal $E_1$ theory. Topological invariants in this case involve generalizations of Seiberg-Witten invariants.</description>

      <title>A proof of Generalized Connected Wedge Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of asymptotic $2$-to-$2$ scattering process in AdS/CFT, the Connected Wedge Theorem identifies the existence of $O(1/G_N)$ mutual information between suitable boundary subregions, referred to as decision regions, as a necessary but not sufficient condition for bulk-only scattering processes, i.e., nonempty bulk scattering region $S_0$. Recently, Liu and Leutheusser proposed an enlarged bulk scattering region $S_E$ and conjectured that the non-emptiness of $S_E$ fully characterizes the existence of $O(1/G_N)$ mutual information between decision regions. Here, we provide a geometrical or general relativity proof for a slightly modified version of their conjecture.</description>

      <title>All Giant Graviton Two-Point Functions at Two-Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive two-loop computation of correlation functions involving two maximal giant gravitons and two arbitrary $R$-charge single-trace half-BPS operators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang-Mills theory. By combining the partially-contracted giant graviton (PCGG) method with the $\mathcal{N}=2$ harmonic superspace formalism, we achieve significant simplifications in perturbative calculations. The resulting correlation functions encode rich CFT data, from which we derive sum rules for the OPE coefficients. These sum rules are in perfect agreement with integrability predictions. Furthermore, at the integrand level, we find a hidden higher dimensional symmetry present at both one- and two-loop orders. This symmetry was discovered recently at strong coupling, which generalizes its counterpart in correlation functions of single-trace operators.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Geometry and the Thermodynamic Fate of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of black holes in the framework of non-commutative geometry, where spacetime fuzziness is modelled by smeared Lorentzian distributions. Corrected black hole solutions with this quantum fuzziness are obtained, and their thermodynamic analysis is performed. We show that the conventional first law of black hole thermodynamics is violated since the entropy deviates from the Bekenstein-Hawking form. Introducing a correction to the mass restores consistency, yielding a modified first law compatible with Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. Next, we investigate the effects of spacetime non-commutativity on the thermodynamic universality of these black holes. We demonstrate that non-commutativity modifies the standard universality relations of black holes and can induce thermodynamic stability by altering the underlying microscopic interactions. Our results suggest that quantum features of spacetime can have significant macroscopic consequences for black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Entropy and Complexity Growth in Horndeski Gravity within the AdS/BCFT Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the connection between quantum complexity and gravitational dynamics within the framework of Horndeski gravity, extending the AdS/BCFT correspondence to include scalar-tensor interactions. By refining the ``\(complexity = action\)'' conjecture we investigate how Horndeski gravity modifies the Wheeler-DeWitt patch and the causal structure of the black hole. Our analysis reveals that the linear growth of complexity, proportional to the product of black hole entropy and temperature, remains valid across various black hole configurations, including those of rotating and charged black holes. Moreover we study the impact of shock waves on the growth of complexity, which shows the appearance of the ``switchback effect''. These results show the universality of the complexity = action conjecture and its validity in modified gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Emergence of General Relativity from Cosmological Constant Via Ghost Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that starting with a cosmological constant in a curved space-time, the Einstein-Hilbert term of general relativity is generated through a ghost condensation. We fix Weyl symmetry, or equivalently local scale symmetry by a gauge condition $R = 0$ \`{a} la BRST formalism, and see that the condensation of the Faddeev-Popov ghosts, $\langle \bar c c \rangle \neq 0$ leads to a generation of the Einstein-Hilbert action of general relativity. This dynamical mechanism of symmetry breakdown for a global scale symmetry is new in the sense that the reduction of fermionic degrees of freedom effectively leads to a generation of bosonic degrees of freedom. We also discuss this mechanism from the viewpoint of the problem of a bound state, and show that asymptotic fields corresponding to the bound states are ``confined'' to the unphysical Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Landau problem in graphene: a gauge-invariant analysis with the Seiberg-Witten map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relativistic quantum dynamics of amassless electron in graphene in a two-dimensional noncommutative (NC) plane under a constant background magnetic field. To address the issue of gauge invariance, we employ an effective massless NC Dirac field theory, incorporating the Seiberg-Witten (SW) map alongside the Moyal star product. Using this framework, we derive a manifestly gauge-invariant Hamiltonian for a massless Dirac particle, which serves as the basis for studying the relativistic Landau problem in graphene in NC space. Specifically, we analyze the motion of a relativistic electron in monolayer graphene within this background field and compute the energy spectrum of the NC Landau system. The NC-modified energy levels are then used to explore the system's thermodynamic response. Notably, in the low-temperature limit, spatial noncommutativity leads to a spontaneous magnetization-a distinct signature of NC geometry in relativistic condensed matter systems like graphene.</description>

      <title>Predictions with limited data: Bayesian (X)PINNs, entanglement surfaces and overconfidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving differential equations from limited or noisy data remains a key challenge for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), which are typically applied to already known and smooth solutions. In this work, we explore Bayesian PINNs and extended PINNs, (B-(X)PINNs), to solve non-linear second order differential equation typical for high energy theory, where data is only available from the boundary domain, to benchmark suitable approaches to PINNs in this category. In particular, we consider an entangling surface; a differential equation typical in holography. We perform asymptotic analysis to generate analytical training data from the boundary domain. We also explore the meaning of overconfidence in models that are constrained by physical priors and argue that standard overconfidence metrics are not suitable to consider when dealing with B-PINNs. Overconfidence can be a natural feature and not a bug in systems with soft or hard constraints on the loss function; one have to look at when the overconfidence is an artifact of the model adhering to the physics constraints. To diagnose this effect, we introduce an information density quantity, and a local physics-constraint coupling (PCC) metric, to capture locally to what extent the enforced physics collapses the posterior distribution. We also consider these quantities for a Liouville-type equation and the Van der Pol equation to probe apparent overconfidence further.</description>

      <title>Integral Identities from Symmetry Breaking of Conformal Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conformal field theory, the insertion of a defect breaks part of the global symmetry and gives rise to defect operators such as the tilts and displacements. We establish identities relating the integrated four-point functions of such operators to their two-point functions, derived both from the geometric properties of the defect conformal manifold, which is the symmetry-breaking coset, and from the Lie algebra of the corresponding broken symmetry generators. As an explicit example, we demonstrate these integral identities in the case of the 1/2 BPS Maldacena-Wilson loop in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM. This contribution serves as a brief review of the main ideas of Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 201603 (2022), as well as a short preview of our forthcoming paper with Nadav Drukker and Petr Kravchuk. Here we present an independent derivation of the integral identities that will not appear in that work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first rigorous one-loop demonstration that the Lorentz-covariant M2-brane matrix model with Restricted Volume-Preserving Deformations (RVPD) preserves the quantum stability of its BPS membranes. By exploiting the closure of the restricted kappa-symmetry with RVPD, the BRST complex terminates without higher ghosts and the gauge-fixed measure remains under analytic control.
  Performing the one-loop expansion around BPS backgrounds, we match bosonic and fermionic spectra, prove that the RVPD ghost determinant is benign, and evaluate the determinants through zeta regularization. The resulting Main Theorem establishes that the 2D, 4D, 6D, and 8D noncommutative membranes stay stable, whereas the 10D configuration inevitably develops a tachyonic mode. Our analysis unifies the treatment of zero modes, connects the effective action to central charges, and clarifies the relationship with BFSS, BLG/ABJM, and prospective M5-brane matrix models, providing a roadmap for extending RVPD-based formulations.</description>

      <title>Integrable Spherical Brane Model at Large $N$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study one of the simplest integrable two-dimensional quantum field theories with a boundary: $N$ free non-compact scalars in the bulk, constrained non-linearly on the boundary to lie on an $(N-1)$-sphere of radius $1/\sqrt{g}$. The $N=1$ case reduces to the single-channel Kondo problem, while larger $N$ is analogous to multi-channel or higher-spin impurity scenarios. Adding a boundary magnetic field -- a linear boundary coupling to the scalars -- enriches the model's structure while preserving integrability. Lukyanov and Zamolodchikov (2004) conjectured an expansion for the boundary free energy on the infinite half-cylinder in powers of the magnetic field. Using large-$N$ saddle-point techniques, we confirm their conjecture to next-to-leading order in $1/N$. Renormalization of the subleading solution turns out to be highly instructive, and we connect it to the RG running of $g$ studied by Giombi and Khanchandani (2020).</description>

      <title>One-loop analytic structure of the deep-infrared Landau-gauge gluon propagator at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the aim of looking for signatures of deconfinement, the poles and the spectral function of the Landau-gauge gluon propagator are investigated at one loop, vanishing spatial momentum and finite temperature within the framework of the screened massive expansion of pure Yang-Mills theory and of full QCD. When computed using both temperature-independent parameters optimized by principles of gauge invariance and temperature-dependent parameters obtained by fitting lattice data at zero Matsubara frequency, the propagator is found to have a pair of complex-conjugate poles in its squared complexified frequency variable throughout the considered temperature interval, ranging from $T=0$ to temperatures $T&gt;T_{c}$ of interest to quark-gluon plasma phenomenology. The spectral function is found to violate positivity and not to develop sharp peaks over said temperature interval. In full QCD, a simple model is used for mass generation in the infrared quark sector; the dependence of our results on the quark masses is discussed.</description>

      <title>Factorizations of 3d Interval Partition Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that interval partition functions (transition amplitudes) of three-dimensional $N = 2$ theories admit factorizations into sums of products of hemisphere partition functions with additional normalization factors. We prove the factorization explicitly for supersymmetric quantum electrodynamics and Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theories. In the former case, we interpret the factorization geometrically in terms of the factorization of equivariant K-theory classes. In the latter case, we prove that hemisphere partition functions are affine characters and determine the normalization factors explicitly in special cases.</description>

      <title>Residual Symmetries and Algebraic Structures in the Kerr-Schild Double Copy I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24112v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kerr-Schild double copy is celebrated for producing exact gravitational spacetimes from gauge fields, yet the preservation of symmetry content gone largely unexplored. We investigate the fate of residual symmetries in the Kerr-Schild double copy, focusing on the Schwarzschild solution. On the gauge theory side, we derive the residual transformations that preserve the Abelian and non-Abelian Kerr-Schild ansatz\"e, finding they both form an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra parameterized by arbitrary null functions. On the gravity side, we analyze the resulting residual diffeomorphisms of the Kerr-Schild Schwarzschild metric. Restricting our focus to the Killing vector class of solutions, we find that the only surviving diffeomorphisms are the finite-dimensional global isometries of Schwarzschild, reducing the residual gauge algebra to the Poincar\'e subalgebra containing exclusively time translations and spatial rotations. This finding confirms a fundamental structural mismatch: the infinite-dimensional algebra of the gauge side admits no analogous structure in this gravitational sector. We formalize this by showing that the BRST operator for the residual symmetry is trivialized under the Killing condition, establishing the consistency of this algebraic reduction within a quantum field theoretic framework. This paper is the first of a two-part series. In Part II, we complete this analysis by examining the more complex proper conformal Killing vector class of solutions and formulating a unified BRST framework.</description>

      <title>Lifshitz transition in a holographic finite density flavour brane Weyl semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24287v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend a top-down holographic model of a Weyl semimetal to finite charge density and compute the fermionic spectral function by introducing two probe fermions of opposite chirality. The model is controlled by the boundary fermion mass M and the chemical potential $\mu$. In the zero density, small-M limit, we recover four energy bands, two Weyl points, and linear dispersion in their vicinity, the hallmarks of a Weyl semimetal. As M increases, the bands between the Weyl points become progressively compressed and the spectral weight associated with those bands is smeared out. At finite charge density, we map the Fermi surface in momentum space and identify a Lifshitz transition: two distinct Fermi pockets, each enclosing a different Weyl point, merge into a single large Fermi surface that encloses both. This transition can be induced by either control parameter. Varying M alters the band structure and thus the band shape, which drives the Lifshitz transition, whereas changing $\mu$ shifts the bands relative to the Fermi level without qualitatively changing the band structure, producing the Lifshitz transition by moving the band positions.</description>

      <title>Shadow Ringing of Black Holes from Photon Sphere Quasinormal Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent convergence of gravitational-wave (GW) observations and black hole imaging provides complementary probes of strong-gravity dynamics. While the black hole shadow is typically modeled as a static feature, a dynamically perturbed spacetime in its ringdown phase must induce temporal modulations in the shadow's apparent size and shape. We develop a theoretical framework within linear perturbation theory to investigate this shadow ringing effect for a Schwarzschild black hole. By modeling the geometry as a small, mode-selected quasinormal mode (QNM) perturbation, we treat the shadow boundary as an instantaneous separatrix of null geodesics. We derive a first-order, gauge-invariant mapping between the metric perturbation $h_{\mu\nu}$ and the displacement of the shadow boundary, $\delta R(\varphi,t)$. By perturbing the effective potential for null geodesics near the unstable photon sphere ($r=3M$), we derive mode-resolved transfer coefficients that quantify how the QNM imprints itself onto the shadow. We predict that the shadow boundary oscillates coherently at the QNM's real frequency $\omega_{\rm Re}$ with an exponential damping rate set by $|\omega_{\rm Im}|$. Furthermore, the azimuthal structure of the modulation encodes the spherical harmonic content $(\ell,m)$ of the driving QNM, providing a novel, geometric signature for QNM spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Singularities, Color Confinement, and the Quantum Dirac Sheaf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A singularity $\mathbb{C}^{2r}/G$, with $G$ a split symplectic reflection group, may or may not be crepant. Then the total space $\mathscr{X}$ of the Donagi-Witten integrable system is crepant for some 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT and non-crepant for others. Which physical mechanism controls the (dis)crepancy? Surprisingly, it is the detailed physics of color confinement (and its generalizations for non-Lagrangian QFT). A 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT carries a Frobenius algebra $\mathcal{R}$, the quantum cohomology ring of $\mathscr{X}$ (defined via mirror symmetry), and $\mathscr{X}$ is crepant iff its central Witten index $\dim\mathcal{R}$ is equal to its Euler number $\chi(\mathscr{X})$. When the SCFT has a Lagrangian, $\mathcal{R}$ is fixed by compatibility with confinement, and physics may require a discrepancy to be present. The quantum cohomology depends on quantum-geometric data, and a classical Seiberg-Witten geometry may have several inequivalent $\mathcal{R}$: a relevant quantum datum is the Dirac sheaf $\mathscr{L}$ which refines Dirac charge quantization. We get several other results of independent interest, and we fully classify all special geometries of $\bigstar$-type in rank $r&gt;6$.</description>

      <title>T-duality and bosonization as examples of continuum gauging and disentangling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dualities and duality transformations form a well established methodology in various aspects of quantum many body physics and quantum field theories, allowing one to exploit equivalence between models which may naively seem completely different in order to gain access to further physical regimes, either analytically, numerically or experimentally. Recently, in the context of condensed matter physics and quantum information, it was shown that dualities can be understood very well through a gauging and disentangling procedure that can be represented by a finite depth quantum circuit. In this letter we expand these concepts to the continuum, suggesting them as a way to derive duality transformations in continuum field theories and particle physics, and benchmark the presented ideas through the re-derivation of T-duality and bosonization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: String theory relies on spacetime supersymmetry to guarantee the existence of stable vacua. In this review, we survey two features of non-supersymmetric strings that challenge both aspects: the appearance of tachyons and worldsheet tadpoles. We describe how tachyons arise, how to characterise their presence in closed strings and in their orientifold projections, and how off-shell approaches can be used to tackle them. We then turn to tachyon-free, non-supersymmetric strings. After introducing the simplest ten-dimensional models, we address the additional issues raised by tadpoles and the spacetime consequences of their cancellation. Finally, we discuss recent attempts to explore the non-supersymmetric string landscape.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Covariant Quantum Spacetime with Fuzzy Extra Dimensions in the IKKT model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider general $k=-1$ FLRW covariant quantum spacetimes $\mathcal{M}^{3,1} \times \mathcal{K}$ with fuzzy extra dimensions $\mathcal{K}$ as classical solutions of the IKKT matrix model. The coupled equations of motion are recast in terms of conservation laws, which allow to determine the evolution of spacetime in a transparent way. We show that $\mathcal{K}$ is stabilized as a classical solution in the presence of a large $R$ charge, corresponding to internal angular momentum. This provides a mechanism to maintain a large hierarchy between UV and IR scales. We also argue that the evolution of spacetime is determined by a balance between classical and quantum effects, leading to a cosmic scale factor $a(t) \sim t$ and constant dilaton at late times. On such a background, the undeformed IKKT model leads to a higher-spin gauge theory including gravity.</description>

      <title>Loop-Level Double Copy Relations from Forward Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study double copy relations for loop integrands in gauge theories and gravity based on their constructions from single cuts, which are in turn obtained from forward limits of lower-loop cases. While such a construction from forward limits has been realized for loop integrands in gauge theories, we demonstrate its extension to gravity by reconstructing one-loop gravity integrands from forward limits of trees. Under mild symmetry assumptions on tree-level kinematic numerators (and their forward limits), our method directly leads to double copy relations for one-loop integrands: these include the field-theoretic Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) relations, whose kernel is the inverse of a matrix with rank $(n{-}1)!$ formed by those in bi-adjoint $\phi^3$ theory, and the Bern-Carrasco-Johansson (BCJ) double copy relations with crossing-symmetric kinematic numerators (we provide local and crossing-symmetric Yang-Mills BCJ numerators for $n=3,4,5$ explicitly). By exploiting the "universal expansion" for one-loop integrands in generic gauge theories, we also obtain an analogous expansion for gravity (including supergravity theories).</description>

      <title>Complexity of Einstein-Maxwell-non-minimal coupling $R^2F^2$: the role of the penalty factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the holographic complexity of a theory of Einstein-Maxwell with a non-minimal coupling $R^2 F_{\mu \nu }F^{\mu \nu} $ term via complexity=anything. We introduce a perturbative black brane solution in AdS spacetime up to the first order of the non-minimal coupling. Because the model exhibits the resistivity proportional to the temperature, it could describe strange metals. The complexity of the solution could be characterized by three quantities: the conserved charge, the non-minimal coupling and the generalized term in the complexity. The generalized term is chosen to be $C^2$, the Weyl squared tensor, $R^2F^2$ and $F^2$. The physical interpretation of the three quantities has been provided where the generalized term is interpreted as a bulk penalty factor, the non-minimal coupling and the conserved charge as an effective scrambling time of the dual theory which contains the choice of the generalization parameter.</description>

      <title>Toward the Analytic Bootstrap of Energy Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for the analytic bootstrap of three-point energy correlators, a crucial observable in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory and quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Our approach combines spherical contour techniques, general physical constraints such as pole cancellations, and power correction data in the singular limits to determine its analytic expression. In contrast to previous bootstrap studies restricted to scattering amplitudes for supersymmetric theories, our framework makes use of the properties of Feynman integrals, marking a significant step toward bootstrapping realistic QCD observables. Using this method, we derive analytic expressions for leading-order three-point energy correlators with equal and unequal energy weights, where the latter are crucial ingredients for projected $N$-point energy correlators. We also apply the recently developed technique of analytic regression with lattice reduction as a way to bypass needing explicit expressions for the singular limits. Bridging theoretical advances in scattering amplitudes with the renewed interest in weighted cross-sections, our work opens the door to precision tests of QCD dynamics through analytic event-shape predictions.</description>

      <title>Quantum Yang-Mills Charges in Strongly Coupled 2D Lattice QCD with Three Flavors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum properties of the truly gauge-invariant and conserved charges of two-dimensional Yang-Mills theories, focusing on lattice QCD in the strong coupling regime. The construction of those charges uses the integral version of the (1+1)-dimensional Yang-Mills equations, and they correspond to the eigenvalues of a charge operator. The gauge invariance of the charges suggests that they are not confined, hence hadronic states may carry them. Using the Feynman-Kac formalism, we evaluate the correlation functions of those charges on baryon and meson states through functional integrals over the gauge group SU(N) (N=2,3) and Grassmannian variables - the fermionic fields. Our results show that the expectation values of the lowest non-trivial charges are nonzero for baryon and meson states but vanish for non-gauge-invariant states, supporting the interpretation that hadrons indeed carry these charges. While renormalization effects and higher-order contributions remain to be analyzed, these findings point toward a potential link between gauge-invariant charges and confinement.</description>

      <title>Learning with errors may remain hard against quantum holographic attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Learning with Errors (LWE) problem underlies modern lattice-based cryptography and is assumed to be quantum hard. Recent results show that estimating entanglement entropy is as hard as LWE, creating tension with quantum gravity and AdS/CFT, where entropies are computed by extremal surface areas. This suggests a paradoxical route to solving LWE by building holographic duals and measuring extremal surfaces, seemingly an easy task. Three possible resolutions arise: that AdS/CFT duality is intractable, that the quantum-extended Church-Turing thesis (QECTT) fails, or that LWE is easier than believed. We develop and analyze a fourth resolution: that estimating surface areas with the precision required for entropy is itself computationally hard. We construct two holographic quantum algorithms to formalize this. For entropy differences of order N, we show that measuring Ryu-Takayanagi geodesic lengths via heavy-field two-point functions needs exponentially many measurements in N, even when the boundary state is efficiently preparable. For order one corrections, we show that reconstructing the bulk covariance matrix and extracting entropy requires exponential time in N. Although these tasks are computationally intractable, we compare their efficiency with the Block Korkine-Zolotarev lattice reduction algorithm for LWE. Our results reconcile the tension with QECTT, showing that holographic entropy remains consistent with quantum computational limits without requiring an intractable holographic dictionary, and provide new insights into the quantum cryptanalysis of lattice-based cryptography.</description>

      <title>Vector Horndeski black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On a spherically symmetric and static background, we study the existence of linearly stable black hole (BH) solutions in nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) with a Horndeski vector-tensor (HVT) coupling, with and without curvature singularities at the center ($r=0$). Incorporating the electric charge $q_E$ and the magnetic charge $q_M$, we first show that nonsingular BHs can exist only if $q_M = 0$. We then study the stability of purely electric BHs by analyzing the behavior of perturbations in the metric and the vector field. Nonsingular electric BHs are unstable due to a Laplacian instability in the vector perturbation near the regular center. In the absence of the HVT coupling ($\beta=0$), singular BHs in power-law NED theories can be consistent with all linear stability conditions, while Born-Infeld BHs encounter strong coupling due to a vanishing propagation speed as $r \to 0$. In power-law NED and Born-Infeld theories with $\beta \neq 0$, the electric fields for singular BHs are regular near $r=0$, while the metric functions behave as $\propto r^{-1}$. Nevertheless, we show that Laplacian instabilities occur for regions inside the outer horizon $r_h$, unless the HVT coupling constant $\beta$ is significantly smaller than $r_h^2$. For $\beta \neq 0$, we also reconstruct the NED Lagrangian so that one of the metric functions takes the Reissner-Nordstr\"om form. In this case, there exists a branch where all squared propagation speeds are positive, but the ghost and strong coupling problems are present around the BH center. Thus, the dominance of the HVT coupling generally leads to BH instability in the high-curvature regime.</description>

      <title>Complete Classification of Domain Wall Solutions in the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a complete classification of domain wall solutions in the two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) with a global $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, categorised as superconducting, CP-violating, or neither, depending on the scalar particle masses and the ratio of the two Higgs doublets' vacuum expectation values. We demonstrate that any domain wall solution can be reduced to depend on only six of the eight general field components, with further field reductions possible within different regions of the parameter space. Furthermore, we show that the superconducting solutions can be used to construct stable, current-carrying domain walls in two spatial dimensions. Similarly, the CP-violating solutions allow for two-dimensional configurations where CP symmetry is locally broken on the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric wall, which could provide an out-of-equilibrium environment for CP-violating processes to occur.</description>

      <title>Null integrability and photon phenomenology in the accelerated Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study we analyse null geodesics in an accelerated Schwarzschild black hole sustained by a cosmic string/strut (C-metric) in the sub-extremal regime. Using dimensionless variables and a Mino-type parameter we cast the equations into a complete first order form. For photons the conformal Hamilton-Jacobi equation separates and the radial and polar motion reduce to Bierman-Weierstrass form, yielding new closed analytic solutions. This provides a clean classification of photon trajectories, identifies a fixed photon cone that replaces equatorial symmetry when the acceleration is nonzero, and locates a single spherical photon surface shared by all latitudes. On the observational side, we prove that the shadow seen by any static observer is an exact circle: its screen radius depends on the acceleration and observer location but not on the conicity, so the local shadow cannot bound the string tension. We provide compact expressions for the photon ring orbital frequency and Lyapunov exponent and use them to obtain eikonal quasinormal estimates; we also show how a single shadow measurement at known position uniquely infers the dimensionless acceleration. As diagnostics of the background, we compute the (generally unequal) surface gravities of the black hole and acceleration horizons and derive an exact redshift law between static worldlines.</description>

Abstract: We present an infinite set of non-local integrals of motion for the deformed $W$-algebra $W_{q,t}(g)$ associated with the affine Lie algebras $g=A_l^{(1)}, D_l^{(1)}$ and $E_{6,7,8}^{(1)}$.They can be regarded as a two-parameter deformation of trace of the monodromy matrix of the $g$-KdV theory. Commutativity of the non-local integrals of motion is shown in the case of $g=A_l^{(1)}$ and $D_l^{(1)}$ by a direct calculation. In the case of $g=E_{6,7,8}^{(1)}$ it is a conjecture.</description>

      <title>Quantum Resonance Beyond Direct Measurement: Insights from Weak Measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aharonov's weak value amplification realized via weak measurement provides a versatile means to measure physical parameters with high accuracy, similar to quantum resonance epitomized by the Rabi and Ramsey resonances. The similarity between the two is not accidental: in fact, these two methods of precision measurement have recently been shown to be interconnected for the particular case of direct weak measurement. Here we show that this connection also holds in the case of indirect weak measurement, which is the standard scheme used mostly for studies of weak value amplification. We present a unified framework of weak measurements in which direct measurement appears as a special case of indirect measurement. This allows us to compare the measurement precision of different methods on a common basis, as demonstrated explicitly for the Rabi and Ramsey resonances, showing how the precision of the latter surpasses that of the former in the context of weak value amplification.</description>

      <title>A non-inflationary solution to the monopole problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles are a long-standing prediction of Grand Unified Theories, yet their efficient production in early universe phase transitions would lead to a monopole abundance that far exceeds observational limits. The standard solution of the problem invokes inflation occurring after monopole production, diluting their density to undetectable levels and eliminating any possibility of present-day observation. Here, we propose an alternative solution based on the breaking, in the early universe prior to Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, of the Weyl conformal symmetry of the gauge kinetic sector of the Lagrangian. This mechanism enhances monopole annihilation, thereby reducing their abundance to acceptable levels without requiring inflation. This scenario also predicts a residual flux of GUT monopoles potentially within the sensitivity of current and upcoming cosmic ray detectors, making their discovery possible in the near future.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.23845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a covariantly stable first-order framework for describing charge and heat transport in isotropic rigid solids embedded in curved spacetime. Working in the Lorenz gauge, we show that the associated initial value problem is both causal and locally well-posed in the fully nonlinear regime. We then apply such framework to explore a range of gravitothermoelectric effects in metals undergoing relativistic acceleration. These include (1) the separation of charge through acceleration, (2) the non-uniformity of Joule heating across accelerating circuits due to time dilation, and (3) the effect of redshift on magnetic diffusion. As an astrophysical application, we derive a relativistic Thomas-Fermi equation governing the charge distribution inside a compact object, also accounting for Seebeck charge displacements driven by cooling.</description>

Abstract: We investigate cosmological solutions for the modified gravity theory obtained from quantum relative entropy between the metric of spacetime and the metric induced by the geometry and matter fields. The vacuum equations admit inflationary solutions, hinting at an entropic origin for inflation. Equations also admit a regime of phantom like behavior. Assuming that the relation between slow roll parameters and CMB observables holds for entropic gravity, the theory predicts a viable spectrum.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group corrections to $\Lambda$CDM model and observational consequences for $H_0$ tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the renormalization group-based extension of the $\Lambda$CDM model as a potential solution to the current cosmological tensions. In this approach, both the cosmological constant density and Newton's constant are allowed to vary with the energy scale, as a consequence of the remnant effects of massive quantum fields in the low-energy regime. The corresponding cosmological model is consistent with the principles of quantum field theory, based on the covariance of the vacuum effective action, and is characterized by an unique extra parameter $\nu$. Our analysis yields a best-fit value of $\nu = - (2.5 \pm 1.3)\times 10^{-4}$, placing the $\Lambda$CDM limit at the $2\sigma$ region of the $\nu$ posterior. This narrow range is consistent with data from CMB (Planck), BAO (DESI), and SN Ia (DES Y5). Our result also alleviates the $H_0$ tension and is consistent with the previously established constraints from large-scale structure. In this kind of models there is a link between cosmology and particle physics. Our results point to possibility of a new physics, characterized by a mass spectrum lying below the Planck scale but above the values typically associated with Grand Unified Theories (GUTs).</description>

      <title>Interaction of exact gravitational waves with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider interactions of exact (i.e., solutions of full nonlinear field equations) gravitational waves with matter by using the Einstein-Boltzmann equation. For a gravitational wave interacting with a system of massless particles, we compute the perturbed energy-momentum tensor and obtain explicit form of a set of Einstein-Boltzmann equations. We find solution to this system of equations to obtain the gravitational wave profile. The interaction superposes a static term on the gravitational wave profile which depends on the difference between square of the temperatures of the system in the absence and in the presence of the wave. We compute this perturbed term when the states of the system obey Bose-Einstein, Fermi-Dirac, and Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions, respectively. The relative strength of this term is roughly half for the Fermi-Dirac, and one-third for the Maxwell-Boltzmann distributions compared with that of the Bose-Einstein distribution. We consider both Minkowski and flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker backgrounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that a linear electromagnetic matter source can be constructed for regular black hole solutions, illustrated by the case of the Bardeen black hole. Our method relies on coupling a scalar field and its potential to General Relativity (GR) alongside electrodynamics. Both fields are minimally coupled to GR but interact with each other. We validate this approach by interpreting the Bardeen solution either as a purely magnetic or as a purely electric configuration for a spherically symmetric metric with an arbitrary electrodynamics Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}(F)$ and a coupling function $W(\varphi)$. By choosing an appropriate form of $W$, the electromagnetic Lagrangian can be rendered linear. We then analyze the behavior of the coupling function and the scalar field potential, emphasizing their relation to the magnetic or electric charge. Finally, we compare the advantages and disadvantages of this framework with the conventional formalism, in which regular charged black holes are supported solely by nonlinear electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Black bounce solutions via nonminimal scalar-electrodynamic couplings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black-bounce (BB) solutions generalize the spacetimes of black holes, regular black holes, and wormholes, depending on the values of certain characteristic parameters. In this work, we investigate such solutions within the framework of General Relativity (GR), assuming spherical symmetry and static geometry. It is well established in the literature that, in order to sustain such geometries, the source of Einstein's equations in the BB context can be composed of a scalar field $\varphi$ and a nonlinear electrodynamics (NLED). In our model, in addition to the Lagrangian associated with the scalar field in the action, we also include an interaction term of the form $W(\varphi)\mathcal{L}(F)$, which introduces a nonminimal coupling between the scalar field and the electromagnetic sector. Notably, the usual minimal coupling configuration is recovered by setting $W(\varphi)=1$. In contrast to approaches where the function $W(\varphi)$ is assumed a priori, here we determine its functional form by modeling the radial dependence of the derivative of the electromagnetic Lagrangian as a power law, namely $\mathcal{L}_F(r) \sim F^n$. This approach enables us to determine $W(r)$ directly from the obtained solutions. We apply this procedure to two specific geometries: the Simpson-Visser-type BB solution and the Bardeen-type BB solution, both analyzed in the purely magnetic ($q_m \neq 0$, $q_e=0$) and purely electric ($q_m=0$, $q_e \neq 0$) cases. In all scenarios, we find that these BB spacetime solutions can be described with a linear electrodynamics, which is a noteworthy result. Furthermore, we examine the regularity of the spacetime through the Kretschmann scalar and briefly discuss the associated energy conditions for the solutions obtained.</description>

      <title>Scalarizations of qOS-extremal black hole and Aretakis instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study scalarization of quantum Oppenheimer-Snyder (qOS)-extremal black hole in the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-scalar theory.
  This black hole is described by mass ($M=4\sqrt{\alpha}/3\sqrt{3}$) with $\alpha$ quantum parameter. From studying onset of scalarization, we find the appearance of the single branch of scalarized qOS-extremal black holes. To obtain the tachyonic scalar cloud being a seed to generate the single branch of scalarized qOS-extremal black holes, we consider the near-horizon geometry of the Bertotti-Bobinson (BR) spacetime. In this case, we find that the appearance of a large scalar cloud at the horizon ($\rho=0$) is a new feature to represent onset scalarization of extremal black holes for tachyon with negative mass, but it is not related to the Aretakis instability of a propagating scalar with standard mass around the BR spacetime, showing polynomial instability of the ingoing time $v$. The Aretakis instability is connected to the scalar cloud with standard mass, indicating the blow-up at the horizon.</description>

Abstract: We consider an infrared truncated massive minimally coupled scalar field with an asymmetric self-interaction $\frac{m^2}{2}\varphi^2\!+\!\frac{\lambda\varphi^4}{4!}\!+\!\frac{\beta\varphi^3}{3!}(\lambda\!&gt;\!0)$ during a cosmological constant driven de Sitter inflation with a constant expansion rate, $H$. The Fokker-Planck equation for the evolution of the massive scalar field is obtained and solved for this asymmetric potential. Firstly we compute the vacuum expectation values of $\varphi$ and $\varphi^2$ using the normalized late-time probability distribution $\rho(\varphi,t)$. Secondly, we evaluate the two-point correlation function and the vacuum expectation value of the massive scalar field at tree and one-loop order following Starobinsky's approach and applying the techniques of perturbative quantum field theory. Lastly, we compare the results obtained via these two different methods. Although these results give consistent qualitative behavior at tree and one-loop order, they differ numerically.</description>

      <title>Phase spaces in field theory: Reduction vs. resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we review the concept of phase space in classical field theory, discussing several variations on the basic notion, as well as the relation between them. In particular we will focus on the case where the field theory admits local (gauge) symmetry, in which case the physical phase space of the system emerges after a (usually singular) quotient with respect to the action of the symmetry group. We will highlight the symplectic and Poisson underpinnings of the reduction procedure that defines a phase space, and discuss how one can replace quotients with graded smooth objects within classical field theory via cohomological resolutions, a practice that goes under the name of Batalin--Vilkovisky formalism. Special attention is placed on the reduction and resolution of gauge theories on manifolds with corners, which famously depend on a number of arbitrary choices. We phrase these choices in terms of homotopies for the variational bicomplex, and define a homotopy version of Noether's current and conservation theorem.</description>

      <title>A Five-dimensional Kaluza-Klein Approach to Unimodular Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we present a possibility of imposing the unimodular condition within the 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein theory including the scalar field. Unimodular gravity became an object of increasing interest in the late 80-ties; and was recently used in primordial Universe modeling with cosmological constant, in the context of the Brans-Dicke gravity including scalar field. A generalization of the unimodularity principle to the 5-dimensional Kaluza-Klein model was discussed in our recent paper, in which variational principle is formulated in 5 dimensions first, and dimensional reduction is applied to the resulting set of equations. A cosmological model based on these equations was then presented and discussed. Here we present further developments of this approach, focussing our attention at perturbative aspects and stability of solutions.</description>

      <title>Information Loss and Cost in Symmetry Breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an algebraic and information-theoretic framework to characterize symmetry breaking of generalized, non-invertible symmetries in two spatial dimensions. The reduction of symmetry is modeled within subfactor theory, where condensable Frobenius algebras play the role of subgroups in the categorical setting. This perspective naturally connects to the description of anyon condensation in topological phases of matter. Central to our approach are coarse-graining maps, or conditional expectations, which act as quantum channels projecting observables from a phase with higher symmetry onto one where the symmetry is partially or completely broken by condensation. By employing relative entropy as an entropic order parameter, we quantify the information loss induced by condensation and establish a universal bound governed by the Jones index, equal to the quantum dimension of the condensate. We illustrate the framework through explicit examples, including the toric code, abelian groups $\mathbb{Z}_N$, and the representation category Rep($S_3$), and show how dualities give rise to equivalence classes of condensation patterns. Our results forge new connections between operator algebras, tensor category theory, and quantum information in the study of generalized symmetries.</description>

      <title>The generalized second law for fermionic and bosonic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the validity of the generalied second law for Kerr black holes perturbed by fermionic and bosonic fields. We derive that the critical frequency for a test field below which the area of a Kerr black hole would decrease, coincides with the superradiance limit which pertains to bosonic fields. The fact that the absorption of fermionic fields with arbitrarily low frequencies is allowed, leads to a generic violation of the generalized second law as both the black hole and the environment lose entropy. The result does not contradict the proof of the area theorem which pre-assumes the validity of the null energy condition. We also construct a thought experiment involving bosonic fields to check whether the minimum increase in the area can compensate for the decrease in the entropy of the environment. We minimize the entropy increase by considering a black hole at the extremal limit, perturbed by a bosonic field at the superradiance limit. We show that the generalized second law remains valid for bosonic fields that satisfy the null energy condition. The result does not require the employment of entropy bounds when one assigns von Neumann entropy to test fields.</description>

      <title>Discrete flat disks: rigid quadrangulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by a question of Ferrari in the physics context of JT gravity, we introduce and enumerate a combinatorial family of quadrangulations of the disk, called rigid quadrangulations. These form a subclass of the flat quadrangulations in the sense that every inner vertex has degree 4, and therefore it can be viewed as a discrete model of flat metrics on the disk. Our main result is a bijection between rigid quadrangulations and certain colorful integer-labeled quadrangulations of the sphere, together with a dictionary relating a variety of natural statistics on both sides. Adaptions of the bijection to various boundary conditions allow us to import recent enumerative results for colorful quadrangulation obtained by Bousquet-M\'elou and Elvey Price. We discuss some consequences of the enumeration of rigid quadrangulations for a flat version of JT gravity at finite cutoff, and comment on potential scaling limits.</description>

      <title>A tree bijection for rigid quadrangulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the counting problem of rigid quadrangulations, recently introduced by Budd and proven to be in bijection with colorful quadrangulations. The generating function for the latter has been derived in an algebraic manner by Bousquet-M\'elou and Elvey Price, which therefore also counts rigid quadrangulations. In this paper we will provide a direct, bijective proof, for this generating function. We will relate the rigid quadrangulations to some naturally appearing trees, decorated with certain natural data. By some slight bijective manipulation of the data, we get a decorated tree, for which the generating function can be found. This result opens the door to better understand the geometry of random rigid quadrangulations (and maybe even of random colorful quadrangulations), by studying the corresponding decorated trees. These properties are relevant the formulation of UV complete JT-gravity, following the work of Ferrari.</description>

      <title>High Reheating Temperature without Axion Domain Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a cosmological scenario in which the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry remains broken in the entire history of the Universe, thereby avoiding the formation of axion strings and domain walls. Contrary to the conventional expectation, it is demonstrated that appropriately chosen scalar interactions are able to keep the PQ symmetry broken at arbitrarily high temperatures. We carefully examine the finite-temperature effective potential in a model with two PQ breaking scalar fields. The existence of flat directions plays a vital role in suppressing axion isocurvature perturbations during inflation by stabilizing a PQ field at a large field value. The viable parameter space consistent with theoretical and observational constraints is identified. Our scenario provides a minimal path for PQ symmetry breaking that addresses both the axion domain wall and isocurvature problems while permitting arbitrarily high reheating temperatures accommodating high-scale baryogenesis scenarios such as thermal leptogenesis.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Solution in Anti-de Sitter Space with a New Cloud of Strings Surrounded by Dark Matter Halo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.24833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical study of a Schwarzschild-like Anti-de Sitter (AdS) black hole (BH) influenced by a new cloud of strings (NCS) and a dark matter halo (DMH) characterized by a Dehnen-type density profile. We analyze the geodesic motion of both massless and massive test particles, highlighting how the NCS and DMH parameters affect the effective potentials, photon spheres, circular orbits, BH shadow, and the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of test particles. Additionally, we investigate the thermodynamic behavior of the BH in an extended phase space by deriving key quantities, such as the Hawking temperature, the equation of state (EoS), Gibbs free energy, internal energy, and the specific heat capacity. Our results show that the presence of NCS and DMH induces significant modifications in both the dynamical and thermodynamical behavior of the BH, including shifts in the Hawking-Page transition and divergences in heat capacity, thereby reshaping the phase structure of the BH.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Special Relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2201.02201v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anisotropic Special Relativity (ASR) is the relativistic theory of nature with a preferred direction in space-time. By relaxing the \textit{full-isotropy} constraint on space-time to the \textit{preference of one direction}, we obtain a perturbative modification of the Minkowski metric as $\mathscr{g}_{\mu\nu}\simeq\eta_{\mu\nu}+2\phi\epsilon_{\mu\nu}$ for a small perturbation parameter $\phi$. The symmetry group of ASR is obtained to have six generators satisfying the full Lorentz group algebra. However, the generators are deformed by the perturbation parameter $\phi$. So, ASR retains the same representations of Special Relativity (SR) but allows for Lorentz-invariant violation at the same time. Any invariant quantity of the theory is the inner product of two contravariant 4-vectors mediated by ${g}_{\mu\nu}$. The mass of a the particle is modified to $m^2=P^{\mu}\mathscr{g}_{\mu\nu}P^{\nu}$ which, in the first approximation level, has the extra term $(2\phi\epsilon_{\mu\nu})P^{\mu}P^{\nu}$ compared to the mass of the particle in SR. So, one application of ASR is, for example, to explain the neutrino flavour oscillation experiments in a natural way without violating the lepton number or adding sterile right-handed neutrinos. The mass of a particle is not the only quantity that is modified in ASR; any scalar quantity such as the Lagrangian of fields are also modified since the anisotropic metric $\mathscr{g}_{\mu\nu}$ is used to contract any pair of covariant-contravariant indices. As a more general consequence of ASR, any Quantum Field Theory (QFT) becomes anisotropic since the Lagrangian must contain the anisotropic metric. So, we provide a procedure to make anisotropic QFTs where the Lorentz-invariant Lagrangians are replaced with their ASR version.</description>

      <title>Notes on the type classification of von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01958v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: These notes provide an explanation of the type classification of von Neumann algebras, which has made many appearances in recent work on entanglement in quantum field theory and quantum gravity. The goal is to bridge a gap in the literature between resources that are too technical for the non-expert reader, and resources that seek to explain the broad intuition of the theory without giving precise definitions. Reading these notes will provide you with: (i) an argument for why "factors" are the fundamental von Neumann algebras that one needs to study; (ii) an intuitive explanation of the type classification of factors in terms of renormalization schemes that turn unnormalizable positive operators into "effective density matrices;" (iii) a mathematical explanation of the different types of renormalization schemes in terms of the allowed traces on a factor; (iv) an intuitive characterization of type I and II factors in terms of their "standard forms;" and (v) a list of some interesting connections between type classification and modular theory, including the argument for why type III$_1$ factors are believed to be the relevant ones in quantum field theory. None of the material is new, but the pedagogy is different from other sources I have read; it is most similar in spirit to the recent work on gravity and the crossed product by Chandrasekaran, Longo, Penington, and Witten.</description>

Abstract: Jacobi sigma models are two-dimensional topological non-linear field theories which are associated with Jacobi structures. The latter can be considered as a generalization of Poisson structures. After reviewing the main properties and peculiarities of these models, we focus on the twisted version in which a Wess-Zumino term is included. This modification allows for the target space to be a twisted Jacobi manifold. We discuss in particular the model on the sphere $S^5$.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Quantum Phase Transitions of the $\phi^4$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20704v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss and revisit the finite temperature extension of the renormalization group (RG) treatment of $T=0$ field theories, focusing as a case study on the $\phi^4$ model. We first discuss the extension of RG equations of the very same model from $T=0$ to finite $T$ in the usual way by resorting to sums on the Matsubara frequencies and fixing the physical temperature parameter $T$. We show that this approach, although useful for a variety of applications, may lead to the disappearance of the critical points as extracted from the RG flow. Since the identification of fixed points is key in the study of classical and quantum phase transitions, wepropose a modification of the usual finite-temperature RG approach by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale, $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ where $k_T$ is the running cutoff for thermal, and $k$ is for the quantum fluctuations. Once introduced this dimensionless temperature $\tau$, we investigate the consequences on the thermal RG approach for the $\phi^4$ model and construct its phase diagram. Finally, we formulate requirements for the phase diagram of the $\phi^4$ theory based on known properties of the quantum and classical phase diagrams of the Ising model.</description>

      <title>Type II orientifold flux vacua in 3D</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01403v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of type II orientifold flux vacua in three dimensions including gauge and metric fluxes, O-planes and D-branes. We derive simple flux models (we dub them RSTU-models) that admit a description in terms of gauged supergravities with half-maximal $\,\mathcal{N}=8\,$ supersymmetry in three dimensions. As a landscape appetizer, we present various multi-parametric families of supersymmetric and non-supersymmetric AdS$_{3}$ and Mkw$_{3}$ vacua. Remarkably, negative masses turn out to be always absent in the spectrum of scalar fluctuations, thus making all the vacua perturbatively stable within half-maximal supergravity. We provide examples of non-supersymmetric type IIB AdS$_{3}$ flux vacua which feature parametrically-controlled scale separation and come along with integer-valued conformal dimensions of the would-be dual CFT$_{2}$ operators. We also comment on the implications of our results in light of the Swampland Program.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the recent advances in the understanding of integrability for $AdS_3$ backgrounds, we present a lightning review of this approach, with particular attention to the "tensionless" limits (with zero and one unit of NSNS flux), and to the many integrable deformations of the supergravity backgrounds. Our aim is to concisely but comprehensively take stock of the state of the art in the field, in a way accessible to non-experts, and to highlight outstanding challenges. Along the way we reference where the various derivation of these results, which we mostly omit, can be found in full detail.</description>

Abstract: Massless chiral fields of arbitrary spin in six spacetime dimensions, also known as higher spin singletons, admit a simple formulation in terms of $SU^*(4) \cong SL(2,\mathbb{H})$ tensors. We show that, paralleling the four-dimensional case, these fields can be described using a $0$-form and a gauge $2$-form, taking values in totally symmetric tensors of $SU^*(4)$. We then exhibit an example of interacting theory that couples a tower of singletons of all integer spin to a background of $\mathfrak{g}$-valued higher spin fields, for $\mathfrak{g}$ an arbitrary Lie algebra equipped with an invariant symmetric bilinear form. Finally, we discuss the formulation of these models in arbitrary even dimensions, as well as their partially-massless counterpart.</description>

      <title>A Note on Kinematic Flow and Differential Equations for Two-Site One-Loop Graph in FRW Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17192v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically study the differential systems governing loop-level wavefunction coefficients of conformally-coupled scalar field theory within a general power-law FRW cosmology. By utilizing the twisted cohomology, hyperplane arrangements, and IBP techniques, we derive the canonical differential equations for two-site one-loop bubble and tadpole systems, revealing distinct structural differences. We present new insights into the one-loop tadpole system, uncovering that its integral family can include multiple parent functions due to distinct pairs of relative hyperplane associated with each function, unlike the single parent function appearing in the one-loop bubble case. Moreover, we demonstrate that the tadpole correlator selectively probes only a subset of the cohomology space, despite the hyperplane arrangement suggesting a higher-dimensional structure. Another novel contribution of this work is the extension of kinematic flow framework to the loop-level scenarios for the first time. Using a graphical approach based on family trees generated by marked tubing graphs, which encode singularity structures, we efficiently construct the differential equations and uncover the hierarchical relationships among the associated master integrals. Additionally, we provide a preliminary discussion on generalization to two-site higher-loop configurations. We propose a general decomposition formula for the canonical form of a two-site diagram with arbitrary loops, breaking it into unshifted and shifted components associated with the fundamental tree-level and bubble-like structures, and establish a block-wise decomposition rule for the matrix $\tilde{A}$ in the corresponding differential system. These advancements provide a unified framework for two-site loop-level correlators and lay the groundwork for future study of more complex multi-site loop systems.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Grey Galaxies, Dual Dressed Black Holes and the Superconformal Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent construction of grey galaxy and Dual Dressed Black Hole solutions in $AdS_5\times S^5$, we present two conjectures relating to the large $N$ entropy of supersymmetric states in ${\cal N}=4$ Yang-Mills theory. Our first conjecture asserts the existence of a large number of supersymmetric states which can be thought of as a non interacting mix of supersymmetric black holes and supersymmetric `gravitons'. It predicts a microcanonical phase diagram of supersymmetric states with eleven distinct phases, and makes a sharp prediction for the supersymmetric entropy (as a function of 5 charges) in each of these phases. The microcanonical version of the superconformal index involves a sum over states - with alternating signs - over a line in 5 parameter charge space. Our second (and more tentative) conjecture asserts that this sum is dominated by the point on the line that has the largest supersymmetric entropy. This conjecture predicts a large $N$ formula for the superconformal index as a function of indicial charges, and predicts a microcanonical indicial phase diagram with nine distinct phases. It predicts agreement between the superconformal index and black hole entropy in one phase (so over one range of charges), but disagreement in other phases (and so at other values of charges). We compare our predictions against numerically evaluated superconformal index at $N\leq10$, and find qualitative agreement.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and Heat Engine Behavior of Phantom BTZ Black Holes in Noncommutative Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03725v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study explores the thermodynamic and geometric properties of phantom BTZ black holes within a noncommutative spacetime framework, where noncommutativity is implemented through Lorentzian smearing of mass and charge distributions. The resulting metric exhibits significant modifications in curvature and horizon structure, particularly in the near-horizon regime. We perform a comparative thermodynamic analysis between phantom and Maxwell field cases, calculating quantities such as Hawking temperature, entropy, heat capacity, and Gibbs free energy. Our findings reveal that noncommutative corrections strongly affect phase transitions and stability conditions. Furthermore, we model the black hole as a heat engine and compute its efficiency, showing how noncommutative effects enhance or suppress energy extraction. This work underscores the interplay between spacetime fuzziness and exotic field dynamics in lower-dimensional gravity, offering new insights into quantum-modified black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Holography for the IKKT matrix model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08771v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic dualities that relate type II strings on near-horizon Dp brane geometries to super Yang-Mills theories with sixteen supercharges in p+1 dimensions provide non-conformal generalizations of the famous AdS/CFT correspondence. For the extremal case p=-1, this suggests a holographic duality for the IKKT matrix model - super Yang-Mills theory reduced to zero dimensions. Despite intriguing and highly non-trivial results in the IKKT model, this duality has remained largely unexplored so far. In this letter, we consider the lowest supermultiplet of gauge invariant operators of the model and identify its states with the lowest Kaluza-Klein fluctuations of (Euclidean) IIB supergravity on the D(-1) instanton background. We construct its holographic bulk realization as a one-dimensional maximal supergravity with 32 supercharges and local SO(10) invariance, capturing the full non-linear dynamics. Analyzing the bulk Killing spinor equations, we construct a general class of half-supersymmetric solutions, which typically break SO(10). We present their uplifts to IIB supergravity, and furthermore to pp-waves in twelve dimensions. These results provide the minimal setup for conducting precision tests of holography involving Einstein gravity.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative Formulation of Resonances in Quantum Mechanics Based on Exact WKB Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quasi-stationary states in quantum mechanics using the exact Wentzel--Kramers--Brillouin (WKB) analysis as a nonperturbative framework. Whereas previous works focused mainly on stable systems, we explore unstable states such as resonances. As a concrete example, we analyze the inverted Rosen--Morse potential, which exhibits barrier resonance. This model allows exact solutions, enabling a direct comparison with exact WKB predictions. We provide a simple analytic picture of resonance and demonstrate consistency between exact and WKB-based results, extending the applicability of exact WKB analysis to nonpolynomial potentials.</description>

      <title>Consequences of Symmetry Fractionalization without 1-Form Global Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fractionalization of 0-form global symmetries on line operators in theories without 1-form global symmetries. The projective transformation properties of line operators are renormalization group invariant, and we derive constraints which are similar to the consequences of exact 1-form symmetries. For instance, symmetry fractionalization can lead to exact selection rules for line operators in twisted sectors, and in theories with 't Hooft anomalies involving the fractionalization class, these selection rules can further imply that certain twisted sectors have exact finite-volume vacuum degeneracies. Along the way, we define topological operators on open codimension-1 manifolds, which we call `disk operators', that provide a convenient way of encoding the projective action of 0-form symmetries on lines. In addition, we discuss the possible ways symmetry fractionalization can be matched along renormalization group flows.</description>

      <title>Conformal boundaries near extremal black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14003v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine four dimensional, near-extremal black hole solutions in the presence of a finite boundary obeying conformal boundary conditions, where the conformal class of the induced metric and the trace of the extrinsic curvature are fixed. Working in Euclidean signature and at fixed charge, we find the near-extremal regime is dominated by a double-scaling limit which reveals new scaling laws for the quasi-local conformal entropy at low temperatures. Upon spherical dimensional reduction, we obtain the effective two-dimensional dilaton-gravity theory that describes the near-extremal regime. In contrast to Dirichlet boundaries, for conformal boundaries a linear dilaton potential is not sufficient to capture the leading correction away from extremality and higher orders are needed. We also examine near-Nariai solutions and the spherical reduction of pure three-dimensional gravity in (Anti-) de Sitter space. In the latter, provided the boundary is placed near the conformal boundary of three-dimensional Anti-de Sitter space, the dynamics of the spherically symmetric boundary mode is governed by a Liouville equation that descends from a (minus) Schwarzian effective action.</description>

Abstract: We review recent progress in constructing type IIB AdS$_{3}$ flux vacua that exhibit parametrically-controlled scale separation and come along with integer-valued conformal dimensions for the would-be dual CFT$_{2}$ operators. We comment on the anisotropic nature of the associated internal spaces, as well as on the existence of polynomial shift symmetries underlying the mass spectra. We conclude by outlining open questions and potential directions for future research, partially inspired by the Swampland program.</description>

      <title>Finite $N$ Bulk Hilbert Space in ETH Matrix Model for double-scaled SYK</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the notion of chord number in the strict large $N$ double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (DSSYK) model to the corresponding finite $N$ ETH matrix model. The chord number in the strict large $N$ DSSYK model is known to correspond to the discrete length of the Einstein-Rosen bridge in the gravity dual, which reduces to the renormalized geodesic length in JT gravity at weak coupling. At finite $N$, these chord number states form an over-complete basis of the non-perturbative Hilbert space, as the structure of the inner product gets significantly modified due to the Cayley-Hamilton theorem: There are infinitely many null states. In this paper, by considering ``EFT for gravitational observables'' or a version of ``non-isometric code'', we construct a family of chord number operators at finite $N$. While the constructed chord number operator depends on the reference chord number state, it realizes approximate $q$-deformed oscillator algebra and reproduces semiclassical bulk geometry around the reference state. As a special case, we will show that when the reference is chosen to be the chord number zero state, the chord number operator precisely matches with the Krylov state complexity, leading to the ``ramp-slope-plateau'' behavior at late times, implying the formation of ``grey hole''.</description>

      <title>On entanglement c-functions in confining gauge field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement entropy has proven to be a powerful tool for probing renormalization group (RG) flows in quantum field theories, with c-functions derived from it serving as candidate measures of the effective number of degrees of freedom. While the monotonicity of such c-functions is well established in many settings, notable exceptions occur in theories with a mass scale. In this work, we investigate entanglement c-functions in the context of holographic RG flows, with a particular focus on flows across dimensions induced by circle compactifications. We argue that in spacetime dimensions $d \geq 4$, standard constructions of c-functions, which rely on higher derivatives of the entanglement entropy of either a ball or a cylinder, generically lead to non-monotonic behavior. Working with known dual geometries, we argue that the non-monotonicity stems not from any pathology or curvature singularity, but from a transition in the holographic Ryu--Takayanagi surface. In compactifications from four to three dimensions, we propose a modified construction that restores monotonicity in the infrared, although a fully monotonic ultraviolet extension remains elusive. Furthermore, motivated by entanglement entropy inequalities, we conjecture a bound on the cylinder entanglement c-function, which holds in all our examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel type of duality that connects a sequence of well-known theories with even-multiplicity scalar amplitudes: it relates the Yang-Mills theory coupled to a specific scalar matter sector to the nonlinear sigma model on a symmetric coset space, the (multiflavor) Dirac-Born-Infeld theory, and the special Galileon theory. The duality is manifested with the help of a covariant formulation of the classical equations of motion that features a contact quartic scalar self-coupling combined with propagation on a dynamical background of elementary or composite gauge fields. This is augmented with a set of constitutive relations that reflect the intrinsic or extrinsic geometry of the target space of the theory. The universality of the underlying geometric structure allows for an unambiguous mapping between different theories.</description>

      <title>Building the Holographic Dictionary of the DSSYK from Chords, Complexity &amp; Wormholes with Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22716v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we formulate the holographic dictionary for the double-scaled SYK (DSSYK) model with matter operators. Based on the two-sided Hartle-Hawking (HH) state, we derive several properties of the DSSYK model, without making assumptions about the specific dual theory, including its semiclassical thermodynamics, correlation functions, and Krylov complexity. We derive these quantities from the saddle points of the DSSYK path integral preparing the HH state. We also construct a Lanczos algorithm that simultaneously evaluates Krylov state and operator complexity in the two-sided Hamiltonian system including finite temperature effects. In the semiclassical limit, both measures are encoded in the saddle points of the path integral. They have a bulk interpretation in terms of minimal geodesic lengths in an effective AdS$_2$ space with matter backreaction. Different saddle points correspond to geodesic distances with different evolution, and they display different scrambling properties. We also discuss about the quantization of the bulk theory dual to the DSSYK model. At last, we formulate the double-scaled algebra in bulk terms, and the dual entry of the proper radial momentum of a bulk probe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01415v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the relation of the super Macdonald polynomials and the BPS state counting on the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^2$, which is mathematically described by framed stable perverse coherent sheaves. Fixed points of the torus action on the moduli space of BPS states are labeled by super partitions. From the equivariant character of the tangent space at the fixed points we can define the Nekrasov factor for a pair of super partitions, which is used for the localization computation of the partition function. The Nekrasov factor also allows us to compute matrix elements of the action of the quantum toroidal algebra of type $\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}$ on the $K$ group of the moduli space. We confirm that these matrix elements are consistent with the Pieri rule of the super Macdonald polynomials.</description>

      <title>The Veneziano Amplitude in any Dimension and a Virasoro-Shapiro Partial Amplitude</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates how the Veneziano partial amplitude of bosonic string theory admits a generalization to world-(hyper)surfaces of any dimension $d$. In particular, for $d=2$, by carving up the worldsheet integral according to stipulations imposed on conformal cross ratios, the Virasoro-Shapiro full amplitude can be decomposed into a sum of three partial amplitudes. The amplitudes obtained on generalizing the Veneziano amplitude all contain tachyons. To explore candidate tachyon-free and supersymmetric versions of these amplitudes, a new bootstrap principle is introduced and applied, which demands that towers of residues alternate between all-even and all-odd spin partial waves.</description>

      <title>Mixed five-point correlators in the 3d Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study five-point correlators of the $\sigma$, $\epsilon$, and $\epsilon'$ operators in the critical 3d Ising model. We consider the $\sigma \times \sigma$ and $\sigma \times \epsilon$ operator product expansions (OPEs) and truncate them by including a finite set of exchanged operators. We approximate the truncated operators by the corresponding contributions in appropriate disconnected five-point correlators. We compute a number of OPE coefficients that were previously unknown and show that these are consistent with predictions obtained using the fuzzy sphere regularization of the critical 3d Ising model.</description>

      <title>Near-extremal quantum cross-section for charged fields and superradiance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13896v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the scattering and absorption properties of charged scalar fields on a near-extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole background. We show that in this low-temperature regime the near-horizon throat experiences large quantum fluctuations, whose leading contribution is described by the one dimensional Schwarzian effective action, while the soft $U(1)$ gauge modes can only contribute to subleading order. We investigate the role of the leading quantum effects both inside and outside the superradiant regime. These effects result in an enhanced reflection coefficient within the superradiant regime, while causing a suppression in the non-superradiant regime. On the other hand, the absorption cross-section increases in both regimes. Additional physical features appear as kinks in the reflection coefficient and absorption cross-section plots, corresponding to the shutdown of absorption in the superradiant regime and of stimulated emission in the non-superradiant regime.</description>

Abstract: These notes review the D0-brane or Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind (BFSS) matrix quantum mechanics from a post-AdS/CFT perspective. We start from the decoupling argument for D0-branes and discuss the gravity dual in the 't Hooft regime, before extrapolating to strong coupling. In the second part of these notes, we review the matrix bootstrap method and its application to the D0-brane quantum mechanics.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the relationship between the Swampland program and QM2-branes, which are supersymmetric M2-branes with discrete spectrum. The worldvolume description of these M2-branes is well-known. The global description is given in terms of twisted torus bundles with monodromy in $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$. In particular, we show that the towers of states that ensure the Swampland Distance Conjecture for type II maximal supergravity in nine dimensions are directly related to QM2-branes with trivial monodromy on a background that is toroidally compactified.</description>

Abstract: We propose an embedding of the symTFT construction in (finite cut-off) holography. The proposal passes several non-trivial consistency checks reproducing the expected symTFTs in various cases, including the recently discussed symTFT for the 1-form symmetry of 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. Moreover, we comment on the possibility of unifying the symTFT and the symTh descriptions via the democratic formulation of Supergravity, using the 4d $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM theory as an example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16099v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry under a particular class of non-strictly canonical transformations may be used to identify, and subsequently excise degrees of freedom which do not contribute to the closure of the algebra of dynamical observables. In this article, we present a mathematical framework which extends this symmetry reduction procedure to classical field theories described within the covariant De-Donder Weyl formalism. Both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms are discussed; in the former case, the Lagrangian is introduced as a bundle morphism $\mathcal{L}:J^1E\rightarrow\wedge^mM$, whilst the Hamiltonian description takes as its multiphase space the restricted multimomentum bundle $J^1E^*$. The contact reduction process is implemented in a number of particular cases, and it is found that the geometry of the reduced space admits an elegant physical interpretation.</description>

      <title>Non-diagonal open spin-1/2 XXZ quantum chains by separation of variables: Complete spectrum and matrix elements of some quasi-local operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.0646</link>
      <description>arXiv:1206.0646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integrable quantum models, associated to the transfer matrices of the 6-vertex reflection algebra for spin 1/2 representations, are studied in this paper. In the framework of Sklyanin's quantum separation of variables (SOV), we provide the complete characterization of the eigenvalues and eigenstates of the transfer matrix and the proof of the simplicity of the transfer matrix spectrum. Moreover, we use these integrable quantum models as further key examples for which to develop a method in the SOV framework to compute matrix elements of local operators. This method has been introduced first in [1] and then used also in [2], it is based on the resolution of the quantum inverse problem (i.e. the reconstruction of all local operators in terms of the quantum separate variables) plus the computation of the action of separate covectors on separate vectors. In particular, for these integrable quantum models, which in the homogeneous limit reproduce the open spin-1/2 XXZ quantum chains with non-diagonal boundary conditions, we have obtained the SOV-reconstructions for a class of quasi-local operators and determinant formulae for the covector-vector actions. As consequence of these findings we provide one determinant formulae for the matrix elements of this class of reconstructed quasi-local operators on transfer matrix eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Scattering diagrams, stability conditions, and coherent sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:1909.02985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a purely algebraic structure, a two-dimensional scattering diagram, describes a large part of the wall-crossing behavior of moduli spaces of Bridgeland semistable objects in the derived category of coherent sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$. This gives a new algorithm computing the Hodge numbers of the intersection cohomology of the classical moduli spaces of Gieseker semistable sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$, or equivalently the refined Donaldson-Thomas invariants for compactly supported sheaves on local $\mathbb{P}^2$.
  As applications, we prove that the intersection cohomology of moduli spaces of Gieseker semistable sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$ is Hodge-Tate, and we give the first non-trivial numerical checks of the general $\chi$-independence conjecture for refined Donaldson-Thomas invariants of one-dimensional sheaves on local $\mathbb{P}^2$.</description>

      <title>A proof of N.Takahashi's conjecture for $(\mathbb{P}^2,E)$ and a refined sheaves/Gromov-Witten correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.02992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove N.Takahashi's conjecture determining the contribution of each contact point in genus-$0$ maximal contact Gromov-Witten theory of $\mathbb{P}^2$ relative to a smooth cubic $E$. This is a new example of a question in Gromov-Witten theory which can be fully solved despite the presence of contracted components and multiple covers. The proof relies on a tropical computation of the Gromov-Witten invariants and on the interpretation of the tropical picture as describing wall-crossing in the derived category of coherent sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$, giving a translation of the original Gromov-Witten question into a known statement about Euler characteristics of moduli spaces of one-dimensional Gieseker semistable sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$.
  The same techniques allow us to prove a new sheaves/Gromov-Witten correspondence, relating Betti numbers of moduli spaces of one-dimensional Gieseker semistable sheaves on $\mathbb{P}^2$, or equivalently refined genus-$0$ Gopakumar-Vafa invariants of local $\mathbb{P}^2$, with higher-genus maximal contact Gromov-Witten theory of $(\mathbb{P}^2,E)$. The correspondence involves the non-trivial change of variables $y=e^{i \hbar}$, where $y$ is the refined/cohomological variable on the sheaf side, and $\hbar$ is the genus variable on the Gromov-Witten side. We explain how this correspondence can be heuristically motivated by a combination of mirror symmetry and hyperk\"ahler rotation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2009.02266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kauffman bracket skein algebra is a quantization of the algebra of regular functions on the $SL_2$ character variety of a topological surface. We realize the skein algebra of the $4$-punctured sphere as the output of a mirror symmetry construction based on higher genus Gromov-Witten theory and applied to a complex cubic surface. Using this result, we prove the positivity of the structure constants of the bracelets basis for the skein algebras of the $4$-punctured sphere and of the $1$-punctured torus. This connection between topology of the $4$-punctured sphere and enumerative geometry of curves in cubic surfaces is a mathematical manifestation of the existence of dual descriptions in string/M-theory for the $\mathcal{N}=2$ $N_f=4$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2105.07992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this first paper, we start the analysis of correlation functions of quantum spin chains with general integrable boundary conditions. We initiate these computations for the open XXX spin 1/2 quantum chains with some unparallel magnetic fields allowing for a spectrum characterization in terms of homogeneous Baxter like TQ-equations, in the framework of the quantum separation of variables (SoV). Previous SoV analysis leads to the formula for the scalar products of the so-called separate states. Here, we solve the remaining fundamental steps allowing for the computation of correlation functions. In particular, we rederive the ground state density in the thermodynamic limit thanks to SoV approach, we compute the so-called boundary-bulk decomposition of boundary separate states and the action of local operators on these separate states in the case of unparallel boundary magnetic fields. These findings allow us to derive multiple integral formulae for these correlation functions similar to those previously known for the open XXX quantum spin chain with parallel magnetic fields.</description>

Abstract: We present several expected properties of the holomorphic Floer theory of a holomorphic symplectic manifold. In particular, we propose a conjecture relating holomorphic Floer theory of Hitchin integrable systems and Donaldson-Thomas invariants of non-compact Calabi-Yau 3-folds. More generally, we conjecture that the BPS spectrum of a 4-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ quantum field theory can be recovered from the holomorphic Floer theory of the corresponding Seiberg-Witten integrable system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13003v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This report presents a possible attempt at renormalisable quantum gravity based on the standard BRST quantisation used for Yang-Mills theory. We have provided the BRST invariant Lagrangian of the gravitationally interacting U(1) gauge theory, namely the Quantum GraviElectro Dynamics (QGED), including the gauge fixing and the ghost Lagrangian. We have extracted a set of Feynman rules in the local inertial frame where gravity locally vanishes from this Lagrangian. Using the Feynman rules of the QGED constructed here, we have built all the renormalisation constants and show that the theory is perturbatively renormalisable, at least in the one-loop order. All infinite naked objects in the naked Lagrangian can replace experimentally measured ones. In addition to the standard QED parameters, we have shown that the gravitational coupling constant can be experimentally measured.
  We have also discussed a running effect of the gravitational coupling constant and the perturbative estimation of the Hawking radiation as examples of perturbative QGED. The difference between our theory and the widely known un-renormalisable quantum general relativity is clarified.</description>

      <title>Defying eternal inflation in warm inflation with a negative running</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was pointed out previously~\cite{Kinney:2014jya} that a sufficiently negative running of the spectral index of curvature perturbations from (ordinary i.e. cold) inflation is able to prevent eternal inflation from ever occurring. Here, we reevaluate those original results, but in the context of warm inflation, in which a substantial radiation component (produced by the inflaton) exists throughout the inflationary period.
  We demonstrate that the same general requirements found in the context of ordinary (cold) inflation also hold true in warm inflation; indeed an even tinier amount of negative running is sufficient to prevent eternal inflation. This is particularly pertinent, as models featuring negative running are more generic in warm inflation scenarios. Finally, the condition for the existence of eternal inflation in cold inflation -- that the curvature perturbation amplitude exceed unity on superhorizon scales -- becomes more restrictive in the case of warm inflation. The curvature perturbations must be even larger, i.e. even farther out on the potential, away from the part of the potential where observables, e.g. in the Cosmic Microwave Background, are produced.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative Origin of the Electroweak Scale: RGE in Strongly-coupled Dark Gauge Theories via Dyson-Schwinger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel pathway to generate the electroweak scale (EW) via non-perturbative dynamics of a dark gauge sector based on the SU(N) gauge group. Imposing the scale invariance of the theory, we investigate the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) which is triggered dynamically via the condensation of gauge fields. Instead of the usual dimension-4 triggered breaking, a dimension 6 term (with Wilson coefficient compatible with SMEFT bounds) coupling the Higgs boson and the Yang-Mills field quadratic term in the Lagrangian provides feedback from the gauge to the Higgs sector. We provide a novel method to estimate a non-perturbative EW scale generation using the exact solution of a truncated set of the background equations of motion in Yang-Mills theory in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions and the exact beta-function valid in the strongly coupled regimes via the Dyson-Schwinger approach. Particularly, we find an analytical result for the Renormalization Group Equation (RGE) of the gauge coupling in the $SU(N)$ sector in the strongly-coupled regime. The dynamics studied in this paper pave the way to a more realistic model building with possible resolution to the hierarchy problem and, in general, dynamical generation of scales.</description>

Abstract: We develop a unified mathematical theory of defect condensations for topological orders in all dimensions based on higher categories, higher algebras and higher representations. A k-codimensional topological defect $A$ in an n+1D (potentially anomalous) topological order $C^{n+1}$ is condensable if it is equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_k$-algebra. Condensing such a defect $A$ amounts to a k-step process. In the first step, we condense the defect $A$ along one of its transversal directions, thus obtaining a (k-1)-codimensional defect $\Sigma A$, which is naturally equipped with the structure of a condensable $E_{k-1}$-algebra. In the second step, we condense the defect $\Sigma A$ in one of the remaining transversal directions, thus obtaining a (k-2)-codimensional defect $\Sigma^2 A$, so on and so forth. In the k-th step, we condense the 1-codimensional defect $\Sigma^{k-1}A$ along the only transversal direction, thus defining a phase transition from $C^{n+1}$ to a new n+1D topological order $D^{n+1}$. We give precise mathematical descriptions of each step in above process, including the precise mathematical characterization of the condensed phase $D^{n+1}$. When $C^{n+1}$ is anomaly-free, the same phase transition can be alternatively defined by replacing the last two steps by a single step of condensing the $E_2$-algebra $\Sigma^{k-2}A$ directly along the remaining two transversal directions. When n=2, this modified last step is precisely a usual anyon condensation in a 2+1D topological order. We derive many new mathematical results physically along the way. We also establish the connections among various notions of "gauging" symmetries. We also briefly discuss questions, generalizations and applications that naturally arise from our theory, including higher Morita theory, a theory of integrals and the condensations of liquid-like gapless defects in topological orders.</description>

      <title>Hilbert space representation for quasi-Hermitian position-deformed Heisenberg algebra and Path integral formulation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Position deformation of a Heisenberg algebra and Hilbert space representation of both maximal length and minimal momentum uncertainties may lead to loss of Hermiticity of some operators that generate this algebra. Consequently, the Hamiltonian operator constructed from these operators are also not Hermitian. In the present paper, with an appropriate positive-definite Dyson map, we establish the Hermiticity of these operators by means of a quasi-similarity transformation. We then construct Hilbert space representations associated with these quasi-Hermitian operators that generate a quasi-Hermitian Heisenberg algebra. With the help of these representations we establish the path integral formulation of any systems in this quasi-Hermitian algebra. Finally, using the path integral of a free particle as an example, we demonstrate that the Euclidean propagator, action, and kinetic energy of this system are constrained by the standard classical mechanics limits.</description>

      <title>Superfluids in expanding backgrounds and attractor times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01892v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We determine the behavior of an out-of-equilibrium superfluid, composed of a $U(1)$ Goldstone mode coupled to hydrodynamic modes in a M\" uller-Israel-Stewart theory, in expanding backgrounds relevant to heavy ion collision experiments and cosmology. For suitable initial conditions, the evolution of the hydrodynamic variables leads to a change in the potential of the Goldstone mode, spontaneously breaking the symmetry. After some time, the condensate becomes small, leading the system evolution to be well described via hydrodynamic attractors for a timescale that we determine in Bjorken and Gubser flows. We define this new timescale as the \textit{attractor time} and show its dependence on initial conditions. In the case of the Gubser flow, we provide for the first time a complete description of the nonlinear evolution of the system, including a novel nonlinear regime of constant anisotropy not found in the Bjorken evolution. Finally, we consider the superfluid in the dynamical FLRW (Friedmann-Lemaitre-Roberston-Walker) background, where we observe a similar attractor behavior, dependent on the initial conditions, that at late times approaches a regime dominated by the condensate.</description>

      <title>Casimir effect in magnetic dual chiral density waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the Casimir effect originating from Dirac fields in finite-density matter under a magnetic field. In particular, we focus on quark fields in the magnetic dual chiral density wave (MDCDW) phase as a possible inhomogeneous ground state of interacting Dirac-fermion systems. In this system, the distance dependence of Casimir energy shows a complex oscillatory behavior by the interplay between the chemical potential, magnetic field, and inhomogeneous ground state. By decomposing the total Casimir energy into contributions of each Landau level, we elucidate what types of Casimir effects are realized from each Landau level: the lowest or some types of higher Landau levels lead to different behaviors of Casimir energies. Furthermore, we point out characteristic behaviors due to level splitting between different fermion flavors, i.e., up/down quarks. These findings provide new insights into Dirac-fermion (or quark) matter with a finite thickness.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of effective field theories via on-shell methods: the case of axion-like particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the most general axion-like particle effective field theory, including both CP-odd and CP-even types of interactions, and evaluate the corresponding renormalization group equations, improving and extending previous results in the literature. Our calculations exploit on-shell and unitarity-based methods. The relevant phase-space cut-integrals are carried out using different integration methods, among which the double-cut integration via Stokes' theorem proves to be technically simpler. A close comparison between the standard Feynman diagrammatic approach and the unitarity-based method enables us to explicitly verify the reduction of complexity in the latter case, along with a more direct and elegant way to establish a connection among anomalous dimensions of operators that are dual under the CP symmetry.</description>

      <title>Free-Streaming Neutrinos and Their Phase Shift in Current and Future CMB Power Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13788v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmic neutrino background and other light relics leave distinct imprints in the cosmic microwave background anisotropies through their gravitational influence. Since neutrinos decoupled from the primordial plasma about one second after the big bang, they have been free-streaming through the universe. This induced a characteristic phase shift in the acoustic peaks as a unique signature. In this work, we constrain the free-streaming nature of these relativistic species and other light relics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics by establishing two complementary template-based approaches to robustly infer the size of this phase shift from the temperature and polarization power spectra. One template shifts the multipoles in these spectra, while the other novel template more fundamentally isolates the phase shift at the level of the underlying photon-baryon perturbations. Applying these methods to Planck data, we detect the neutrino-induced phase shift at about $10\sigma$ significance, which rises to roughly $14\sigma$ with additional data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope and the South Pole Telescope. We also infer that the data is consistent with the Standard Model prediction of three free-streaming neutrinos. In addition, we forecast the capabilities of future experiments which will enable significantly more precise phase-shift measurements, with the Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 reducing the $1\sigma$ uncertainties to roughly 4.3% and 2.5%, respectively. More generally, we establish a new analysis pipeline for the phase shift induced by neutrinos and other free-streaming dark radiation which additionally offers new avenues for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model in a signature-driven and model-agnostic way.</description>

      <title>Improving accuracy of tree-tensor network approach by optimization of network structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical methods based on tensor networks have been extensively explored in the research of quantum many-body systems in recent years. It has been recognized that the ability of tensor networks to describe a quantum many-body state crucially depends on the spatial structure of the network. In the previous work [Hikihara et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 013031 (2023)], we proposed an algorithm based on tree tensor networks (TTNs) that automatically optimizes the structure of TTN according to the spatial profile of entanglement in the state of interest. In this paper, we apply the algorithm to the random XY-exchange model under random magnetic fields and the Richardson model in order to analyze how the performance of the algorithm depends on the detailed updating schemes of the structural optimization. We then find that for the random XY model, on the one hand, the algorithm achieves improved accuracy, and the stochastic algorithm, which selects the local network structure probabilistically, is notably effective. For the Richardson model, on the other hand, the resulting numerical accuracy subtly depends on the initial TTN and the updating schemes. In particular, the algorithm without the stochastic updating scheme certainly improves the accuracy, while the one with the stochastic updates results in poor accuracy due to the effect of randomizing the network structure at the early stage of the calculation. These results indicate that the algorithm successfully improves the accuracy of the numerical calculations for quantum many-body states, while it is essential to appropriately choose the updating scheme as well as the initial TTN structure, depending on the systems treated.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic analysis and shadow bound of black holes surrounded by a dark matter halo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13397v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform the thermodynamic analysis of a black hole (BH) immersed in a dark matter halo (DMH). It is shown that the BH could not be in thermal equilibrium with the DMH in any regions outside the event horizon. This means that the thermodynamic influence of the environment (DMH) is relatively small on the BH. Importantly, it does not alter the nature of the negative heat capacity for the BH. We stress that the Newtonian ($1/a_0$) approximation gives us a correct thermodynamic description for the BH surrounded by DMH because the first law of thermodynamics and Smarr formula are satisfied. Hence, the Newtonian Helmholtz free energy is employed to reveal that there is the absence of phase transition to other BH with a positive heat capacity. Finally, we investigate the shadow bound of favored region for the BH immersed in the DMH by comparing EHT observations.</description>

      <title>Influence of finite-temperature effects on CMB power spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07469v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the implications of finite-temperature quantum field theory effects on cosmological parameters within the framework of the $\L$CDM model and its modification. By incorporating temperature-dependent corrections to the cosmological constant, we extend the standard cosmological model to include additional density parameters, $\Omega_{\L_2}$ and $\Omega_{\L_3}$, which arise from finite-T quantum gravitational effects. Using the Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving System (CLASS), we analyze the impact of these corrections on the cosmic microwave background power spectrum and compare the results with the Planck 2018 data. Through brute-force parameter scans and advanced machine learning techniques, including quartic regression, we demonstrate that the inclusion of $\Omega_{\L_2}$ and $\Omega_{\L_3}$ improves the model's predictive accuracy, achieving high $R^2$ values and low mean squared error. The present work paves the way for future research into higher-order corrections and enhanced computational methods for cosmological parameter estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the report by BICEP/Keck collaborations, the tensor-to-scalar ratio is $r_{0.05}&lt;0.036$ (95\% C.L.). However, recent datasets have preferred the evolving dark energy, which thus have significantly shifted the bestfit values of standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmological parameters. In this paper, we perform the joint analysis of BICEP/Keck cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode data, latest DESI DR2 baryon acoustic oscillations and supernova data, combined with Planck PR3 and PR4 CMB data respectively, and find $r_{0.05}=0.0159^{+0.0057}_{-0.014}$ and $r_{0.05}=0.0164^{+0.0063}_{-0.014}$. The constraints on $r$ are further tightened compared to the result of BICEP/Keck collaborations. Though there might be still systematic uncertainties in B-mode measurements due to the foreground contamination, our work is to not say what the value of $r$ is, but present the state-of-the-art constraints on $r$ and emphasize that the detection for $r$ depends potentially on our insight into the dark universe, highlighting the important role of cosmological surveys in comprehending our very early universe.</description>

      <title>Towards Model Agnostic $F(R)$ Gravity Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00915v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we construct a formalism that can reveal the general characteristics of classes of viable $F(R)$ inflationary theories. The assumptions we make is that the slow-roll era occurs, and that the de Sitter scalaron mass $m^2(R)$ of the $F(R)$ gravity is positive or zero, for both the inflationary and late-time quasi de Sitter eras, a necessary condition for the stability of the de Sitter spacetime. In addition, we require that the de Sitter scalaron mass is also a monotonically increasing function of the Ricci scalar, or it has an extremum. Also the $F(R)$ gravity function is required to depend on the two known fundamental scales in cosmology, the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ and the mass scale $m_s^2=\frac{\kappa^2 \rho_m^{(0)}}{3}$, with $\rho_m^{(0)}$ denoting the energy density of the cold dark matter at the present epoch, that is $F(R)=F(R,\Lambda,m_s^2)$. Using these general assumptions we provide the general features of viable classes of $F(R)$ gravity inflationary theories which remarkably can also simultaneously describe successfully the dark energy era. This unique feature of a unified description of the dark energy and inflationary eras stems from the requirement of the monotonicity of the de Sitter scalaron mass $m^2(R)$. These viable classes are either deformations of the $R^2$ model or $\alpha$-attractors type theories. The analysis of the viability of a general $F(R)$ gravity inflationary theory is reduced in evaluating the parameter $x=\frac{R F_{RRR}}{F_{RR}}$ and the first slow-roll index of the theory, either numerically or approximately. We also disentangle the power-law $F(R)$ gravities from power-law evolution.</description>

      <title>Universal Horizons without Hypersurface Orthogonality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key consequence of Lorentz-violating gravity is the emergence of modified dispersion relations implying the absence of a universal maximum propagation speed. This challenges the conventional notion of the event horizon as a causal boundary common to all degrees of freedom. However, certain solutions in these theories exhibit \emph{universal horizons} -- surfaces capable of trapping signals of arbitrarily high speed, thereby restoring the notion of black hole. Previous studies have extensively characterised universal horizons in settings where Lorentz violation is encoded via a hypersurface-orthogonal \ae{}ther. In this work, we explore the possibility of extending this concept to more general cases where hypersurface orthogonality is relaxed. To do so, we construct a candidate trapping surface and analyse its causal properties using a general model for Lorentz-violating matter. We find that, in addition to the standard conditions associated to universal horizons, a local vanishing of the \ae{}ther's twist is also necessary. We then provide an explicit example of such a universal horizon by suitably deforming the \ae{}ther flow in a stealth Kerr solution recently found in Einstein--\ae{}ther theory. Moreover, we analyse the behaviour of trajectories which are not analytical at the universal horizon and discuss the implications of our findings for Hawking radiation. While our analysis is motivated by Einstein-\ae{t}her gravity, our results apply to broader classes of Lorentz-violating theories, further supporting the relevance of black hole phenomenology in these frameworks.</description>

      <title>Information geometry and entanglement under phase-space deformation through nonsymplectic congruence transformation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fisher-Rao (FR) information matrix is a central object in multiparameter quantum estimation theory. The geometry of a quantum state can be envisaged through the Riemannian manifold generated by the FR-metric corresponding to the quantum state. Interestingly, any congruence transformation $GL(2n,\mathbb{R})$ in phase-space leaves the FR-distance for Gaussian states invariant. In the present paper, we investigate whether this isometry affects the entanglement in the bipartite system. It turns out that, even a simple choice of a congruence transformation, induces the entanglement in a bipartite Gaussian system.
  To make our study relevant to physical systems, we choose Bopp's shift in phase-space as an example of $GL(2n,\mathbb{R})$, so that the results can be interpreted in terms of noncommutative (NC) phase-space deformation. We explicitly provide a quantitative measure of the dependence of separability on NC parameters. General expressions for the metric structure are also provided.
  The crucial point in the present piece of study is the identification of the connection of phase-space deformation-induced entanglement through a general class of congruence transformation and the identification of a trade-off relationship between the initial correlations and deformation parameters.</description>

Abstract: Asymptotically Weyl-invariant gravity (AWIG) is further developed within the Palatini formalism as a power-counting renormalizable alternative to general relativity (GR). An expression for the dimensionless exponent n(R) is derived based on dynamical dimensional reduction. We show that this version of AWIG naturally resolves several theoretical issues normally associated with the Palatini formalism. A falsifiable prediction regarding the frequency of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers is made. A preliminary analysis of gravitational wave GW150914 yields a maximum tension of 0.9{\sigma} with GR and marginally favours AWIG. A similar analysis of gravitational wave GW151226 yields a maximum tension of 2.7{\sigma} with GR and favours AWIG more significantly.</description>

      <title>Thermal scalar field stress tensor on a two dimensional black hole and its near horizon properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the thermal renormalized energy-momentum tensor components of a massless scalar field, leading to trace anomaly, on a $(1+1)$ dimensional static black hole spacetime. Using these, the energy density and flux, seen by both static and freely-falling observers, are evaluated. Interestingly for both these observers the aforementioned quantities in the thermal version of Unruh and Boulware states are finite at the horizon when the scalar field is in thermal equilibrium with the horizon temperature (given by the Hawking expression). Whereas in Hartle-Hawking thermal state both the observers see finite energy-density and flux at the horizon, irrespective of the value of field temperature. Particularly in the case of Schwarzschild spacetime a freely falling observer, starts with initial zero velocity, finds its initial critical position $r^c_i = (3/2)r_H$, where $r_H$ is the horizon radius for which energy-density vanishes.</description>

      <title>Bipartite and tripartite entanglement in pure dephasing relativistic spin-boson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study non-perturbatively the entanglement generation between two and three emitters in an exactly solvable relativistic variant of the spin-boson model, equivalent to the time-independent formulation of the Unruh-DeWitt detector model. We show that (i) (highly) entangled states of the two emitters require interactions very deep into the light cone, (ii) the mass of the field can generically improve the entanglement generation, (iii) while it is possible to find regimes with genuine GHZ-like tripartite entanglement, it is difficult find regimes where tripartite entanglement can be easily shown to be significant or classified. Result (iii), in particular, suggests that probing the multipartite entanglement of a relativistic quantum field non-perturbatively requires either different probe-based techniques or variants of the UDW model. Along the way, we provide the regularity conditions for the $N$-emitter model to have well-defined ground states in the Fock space.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive approach to the physics of mesons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15646v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel approach for the self-consistent solution of coupled sets of Bethe-Salpeter and Schwinger-Dyson equations in QCD. This framework allows us to maintain the axial Ward-Takahashi identities of the theory within advanced approximation schemes, such as the skeleton or three-particle irreducible expansions. For this purpose we reformulate the Schwinger-Dyson equation of the axial-vector vertex such that the bulk of its quantum corrections is expressed in terms of a novel vertex. Crucially, this vertex satisfies a symmetry-induced relation of its own, which involves the full quark-gluon vertex. As a result, the Schwinger-Dyson equation reproduces the standard Ward-Takahashi identity satisfied by the axial-vector vertex. Consequently, the known relation between the quark mass function and the wave function of the pion in the chiral limit is duly fulfilled. The present approach offers valuable insights into the interplay between symmetry and dynamics, and provides a practical path towards computations of hadron physics within sophisticated approximations. In particular, the one-loop dressed truncation of the key dynamical equations, including that of the quark-gluon vertex, is shown to be completely compatible with the required symmetry relations. Further extensions and potential phenomenological applications of the developed framework are briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the dynamics of the three-state Potts quantum spin chain in the extreme ferromagnetic regime using perturbation theory in the transverse magnetic field. We demonstrate that this approach provides access to features well beyond the semiclassical method applied previously, including the description of resonant excitations and analytic prediction for the time evolution after a quantum quench. We also demonstrate that it agrees with the meson/bubble spectrum results from exact diagonalisation and the numerical simulations of the time evolution.</description>

      <title>Quenched properties of the Spectral Form Factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Spectral Form Factor (SFF) is defined as the modulus squared of the partition function in complex temperature for hermitian matrices and a suitable generalisation has been given in the non hermitian case. In this work we compute the properties of the quenched SFF for hermitian and non hermitian random matrices. Despite the fact that the (annealed) SFF is not self-averaging the quenched SFF is self-averaging but these two averages coincide up to subleading constants (at least for high enough temperatures). The fluctuations of $\log \mathrm{SFF}$ are deep and one encounters thin spikes when moving close to a zero of the partition function. We study the partition function at late times by considering a suitable change of variable which turns out to be compatible with a Gumbel distribution. We note that the exponential tails of this distribution can be obtained by the deep spikes in the $\log \mathrm{SFF}$, namely the zeros of the partition function. We compare with the results obtained in isolated many-body systems and we show that same results hold at late times also for non-hermitian Hamiltonains and non-hermitian random matrices.</description>

      <title>Dark Photon Oscillations in Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark photons, which can kinetically mix with ordinary photons, represent the simplest extension to the standard model. Detecting their oscillations with visible photons could provide crucial insights into the nature of dark matter and fundamental interactions beyond the standard model. We propose a novel laboratory-based approach to detect dark photon oscillations using a laser in an Optical Time-domain Relectometry (OTDR) setup. The laser light propagating through the optical fiber undergoes oscillations with the dark photon, leading to measurable changes in the power flow. These oscillations can precisely measured,
  leveraging its high sensitivity and efficiency in detecting small variations in the optical signal. This approach could provide a new avenue for probing dark photon oscillations in the laboratory and greatly improve the current experimental sensitivity to dark photon in a wide mass range.</description>

      <title>Quantum interference in the Einstein-Maxwell-Scalar spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19381v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate gravitationally induced interference within the framework of teleparallel gravity, deriving a general expression for the gravitational phase difference and applying it to an EMS spacetime. We then analyze how this phase difference is affected by the presence or absence of black hole charge. Our results show that, irrespective of charge, the dominant contribution to the gravitational phase difference arises from the black hole mass. Nevertheless, while the influence of charge is negligible under standard astrophysical conditions, we identify a possible amplification mechanism through its interplay with the coupling parameter $\alpha$ in the case of extremal charged black holes. This finding not only offers new theoretical insights but also suggests experimental opportunities for probing charged black hole parameters via quantum interferometric techniques.</description>

      <title>Axion boson stars with wormhole topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a novel gravitational configuration formed by a massless real phantom field and an axion scalar field, minimally coupled to gravity. This system describes an Ellis-type wormhole situated at the center of an axion star. By normalizing the mass of the axion field to unity, the physical properties of the model are determined by three independent parameters: the potential's decay constant, the frequency of the axion field, and the wormhole's throat parameter. We assess the traversability of this wormhole by examining the curvature scalars and energy conditions of the static solution. Our analysis of the wormhole's embedding diagrams indicates that, although the wormhole typically exhibits a single-throat geometry, a double-throat configuration featuring an equatorial plane may arise under specific conditions. Finally, an analysis of the null-geodesics reveals the existence of at least one unstable light ring at the wormhole throat.</description>
