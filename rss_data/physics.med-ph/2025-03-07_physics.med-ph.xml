      <title>Fusion of Various Optimization Based Feature Smoothing Methods for Wearable and Non-invasive Blood Glucose Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the wearable and non-invasive blood glucose estimation approach has been proposed. However, due to the unreliability of the acquisition device, the presence of the noise and the variations of the acquisition environments, the obtained features and the reference blood glucose values are highly unreliable. To address this issue, this paper proposes a polynomial fitting approach to smooth the obtained features or the reference blood glucose values. First, the blood glucose values are estimated based on the individual optimization approaches. Second, the absolute difference values between the estimated blood glucose values and the actual blood glucose values based on each optimization approach are computed. Third, these absolute difference values for each optimization approach are sorted in the ascending order. Fourth, for each sorted blood glucose value, the optimization method corresponding to the minimum absolute difference value is selected. Fifth, the accumulate probability of each selected optimization method is computed. If the accumulate probability of any selected optimization method at a point is greater than a threshold value, then the accumulate probabilities of these three selected optimization methods at that point are reset to zero. A range of the sorted blood glucose values are defined as that with the corresponding boundaries points being the previous reset point and this reset point. Hence, after performing the above procedures for all the sorted reference blood glucose values in the validation set, the regions of the sorted reference blood glucose values and the corresponding optimization methods in these regions are determined. The computer numerical simulation results show that our proposed method yields the mean absolute relative deviation (MARD) at 0.0930 and the percentage of the test data falling in the zone A of the Clarke error grid at 94.1176%.</description>

      <title>Non-Invasive Temporal Interference Electrical Stimulation for Spinal Cord Injury Rehabilitation: A Simulation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Spinal cord injury (SCI) rehabilitation remains a major clinical challenge, with limited treatment options for functional recovery. Temporal interference (TI) electrical stimulation has emerged as a promising non-invasive neuromodulation technique capable of delivering deep and targeted stimulation. However, the application of TI stimulation in SCI rehabilitation remains largely unexplored. Methods: This study aims to investigate the feasibility of applying non-invasive TI electrical stimulation for SCI rehabilitation. Through computational modeling, we analyzed the electric field distribution characteristics in the spinal cord under different TI stimulation configurations. Based on these findings, we propose a clinically applicable TI stimulation protocol for SCI rehabilitation. Results: The results demonstrate that TI stimulation can effectively deliver focused electric fields to targeted spinal cord segments while maintaining non-invasiveness. The electric field intensity varied depending on individual anatomical differences, highlighting the need for personalized stimulation parameters. The proposed protocol provides a practical framework for applying TI stimulation in SCI rehabilitation and offers a non-invasive alternative to traditional spinal cord stimulation techniques. Conclusions: This study establishes the feasibility of using non-invasive TI stimulation for SCI rehabilitation. The proposed stimulation protocol enables precise and targeted spinal cord modulation. However, further research is needed to refine personalized stimulation parameters and validate the clinical efficacy of this approach.</description>

      <title>An artificially intelligent magnetic resonance spectroscopy quantification method: Comparison between QNet and LCModel on the cloud computing platform CloudBrain-MRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objctives: This work aimed to statistically compare the metabolite quantification of human brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) between the deep learning method QNet and the classical method LCModel through an easy-to-use intelligent cloud computing platform CloudBrain-MRS. Materials and Methods: In this retrospective study, two 3 T MRI scanners Philips Ingenia and Achieva collected 61 and 46 in vivo 1H magnetic resonance (MR) spectra of healthy participants, respectively, from the brain region of pregenual anterior cingulate cortex from September to October 2021. The analyses of Bland-Altman, Pearson correlation and reasonability were performed to assess the degree of agreement, linear correlation and reasonability between the two quantification methods. Results: Fifteen healthy volunteers (12 females and 3 males, age range: 21-35 years, mean age/standard deviation = 27.4/3.9 years) were recruited. The analyses of Bland-Altman, Pearson correlation and reasonability showed high to good consistency and very strong to moderate correlation between the two methods for quantification of total N-acetylaspartate (tNAA), total choline (tCho), and inositol (Ins) (relative half interval of limits of agreement = 3.04%, 9.3%, and 18.5%, respectively; Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.775, 0.927, and 0.469, respectively). In addition, quantification results of QNet are more likely to be closer to the previous reported average values than those of LCModel. Conclusion: There were high or good degrees of consistency between the quantification results of QNet and LCModel for tNAA, tCho, and Ins, and QNet generally has more reasonable quantification than LCModel.</description>

      <title>Reproducibility Assessment of Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of Pregenual Anterior Cingulate Cortex across Sessions and Vendors via the Cloud Computing Platform CloudBrain-MRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the need to elucidate the mechanisms underlying illnesses and their treatment, as well as the lack of harmonization of acquisition and post-processing protocols among different magnetic resonance system vendors, this work is to determine if metabolite concentrations obtained from different sessions, machine models and even different vendors of 3 T scanners can be highly reproducible and be pooled for diagnostic analysis, which is very valuable for the research of rare diseases. Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning once on two separate days within one week (one session per day, each session including two proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) scans with no more than a 5-minute interval between scans (no off-bed activity)) on each machine. were analyzed for reliability of within- and between- sessions using the coefficient of variation (CV) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and for reproducibility of across the machines using correlation coefficient. As for within- and between- session, all CV values for a group of all the first or second scans of a session, or for a session were almost below 20%, and most of the ICCs for metabolites range from moderate (0.4-0.59) to excellent (0.75-1), indicating high data reliability. When it comes to the reproducibility across the three scanners, all Pearson correlation coefficients across the three machines approached 1 with most around 0.9, and majority demonstrated statistical significance (P&lt;0.01). Additionally, the intra-vendor reproducibility was greater than the inter-vendor ones.</description>

      <title>Natural Frequency Dependency of Magneto-Mechanical Resonators on Magnet Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise derivation of physical quantities like temperature or pressure at arbitrary locations is useful in numerous contexts, e.g. medical procedures or industrial process engineering. The novel sensor technology of magneto-mechanical resonators (MMR), based on the interaction of a rotor and stator permanent magnet, allows for the combined tracking of the sensor position and orientation while simultaneously sensing an external measurand. Thereby, the quantity is coupled to the torsional oscillation frequency, e.g. by varying the magnet distance. In this paper, we analyze the (deflection angle-independent) natural frequency dependency of MMR sensors on the rotor-stator distance, and evaluate the performance of theoretical models. The presented sensors incorporate magnets of spherical and/or cylindrical geometry. We find the distance-frequency relationship to be well described by an adapted dipole model accounting for material and manufacturing uncertainties. Their combined effect can be compensated by an adjustment of a single parameter which drives the median model deviation generally below 0.2 %. Our depicted methods and results are important for the design and calibration process of new sensor types utilizing the MMR technique</description>
