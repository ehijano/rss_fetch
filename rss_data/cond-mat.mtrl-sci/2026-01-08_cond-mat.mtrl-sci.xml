      <title>Fine and Hyperfine Interactions with Multi-level Spin Relaxation of the purified Giese-Salt in Veterinary Medicine: Prussian Blue Compound Ammonium-Ferric-Hexacyano-Ferrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ammonium ferric hexacyanoferrate is a veterinary-medical milestone and antidote against radiocesium, well-known as Giese-salt after the Chernobyl disaster fed to domestic and wild animals, which shows even a rich interplay of properties in nanostructural chemistry and ferromagnetism. Among the broad analytical techniques, the ambivalence of macroscopic micrometer-sized agglomerates and nanoparticle sizes, a suggested enlarged Fe(II)$-$C$\equiv$N$-$Fe(III) bond length by Fe K-edge XAFS results and multi-level spin relaxation in $^{57}$Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy are highlighted. This sets this underestimated compound in a new light, e.g., for modern biomedicine and biofunctionality, extending its essential importance in addition to hypothetical future nuclear incidents</description>

      <title>Peridynamic modeling of the crack velocity dependence via an incubation time fracture criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates one of the central problems of dynamic fracture mechanics, namely the dependence of the instantaneous stress intensity factor (SIF) on the crack propagation velocity. For this purpose, the well-known experiments by Ravi-Chandar and Knauss on brittle, amorphous Homalite-100 polymer plates are modeled using a peridynamic approach. The numerical model integrates the previously proposed remote stress fracture criterion into an incubation time fracture criterion. Results of numerical modeling indicate a significant variation in SIF values at an almost constant crack propagation velocity. Moreover, for higher crack propagation velocities, micro-branching is obtained numerically, leading to a larger scatter of SIF values. These effects were also observed in the experiments of Ravi-Chandar and Knauss, which provides new insights into the nature of the crack-velocity dependence of the Mode-I SIF.</description>

      <title>Light-Induced Even-Parity Unidirectional Spin Splitting in Coplanar Antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a coplanar antiferromagnet (AFM) with $xy$-plane magnetic moments exhibits a spin-split band structure and unidirectional spin polarization along $z$, the spin polarization is forced to be an odd function of momentum by the fundamental symmetry $[\bar{C}_{2z}\|\mathcal{T}]$. Coplanar AFMs displaying such odd-parity unidirectional spin splittings are known as odd-parity magnets. In this work, we propose the realization of their missing even-parity counterparts. We begin by deriving the symmetry conditions required for an even-parity, out-of-plane spin splitting. We then show that irradiating a spin-degenerate coplanar AFM with circularly polarized light lifts the $[\bar{C}_{2z}|\mathcal{T}]$ constraint, dynamically generating this even-parity state. Specifically, the light-induced unidirectional spin splitting exhibits a $d$-wave texture in momentum space, akin to that of a $d$-wave altermagnet. We prove this texture's robustness against spin canting and show it yields a unique clover-like angular dependence in the Drude spin conductivity. Our work demonstrates that optical driving can generate novel spin-split phases in coplanar AFMs, thereby diversifying the landscape of materials exhibiting distinct spin splittings.</description>

      <title>The interplay between topology, defects and chiral order in the nearly-commensurate charge density wave of 1T-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1T-TaS2, the nearly-commensurate charge density wave (NC-CDW) exhibits emergent chirality, a property of interest for technological applications such as memory. We study the relationship between chirality and topological defects using holographic analysis of scanning tunneling microscopy data. By characterizing the CDW order parameter, we uncover distinct topological defects and define a chiral order parameter that connects directly to them. Our analysis distinguishes between vortex pairs in high-strain areas and glass-like soliton or discommensurations networks. We propose that perturbations, such as strain, drive vortex nucleation and annihilation, leaving solitons or discommensurations pinned by disorder. Electric fields induce soliton and discommensurations movement, causing chiral switching via localized order parameter melting, enabling controllable room-temperature chirality</description>

      <title>Optical Spectroscopy of Waveguide coupled Er$^{3+}$ ensembles in CaWO$_4$ and YVO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an optical study of near-surface Er$^{3+}$ ensembles in waveguide-integrated CaWO$_4$ and YVO$_4$, investigating how nanophotonic coupling modifies rare-earth spectroscopy. In particular, we compare bulk excitation with evanescently coupled TE and TM waveguide modes. In Er$^{3+}$:CaWO$_4$, we observe a pronounced polarization-dependent surface effect. TE-coupled spectra closely reproduce bulk behavior. In contrast, TM coupling induces strong inhomogeneous broadening and an asymmetric low-energy shoulder of the site S1 Y1Z1 transition, with linewidths exceeding those of the bulk by more than a factor of four. Temperature-dependent measurements and surface termination studies indicate that surface charges are the dominant mechanism. Er$^{3+}$:YVO$_4$ remains largely unaffected by mode polarization, and surface termination leads only to minor spectral shifts. These observations suggest that non-charge-neutral rare-earth systems are more susceptible to surface-induced decoherence sources than charge-neutral hosts.</description>

      <title>Ir3Ge20: A 3n-Connected Cloverleaf-Shaped Supercluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Group 14 Zintl clusters are promising molecular building blocks for nanoscale architecture. Endohedral variants, which encapsulate d/f-block metals within p-block semimetal cages, provide insights into intermetallic bonding and compound formation. In this study, experimental photoelectron spectroscopy and first-principles calculations were used to investigate the Ir-doped germanium cluster species. A new C2v symmetric building block, IrGe12, was identified, serving as the basis for designing the supercluster Ir3Ge20 with a cloverleaf-shaped, D3h symmetric architecture. This structure consists of three interconnected aromatic IrGe12 units linked by Ge-Ge sigma bonds, forming shielding cones. Ir3Ge20 follows the 5n rule with 100 valence electrons, featuring a core-Ir3 unit with a d10 closed-shell configuration sharing electrons with the Ge20 skeleton. The stability, chemical bonding, and aromaticity of Ir3Ge20 were confirmed, demonstrating a novel approach to precise atom manipulation in cluster-based materials and devices.</description>

      <title>Structural heterogeneity-induced enhancement of transverse magneto-thermoelectric conversion revealed by thermoelectric imaging in functionally graded materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functionally graded materials (FGMs) exhibit continuous property variations that enable unique functionalities and provide efficient platforms for systematic property optimization. Here, we report the fabrication of FGMs with graded structural heterogeneity by annealing an amorphous metal under a one-dimensional temperature gradient. Using lock-in thermography (LIT), we spatially mapped transverse thermoelectric conversion with high spatial and temperature resolution. A pronounced non-monotonic response was observed, with the maximum anomalous Ettingshausen effect, transverse charge-to-heat conversion in magnetic materials, appearing in the atomic-heterogeneity regime well before crystallization. This enhancement was not captured by conventional structural or longitudinal transport measurements, highlighting the exceptional sensitivity of transverse thermoelectric phenomena to subtle structural heterogeneity. Structural analyses using scanning transmission electron microscopy and atom probe tomography revealed Fe-based crystalline alloys and Cu nanoclusters embedded in the amorphous matrix, whose heterogeneity accounts for the enhanced response. These findings establish temperature-gradient-annealed FGMs, combined with LIT, as a powerful methodology for probing structural-heterogeneity-driven transverse electron transport and designing high-performance flexible materials.</description>

      <title>Impact of MAPbI3 Phase Transitions on Solar Cell Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a first step toward a pragmatic phenomenological multiscale approach to evaluate perovskite solar cell performance which determines material properties at the atomistic scale with first-principles calculations, and applies them in macro-scale device models. This work focuses on the MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3) perovskite and how its phase transitions impact on its optical, electronic, and structural properties which are investigated at the first-principles level. The obtained data are coupled to a numerical drift-diffusion device model enabling evaluation of the performance of corresponding single junction devices. The first-principles simulation applies a hybrid exchange-correlation functional adapted to the studied family of compounds. Validation by available experimental data is presented from materials properties to device performance, justifying the use of the approach for predictive evaluation of existing and novel perovskites. The coupling between atomistic and device models is described in terms of a framework for exchange of optical and electronic parameters between the two scales. The obtained results are systematically discussed in terms of first-principles levels of approximation performances.</description>

      <title>Physically Consistent Machine Learning for Melting Temperature Prediction of Refractory High-Entropy Alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the melting temperature (Tm) of multi-component and high-entropy alloys (HEAs) is critical for high-temperature applications but computationally expensive using traditional CALPHAD or DFT methods. In this work, we develop a gradient-boosted decision tree (XGBoost) model to predict Tm for complex alloys based on elemental properties. To ensure physical consistency, we address the issue of data leakage by excluding temperature-dependent thermodynamic descriptors (such as Gibbs free energy of mixing) and instead rely on physically motivated elemental features. The optimized model achieves a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.948 and a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 9928 which is about 5% relative error for HEAs on a validation set of approximately 1300 compositions. Crucially, we validate the model using the Valence Electron Concentration (VEC) rule. Without explicit constraints during training, the model successfully captures the known stability transition between BCC and FCC phases at a VEC of approximately 6.87. These results demonstrate that data-driven models, when properly feature-engineered, can capture fundamental metallurgical principles for rapid alloy screening.</description>

      <title>High-pressure synthesis of quantum magnet M-YbTaO4 with a stretched diamond lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report bulk magnetic properties of ytterbium tantalate in its monoclinic fergusonite modification, M-YbTaO4. The spin-1/2 Yb3+ ions in this phase are arranged on a geometrically frustrated "stretched diamond" lattice. M-YbTaO4 cannot be prepared at ambient pressure and was instead prepared in a belt-type apparatus at 6 GPa and 1800 C. Susceptibility and specific heat data show no long-range ordering down to 1.8 K and are consistent with a Jeff = 1/2 Kramers doublet which splits in an applied field. Furthermore, under high-pressure synthesis the entire solid solution YbNbxTa1-xO4 (0 &lt; x &lt; 1) can be stabilised in the M phase, in contrast to ambient-pressure synthesis which favours the competing M' phase for Ta-rich compositions. Subsequent annealing of the Nb-Ta mixed samples resulted in colour changes, suggesting oxygen deficiency in some of the as-prepared high pressure samples. There was little variation in the bulk magnetic properties upon varying either the Nb/Ta ratio or the annealing conditions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopic and dynamic control over quantum states is essential for bridging fundamental studies of material properties to device function. Realizing such control at combined high spatial resolution and ultrafast temporal precision remains a major challenge. Here, we demonstrate femtosecond laser-driven patterning of topological quantum states in the Weyl semimetal WTe2. By engineering the excitation field into a transient optical grating, we spatially selectively and reversibly drive phase transitions between the topological Td and topologically trivial 1T* phases. Using ultrafast transmission electron microscopy, we directly visualize the formation of a periodic Td/1T* heterostructure, observe the propagation of a phase front, and analyze nanoscale confinement of coherently excited optical phonon modes. Our findings establish a platform for all-optical, spatially programmable, and reconfigurable control of quantum states, paving the way for optically addressable topological devices.</description>

      <title>Cleavage toughness of single crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Griffith thermodynamic energy balance is employed to analyze cleavage phenomenon from atomic level. Results show that the cleavage toughness, the strain energy release rate, and the surface energy can be defined by the bond strength (the appropriate elastic modulus ) and the bond density. Such simple definition of fracture parameters is different from Irwin ones. This appropriate elastic modulus of single crystals is obtained using the complex variable function method. The calculated results of cleavage toughness and surface energy of typical ionic and covalent crystals by the present formulae are in excellent agreement with the experimental values. It demonstrates that our method offers a concise tool for predicting the cleavage toughness, the energy release rate and the surface energy of crystal cleavage planes.</description>

      <title>Material exploration through active learning -- METAL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery and design of new materials are paramount in the development of green technologies. High entropy oxides represent one such group that has only been tentatively explored, mainly due to the inherent problem of navigating vast compositional spaces. Thanks to the emergence of machine learning, however, suitable tools are now readily available. Here, the task of finding oxygen carriers for chemical looping processes has been tackled by leveraging active learning-based strategies combined with first-principles calculations. High efficiency and efficacy have, moreover, been achieved by exploiting the power of recently developed machine learning interatomic potentials. Firstly, the proposed approaches were validated based on an established computational framework for identifying high entropy perovskites that can be used in chemical looping air separation and dry reforming. Chief among the insights thus gained was the identification of the best performing strategies, in the form of greedy or Thompson-based sampling based on uncertainty estimates obtained from Gaussian processes. Building on this newfound knowledge, the concept was applied to a more complex problem, namely the discovery of high entropy oxygen carriers for chemical looping oxygen uncoupling. This resulted in both qualitative as well as quantitative outcomes, including lists of specific materials with high oxygen transfer capacities and configurational entropies. Specifically, the best candidates were based on the known oxygen carrier CaMnO3 but also contained a variety of additional species, of which some, e.g., Ti; Co; Cu; and Ti, were expected while others were not, e.g., Y and Sm. The results suggest that adopting active learning approaches is critical in materials discovery, given that these methods are already shifting research practice and soon will be the norm.</description>

      <title>Robust chirality memory in carbon nanotubes growing under modulated and evolving environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the chirality and yield of carbon nanotubes is essential for their diverse applications from macroscopic composites to nanoelectronics. Floating-catalyst chemical vapor deposition is widely employed as a scalable synthesis route, where catalysts inevitably traverse spatially varying environments. However, prevailing interpretations of nanotube growth largely rely on ensemble monitoring or static, post-growth snapshots. Here, we combine digital isotope labeling with programmed temperature modulation to reconstruct the dynamic growth histories of supported individual nanotubes. Growth rates exhibit hysteresis and extraordinary sensitivity to temperature changes, indicating irreversible catalyst coarsening; nevertheless, the nanotube chirality remains robustly preserved across lengths exceeding 300 um. This sharp contrast between kinetic adaptability and structural memory in nanotube growth indicates that chirality control can be established at the nucleation stage, while allowing independent optimization of subsequent elongation. Our findings further call for a re-examination of static interpretations of diameter-determination mechanisms derived from post-growth snapshots.</description>

      <title>Magnetoluminescence of ZnMnSe/BeMnTe heterostructures with type-II band alignment at millikelvin temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04046v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magneto-optical properties of a Zn$_{0.99}$Mn$_{0.01}$Se/Be$_{0.93}$Mn$_{0.07} $Te diluted magnetic semiconductor heterostructure with type-II band alignment are investigated at cryogenic temperatures down to 16 mK. The temperature of the Mn spin system, which at the lowest possible laser power reaches 270 mK, is evaluated from the giant Zeeman splitting of the direct exciton in the Zn$_{0.99}$Mn$_{0.01}$Se layers subject to an external magnetic field. The degree of circular polarization of the direct and indirect optical transitions, induced by the magnetic field, is a sensitive indicator for the laser heating of the Mn spin system. Evidence of spin glass formation in the Mn spin system of the Be$_{0.93}$Mn$_{0.07}$Te layers with the critical temperature of $T_{SG}=400$ mK is found.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Computational Framework for Materials Design, Ab Initio Modeling, and Molecular Docking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To facilitate rational molecular and materials design, this research proposes an integrated computational framework that combines stochastic simulation, ab initio quantum chemistry, and molecular docking. The suggested workflow allows systematic investigation of structural stability, binding affinity, and electronic properties across biological and materials science domains by utilizing complementary tools like Avogadro for molecular construction and visualization, AutoDock for docking and interaction analysis, and ORCA for high-level electronic structure computations. Uncertainty, configurational sampling, and optimization in high-dimensional chemical spaces are addressed by combining Monte Carlo-based and annealing-inspired techniques. The work shows how materials science ideas such as polymer design, thin films, crystalline lattices, and bioelectronic systems can be applied to drug development. On-device, open-source computational methods are viable, scalable, and economical, as demonstrated by comparative platform analysis. All things considered, the findings highlight the need of an integrated, repeatable computational pipeline for speeding up de novo molecule assembly and materials architecture while lowering experimental risk and expense.</description>

      <title>AI-Guided Discovery of Novel Ionic Liquid Solvents for Industrial CO2 Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an AI-driven approach to discover compounds with optimal properties for CO2 capture from flue gas-refinery emissions' primary source. Focusing on ionic liquids (ILs) as alternatives to traditional amine-based solvents, we successfully identify new IL candidates with high working capacity, manageable viscosity, favorable regeneration energy, and viable synthetic routes. Our approach follows a five-stage pipeline. First, we generate IL candidates by pairing available cation and anion molecules, then predict temperature- and pressure-dependent CO2 solubility and viscosity using a GNN-based molecular property prediction model. Next, we convert solubility to working capacity and regeneration energy via Van't Hoff modeling, and then find the best set of candidates using Pareto optimization, before finally filtering those based on feasible synthesis routes. We identify 36 feasible candidates that could enable 5-10% OPEX savings and up to 10% CAPEX reductions through lower regeneration energy requirements and reduced corrosivity-offering a novel carbon-capture strategy for refineries moving forward.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Gaussian Process Regression for the Constitutive Modeling of Concrete: A Data-Driven Improvement to Phenomenological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling the constitutive behavior of concrete is crucial for civil and defense applications, yet widely used phenomenological models such as Karagozian \&amp; Case concrete (KCC) model depend on empirically calibrated failure surfaces that lack flexibility in model form and associated uncertainty quantification. This work develops a physics-informed framework that retains the modular elastoplastic structure of KCC model while replacing its empirical failure surface with a constrained Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) surrogate that can be learned directly from experimentally accessible observables. Triaxial compression data under varying confinement levels are used for training, and the surrogate is then evaluated at confinement levels not included in the training set to assess its generalization capability. Results show that an unconstrained GPR interpolates well near training conditions but deteriorates and violates essential physical constraints under extrapolation, even when augmented with simulated data. In contrast, a physics-informed GPR that incorporates derivative-based constraints aligned with known material behavior yields markedly better accuracy and reliability, including at higher confinement levels beyond the training range. Probabilistic enforcement of these constraints also reduces predictive variance, producing tighter confidence intervals in data-scarce regimes. Overall, the proposed approach delivers a robust, uncertainty-aware surrogate that improves generalization and streamlines calibration without sacrificing the interpretability and numerical efficiency of the KCC model, offering a practical path toward an improved constitutive models for concrete.</description>

      <title>Polymorph Selection in Charged Colloids in the Second Nucleation Step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study polymorph selection in a model of charged colloids, with a focus on the higher-order structure prior to and during nucleation. Specifically, we carry out molecular dynamics simulations of a repulsive Yukawa system with a slightly softened (Weeks-Chandler-Andersen) core. We consider the case where the interaction is long-ranged and the BCC crystal is stable, and also intermediate- and short-ranged cases where the FCC crystal is stable. We use two methods for structure identification, the topological cluster classification (TCC) [A. Malins et al., J. Chem. Phys. 139, 234506 (2013)] and the bond orientational order parameter analysis of W. Lechner and C. Dellago [J. Chem. Phys.129, 114707 (2008)]. Under conditions of high supersaturation, appropriate to experiments with colloids, we find that the system forms a precursor state in which the particles are hexagonally ordered. ~That is to say, the precursors are indistinguishable from an HCP crystal using the bond orientational order parameters. This ordering occurs at state points both when the body-centred cubic crystal is the stable phase, and also when the face-centred cubic crystal is stable. In all cases, the stable polymorph forms from the precursor phase in a second stage. Although at freezing, the fluid is very much more ordered when the interactions are short-ranged (when FCC is stable), at the supersaturations where nucleation occurs in our simulations, the higher-order structure of the metastable fluids is almost identical for the long-, short-, and intermediate-ranged systems when measured with the TCC.</description>

      <title>Wigner solid or Anderson solid -- 2D electrons in strong disorder</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Critically analyzing recent STM and transport experiments [Z. Ge, et al, arXiv:2510.12009] on 2D electron systems in the presence of random quenched impurities, we argue that the resulting low-density putative "solid" phase reported experimentally is better described as an Anderson solid with the carriers randomly spatially localized by impurities than as a Wigner solid where the carriers form a crystal due to an interaction-induced spontaneous breaking of the translational symmetry. In strongly disordered systems, the resulting solid is amorphous, which is adiabatically connected to the infinite disorder Anderson fixed point rather than the zero disorder Wigner crystal fixed point.</description>

      <title>muT2-NMR: Micro-Scale Correlation Relaxometry for in-situ High-Pressure Nuclear Magnetic Resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, frequency-domain in-situ high-pressure nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in diamond anvil cells (DACs) has been employed as a structural and electronic probe of condensed matter systems at pressures well into the megabar range. However, extensive spin interactions and sample heterogeneities under pressure often lead to significant spectral overlap, inhibiting independent observation of chemically similar spin sub-species in the same sample. In this work, we introduce a time-domain relaxometry framework specifically suited for DAC experiments, named muT2-NMR. Experimental flexibility and operational robustness are benchmarked on three hydrogen-rich molecular solids at pressures up to 72 GPa. We demonstrate that muT2-NMR can resolve individual molecular subunits in relaxation space, paving the way for novel high-pressure, high-resolution NMR applications in molecular solids.</description>

      <title>Unitary Transformation of Two-Dimensional Spin-Orbit Coupled Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rashba, Dresselhaus, and Weyl Hamiltonians form a foundational framework for modeling spin-orbit interactions across condensed matter systems. Although they describe distinct material classes and produce seemingly different spin textures, they are conventionally treated as separate, unrelated theoretical frameworks. Here, this work demonstrates that the linear 2D Rashba and Weyl models are connected by a specific unitary transformation that maps one Hamiltonian exactly onto the other. The same unitary can be applied to map the linear Dresselhaus-1 model onto the Dresselhaus-2 models and vice versa. Such hidden correspondence establishes a unified theoretical foundation for spin-orbit interactions, deepening our conceptual understanding of spin-orbit coupling and opening new avenues for exploring complex spin textures. To illustrate the application, this work introduces a unique, improved, and more realistic model Hamiltonian H_MKM combining all known foundational spintronic models, where the stringent condition of equal spin-orbit coupling strength of Rashba and Dresselhaus may not be required to observe persistent spin texture under MKM transformation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the formulas commonly used to estimate current-induced spin-orbit torques from harmonic Hall voltage measurements. In particular, we focus on the factor of two discrepancy among expressions employed to fit harmonic Hall signals measured under an in-plane rotating magnetic field. By explicitly deriving the relevant relations, we clarify the origin of this discrepancy and present the correct form of the fitting formula. We further discuss the determination of the sign of the field-like torque from harmonic Hall voltage measurements, which depends on the assumed form of the current-induced torques.</description>

      <title>Protonic thermoelectric effect of Superionic H2O and magnetic field generation in Uranus and Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Uranus and Neptune are characterized by anomalously tilted and multi-dipole magnetic fields, which poses substantial challenges for elucidating the internal mechanisms generating magnetic fields. Recent investigations confirmed that superionic H2O is thermodynamically stable and constitutes the dominant H2O phase within their icy mantles. In this study, we demonstrate that the superionic H2O ice exhibits a pronounced protonic thermoelectric effect, in which the maximum Seebeck coefficient within the interior of Uranus can reach approximately 620 uV/K, whereas that of Neptune is lower, within the range of 570-585 uV/K. Consequently, temperature gradients in the icy mantles can induce proton convection, which in turn drives magnetic field generation. Based on this novel mechanism, the disparities in magnetic field strength between Uranus and Neptune can be accounted for exclusively by their differing internal temperature gradients, and the predicted values are in agreement with observations.</description>

      <title>Electric-current control of anomalous Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate robust and reversible electric-current control of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in a two-dimensional WTe2/Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) stack. Applying a current through Td-WTe2 leads to a giant modulation of the AHE of the adjacent FGT layer, with the relative change of the AHE conductivity exceeding 180%. Control experiments show that i) the observed effect is absent in pure FGT, ii) the modulation weakens in thicker FGT films, confirming its interfacial origin, and iii) the modulation peaks for bilayer WTe2, indicating that the Berry-curvature dipole (BCD) plays the dominant role in the modulation. We propose that the charge current I generates an out-of-plane magnetization Mz via BCD in WTe2 and Mz modifies the exchange splitting of FGT via the inverse magnetic proximity effect, thereby altering its Berry curvature and nontrivially influencing the AHE. The demonstrated method of AHE control offers new possibilities for magnetism control, i.e., for the study of AHE-transistors as well as electric-current control of quantum magnets, especially magnetic insulators.</description>

      <title>DNA-Origami-Assembled Rhodium Nanoantennas for Deep-UV Label-Free Single-Protein Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoparticles of plasmonic metals have significantly to the development of spectroscopic techniques, enabling strong confinement of electromagnetic fields at the nanoscale and corresponding signal amplification. However, to date, plasmonic applications have been limited mainly to the visible and near-infrared range, as materials supporting ultraviolet resonances typically exhibit poor chemical stability and lack robust surface functionalisation methods. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a fully programmable approach to UV plasmonics based on rhodium nanocube dimers assembled using DNA origami templates. We have developed a reliable ligand exchange strategy that allows the functionalisation of rhodium nanocubes with DNA while maintaining their colloidal stability. These DNA-modified nanocubes act as modular building blocks that can be assembled into dimers with 69% efficiency and an average gap size of 10 nm. The DNA origami design also allows for the deterministic placement of a single streptavidin protein in the plasmonic gap, unlike previous methods based on stochastic diffusion. Experiments with single-molecule autofluorescence in UV, supported by numerical simulations, show an increase in brightness of up to 22, a reduction in fluorescence lifetime, and a more than tenfold increase in the total number of detected photons. By creating a robust and versatile platform for the production of UV-resonant plasmonic nanoantennas, this work extends the functionality of plasmonics to the deep UV spectrum and opens up new possibilities for labelling-free single-protein spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Surface Optimization of Aluminum Resonators for Robust Quantum Device Fabrication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aluminum remains the central material for superconducting qubits, and considerable effort has been devoted to optimizing its deposition and patterning for quantum devices. However, while post-processing of Nb- and Ta-based resonators has been widely explored, primarily focusing on oxide removal using buffered oxide etch (BOE), post-treatment strategies for Al resonators remain underdeveloped. This challenge becomes particularly relevant for industry-scale fabrication with multichip bonding, where delays between sample preparation and cooldown require surface treatments that preserve low dielectric loss during extended exposure to ambient conditions. In this work, we investigate surface modification approaches for Al resonators subjected to a 24-hour delay prior to cryogenic measurement. Passivation using self-limiting oxygen and fluorine chemistries was evaluated utilizing different plasma processes. Remote oxygen plasma treatment reduced dielectric losses, in contrast to direct plasma, likely due to additional ashing of residual resist despite the formation of a thicker oxide layer on both Si and Al surfaces. A fluorine-based plasma process was developed that passivated the Al surface with fluorine for subsequent BOE treatment. However, increasing fluorine incorporation in the aluminum oxide correlated with higher loss, identifying fluorine as an unsuitable passivation material for Al resonators. Finally, selective oxide removal using HF vapor and phosphoric acid was assessed for surface preparation. HF vapor selectively etched SiO2 while preserving Al2O3, whereas phosphoric acid exhibited the opposite selectivity. Sequential application of both etches yielded dielectric losses as low as $\delta_\mathrm{LP} = 5.2 \times 10^{-7}$ ($Q\mathrm{i} \approx 1.9\,\mathrm{M}$) in the single photon regime, demonstrating a promising pathway for robust Al-based resonator fabrication.</description>

Abstract: We perform Low Energy Ion Scattering with He ions ranging in energy from 1 keV to 3 keV on CaSiO$_3$ using a commercial electrostatic detector system and determine the charge fraction of scattered ions from comparison with Binary Collision Approximation simulations. The simulations take composition changes due to surface cleaning Xe sputtering into account. Scattered He particles are separated in the simulation into single, dual, and multiple scattering trajectories. We find that the charge fraction of single and dual scattered He is about 10 times higher than the one for multiple collisions. Our results show that the charge fraction of scattered He can be reliably extracted for different scattering regimes and that for a given He incidence energy, the entire scattered He spectrum can be modeled with only few constant parameters.</description>

Abstract: Hybrid energy-harvesting systems combining perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with drop-driven triboelectric nanogenerators (D-TENGs) provide continuous power under various weather conditions. However, halide perovskites' vulnerability to moisture hampers widespread use. We present plasma-deposited fluorinated polymers (CFX) as multifunctional encapsulation layers offering water resistance, triboelectric functionality, and &gt; 90 % optical transparency. These conformal, room-temperature, solvent-free coatings protect PSCs without reducing performance; encapsulated cells maintained a PCE of 17.9 %, and devices kept over 50 % of initial PCE after 10 days in high humidity and temperature. CFx layers also enabled compatibility with UV-curable resins, creating a hybrid PSC/D-TENG capable of harvesting solar and rain energy. This device retained 80 % of its performance after 300 hours of humid operation and stayed stable under continuous dripping and illumination for over 5 hours. Optimizing CFx's chemical composition improved triboelectric performance. Using the same CFx layer for encapsulation and triboelectric function, the device achieved 11.6 mA/cm2 short-circuit current under 0.5 sun and 12 V peak voltage per raindrop, enabling simultaneous solar and rain energy harvesting. A self-charging prototype powered LED arrays via a boost converter, demonstrating practical multisource energy harvesting.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical Kerr effect in an A-type antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) is a powerful probe of broken time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$), typically used to study ferromagnets. While MOKE has been observed in some antiferromagnets (AFMs) with vanishing magnetization, it is often associated with structures whose symmetry is lower than basic collinear, bipartite order. In contrast, theory predicts a mechanism for MOKE intrinsic to all AFMs of A-type, i.e. layered AFMs in which ferromagnetic layers are antiferromagnetically aligned. Here we report the first experimental confirmation of this mechanism in a bulk AFM. We achieve this by measuring the imaginary component of MOKE as a function of photon energy in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, an A-type AFM where $\mathcal{T}$ is preserved in combination with a translation. By comparing the experimental results with model calculations, we demonstrate that observable MOKE should be expected in all collinear A-type AFMs with out-of-plane spin order, thus enabling optical detection of AFM domains and expanding the scope of MOKE to few-layer AFMs.</description>

      <title>Physical spin torques from exactly constrained exchange-correlation torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19458v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of capturing physical spin torques in non-collinear magnetic systems has dominated the scene of spin-density functional theory (SDFT) in the last two decades. Progress has been hindered by the fact that the spin torque is directly connected to the divergence of the spin current, a quantity that is {\em extraneous} to SDFT -- thus leading to {\em spurious} exchange-correlation (xc) torques in the spin dynamics. Moreover, SDFT cannot rigorously include vector potentials and spin-orbit couplings. Here, we propose a solution that exploits the U(1)$\times$SU(2)-invariance of the xc energy of SpinCurrent-DFT (SCDFT) -- an exact constraint that is not accessible to SDFT. Non-vanishing xc torques obtained on non-collinear solutions are constrained by the aforementioned exact internal symmetry and do not enter the propagation of the spin magnetization -- i.e., the spin dynamics involve {\em only} the physical currents and physical spin-torques.</description>

      <title>Origin of Reverse Size Effect in Ferroelectric Hafnia Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12952v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The persistence of ferroelectricity in ultrathin HfO$_2$ films challenges conventional theories, particularly given the paradoxical observation that the out-of-plane lattice spacing increases as the film thickness decreases, a reverse size effect absent in perovskite ferroelectrics. Here, we resolve this puzzle by revealing that this anomalous lattice expansion is counterintuitively coupled to a suppressed out-of-plane polarization. First-principles calculations combined with analytical modeling identify two mechanisms behind this expansion: a negative longitudinal piezoelectric response to the residual depolarization field and a positive surface stress that becomes significant at reduced thickness. Their interplay quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed lattice expansion. Furthermore, (111)-oriented HfO$_2$ films can support out-of-plane polarization even under open-circuit conditions, in contrast to (001) films that stabilize a nonpolar ground state. This behavior points to the emergence of orientation-induced hyperferroelectricity, an unrecognized mechanism that enables polarization persistence through orientation engineering without electrode screening. We further demonstrate that this principle generalizes to conventional perovskites such as PbTiO$_3$, offering a strategy to eliminate the critical thickness limit by choosing the appropriate film orientation. As a practical pathway to device integration, we also identify the two-dimensional electride Ca$_2$N as a near-ideal electrode that fully restores the ferroelectric properties of HfO$_2$ in ultrathin capacitors.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Flux Equations for Ion Exchange in Silicate Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ion exchange kinetic flux equations have been extensively investigated since the mid-twentieth century and continue to provide a fundamental framework for describing mass transport phenomena in solid materials. Despite the maturity of this field, inconsistencies remain in the literature concerning the definition, dimensional consistency, and physical interpretation of the parameters involved. A rigorous and unified treatment of these equations is therefore essential to ensure the reproducibility and comparability of theoretical and experimental studies. The present study aims to establish a coherent and systematic development of ion exchange kinetic flux equations, with particular emphasis on the consistent definition and dimensional formulation of the relevant physical quantities. Beyond refining the theoretical foundations, this study extends the classical formulation by incorporating the influence of mechanical stress on ion transport and considering cross-term interactions within the framework of linear irreversible thermodynamics. These developments provide a more comprehensive description of ion exchange kinetics, particularly as applied to silicate glasses, where coupling between chemical and mechanical effects plays a crucial role in determining transport behavior and performance.</description>

      <title>Masgent: An AI-assisted Materials Simulation Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning potentials (MLPs) are essential for predicting and understanding materials properties, yet preparing, executing, and analyzing these simulations typically requires extensive scripting, multi-step procedures, and significant high-performance computing (HPC) expertise. These challenges hinder reproducibility and slow down discovery. Here, we introduce Masgent, an AI-assisted materials simulation agent that unifies structure manipulation, automated VASP input generation, DFT workflow construction and analysis, fast MLP-based simulations, and lightweight machine learning (ML) utilities within a single platform. Powered by large language models (LLMs), Masgent enables researchers to perform complex simulation tasks through natural-language interaction, eliminating most manual scripting and reducing setup time from hours to seconds. By standardizing protocols and integrating advanced simulation and data-driven tools, Masgent lowers the barrier to performing state-of-the-art computational methodologies, enabling faster hypothesis testing, pre-screening, and exploratory research for both new and experienced practitioners.</description>
