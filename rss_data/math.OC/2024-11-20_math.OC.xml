      <title>Controlled Occupied Processes and Viscosity Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the optimal control of occupied processes which record all positions of the state process. Dynamic programming yields nonlinear equations on the space of positive measures. We develop the viscosity theory for this infinite dimensional parabolic $occupied$ PDE by proving a comparison result between sub and supersolutions, and thus provide a characterization of the value function as the unique viscosity solution. Toward this proof, an extension of the celebrated Crandall-Ishii-Lions (second order) Lemma to this setting, as well as finite-dimensional approximations, is established. Examples including the occupied heat equation, and pricing PDEs of financial derivatives contingent on the occupation measure are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian dual with zero duality gap that admits decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For mixed integer programs (MIPs) with block structures and coupling constraints, on dualizing the coupling constraints the resulting Lagrangian relaxation becomes decomposable into blocks which allows for the use of parallel computing. However, the resulting Lagrangian dual can have non-zero duality gap due to the inherent non-convexity of MIPs. In this paper, we propose two reformulations of such MIPs by adding redundant constraints, such that the Lagrangian dual obtained by dualizing the coupling constraints and the redundant constraints have zero duality gap while still remaining decomposable. One of these reformulations is similar, although not the same as the RLT hierarchy. In this case, we present multiplicative bounds on the quality of the dual bound at each level of the hierarchy for packing and covering MIPs. We show our results are applicable to general sparse MIPs, where decomposability is revealed via the tree-decomposition of the intersection graph of the constraint matrix. In preliminary experiments, we observe that the proposed Lagrangian duals give better dual bounds than classical Lagrangian dual and Gurobi in equal time, where Gurobi is not exploiting decomposability.</description>

      <title>Stability and Performance Analysis on Self-dual Cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider nonsymmetric solutions to certain Lyapunov and Riccati equations and inequalities with coefficient matrices corresponding to cone-preserving dynamical systems. Most results presented here appear to be novel even in the special case of positive systems. First, we provide a simple eigenvalue criterion for a Sylvester equation to admit a cone-preserving solution. For a single system preserving a self-dual cone, this reduces to stability. Further, we provide a set of conditions equivalent to testing a given H-infinity norm bound, as in the bounded real lemma. These feature the stability of a coefficient matrix similar to the Hamiltonian, a solution to two conic inequalities, and a stabilizing cone-preserving solution to a nonsymmetric Riccati equation. Finally, we show that the H-infinity norm is attained at zero frequency.</description>

      <title>On sensitivities regarding shape and topology optimization as derivatives on Wasserstein spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the framework of optimal transport to the formulation of optimal design problems. By considering the Wasserstein space as a set of design variables, we associate each probability measure with a shape configuration of a material in some ways. In particular, we focus on connections between differentials on the Wasserstein space and sensitivities in the standard setting of shape and topology optimization in order to regard the optimization procedure of those problems as gradient flows on the Wasserstein space.</description>

      <title>A Control Lyapunov Function Approach to Event-Triggered Parameterized Control for Discrete-Time Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an event-triggered parameterized control method using a control Lyapunov function approach for discrete time linear systems with external disturbances. In this control method, each control input to the plant is a linear combination of a fixed set of linearly independent scalar functions. The controller updates the coefficients of the parameterized control input in an event-triggered manner so as to minimize a quadratic cost function subject to quadratic constraints and communicates the same to the actuator. We design an event-triggering rule that guarantees global uniform ultimate boundedness of trajectories of the closed loop system and non-trivial inter-event times. We illustrate our results through numerical examples and we also compare the performance of the proposed control method with other existing control methods in the literature.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Performance of Genetic Algorithm and Variable Neighborhood Search for Solving the Single Depot Multiple Set Orienteering Problem: A Comparative Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article discusses the single Depot multiple Set Orienteering Problem (sDmSOP), a recently suggested generalization of the Set Orienteering Problem (SOP). This problem aims to discover a path for each traveler over a subset of vertices, where each vertex is associated with only one cluster, and the total profit made from the clusters visited is maximized while still fitting within the available budget constraints. The profit can be collected only by visiting at least one cluster vertex. According to the SOP, each vertex cluster must have at least one of its visits counted towards the profit for that cluster. Like to the SOP, the sDmSOP restricts the number of clusters visited based on the budget for tour expenses. To address this problem, we employ the Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) meta-heuristic. The optimal solution for small-sized problems is also suggested by solving the Integer Linear Programming (ILP) formulation using the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) 37.1.0 with CPLEX for the sDmSOP. Promising computational results are presented that demonstrate the practicability of the proposed GA, VNS meta-heuristic, and ILP formulation by demonstrating substantial improvements to the solutions generated by VNS than GA while simultaneously needing much less time to compute than CPLEX.</description>

      <title>An Effective Iterative Solution for Independent Vector Analysis with Convergence Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Independent vector analysis (IVA) is an attractive solution to address the problem of joint blind source separation (JBSS), that is, the simultaneous extraction of latent sources from several datasets implicitly sharing some information. Among IVA approaches, we focus here on the celebrated IVA-G model, that describes observed data through the mixing of independent Gaussian source vectors across the datasets. IVA-G algorithms usually seek the values of demixing matrices that maximize the joint likelihood of the datasets, estimating the sources using these demixing matrices. Instead, we write the likelihood of the data with respect to both the demixing matrices and the precision matrices of the source estimate. This allows us to formulate a cost function whose mathematical properties enable the use of a proximal alternating algorithm based on closed form operators with provable convergence to a critical point. After establishing the convergence properties of the new algorithm, we illustrate its desirable performance in separating sources with covariance structures that represent varying degrees of difficulty for JBSS.</description>

      <title>Defining Lyapunov functions as the solution of a performance estimation saddle point problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we reinterpret quadratic Lyapunov functions as solutions to a performance estimation saddle point problem. This allows us to automatically detect the existence of such a Lyapunov function and thus numerically check that a given algorithm converges. The novelty of this work is that we show how to define the saddle point problem using the PEPit software  andthen solve it with DSP-CVXPY.This combination gives us a very strong modeling power because defining new points and their relations across iterates is very easy in PEPit. We can without effort define auxiliary points used for the sole purpose of designing more complex Lyapunov functions, define complex functional classes like the class of convex-concave saddle point problems whose smoothed duality gap has the quadratic error bound property or study complex algorithms like primal-dual coordinate descent method.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Nonmonotone Proximal Gradient Methods under the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz Property without a Global Lipschitz Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the composite minimization problem with the objective function being the sum of a continuously differentiable and a merely lower semicontinuous and extended-valued function. The proximal gradient method is probably the most popular solver for this class of problems. Its convergence theory typically requires that either the gradient of the smooth part of the objective function is globally Lipschitz continuous or the (implicit or explicit) a priori assumption that the iterates generated by this method are bounded. Some recent results show that, without these assumptions, the proximal gradient method, combined with a monotone stepsize strategy, is still globally convergent with a suitable rate-of-convergence under the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property. For a nonmonotone stepsize strategy, there exist some attempts to verify similar convergence results, but, so far, they need stronger assumptions. This paper is the first which shows that nonmonotone proximal gradient methods for composite optimization problems share essentially the same nice global and rate-of-convergence properties as its monotone counterparts, still without assuming a global Lipschitz assumption and without an a priori knowledge of the boundedness of the iterates.</description>

      <title>A general modeling and simulation framework for dynamic vehicle routing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In dynamic vehicle routing problems (DVRPs), some part of the information is revealed or changed on the fly, and the decision maker has the opportunity to re-plan the vehicle routes during their execution, reflecting on the changes. Accordingly, the solution to a DVRP is a flexible policy rather than a set of fixed routes. A policy is basically a problem-specific algorithm that is invoked at various decision points in the planning horizon and returns a decision according to the current state. Since DVRPs involve dynamic decision making, a simulator is an essential tool for dynamically testing and evaluating the policies. Despite this, there are few tools available that are specifically designed for this purpose. To fill this gap, we have developed a simulation framework that is suitable for a wide range of dynamic vehicle routing problems and allows to dynamically test different policies for the given problem. In this paper, we present the background of this simulation tool, for which we proposed a general modeling framework suitable for formalizing DVRPs independently of simulation purposes. Our open source simulation tool is already available, easy to use, and easily customizable, making it a useful tool for the research community.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different populations of vehicles travel along a network. Each population has its origin, destination and travel costs - which may well be unbounded. Under the only requirement of the continuity of the travel costs, we prove the existence of a Nash equilibrium for all populations. Conditions for its uniqueness are also provided. A few cases are treated in detail to show specific situations of interest.</description>

      <title>Stationary regimes of piecewise linear dynamical systems with priorities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical systems governed by priority rules appear in the modeling of emergency organizations and road traffic. These systems can be modeled by piecewise linear time-delay dynamics, specifically using Petri nets with priority rules. A central question is to show the existence of stationary regimes (i.e., steady state solutions) -- taking the form of invariant half-lines -- from which essential performance indicators like the throughput and congestion phases can be derived. Our primary result proves the existence of stationary solutions under structural conditions involving the spectrum of the linear parts within the piecewise linear dynamics. This extends to a broader class of systems a fundamental theorem of Kohlberg (1980) dealing with nonexpansive dynamics. The proof of our result relies on topological degree theory and the notion of ``Blackwell optimality'' from the theory of Markov decision processes. Finally, we validate our findings by demonstrating that these structural conditions hold for a wide range of dynamics, especially those stemming from Petri nets with priority rules. This is illustrated on real-world examples from road traffic management and emergency call center operations.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Day-Ahead Battery Scheduling based on Mixed Random Variables for Enhanced Grid Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing penetration of renewable energy sources introduces significant challenges to power grid stability, primarily due to their inherent variability. A new opportunity for grid operation is the smart integration of electricity production combined with battery storages in residential buildings. This study explores how residential battery systems can aid in stabilizing the power grid by flexibly managing deviations from forecasted residential power consumption and PV generation. The key contribution of this work is the development of an analytical approach that enables the asymmetric allocation of quantified power uncertainties between a residential battery system and the power grid, introducing a new degree of freedom into the scheduling problem. This is accomplished by employing mixed random variables - characterized by both continuous and discrete events - to model battery and grid power uncertainties. These variables are embedded into a continuous stochastic optimization framework, which computes probabilistic schedules for battery operation and power exchange with the grid. Test cases demonstrate that the proposed framework can be used effectively to reduce and quantify grid uncertainties while minimizing electricity costs. It is also shown that residential battery systems can be actively used to provide flexibility during critical periods of grid operation. Overall, this framework empowers prosumers to take an active role in grid stabilization, contributing to a more resilient and adaptive energy system.</description>

      <title>Reducing the Large Set Threshold for the Basu-Oertel Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1960, Gr\"{u}nbaum proved that for any convex body $C\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ and every halfspace $H$ containing the centroid of $C$, one has that the volume of $H\cap C$ is at least a $\frac{1}{e}$-fraction of the volume of $C$. Recently, in 2017, Basu and Oertel conjectured that a similar result holds for mixed-integer convex sets. Concretely, they proposed that for any convex body $C\subset \mathbb{R}^{n+d}$, there should exist a point $\mathbf{x} \in S=C\cap(\mathbb{Z}^{n}\times\mathbb{R}^d)$ such that for every halfspace $H$ containing $\mathbf{x}$, one has that
  \[
  \mathcal{H}_d(H\cap S) \geq \frac{1}{2^n}\frac{1}{e}\mathcal{H}_d(S),
  \] where $\mathcal{H}^d$ denotes the $d$-dimensional Hausdorff measure. While the conjecture remains open, Basu and Oertel proved that the above inequality holds true for sufficiently large sets, in terms of a measure known as the \emph{lattice width} of a set. In this work, by following a geometric approach, we improve this result by substantially reducing the threshold at which a set can be considered large. We reduce this threshold from an exponential to a polynomial dependency on the dimension, therefore significantly enlarging the family of mixed-integer convex sets over which the Basu-Oertel conjecture holds true.</description>

      <title>MultiBalance: Multi-Objective Gradient Balancing in Industrial-Scale Multi-Task Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In industrial recommendation systems, multi-task learning (learning multiple tasks simultaneously on a single model) is a predominant approach to save training/serving resources and improve recommendation performance via knowledge transfer between the joint learning tasks. However, multi-task learning often suffers from negative transfer: one or several tasks are less optimized than training them separately. To carefully balance the optimization, we propose a gradient balancing approach called MultiBalance, which is suitable for industrial-scale multi-task recommendation systems. It balances the per-task gradients to alleviate the negative transfer, while saving the huge cost for grid search or manual explorations for appropriate task weights. Moreover, compared with prior work that normally balance the per-task gradients of shared parameters, MultiBalance is more efficient since only requiring to access per-task gradients with respect to the shared feature representations. We conduct experiments on Meta's large-scale ads and feeds multi-task recommendation system, and observe that MultiBalance achieves significant gains (e.g., 0.738% improvement for normalized entropy (NE)) with neutral training cost in Queries Per Second (QPS), which is significantly more efficient than prior methods that balance per-task gradients of shared parameters with 70~80% QPS degradation.</description>

In particular, we investigate Langevin dynamics in the continuous- and the discrete-time setting for such distributions with potentials $U(x)$ which are strongly-convex but possibly non-differentiable. We show that the corresponding subgradient Langevin dynamics are exponentially ergodic to the target density $\pi$ in the continuous setting and that certain explicit as well as semi-implicit discretizations are geometrically ergodic and approximate $\pi$ for vanishing discretization step size. Moreover, we prove that the discrete schemes satisfy the law of large numbers allowing to use consecutive iterates of a Markov chain in order to compute statistics of the stationary distribution posing a significant reduction of computational complexity in practice. Numerical experiments are provided confirming the theoretical findings and showcasing the practical relevance of the proposed methods in imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Wavelet s-Wasserstein distances for 0 &lt; s &lt;= 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by classical harmonic analysis results characterizing H\"older spaces in terms of the decay of their wavelet coefficients, we consider wavelet methods for computing s-Wasserstein type distances. Previous work by Sheory (n\'e Shirdhonkar) and Jacobs showed that, for 0 &lt; s &lt;= 1, the s-Wasserstein distance W_s between certain probability measures on Euclidean space is equivalent to a weighted l_1 difference of their wavelet coefficients. We demonstrate that the original statement of this equivalence is incorrect in a few aspects and, furthermore, fails to capture key properties of the W_s distance, such as its behavior under translations of probability measures. Inspired by this, we consider a variant of the previous wavelet distance formula for which equivalence (up to an arbitrarily small error) does hold for 0 &lt; s &lt; 1. We analyze the properties of this distance, one of which is that it provides a natural embedding of the s-Wasserstein space into a linear space. We conclude with several numerical simulations. Even though our theoretical result merely ensures that the new wavelet s-Wasserstein distance is equivalent to the classical W_s distance (up to an error), our numerical simulations show that the new wavelet distance succeeds in capturing the behavior of the exact W_s distance under translations and dilations of probability measures.</description>

      <title>Safe Navigation in Dynamic Environments using Density Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work uses density functions for safe navigation in dynamic environments. The dynamic environment consists of time-varying obstacles as well as time-varying target sets. We propose an analytical construction of time-varying density functions to solve these navigation problems. The proposed approach leads to a time-varying feedback controller obtained as a positive gradient of the density function. This paper's main contribution is providing convergence proof using the analytically constructed density function for safe navigation in the presence of a dynamic obstacle set and time-varying target set. The results are the first of this kind developed for a system with integrator dynamics and open up the possibility for application to systems with more complex dynamics using methods based on control density function and inverse kinematic-based control design. We present the application of the developed approach for collision avoidance in multi-agent systems and robotic systems. While the theoretical results are produced for first-order integrator systems, we demonstrate how the framework can be applied for systems with non-trivial dynamics, such as Dubin's car model and fully actuated Euler-Lagrange system with robotics applications.</description>

Abstract: A traffic model on an open one-dimensional lattice is considered. At any discrete time moment, with prescribed probability, a particle arrives to the leftmost cell of the lattice, and, with prescribed probability, the arriving particle belongs to one of the types characterized by the probabilities of particle attempts to move at the present time and the probabilities to leave the system. An approximate approach to compute the particle flow rate and density in cells is proposed. It is proven that, for a particular case of the system, the approach gives exact results.</description>

      <title>An Eulerian approach to regularized JKO scheme with low-rank tensor decompositions for Bayesian inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility of using the Eulerian discretization for the problem of modelling high-dimensional distributions and sampling, is studied. The problem is posed as a minimization problem over the space of probability measures with respect to the Wasserstein distance and solved with entropy-regularized JKO scheme. Each proximal step can be formulated as a fixed-point equation and solved with accelerated methods, such as Anderson's. The usage of low-rank Tensor Train format allows to overcome the \emph{curse of dimensionality}, i.e. the exponential growth of degrees of freedom with dimension, inherent to Eulerian approaches. The resulting method requires only pointwise computations of the unnormalized posterior and is, in particular, gradient-free. Fixed Eulerian grid allows to employ a caching strategy, significally reducing the expensive evaluations of the posterior. When the Eulerian model of the target distribution is fitted, the passage back to the Lagrangian perspective can also be made, allowing to approximately sample from it. We test our method both for synthetic target distributions and particular Bayesian inverse problems and report comparable or better performance than the baseline Metropolis-Hastings MCMC with same amount of resources. Finally, the fitted model can be modified to facilitate the solution of certain associated problems, which we demonstrate by fitting an importance distribution for a particular quantity of interest.</description>

      <title>Distributed Coordination of Grid-Forming and Grid-Following Inverter-Based Resources for Optimal Frequency Control in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the fast-growing penetration of power inverter-interfaced renewable generation, power systems face significant challenges in maintaining power balance and the nominal frequency. This paper studies the grid-level coordinated control of a mix of grid-forming (GFM) and grid-following (GFL) inverter-based resources (IBRs) for power system frequency regulation at scale. Specifically, a fully distributed optimal frequency control algorithm is proposed by leveraging the projected primal-dual gradient method and the structure of the physical system dynamics. This algorithm 1) restores the nominal frequency, 2) minimizes the total control cost, 3) respects the IBR power limits and the line thermal constraints, and 4) is implemented in a distributed fashion that only needs local measurement and local communication. The effectiveness and optimality of the proposed algorithm are demonstrated through high-fidelity electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations on the IEEE 39-bus system.</description>

      <title>Improvements on Permutation Reconstruction from Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the reconstruction problem of permutation sequences from their $k$-minors, which are subsequences of length $k$ with entries renumbered by $1,2,\ldots,k$ preserving order. We prove that the minimum number $k$ such that any permutation of length $n$ can be reconstructed from the multiset of its $k$-minors is between $\exp{(\Omega(\sqrt{\ln n}))}$ and $O(\sqrt{n\ln n})$. These results imply better bounds of a well-studied parameter $N_d$, which is the smallest number such that any permutation of length $n\ge N_d$ can be reconstructed by its $(n-d)$-minors. The new bounds are $ d+\exp(\Omega(\sqrt{\ln d}))&lt;N_d&lt;d+O(\sqrt{d\ln d})$ asymptotically, and the previous bounds were $d+\log_2 d&lt;N_d&lt;d^2/4+2d+4$.</description>

      <title>ACING: Actor-Critic for Instruction Learning in Black-Box Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12736v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in solving tasks vastly depends on the quality of the instructions, which often require fine-tuning through extensive human effort. This highlights the need for automated instruction optimization; however, this optimization is particularly challenging when dealing with black-box LLMs, where model parameters and gradients remain inaccessible. We propose ACING, a task-specific prompt optimization approach framed as a stateless continuous-action Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem, known as the continuum bandit setting. ACING leverages an actor-critic-based method to optimize prompts, learning from non-differentiable reward signals. We validate ACING by optimizing prompts for ChatGPT on 30 instruction-based tasks. ACING consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving a median score improvement of 10 percentage points. Furthermore, ACING not only recovers but also surpasses human-crafted expert instructions, achieving up to a 39 percentage point improvement against human benchmarks.</description>

      <title>On the existence of minimizers in shallow residual ReLU neural network optimization landscapes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.14690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we show existence of minimizers in the loss landscape for residual artificial neural networks (ANNs) with multi-dimensional input layer and one hidden layer with ReLU activation. Our work contrasts earlier results in [D. Gallon, A. Jentzen, and F. Lindner, preprint, arXiv:2211.15641, 2022] and [P. Petersen, M. Raslan, and F. Voigtlaender, Found. Comput. Math., 21 (2021), pp. 375-444] which showed that in many situations minimizers do not exist for common smooth activation functions even in the case where the target functions are polynomials. The proof of the existence property makes use of a closure of the search space containing all functions generated by ANNs and additional discontinuous generalized responses. As we will show, the additional generalized responses in this larger space are suboptimal so that the minimum is attained in the original function class.</description>

      <title>PAPAL: A Provable PArticle-based Primal-Dual ALgorithm for Mixed Nash Equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.00970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the non-convex non-concave objective function in two-player zero-sum continuous games. The existence of pure Nash equilibrium requires stringent conditions, posing a major challenge for this problem. To circumvent this difficulty, we examine the problem of identifying a mixed Nash equilibrium, where strategies are randomized and characterized by probability distributions over continuous domains. To this end, we propose PArticle-based Primal-dual ALgorithm (PAPAL) tailored for a weakly entropy-regularized min-max optimization over probability distributions. This algorithm employs the stochastic movements of particles to represent the updates of random strategies for the $\epsilon$-mixed Nash equilibrium. We offer a comprehensive convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its effectiveness. In contrast to prior research that attempted to update particle importance without movements, PAPAL is the first implementable particle-based algorithm accompanied by non-asymptotic quantitative convergence results, running time, and sample complexity guarantees. Our framework contributes novel insights into the particle-based algorithms for continuous min-max optimization in the general non-convex non-concave setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new notion of Koopman operator which faithfully encodes the dynamics of controlled systems by leveraging the grammar of set-valued analysis. In this context, we propose meaningful generalisations of the Liouville and Perron-Frobenius operators, and show that they respectively coincide with proper set-valued analogues of the infinitesimal generator and dual operator of the Koopman semigroup. We also give meaning to the spectra of these set-valued maps and prove an adapted version of the classical spectral mapping theorem relating the eigenvalues of a semigroup and those of its generator. In essence, these results provide theoretical justifications for existing approaches in the Koopman communities which consist in studying control systems by bundling together the Liouville operators associated with different input parameters.</description>

Abstract: Linear-Quadratic optimal controls are computed for a class of boundary controlled, boundary observed hyperbolic infinite-dimensional systems, which may be viewed as networks of waves. The main results of this manuscript consist in converting the infinite-dimensional continuous-time systems into infinite-dimensional discrete-time systems for which the operators dynamics are matrices, in solving the LQ-optimal control problem in discrete-time and then in interpreting the solution in the continuous-time variables, giving rise to the optimal boundary control input. The results are applied to two examples, a small network of three vibrating strings and a co-current heat-exchanger, for which boundary sensors and actuators are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As the problem of minimizing functionals on the Wasserstein space encompasses many applications in machine learning, different optimization algorithms on $\mathbb{R}^d$ have received their counterpart analog on the Wasserstein space. We focus here on lifting two explicit algorithms: mirror descent and preconditioned gradient descent. These algorithms have been introduced to better capture the geometry of the function to minimize and are provably convergent under appropriate (namely relative) smoothness and convexity conditions. Adapting these notions to the Wasserstein space, we prove guarantees of convergence of some Wasserstein-gradient-based discrete-time schemes for new pairings of objective functionals and regularizers. The difficulty here is to carefully select along which curves the functionals should be smooth and convex. We illustrate the advantages of adapting the geometry induced by the regularizer on ill-conditioned optimization tasks, and showcase the improvement of choosing different discrepancies and geometries in a computational biology task of aligning single-cells.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic and Non-Asymptotic Convergence of AdaGrad for Non-Convex Optimization via Novel Stopping Time-based Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive optimizers have emerged as powerful tools in deep learning, dynamically adjusting the learning rate based on iterative gradients. These adaptive methods have significantly succeeded in various deep learning tasks, outperforming stochastic gradient descent (SGD). However, despite AdaGrad's status as a cornerstone of adaptive optimization, its theoretical analysis has not adequately addressed key aspects such as asymptotic convergence and non-asymptotic convergence rates in non-convex optimization scenarios. This study aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of AdaGrad, filling the existing gaps in the literature. We introduce an innovative stopping time technique from probabilistic theory, which allows us to establish the stability of AdaGrad under mild conditions for the first time. We further derive the asymptotically almost sure and mean-square convergence for AdaGrad. In addition, we demonstrate the near-optimal non-asymptotic convergence rate measured by the average-squared gradients in expectation, which is stronger than the existing high-probability results. The techniques developed in this work are potentially independent of interest for future research on other adaptive stochastic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Importance sampling-based gradient method for dimension reduction in Poisson log-normal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00476v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional count data poses significant challenges for statistical analysis, necessitating effective methods that also preserve explainability. We focus on a low rank constrained variant of the Poisson log-normal model, which relates the observed data to a latent low-dimensional multivariate Gaussian variable via a Poisson distribution. Variational inference methods have become a golden standard solution to infer such a model. While computationally efficient, they usually lack theoretical statistical properties with respect to the model. To address this issue we propose a projected stochastic gradient scheme that directly maximizes the log-likelihood. We prove the convergence of the proposed method when using importance sampling for estimating the gradient. Specifically, we obtain a rate of convergence of $O(T^{\nicefrac{-1}{2}} + N^{-1})$ with $T$ the number of iterations and $N$ the number of Monte Carlo draws. The latter follows from a novel descent lemma for non convex $L$-smooth objective functions, and random biased gradient estimate. We also demonstrate numerically the efficiency of our solution compared to its variational competitor. Our method not only scales with respect to the number of observed samples but also provides access to the desirable properties of the maximum likelihood estimator.</description>

      <title>Performance Estimation for Smooth and Strongly Convex Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend recent computer-assisted design and analysis techniques for first-order optimization over structured functions--known as performance estimation--to apply to structured sets. We prove "interpolation theorems" for smooth and strongly convex sets with Slater points and bounded diameter, showing a wide range of extremal questions amount to structured mathematical programs. Prior function interpolation theorems are recovered as a limit of our set interpolation theory. Our theory provides finite-dimensional formulations of performance estimation problems for algorithms utilizing separating hyperplane oracles, linear optimization oracles, and/or projection oracles of smooth/strongly convex sets. As direct applications of this computer-assisted machinery, we identify the minimax optimal separating hyperplane method and several areas for improvement in the theory of Frank-Wolfe, Alternating Projections, and non-Lipschitz Smooth Optimization. While particular applications and methods are not our primary focus, several simple theorems and numerically supported conjectures are provided.</description>

      <title>General duality and dual attainment for adapted transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate duality and existence of dual optimizers for several adapted optimal transport problems under minimal assumptions. This includes the causal and bicausal transport, the causal and bicausal barycenter problem, and a multimarginal problem incorporating causality constraints. Moreover, we characterize polar sets in the causal and bicausal setting and discuss applications of our results in robust finance. We consider a non-dominated model of several financial markets where stocks are traded dynamically, but the joint stock dynamics are unknown. We show that a no-arbitrage assumption naturally leads to sets of multicausal couplings. Consequently, computing the robust superhedging price is equivalent to solving an adapted transport problem, and finding a superhedging strategy means solving the corresponding dual.</description>

      <title>The Implicit Bias of Heterogeneity towards Invariance: A Study of Multi-Environment Matrix Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01420v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Models are expected to engage in invariance learning, which involves distinguishing the core relations that remain consistent across varying environments to ensure the predictions are safe, robust and fair. While existing works consider specific algorithms to realize invariance learning, we show that model has the potential to learn invariance through standard training procedures. In other words, this paper studies the implicit bias of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) over heterogeneous data and shows that the implicit bias drives the model learning towards an invariant solution. We call the phenomenon the implicit invariance learning. Specifically, we theoretically investigate the multi-environment low-rank matrix sensing problem where in each environment, the signal comprises (i) a lower-rank invariant part shared across all environments; and (ii) a significantly varying environment-dependent spurious component. The key insight is, through simply employing the large step size large-batch SGD sequentially in each environment without any explicit regularization, the oscillation caused by heterogeneity can provably prevent model learning spurious signals. The model reaches the invariant solution after certain iterations. In contrast, model learned using pooled SGD over all data would simultaneously learn both the invariant and spurious signals. Overall, we unveil another implicit bias that is a result of the symbiosis between the heterogeneity of data and modern algorithms, which is, to the best of our knowledge, first in the literature.</description>

      <title>When are Lossy Energy Storage Optimization Models Convex?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine a class of optimization problems involving the optimal operation of a single lossy energy storage system, where energy losses occur during charging and discharging. These inefficiencies typically lead to a nonconvex set of feasible charging and discharging power profiles. In this paper, we derive an equivalent reformulation of this class of optimization problems by eliminating the charging and discharging power variables and recasting the problem entirely in terms of the storage state-of-charge variables. We show that the feasible set of the proposed reformulation is always convex. We also provide sufficient conditions under which the objective function of the proposed reformulation is guaranteed to be convex. The conditions provided both unify and generalize many existing conditions for convexity in the literature.</description>

      <title>Fair Generalized Linear Mixed Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09273v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When using machine learning for automated prediction, it is important to account for fairness in the prediction. Fairness in machine learning aims to ensure that biases in the data and model inaccuracies do not lead to discriminatory decisions. E.g., predictions from fair machine learning models should not discriminate against sensitive variables such as sexual orientation and ethnicity. The training data often in obtained from social surveys. In social surveys, oftentimes the data collection process is a strata sampling, e.g. due to cost restrictions. In strata samples, the assumption of independence between the observation is not fulfilled. Hence, if the machine learning models do not account for the strata correlations, the results may be biased. Especially high is the bias in cases where the strata assignment is correlated to the variable of interest. We present in this paper an algorithm that can handle both problems simultaneously, and we demonstrate the impact of stratified sampling on the quality of fair machine learning predictions in a reproducible simulation study.</description>

      <title>Discrete Variable Topology Optimization Using Multi-Cut Formulation and Adaptive Trust Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new framework for solving general topology optimization (TO) problems that find an optimal material distribution within a design space to maximize the performance of a structure while satisfying design constraints. These problems involve state variables that nonlinearly depend on the design variables, with objective functions that can be convex or non-convex, and may include multiple candidate materials. The framework is designed to greatly enhance computational efficiency, primarily by diminishing optimization iteration counts and thereby reducing the solving of associated state-equilibrium partial differential equations (PDEs). It maintains binary design variables and addresses the large-scale mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem that arises from discretizing the design space and PDEs. The core of this framework is the integration of the generalized Benders' decomposition and adaptive trust regions. The trust-region radius adapts based on a merit function. To mitigate ill-conditioning due to extreme parameter values, we further introduce a parameter relaxation scheme where two parameters are relaxed in stages at different paces. Numerical tests validate the framework's superior performance, including minimum compliance and compliant mechanism problems in single-material and multi-material designs. We compare our results with those of other methods and demonstrate significant reductions in optimization iterations by about one order of magnitude, while maintaining comparable optimal objective function values. As the design variables and constraints increase, the framework maintains consistent solution quality and efficiency, underscoring its good scalability. We anticipate this framework will be especially advantageous for TO applications involving substantial design variables and constraints and requiring significant computational resources for PDE solving.</description>

      <title>Gradient Normalization Provably Benefits Nonconvex SGD under Heavy-Tailed Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the roles of gradient normalization and clipping in ensuring the convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) under heavy-tailed noise. While existing approaches consider gradient clipping indispensable for SGD convergence, we theoretically demonstrate that gradient normalization alone without clipping is sufficient to ensure convergence. Furthermore, we establish that combining gradient normalization with clipping offers significantly improved convergence rates compared to using either technique in isolation, notably as gradient noise diminishes. With these results, our work provides the first theoretical evidence demonstrating the benefits of gradient normalization in SGD under heavy-tailed noise. Finally, we introduce an accelerated SGD variant incorporating gradient normalization and clipping, further enhancing convergence rates under heavy-tailed noise.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of a perturbed quintic defocusing Schr\"odinger equation in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article addresses the stabilizability of a perturbed quintic defocusing Schr\"odinger equation in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ at the $H^1$--energy level, considering the influence of a damping mechanism. More specifically, we establish a profile decomposition for both linear and nonlinear systems and use them to show that, under certain conditions, the sequence of nonlinear solutions can be effectively linearized. Lastly, through microlocal analysis techniques, we prove the local exponential stabilization of the solution to the perturbed Schr\"odinger equation in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ showing an observability inequality for the solution of the system under consideration, which is the key result of this work.</description>
