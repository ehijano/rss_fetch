      <title>Quantum AI for Alzheimer's disease early screening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is a new research field combining quantum information science and machine learning. Quantum computing technologies seem to be particularly well suited to solving problems in the health sector in an efficient way, because they may deal with large datasets more efficiently than classical AI.
  Alzheimer's disease is a neurodegenerative brain disorder that mostly affects elderly people, causing important cognitive impairments. It is the most common cause of dementia and it has an effect on memory, thought, learning abilities and movement control. This type of disease has no cure, consequently an early diagnosis is fundamental for reducing its impact. The analysis of handwriting can be effective for diagnosing, as many researches have conjectured. The DARWIN (Diagnosis AlzheimeR WIth haNdwriting) dataset contains handwriting samples from people affected by Alzheimer's disease and a group of healthy people. Here we apply quantum AI to this use-case. In particular, we use this dataset to test kernel methods for classification task and compare their performances with the ones obtained via quantum machine learning methods. We find that quantum and classical algorithms achieve similar performances and in some cases quantum methods perform even better.
  Our results pave the way for future new quantum machine learning applications in early-screening diagnostics in the healthcare domain.</description>

      <title>QSimPy: A Learning-centric Simulation Framework for Quantum Cloud Resource Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum cloud computing is an emerging computing paradigm that allows seamless access to quantum hardware as cloud-based services. However, effective use of quantum resources is challenging and necessitates robust simulation frameworks for effective resource management design and evaluation. To address this need, we proposed QSimPy, a novel discrete-event simulation framework designed with the main focus of facilitating learning-centric approaches for quantum resource management problems in cloud environments. Underpinned by extensibility, compatibility, and reusability principles, QSimPy provides a lightweight simulation environment based on SimPy, a well-known Python-based simulation engine for modeling dynamics of quantum cloud resources and task operations. We integrate the Gymnasium environment into our framework to support the creation of simulated environments for developing and evaluating reinforcement learning-based techniques for optimizing quantum cloud resource management. The QSimPy framework encapsulates the operational intricacies of quantum cloud environments, supporting research in dynamic task allocation and optimization through DRL approaches. We also demonstrate the use of QSimPy in developing reinforcement learning policies for quantum task placement problems, demonstrating its potential as a useful framework for future quantum cloud research.</description>

      <title>Computing Threshold Circuits with Bimolecular Void Reactions in Step Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Step Chemical Reaction Networks (step CRNs) are an augmentation of the Chemical Reaction Network (CRN) model where additional species may be introduced to the system in a sequence of ``steps.'' We study step CRN systems using a weak subset of reaction rules, \emph{void} rules, in which molecular species can only be deleted. We demonstrate that step CRNs with only void rules of size (2,0) can simulate threshold formulas (TFs) under linear resources. These limited systems can also simulate threshold \emph{circuits} (TCs) by modifying the volume of the system to be exponential. We then prove a matching exponential lower bound on the required volume for simulating threshold circuits in a step CRN with (2,0)-size rules under a restricted \emph{gate-wise} simulation, thus showing our construction is optimal for simulating circuits in this way.</description>

      <title>Leverage Multi-source Traffic Demand Data Fusion with Transformer Model for Urban Parking Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The escalation in urban private car ownership has worsened the urban parking predicament, necessitating effective parking availability prediction for urban planning and management. However, the existing prediction methods suffer from low prediction accuracy with the lack of spatial-temporal correlation features related to parking volume, and neglect of flow patterns and correlations between similar parking lots within certain areas. To address these challenges, this study proposes a parking availability prediction framework integrating spatial-temporal deep learning with multi-source data fusion, encompassing traffic demand data from multiple sources (e.g., metro, bus, taxi services), and parking lot data. The framework is based on the Transformer as the spatial-temporal deep learning model and leverages K-means clustering to establish parking cluster zones, extracting and integrating traffic demand characteristics from various transportation modes (i.e., metro, bus, online ride-hailing, and taxi) connected to parking lots. Real-world empirical data was used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method compared with different machine learning, deep learning, and traditional statistical models for predicting parking availability. Experimental results reveal that, with the proposed pipeline, the developed Transformer model outperforms other models in terms of various metrics, e.g., Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). By fusing multi-source demanding data with spatial-temporal deep learning techniques, this approach offers the potential to develop parking availability prediction systems that furnish more accurate and timely information to both drivers and urban planners, thereby fostering more efficient and sustainable urban mobility.</description>

      <title>Towards Optimising EEG Decoding using Post-hoc Explanations and Domain Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoding EEG during motor imagery is pivotal for the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system, influencing its overall performance significantly. As end-to-end data-driven learning methods advance, the challenge lies in balancing model complexity with the need for human interpretability and trust. Despite strides in EEG-based BCIs, challenges like artefacts and low signal-to-noise ratio emphasise the ongoing importance of model transparency. This work proposes using post-hoc explanations to interpret model outcomes and validate them against domain knowledge. Leveraging the GradCAM post-hoc explanation technique on the motor imagery dataset, this work demonstrates that relying solely on accuracy metrics may be inadequate to ensure BCI performance and acceptability. A model trained using all EEG channels of the dataset achieves 72.60% accuracy, while a model trained with motor-imagery/movement-relevant channel data has a statistically insignificant decrease of 1.75%. However, the relevant features for both are very different based on neurophysiological facts. This work demonstrates that integrating domain-specific knowledge with XAI techniques emerges as a promising paradigm for validating the neurophysiological basis of model outcomes in BCIs. Our results reveal the significance of neurophysiological validation in evaluating BCI performance, highlighting the potential risks of exclusively relying on performance metrics when selecting models for dependable and transparent BCIs.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Spatial Domain Explanations in BCI using Earth Mover's Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems facilitate unique communication between humans and computers, benefiting severely disabled individuals. Despite decades of research, BCIs are not fully integrated into clinical and commercial settings. It's crucial to assess and explain BCI performance, offering clear explanations for potential users to avoid frustration when it doesn't work as expected. This work investigates the efficacy of different deep learning and Riemannian geometry-based classification models in the context of motor imagery (MI) based BCI using electroencephalography (EEG). We then propose an optimal transport theory-based approach using earth mover's distance (EMD) to quantify the comparison of the feature relevance map with the domain knowledge of neuroscience. For this, we utilized explainable AI (XAI) techniques for generating feature relevance in the spatial domain to identify important channels for model outcomes. Three state-of-the-art models are implemented - 1) Riemannian geometry-based classifier, 2) EEGNet, and 3) EEG Conformer, and the observed trend in the model's accuracy across different architectures on the dataset correlates with the proposed feature relevance metrics. The models with diverse architectures perform significantly better when trained on channels relevant to motor imagery than data-driven channel selection. This work focuses attention on the necessity for interpretability and incorporating metrics beyond accuracy, underscores the value of combining domain knowledge and quantifying model interpretations with data-driven approaches in creating reliable and robust Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs).</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Quantum Annealers with Near-Optimal Minor-Embedded Instances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Benchmarking Quantum Process Units (QPU) at an application level usually requires considering the whole programming stack of the quantum computer. One critical task is the minor-embedding (resp. transpilation) step, which involves space-time overheads for annealing-based (resp. gate-based) quantum computers. This paper establishes a new protocol to generate graph instances with their associated near-optimal minor-embedding mappings to D-Wave Quantum Annealers (QA). This set of favorable mappings is used to generate a wide diversity of optimization problem instances. We use this method to benchmark QA on large instances of unconstrained and constrained optimization problems and compare the performance of the QPU with efficient classical solvers. The benchmark aims to evaluate and quantify the key characteristics of instances that could benefit from the use of a quantum computer. In this context, existing QA seem best suited for unconstrained problems on instances with densities less than $10\%$. For constrained problems, the penalty terms used to encode the hard constraints restrict the performance of QA and suggest that these QPU will be less efficient on these problems of comparable size.</description>

Abstract: Photonic reservoir computing has been successfully utilized in time-series prediction as the need for hardware implementations has increased. Prediction of chaotic time series remains a significant challenge, an area where the conventional reservoir computing framework encounters limitations of prediction accuracy. We introduce an attention mechanism to the reservoir computing model in the output stage. This attention layer is designed to prioritize distinct features and temporal sequences, thereby substantially enhancing the prediction accuracy. Our results show that a photonic reservoir computer enhanced with the attention mechanism exhibits improved prediction capabilities for smaller reservoirs. These advancements highlight the transformative possibilities of reservoir computing for practical applications where accurate prediction of chaotic time series is crucial.</description>

      <title>QuERLoc: Towards Next-Generation Localization with Quantum-Enhanced Ranging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Remarkable advances have been achieved in localization techniques in past decades, rendering it one of the most important technologies indispensable to our daily lives. In this paper, we investigate a novel localization approach for future computing by presenting QuERLoc, the first study on localization using quantum-enhanced ranging. By fine-tuning the evolution of an entangled quantum probe, quantum ranging can output the information integrated in the probe as a specific mapping of distance-related parameters. QuERLoc is inspired by this unique property to measure a special combination of distances between a target sensor and multiple anchors within one single physical measurement. Leveraging this capability, QuERLoc settles two drawbacks of classical localization approaches: (i) the target-anchor distances must be measured individually and sequentially, and (ii) the resulting optimization problems are non-convex and are sensitive to noise. We first present the theoretical formulation of preparing the probing quantum state and controlling its dynamic to induce a convexified localization problem, and then solve it efficiently via optimization. We conduct extensive numerical analysis of QuERLoc under various settings. The results show that QuERLoc consistently outperforms classical approaches in accuracy and closely follows the theoretical lowerbound, while maintaining low time complexity. It achieves a minimum reduction of 73% in RMSE and 97.6% in time consumption compared to baselines. By introducing range-based quantum localization to the mobile computing community and showing its superior performance, QuERLoc sheds light on next-generation localization technologies and opens up new directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Design and execution of quantum circuits using tens of superconducting qubits and thousands of gates for dense Ising optimization problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.12423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a hardware-efficient ansatz for variational optimization, derived from existing ansatze in the literature, that parametrizes subsets of all interactions in the Cost Hamiltonian in each layer. We treat gate orderings as a variational parameter and observe that doing so can provide significant performance boosts in experiments. We carried out experimental runs of a compilation-optimized implementation of fully-connected Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Hamiltonians on a 50-qubit linear-chain subsystem of Rigetti Aspen-M-3 transmon processor. Our results indicate that, for the best circuit designs tested, the average performance at optimized angles and gate orderings increases with circuit depth (using more parameters), despite the presence of a high level of noise. We report performance significantly better than using a random guess oracle for circuits involving up to approx 5000 two-qubit and approx 5000 one-qubit native gates. We additionally discuss various takeaways of our results toward more effective utilization of current and future quantum processors for optimization.</description>

      <title>Learning finitely correlated states: stability of the spectral reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that marginals of blocks of $t$ systems of any finitely correlated translation invariant state on a chain can be learned, in trace distance, with $O(t^2)$ copies -- with an explicit dependence on local dimension, memory dimension and spectral properties of a certain map constructed from the state -- and computational complexity polynomial in $t$. The algorithm requires only the estimation of a marginal of a controlled size, in the worst case bounded by the minimum bond dimension, from which it reconstructs a translation invariant matrix product operator. In the analysis, a central role is played by the theory of operator systems. A refined error bound can be proven for $C^*$-finitely correlated states, which have an operational interpretation in terms of sequential quantum channels applied to the memory system. We can also obtain an analogous error bound for a class of matrix product density operators reconstructible by local marginals. In this case, a linear number of marginals must be estimated, obtaining a sample complexity of $\tilde{O}(t^3)$. The learning algorithm also works for states that are only close to a finitely correlated state, with the potential of providing competitive algorithms for other interesting families of states.</description>
