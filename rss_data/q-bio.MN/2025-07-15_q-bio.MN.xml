      <title>MiNAA-WebApp: A Web-Based Tool for the Visualization and Analysis of Microbiome Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microbial networks, representing microbes as nodes and their interactions as edges, are crucial for understanding community dynamics in various environments. Analyzing microbiome networks is crucial for identifying keystone taxa that play central roles in maintaining microbial community structure and function, assessing how environmental changes such as pollution, climate shifts, or land use affect microbial dynamics, tracking disease progression by revealing alterations in microbial interactions over time, and predicting microbial community responses to interventions such as antibiotics, probiotics, or changes in diet and habitat. The complexity of microbial interactions necessitates the use of computational tools such as the MiNAA-WebApp, available at https://minaa.wid.wisc.edu, which enhances the accessibility of the Microbiome Network Alignment Algorithm MiNAA. This tool allows researchers to align microbial networks and explore ecological relationships and community dynamics without extensive computational skills. Originally, MiNAA's command-line interface limited its usability for those without programming backgrounds. The web-based MiNAA-WebApp addresses this shortcoming by offering an intuitive interface with visualization tools, allowing easy exploration and analysis of microbial networks. The web app is designed for microbiome networks but also applicable to other biological networks, broadening its use in computational biology and making network-based research accessible to a wider audience.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy of Zero-one Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09272v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zero-one biochemical reaction networks are widely recognized for their importance in analyzing signal transduction and cellular decision-making processes. Degenerate networks reveal non-standard behaviors and mark the boundary where classical methods fail. Their analysis is key to understanding exceptional dynamical phenomena in biochemical systems. Therefore, we focus on investigating the degeneracy of zero-one reaction networks. It is known that one-dimensional zero-one networks cannot degenerate. In this work, we identify all degenerate two-dimensional zero-one reaction networks with up to three species by an efficient algorithm. By analyzing the structure of these networks, we arrive at the following conclusion: if a two-dimensional zero-one reaction network with three species is degenerate, then its steady-state system is equivalent to a binomial system.</description>

      <title>Towards Interpretable Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction: A Graph-Based Approach with Molecular and Network-Level Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) represent a critical challenge in pharmacology, often leading to adverse drug reactions with significant implications for patient safety and healthcare outcomes. While graph-based methods have achieved strong predictive performance, most approaches treat drug pairs independently, overlooking the complex, context-dependent interactions unique to drug pairs. Additionally, these models struggle to integrate biological interaction networks and molecular-level structures to provide meaningful mechanistic insights. In this study, we propose MolecBioNet, a novel graph-based framework that integrates molecular and biomedical knowledge for robust and interpretable DDI prediction. By modeling drug pairs as unified entities, MolecBioNet captures both macro-level biological interactions and micro-level molecular influences, offering a comprehensive perspective on DDIs. The framework extracts local subgraphs from biomedical knowledge graphs and constructs hierarchical interaction graphs from molecular representations, leveraging classical graph neural network methods to learn multi-scale representations of drug pairs. To enhance accuracy and interpretability, MolecBioNet introduces two domain-specific pooling strategies: context-aware subgraph pooling (CASPool), which emphasizes biologically relevant entities, and attention-guided influence pooling (AGIPool), which prioritizes influential molecular substructures. The framework further employs mutual information minimization regularization to enhance information diversity during embedding fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that MolecBioNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods in DDI prediction, while ablation studies and embedding visualizations further validate the advantages of unified drug pair modeling and multi-scale knowledge integration.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph-Based Models of Random Chemical Reaction Networks: Conservation Laws, Connectivity, and Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random graph models have been instrumental in characterizing complex networks, but chemical reaction networks (CRNs) are better represented as hypergraphs. Traditional models of random CRNs often reduce CRNs to bipartite graphs, representing species and reactions as distinct nodes, or simpler derived graphs, which can obscure the relationship between the statistical properties of these representations and the physical characteristics of the CRN. We introduce a straightforward model for generating random CRNs that preserves their hypergraph structure as well as atomic composition, enabling the direct study of chemically relevant features. Notably, our approach distinguishes two notions of connectivity that are equivalent in graphs but differ fundamentally in hypergraphs. These notions exhibit percolation-like phase transitions, which we analyze in detail. The first type of connectivity has relevance to steady-state synthesis and transduction, determining the effective reactions an open CRN can perform at steady state. The second type is suitable to identify which species can be produced from a given initial set of species in a closed CRN. Our findings highlight the importance of hypergraph-based modeling for uncovering the complex behaviors of CRNs.</description>

      <title>Spectral Manifold Harmonization for Graph Imbalanced Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph-structured data is ubiquitous in scientific domains, where models often face imbalanced learning settings. In imbalanced regression, domain preferences focus on specific target value ranges that represent the most scientifically valuable cases; however, we observe a significant lack of research regarding this challenge. In this paper, we present Spectral Manifold Harmonization (SMH), a novel approach to address imbalanced regression challenges on graph-structured data by generating synthetic graph samples that preserve topological properties while focusing on the most relevant target distribution regions. Conventional methods fail in this context because they either ignore graph topology in case generation or do not target specific domain ranges, resulting in models biased toward average target values. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of SMH on chemistry and drug discovery benchmark datasets, showing consistent improvements in predictive performance for target domain ranges.
