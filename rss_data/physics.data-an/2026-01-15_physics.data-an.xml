      <title>GenL: An extensible fitting program for Laue oscillations and whole pattern fitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13539v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: GenL is a flexible program that can be used to simulate and/or fit X-ray reflectivity and X-ray diffraction data from epitaxial thin films exhibiting, for example, Laue oscillations. It utilizes a differential evolution within a genetic algorithm for fitting data and uses a modular approach based on either the kinematic theory of diffraction or the dynamic theory. Effects of polarization, absorption, the Lorentz factor, as well as instrumental resolution and lattice vibrations are taken into account. Useful parameters that can be extracted after fitting include atomic interplanar spacings, number of coherently scattering atomic planes, strain profiles along the film thickness, and crystal roughness. The program has been developed in MATLAB and employs a graphical user interface. The deployment strategy is twofold, whereby the software can either be obtained in source code form and executed within the MATLAB environment, or as a pre-compiled binary for those who prefer not to run it within MATLAB. Finally, GenL can be easily extended to simulate multilayered film systems, superlattices, and films with atomic steps. The program is released under the GNU General Public License.</description>

      <title>Reproducing the first and second moment of empirical degree distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10373v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of probabilistic models for the analysis of complex networks represents a flourishing research field. Among the former, Exponential Random Graphs (ERGs) have gained increasing attention over the years. So far, only linear ERGs have been extensively employed to gain insight into the structural organisation of real-world complex networks. None, however, is capable of accounting for the variance of the empirical degree distribution. To this aim, non-linear ERGs must be considered. After showing that the usual mean-field approximation forces the degree-corrected version of the two-star model to degenerate, we define a fitness-induced variant of it. Such a `softened' model is capable of reproducing the sample variance, while retaining the explanatory power of its linear counterpart, within a purely canonical framework.</description>

      <title>Scaling intra-urban climate fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19998v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Urban-induced changes in local microclimate, such as urban heat islands and air pollution, are known to vary with city size, leading to distinctive relations between average climate variables and city-scale quantities (e.g., total population). However, these approaches suffer from biases related to the choice of city boundaries and they neglect intra-urban variations of urban characteristics. Here, we use high-resolution data of urban temperatures, air quality, population, and street networks from 142 cities worldwide and show that their marginal and joint probability distributions collapse onto a set of general scaling functions. Using a logarithmic relation between urban spatial features and climate variables, we find that average street network properties are sufficient to characterize the entire variability of the temperature and air pollution fields observed within and across cities. These findings provide a unified statistical framework for characterizing intra-urban climate variability, with important implications for climate modeling and urban planning.</description>
