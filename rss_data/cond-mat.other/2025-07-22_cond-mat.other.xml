      <title>Sustained Amplification of Coherent Spin Waves by Parametric Pumping with Surface Acoustic Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametric amplification offers a route to overcoming intrinsic damping in spin-wave systems, a key challenge in the development of magnonic signal processing and computing technologies. Here we demonstrate the sustained amplification of coherent forward volume magnetostatic spin waves in a yttrium-iron-garnet thin film using a traveling surface acoustic wave as a nonstationary pump. A gain of up to 6 dB is achieved under continuous pumping below the threshold for parametric instability. The interaction generates an idler wave at a distinct frequency, consistent with three-wave mixing governed by energy and momentum conservation. This approach enables stable, frequency- and wavevector-selective spin-wave gain using practical pump power levels, establishing acoustic wave pumping as a viable mechanism for realizing active components in integrated magnonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Vortices in dipolar condensates of interlayer excitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently observed signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation and superfluidity of dipolar excitons have drawn enormous attention to excitonic semiconductor bilayers. In superfluids, stabilization and observation of vortex matter is usually a decisive proof of coherent condensation order. However to date, the vortex behavior in a 2D excitonic system with aligned dipole-like interactions that are long-range and everywhere repulsive has not been addressed. We here provide a theoretical description of the vortex characteristics, interaction, and lattices in a dipolar exciton superfluid, solving the corresponding Gross-Pitaevskii equation, while varying the exciton dipole moments and the exciton density - both tunable in the experiment, by interlayer separation and gating, respectively. We draw particular attention to the appearance of a maximum in the density redistribution around the edge of each vortex, in the phase-space region where the dipole interactions are particularly strong, and where a transition to an incompressible exciton supersolid is expected.</description>

      <title>A Lattice Physics Approach to Spin-Networks in Loop Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we model a spin-network in loop quantum gravity as a regular tetrahedral lattice, applying lattice physics techniques to study its structure and vertex dynamics. Using the area eigenvalue, $A\propto 8\pi l_P^2$, we derive a lattice constant $a = 2.707\,l_P$ and construct a vertex Hamiltonian incorporating a Lennard-Jones potential, zero-point energy, and simple harmonic oscillations. A foliation approach enforces the Wheeler-DeWitt constraint via locally non-zero Hamiltonians that globally cancel. Graviton-like perturbations (treated here as spin-0 bosons) modify the vertex energy spectrum, with variational analysis suggesting twelve coherent excitations per vertex. This model frames flat spacetime as a graviton-rich lattice while enforcing a Brownian-like stochastic picture for the gravitons, and offers a basis for extension into curved quantum geometries.</description>

      <title>Rigorous lower bound on dynamical exponents in gapless frustration-free systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work rigorously establishes a universal lower bound $z\ge2$ for the dynamical exponent in frustration-free quantum many-body systems whose ground states exhibit power-law decaying correlations. The derivation relies on the Gosset-Huang inequality, providing a unified framework applicable across various lattice structures and spatial dimensions, independent of specific boundary conditions. Remarkably, our result can be applied to prove new bounds for dynamics of classical stochastic processes. Specifically, we utilize a well-established mapping from the time evolution of local Markov processes with detailed balance to that of frustration-free quantum Hamiltonians, known as Rokhsar-Kivelson Hamiltonians. This proves $z \ge 2$ for such Markov processes, which is an improvement over existing bounds. Beyond these applications, the quantum analysis of the $z\ge2$ bound is further broadened to include systems exhibiting hidden correlations, which may not be evident from purely local operators.</description>

      <title>Universal path decomposition of transfer and scattering matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04822v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a universal identity: any entry of a one-dimensional transfer or scattering matrix comprising N layers equals a coherent sum of 2**(N-1) directed paths representing wave patterns with pre-defined amplitude and phase evolutions. Treating those paths as analytic building blocks, we derive closed-form results for arbitrary stratified media - optical, acoustic, elastic, or electronic - without resorting to matrix products or recursion. The combinatorial construction of paths turns layered system design into rule-based path engineering, illustrated with a design example that offers a reinterpretation of the quarter-wavelength principle. We also quantify the computational speed-up of the path method over classical transfer-matrix chaining and showcase two more cross-disciplinary applications (site-response seismology and quantum superlattices). This paradigm replaces numerical sweeps that employ the transfer matrix method with physically-transparent path-construction rules; its applicability spans across physical disciplines and scales: from nanometer optical coatings to kilometer-scale seismic strata.</description>

      <title>Unusual Electron-Phonon Interactions in Highly Anisotropic Two-Dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) represent a fundamental cornerstone of condensed matter physics, commanding persistent attention due to their pivotal role in driving novel quantum phenomena within low-dimensional materials. Here, we unveil unusual anisotropic electron-phonon coupling behaviors in quasi-one-dimensional $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ nano-flakes through a powerful combination of angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy and density functional perturbation theory (DFPT). High-resolution transmission electron microscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy directly visualize the pronounced quasi-one-dimensional atomic chains within the crystal structure, establishing a structural foundation for the observed anisotropic interactions. Our Raman investigations reveal remarkable polarization-dependent responses in $A_g$ phonon modes that deviate significantly from conventional behavior, which our theoretical analyses attribute to complex anisotropic electron-photon and electron-phonon interactions. Temperature-dependent Raman measurements further uncover an intriguing phonon decay mechanism involving both three- and four-phonon processes, with the latter showing significant contributions in some modes - a possible manifestation of strong anisotropic electron-phonon interactions. Beyond revealing $Ta_2$$Ni_3$$Te_5$ as an exceptional platform for exploring anisotropic EPIs, this work demonstrates that integrating angle-resolved polarized Raman spectroscopy with DFPT calculations offers a powerful methodology for investigating electron-phonon interactions in emerging low-dimensional quantum materials.</description>
