      <title>Size and Shape of Jupiter Trojan (2207) Antenor from Stellar Occultations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Librating around the Lagrange L5, the Jupiter's Trojan (2207) Antenor has been observed in recent years and its rotational light curve suggests it to be a very likely binary asteroid candidate. From stellar occultations, we report results from three events from Europe and North America to estimate the 2D apparent size and shape of Jupiter's Trojan (2207) Antenor. For the best-fitted ellipse in the sky-plane, we determined that Antenor has a 2D apparent equatorial radius of 54.30 +/- 0.99 km at the moment of the occultations, with an apparent oblateness of 0.144 +/- 0.051. We highlight the positive detection from 2021 June 12, which shows an intriguing feature that can be interpreted as a very large topographical feature (of about 11 km) of the body or that can provide further evidence that this object is, in fact, a close or contact binary. We also determine astrometric positions, with uncertainties of a few milliarcseconds (mas) for our preferred solutions.</description>

      <title>Eccentric von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai effects under mildly hierarchical triple systems: Influence of Brown corrections upon orbit flipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mildly hierarchical three-body systems are widespread in the Universe, exemplified by planets in stellar binaries and stars in black-hole binaries. In such systems, Brown Hamiltonian corrections play a crucial role in governing the long-term dynamical evolution. In this work, we extend Brown corrections to include octupole-order coupling terms, thereby formulating a more accurate dynamical model for predicting long-term dynamical behaviors. The utilization of the gauge freedom in canonical transformation shows that the quadrupole-octupole coupling term vanishes and the octupole-octupole coupling term is axisymmetric. Under triple systems with different levels of hierarchies, we systematically investigate the impact of Brown corrections on orbital flipping induced by the eccentric von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) mechanism. Our analysis reveals that, as the hierarchy of triple systems becomes lower, the asymmetry in the flipping regions becomes more significant. The asymmetric structures are examined in detail using Poincare sections and perturbative techniques, showing that Brown corrections are the key factor responsible for breaking the symmetry of flipping regions. Finally, we extend the classical pendulum approximation to our refined model and demonstrate that its analytical predictions agree remarkably well with those derived from perturbative methods, particularly in the high-eccentricity regime.</description>

      <title>Magnetic effect on the evolution of an eccentric and inclined orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a method to calculate the evolution of an eccentric and inclined orbit under the magnetic effect. Taking the unipolar interaction as an example, we study both coplanar and inclined orbits. We calculate the Lorentz force and then the changes in orbital energy and angular momentum. Combined with the total energy dissipation we write down the evolution equations of semi-major axis, eccentricity, inclination and spin. This set of equations can be used to study the orbital and spin evolution under the magnetic interaction.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Different Haze Types on the Atmosphere and Observations of Hot Jupiters: 3D Simulations of HD 189733b, HD209458b and WASP-39b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results from the simulations of the atmospheres of hot-Jupiters HD189733b, HD209458b and WASP-39b, assuming the presence of three different types of haze. Using a 3D General Circulation Model, the Unified Model, we capture the advection, settling and radiative impact of Titan-like, water-world-like and soot-like haze, with a particle radius of 1.5 nm. We show that the radiative impact of haze leads to drastic changes in the thermal structure and circulation in the atmosphere. We then show that in all our simulations, 1) the superrotating jet largely determines the day-to-night haze distribution, 2) eddies drive the latitudinal haze distribution, and 3) the divergent and eddy component of the wind control the finer structure of the haze distribution. We further show that the stronger the absorption strength of the haze, the stronger the superrotating jet, lesser the difference of the day-to-night haze distribution, and larger the transit depth in the synthetic transmission spectrum. We also demonstrate that the presence of such small hazes could result in a stronger haze opacity over the morning terminator in all three planets. This could lead to an observable terminator asymmetry in WASP-39b, with the morning terminator presenting a larger transit depth than the evening terminator. This work suggests that, although it might not be a typical detection feature for hot-Jupiters, an observed increase in transit depth over the morning terminator across the UV and optical wavelength regime could serve as a strong indicator of the presence of haze.</description>

      <title>Observability of radio reflections from exoplanet ionospheres with next generation radio telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much has been learned about exoplanets and their atmospheres in the last three decades with the help of highly sensitive optical telescopes. Limited observations using X-ray telescopes have revealed the presence of ionospheres with very high density plasma around the hot Jupiter HD189733b. Owing to high density, the cutoff frequency of this plasma would lie in the range of few GHz. As the planet goes around the star, we suggest it might be possible to capture the stellar radio emission reflected from the ionosphere of the planet. We find that the reflected spectrum has a slope which is representative of the plasma density profile of the ionosphere and has a cutoff frequency. After investigating the reflection and free-free absorption process in the ionosphere, we find that this reflected signal, though feeble, can be captured by very sensitive radio telescopes operating in the low frequency range. We estimate the reflected signal from the ionosphere of a hot Jupiter and find that the flux ratio of the planet to the star are about $\sim 0.01\%$. In the view of development of facilities like Square Kilometer Array, it might be possible to capture the reflected radio signal from the ionosphere and constrain the thermal state of the ionosphere.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Detection Using Machine Learning Models Trained on Synthetic Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With manual searching processes, the rate at which scientists and astronomers discover exoplanets is slow because of inefficiencies that require an extensive time of laborious inspections. In fact, as of now there have been about only 5,000 confirmed exoplanets since the late 1900s. Recently, machine learning (ML) has proven to be extremely valuable and efficient in various fields, capable of processing massive amounts of data in addition to increasing its accuracy by learning. Though ML models for discovering exoplanets owned by large corporations (e.g. NASA) exist already, they largely depend on complex algorithms and supercomputers. In an effort to reduce such complexities, in this paper, we report the results and potential benefits of various, well-known ML models in the discovery and validation of extrasolar planets. The ML models that are examined in this study include logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, and random forest. The dataset on which the models train and predict is acquired from NASA's Kepler space telescope. The initial results show promising scores for each model. However, potential biases and dataset imbalances necessitate the use of data augmentation techniques to further ensure fairer predictions and improved generalization. This study concludes that, in the context of searching for exoplanets, data augmentation techniques significantly improve the recall and precision, while the accuracy varies for each model.</description>

      <title>Comparing Behavioural Cloning and Reinforcement Learning for Spacecraft Guidance and Control Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Guidance &amp; control networks (G&amp;CNETs) provide a promising alternative to on-board guidance and control (G&amp;C) architectures for spacecraft, offering a differentiable, end-to-end representation of the guidance and control architecture. When training G&amp;CNETs, two predominant paradigms emerge: behavioural cloning (BC), which mimics optimal trajectories, and reinforcement learning (RL), which learns optimal behaviour through trials and errors. Although both approaches have been adopted in G&amp;CNET related literature, direct comparisons are notably absent. To address this, we conduct a systematic evaluation of BC and RL specifically for training G&amp;CNETs on continuous-thrust spacecraft trajectory optimisation tasks. We introduce a novel RL training framework tailored to G&amp;CNETs, incorporating decoupled action and control frequencies alongside reward redistribution strategies to stabilise training and to provide a fair comparison. Our results show that BC-trained G&amp;CNETs excel at closely replicating expert policy behaviour, and thus the optimal control structure of a deterministic environment, but can be negatively constrained by the quality and coverage of the training dataset. In contrast RL-trained G&amp;CNETs, beyond demonstrating a superior adaptability to stochastic conditions, can also discover solutions that improve upon suboptimal expert demonstrations, sometimes revealing globally optimal strategies that eluded the generation of training samples.</description>

      <title>Transmission of the AtmosPhere for AStronomical data: TAPAS upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art molecular databases and realistic global atmospheric models allow to predict accurate atmospheric transmittance spectra. The TAPAS online service provides atmospheric transmittance spectra of the most important species as well as Rayleigh extinction, adapted to any observing location, date, and direction. We describe recent updates, improvements, and additional tools. TAPAS is interpolating in location in the atmospheric profiles of temperature, pressure, H2O, O2 and O3 extracted from the ECMWF and produced by Arletty, a Data Terra/AERIS/ESPRI product, supplemented by auxiliary climatological models for additional species. The transmittance spectra are computed with the LBLRTM code. The resolution is chosen to ensure that the shapes of all absorption lines are reproduced for each species. Major improvements are: - the extension of the wavelength range in the near-UV down to 300 nm; in the near-IR up to 3500 nm; - the use of HITRAN2020; - the addition of NO2, to complement H2O, O2, O3, N2O, CO2 and CH4; - an increased accessibility; -the possibility to force the total H2O column to match the one measured at the observatory. We show O3 absorption in the near-UV and near-IR and NO2 absorption in the visible. We illustrate the quality of TAPAS by means of comparisons between models and ESO/VLT/CRIRES recorded spectra of a hot star with spectral resolution 130,000, in two intervals with strong H2O, NO2, CO2 and CH4 absorption. We describe the measurement of an instrumental Line Spread Function (LSF) based on TAPAS O2 lines and a method using the Singular Value Decomposition technique that can be made entirely automated. TAPAS can be used to improve the wavelength and to measure the LSF in regions where telluric features are present. The extended wavelength range will be particularly useful for future or recent spectrographs in the near-UV and in the near-infrared.</description>

      <title>Thick Disks around White Dwarfs viewed 'Edge-off': Effects on Transit Properties and Infrared Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A significant fraction of white dwarfs (WDs) host dust/debris disks formed from the tidal disruption of asteroids and planetsimals. Several studies indicate that the disks can attain significant vertical heights through collisional cascade. In this work I model the effects of geometrically thick disks on two primary observables: photometric transits by the disk when viewed at high inclinations and infrared dust emission. Specifically, I consider disks with a Gaussian vertical profile with scale heights comparable to or larger than the WD radius. I primarily focus on inclinations $\gtrsim$$87$ degrees ('edge-off'), which can produce significant transits with moderate disk thickness. Both the transit depth and color become strong functions of inclination, and I explore their dependence on the disk parameters. I show that such a setup can produce the recently discovered reddening in the transit of WD J1013$-$0427. Moving to infrared emission, I show that the contribution from the heated inner rim can be substantial even at high inclinations. It can potentially explain the infrared excess observed in two transiting debris systems, WD 1145$+$017 and WD 1232$+$563, consistently with the transits. The other two important radiation components are the optically thin dust emission from the disk's outer layers and the optically thick emission from the backwarmed disk interior. Extending my analysis to G29-38 shows that the former can adequately produce the silicate emission feature. The inner dense layers, on the other hand, allows the disk to contain a large dust mass. Overall, I show that thick disk effects can be significant and should be taken into account. I motivate detailed studies to quantify the effects accurately.</description>

      <title>Methyl Isocyanate Formation from Oxygen Insertion in Methyl Cyanide Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cold molecular clouds, UV photolysis of icy grain mantles generates radicals that lead to new molecule formation. When radical diffusion is limited by low temperatures, oxygen atom addition and insertion reactions, enabled by photolysis of common ice components such as H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CO, and O$_3$, offer an alternative route to chemical complexity through the production of metastable, highly reactive O($^{1}D$) atoms. We examine the reactivity of these oxygen atoms generated by UV photolysis of O$_3$ with methyl cyanide (CH$_3$CN). These studies are conducted in an ultrahigh vacuum chamber at cryogenic and low-pressure conditions equipped with in situ infrared spectroscopy to monitor destruction and product formation in real time. We conclude that oxygen atoms rapidly insert into CH$_3$CN to produce primarily methyl isocyanate (CH$_3$NCO) in matrix free ices. Over the range from 10 K to 40 K, we observe no temperature dependence to either CH$_3$CN destruction or CH$_3$NCO production. When placing CH$_3$CN:O$_3$ in H$_2$O and CO$_2$ ice matrices, we find that CH$_3$NCO formation remains robust, but that the yield likely decreases due to competing reaction pathways. In the case of the H$_2$O ice we also observe a shift in product branching ratios towards alternative pathways such as the formation of hydroxyacetonitrile (HOCH$_2$CN). Overall, our results demonstrate that oxygen atom reactivity provides an important channel for generating chemical complexity from nitriles on cold grains where radical mobility is limited.</description>

      <title>Estimating the potential of ionizing radiation-induced radiolysis for microbial metabolism on terrestrial planets and satellites with rarefied atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.14675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ionizing radiation is known to have a destructive effect on biology by causing damage to the DNA, cells, and production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), among other things. While direct exposure to high radiation dose is indeed not favorable for biological activity, ionizing radiation can, and in some cases is known to produce a number of biologically useful products. One such mechanism is the production of biologically useful products via charged particle-induced radiolysis. Some of the byproducts are impossible to produce with lower-energy radiation (such as sunlight), opening up new avenues for life to utilize them. The main objective of the manuscript is to explore the concept of a Radiolytic Habitable Zone (RHZ), where the chemistry of GCR-induced radiolysis can be potentially utilized for metabolic activity. We first calculate the energy deposition and the electron production rate using the GEANT4 numerical model, then estimate the current production and possible chemical pathways which could be useful for supporting biological activity on Mars, Europa and Enceladus. The concept of RHZ provides a novel framework for understanding the potential for life in high-radiation environments. By combining energy deposition calculations with the energy requirements of microbial cells, we have defined the RHZ for Mars, Europa, and Enceladus. These zones represent the regions where radiolysis-driven energy production is sufficient to sustain microbial metabolism. We find that bacterial cell density is highest in Enceladus, followed by Mars and Europa. We discuss the implications of these mechanisms for the habitability of such objects in the Solar system and beyond.</description>

      <title>Seasonal Changes in the Atmosphere of HD 80606b Observed with JWST's NIRSpec/G395H</title>

Abstract: High-eccentricity gas giant planets serve as unique laboratories for studying the thermal and chemical properties of H/He-dominated atmospheres. One of the most extreme cases is HD 80606b -- a hot Jupiter orbiting a sun-like star with an eccentricity of $0.93$ -- which experiences an increase in incident flux of nearly three orders of magnitude as the star-planet separation decreases from $0.88\,{\rm AU}$ at apoastron to $0.03\,{\rm AU}$ at periastron. We observed the planet's periastron passage using \emph{JWST}'s NIRSpec/G395H instrument ($2.8-5.2\,{\rm \mu m}$) during a $21\,{\rm hr}$ window centered on the eclipse. We find that, as the planet passes through periastron, its emission spectrum transitions from a featureless blackbody to one in which CO, CH$_4$, and H$_2$O absorption features are visible. We detect CH$_4$ during post-periapse phases at $4.1-10.7\sigma$ depending on the phase and on whether a flux offset is included to account for NRS1 detector systematics. Following periapse, H$_2$O and CO are also detected at $4.2-5.5\sigma$ and $3.7-4.4\sigma$, respectively. Furthermore, we rule out the presence of a strong temperature inversion near the IR photosphere based on the lack of obvious emission features throughout the observing window. General circulation models had predicted an inversion during periapse passage. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of studying hot Jupiter atmospheres using partial phase curves obtained with NIRSpec/G395H.</description>

      <title>A Denser Hydrogen Inferred from First-Principles Simulations Challenges Jupiter's Interior Models</title>

Abstract: First-principle modeling of dense hydrogen is crucial in materials and planetary sciences. Despite its apparent simplicity, predicting the ionic and electronic structure of hydrogen is a formidable challenge, and it is connected with the insulator-to-metal transition, a century-old problem in condensed matter. Accurate simulations of liquid hydrogen are also essential for modeling gas giant planets. Here we perform an exhaustive study of the equation of state of hydrogen using Density Functional Theory and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. We find that the pressure predicted by Density Functional Theory may vary qualitatively when using different functionals. The predictive power of first-principle simulations is restored by validating each functional against higher-level wavefunction theories, represented by computationally intensive variational and diffusion Monte Carlo calculations. Our simulations provide evidence that hydrogen is denser at planetary conditions, compared to currently used equations of state. For Jupiter, this implies a lower bulk metallicity (i.e., a smaller mass of heavy elements). Our results further amplify the inconsistency between Jupiter's atmospheric metallicity measured by the Galileo probe and the envelope metallicity inferred from interior models.</description>

      <title>Interior redox state effects on the stability of secondary atmospheres and observational manifestations: LP 791-18 d as a case study for outgassing rocky exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02188</link>

Abstract: Recent advances in space and ground-based facilities now enable atmospheric characterization of a selected sample of rocky exoplanets. These atmospheres offer key insights into planetary formation and evolution, but their interpretation requires models that couple atmospheric processes with both the planetary interior and the surrounding space environment. This work focuses on the Earth-size planet LP791 18d, which is estimated to receive continuous tidal heating due to the orbital configuration of the system; thus, it is expected to exhibit volcanic activity. We estimate the mantle temperature of 1680-1880 K. Our results show that the atmospheric mean molecular weight gradient is controlled by oxygen fugacity rather than bulk metallicity. Furthermore, we use the atmospheric steady-state solutions produced from the interior redox state versus surface pressure parameter space and explore their atmospheric stability. We find that stability is achieved only in highly oxidized scenarios while reduced interior states fall into the hydrodynamic escape regime with mass loss rates on the order of 10^5-10^8 kg/s. We argue that scenarios with reduced interior states are likely to have exhausted their volatile budget during the planets lifetime. Furthermore, we predict the atmospheric footprint of the planets interior based on its oxidation state and assess its detectability using current or forthcoming tools to constrain the internal and atmospheric composition. We show that the degeneracy between bare rock surfaces and thick atmospheres can be resolved by using three photometric bands to construct a color-color diagram that accounts for potential effects from photochemical hazes and clouds. Our modeling approach connects interior and atmospheric processes, providing a basis to explore volatile evolution and potential habitability.</description>

      <title>Assessing interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS with the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12922v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Theories of the formation and evolution of small bodies in planetary systems predict that they may escape into interstellar space at any time. After having characterized just two such interlopers -1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov more questions were raised than answered. Assessing the recently discovered interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS will only broaden our understanding of this complex topic.
  Aims. Here, we investigate the spectral, cometary, and rotational properties of 3I/ATLAS as well as its dynamical context.
  Methods. We identified the spectral type of 3I/ATLAS from the visible reflectance spectrum and used photometric observations to derive its level of activity and rotational properties. Observational data were obtained with the OSIRIS camera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope. We used N-body simulations and statistical analyses of Gaia DR3 data to investigate the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its Galactic background.
  Results. Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has a visible spectrum slightly redder than those of D-type asteroids, 1I/'Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, with a spectral slope of 18.3%/1000 A in the 4000-9000 A range, which is similar to those of TNOs and Centaurs. It has a conspicuous coma and its rotation period is 16.79 h. The heliocentric components of its Galactic velocity were (U, V, W) = (-51.233, -19.456, 18.930) km/s with a radiant in Sagittarius. The analysis of a sample of kinematic analogs of 3I/ATLAS extracted from Gaia DR3 suggests that its parent system is part of the Galactic thin disk and includes a solar-like star with slightly sub-solar metallicity.</description>

      <title>XUE. JWST spectroscopy of externally irradiated disks around young intermediate-mass stars</title>

Abstract: Most young stars and therefore planetary systems form in high-mass star forming regions and are exposed to ultraviolet radiation, affecting the protoplanetary disk. These regions are located at large distances and only now with JWST become accessible to study the inner disks surrounding young stars. We present the eXtreme UV Environments (XUE) program, which provides the first detailed characterization of the physical and chemical properties of the inner disks around young intermediate-mass stars exposed to external irradiation from nearby massive stars. We present high signal to noise MIRI-MRS spectroscopy of 12 disks located in three sub-clusters of the high-mass star-forming region NGC 6357. Based on their mid-infrared spectral energy distribution, we classify the XUE sources into Group I and II based on the Meeus scheme. We analyze their molecular emission features, and compare their spectral indices and 10 $\mu$m silicate emission profiles to those of nearby Herbig and intermediate T Tauri disks. Despite being more massive, the XUE stars host disks with molecular richness comparable to isolated T Tauri systems. The 10 $\mu$m silicate features show lower F$_{11.3}$/F$_{9.8}$ ratios at a given F$_{\mathrm{peak}}$, but current uncertainties prevent conclusions about their inner disk properties. Most disks display water emission from the inner disk, suggesting that even in these extreme environments rocky planets can form in the presence of water. The absence of strong line fluxes and other irradiation signatures suggests that the XUE disks have been truncated by external UV photons. However, this truncation does not appear to significantly impact the chemical richness of their inner regions. These findings indicate that even in extreme environments, IMTT disks can retain the ingredients necessary for rocky planet formation.</description>
