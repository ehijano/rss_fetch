      <title>Puzzle Ideals for Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Puzzles are a versatile combinatorial tool to interpret the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients for Grassmannians. In this paper, we propose the concept of puzzle ideals whose varieties one-one correspond to the tilings of puzzles and present an algebraic framework to construct the puzzle ideals which works with the Knutson-Tao-Woodward puzzle and its $T$-equivariant and $K$-theoretic variants for Grassmannians. For puzzles for which one side is free, we propose the side-free puzzle ideals whose varieties one-one correspond to the tilings of side-free puzzles, and the elimination ideals of the side-free puzzle ideals contain all the information of the structure constants for Grassmannians with respect to the free side.
  Besides the underlying algebraic importance of the introduction of these puzzle ideals is the computational feasibility to find all the tilings of the puzzles for Grassmannians by solving the defining polynomial systems, demonstrated with illustrative puzzles via computation of Gr\"obner bases.</description>

      <title>Combining Neural Networks and Symbolic Regression for Analytical Lyapunov Function Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15675</link>

Abstract: We propose CoNSAL (Combining Neural networks and Symbolic regression for Analytical Lyapunov function) to construct analytical Lyapunov functions for nonlinear dynamic systems. This framework contains a neural Lyapunov function and a symbolic regression component, where symbolic regression is applied to distill the neural network to precise analytical forms. Our approach utilizes symbolic regression not only as a tool for translation but also as a means to uncover counterexamples. This procedure terminates when no counterexamples are found in the analytical formulation. Compared with previous results, CoNSAL directly produces an analytical form of the Lyapunov function with improved interpretability in both the learning process and the final results. We apply CoNSAL to 2-D inverted pendulum, path following, Van Der Pol Oscillator, 3-D trig dynamics, 4-D rotating wheel pendulum, 6-D 3-bus power system, and demonstrate that our algorithm successfully finds their valid Lyapunov functions. Code examples are available at https://github.com/HaohanZou/CoNSAL.</description>

      <title>A Neurosymbolic Approach to Adaptive Feature Extraction in SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous robots, autonomous vehicles, and humans wearing mixed-reality headsets require accurate and reliable tracking services for safety-critical applications in dynamically changing real-world environments. However, the existing tracking approaches, such as Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), do not adapt well to environmental changes and boundary conditions despite extensive manual tuning. On the other hand, while deep learning-based approaches can better adapt to environmental changes, they typically demand substantial data for training and often lack flexibility in adapting to new domains. To solve this problem, we propose leveraging the neurosymbolic program synthesis approach to construct adaptable SLAM pipelines that integrate the domain knowledge from traditional SLAM approaches while leveraging data to learn complex relationships. While the approach can synthesize end-to-end SLAM pipelines, we focus on synthesizing the feature extraction module. We first devise a domain-specific language (DSL) that can encapsulate domain knowledge on the important attributes for feature extraction and the real-world performance of various feature extractors. Our neurosymbolic architecture then undertakes adaptive feature extraction, optimizing parameters via learning while employing symbolic reasoning to select the most suitable feature extractor. Our evaluations demonstrate that our approach, neurosymbolic Feature EXtraction (nFEX), yields higher-quality features. It also reduces the pose error observed for the state-of-the-art baseline feature extractors ORB and SIFT by up to 90% and up to 66%, respectively, thereby enhancing the system's efficiency and adaptability to novel environments.</description>
