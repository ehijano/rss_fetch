      <title>Light-by-light scattering in ultraperipheral collisions of heavy ions with future FoCal and ALICE 3 detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present possible future studies of light-by-light scattering using FoCal@ALICE and ALICE 3 detectors. Different mechanisms are discussed. The PbPb$\to$PbPb$\gamma \gamma$ cross section is calculated within equivalent photon approximation in the impact parameter space. Several differential distributions are presented and discussed.
  We predict cross section in the (mb-b) range for typical ALICE 3 cuts, a few orders of magnitude larger than for the current ATLAS or CMS experiments. We also consider the two-$\pi^0$ background which can, in principle, be eliminated at the new kinematical range for the ALICE 3 measurements by imposing dedicated cuts on diphoton transverse momentum and$\slash$or so-called vector asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Spheroidal expansion and freeze-out geometry of heavy-ion collisions in the few-GeV energy regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.07694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A spheroidal model of the expansion of hadronic matter produced in heavy-ion collisions in the few-GeV energy regime is proposed. It constitutes an extension of the spherically symmetric Siemens-Rasmussen blast-wave model used in our previous works. The spheroidal form of the expansion, combined with a single-freeze-out scenario, allows for a significantly improved description of both the transverse-mass and the rapidity distributions of the produced particles. With the model parameters determined by the hadronic abundances and spectra, we make further predictions of the pion HBT correlation radii that turn out to be in a qualitative agreement with the measured ones. The overall successful description of the data supports the concept of spheroidal symmetry of the produced hadronic systems in this energy range.</description>

      <title>Ab initio investigation of the $^7$Li($p,e^+e^-$)$^8$Be process and the X17 boson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations of anomalies in the electron-positron angular correlations in high-energy decays in $^4$He, $^8$Be, and $^{12}$C have been reported recently by the ATOMKI collaboration. These could be explained by the creation and subsequent decay of a new boson with a mass of ${\sim}17$ MeV. Theoretical understanding of pair creation in the proton capture reactions used in these experiments is important for the interpretation of the anomalies. We apply the ab initio No-Core Shell Model with Continuum (NCSMC) to the proton capture on $^7$Li. The NCSMC describes both bound and unbound states in light nuclei in a unified way with chiral two- and three-nucleon interactions as the only input. We investigate the structure of $^8$Be, the $p+^7$Li elastic scattering, the $^7$Li($p,\gamma$)$^8$Be cross section and the internal pair creation $^7$Li($p,e^+ e^-$)$^8$Be. We discuss the impact of a proper treatment of the initial scattering state on the electron-positron angular correlation spectrum and compare our results to available ATOMKI data sets. Finally, we calculate $^7$Li($p,X$)$^8$Be cross sections for several proposed models of the hypothetical X17 particle.</description>

      <title>$K_{1}^{\pm}$ mesons moving in nuclear matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observing the mass shifts of mesons immersed in nuclear matter is interesting, as the changes are expected to shed light on the effects of chiral symmetry breaking on the origin of hadron masses. At the same time, it is important to understand the momentum dependence of the masses for spin-1 mesons, as the changes manifest differently across the two polarization modes. Here, the mass shifts of $K_{1}^{\pm}$ mesons with finite three-momentum in nuclear medium are studied in the QCD sum rule approach. We find that the mass of $K_{1}^{+}$($K_{1}^{-}$) meson is increased(decreased) by the non-trivial momentum effect in both the transverse and longitudinal modes. Specifically, compared to its rest mass in the nuclear medium, in the transverse mode, the mass of $K_{1}^{+}(K_{1}^{-})$ is observed to shift by +2(-55) MeV, while in the longitudinal mode, the mass shift is +13(-11) MeV, all at a momentum of 0.5 GeV. Exploring the medium modifications of $K_{1}$ meson through kaon beams at J-PARC will provide insights on the partial restoration of chiral symmetry in nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Spin asymmetry and dipole moments in $\tau$-pair production with ultraperipheral heavy ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The anomalous magnetic (MDM) and electric (EDM) dipole moments of the $\tau$ lepton serve as crucial indicators of new physics beyond the Standard Model. Leveraging azimuthal angular asymmetry as a novel tool in ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs), we attain unparalleled precision in the study of these key properties. Driven by the highly linear polarization of coherent photons, this method uniquely enables both the MDM and EDM to contribute to the $\cos2\phi$ angular distribution in similar magnitudes. Importantly, our approach substantially narrows the parameter space, excluding more than half of it compared to expected UPC-based measurements reliant solely on the total cross-section. This method not only provides improved constraints but also minimizes the need for additional theoretical assumptions.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Ginzburg-Landau expansions: superconductivity in the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory and chiral symmetry breaking in the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) expansion in the context of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory for superconductivity and the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model for chiral symmetry breaking at finite temperature $T$ and chemical potential $\mu$. We present derivations of the all-order formulas for the coefficients of the GL expansions in both systems under the mean-field approximation. We show that the convergence radii for the BCS gap $\Delta$ and dynamical quark mass $M$ are given by $\Delta_\text{conv} = \pi T$ and $M_\text{conv} = \sqrt{\mu^2 + (\pi T)^2}$, respectively. We also discuss the implications of these results and the quantitative reliability of the GL expansion near the first-order chiral phase transition.</description>

      <title>Reference Energies for Valence Ionizations and Satellite Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Upon ionization of an atom or a molecule, another electron (or more) can be simultaneously excited. These concurrently generated states are called "satellites" (or shake-up transitions) as they appear in ionization spectra as higher-energy peaks with weaker intensity and larger width than the main peaks associated with single-particle ionizations. Satellites, which correspond to electronically excited states of the cationic species, are notoriously challenging to model using conventional single-reference methods due to their high excitation degree compared to the neutral reference state. This work reports 42 satellite transition energies and 58 valence ionization potentials of full configuration interaction (FCI) quality computed in small molecular systems. Following the protocol developed for the quest database [https://doi.org/10.1002/wcms.1517, V\'eril et al. Wiley Interdiscip. Rev.: Comput. Mol. Sci. 2021, 11, e1517], these reference energies are computed using the configuration interaction using a perturbative selection made iteratively (CIPSI) method. In addition, the accuracy of the well-known coupled-cluster (CC) hierarchy (CC2, CCSD, CC3, CCSDT, CC4, and CCSDTQ) is gauged against these new accurate references. The performances of various approximations based on many-body Green's functions ($GW$, GF2, and $T$-matrix) for ionization potentials are also analyzed. Their limitations in correctly modeling satellite transitions are discussed.</description>

      <title>The collisional energy loss of a heavy-quark in a semi-quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By utilizing a background field effective theory, we compute the collisional energy loss of a heavy-quark moving through a semi-quark-gluon plasma characterized by nontrivial holonomy for Polyakov loops. We consider the elastic scatterings between the incident heavy-quark and the thermal partons with both hard and soft momentum transfers. As compared to the energy loss obtained from the perturbation theory, the hard processes get modified through the thermal distribution functions that depend on the background field, while the proper treatment of the soft processes strongly relies on the use of the hard-thermal-loop resummed gluon propagator derived from the background field effective theory. Our results show that the heavy-quark energy loss is significantly suppressed in the semi-quark-gluon plasma due to a background field that is self-consistently generated in the effective theory. On the other hand, the suppression has a strong dependence on the temperature of the plasma which becomes negligible above $2\sim 3 $ times the critical temperature. For a realistic coupling constant, ignoring a relatively weak dependence on the heavy-quark velocity, the suppression on the collisional energy loss can be approximated by an overall factor determined solely by the background field. This simple conclusion is expected to be useful for phenomenological applications in the heavy flavor physics.</description>
