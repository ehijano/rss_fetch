      <title>Attractive-repulsive interaction in coupled quantum oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12972</link>

Abstract: We study the emergent dynamics of quantum self-sustained oscillators induced by the simultaneous presence of attraction and repulsion in the coupling path. We consider quantum Stuart-Landau oscillators under attractive-repulsive coupling and construct the corresponding quantum master equation in the Lindblad form. We discover an interesting symmetry-breaking transition from quantum limit cycle oscillation to quantum inhomogeneous steady state; This transition is contrary to the previously known symmetry-breaking transition from quantum homogeneous to inhomogeneous steady state. The result is supported by the analysis on the noisy classical model of the quantum system in the weak quantum regime. Remarkably, we find the generation of entanglement associated with the symmetry-breaking transition that has no analogue in the classical domain. This study will enrich our understanding of the collective behaviors shown by coupled oscillators in the quantum domain.</description>

      <title>Activity patterns in ring networks of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons with synaptic and gap junction coupling</title>

Abstract: We consider a ring network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons with nonlocal synaptic and gap junction coupling. The corresponding neural field model supports solutions such as standing and travelling waves, and also lurching waves. We show that many of these solutions satisfy self-consistency equations which can be used to follow them as parameters are varied. We perform numerical bifurcation analysis of the neural field model, concentrating on the effects of varying gap junction coupling strength. Our methods are generally applicable to a wide variety of networks of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons.</description>

      <title>Self-Organization in Computation &amp; Chemistry: Return to AlChemy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How do complex adaptive systems, such as life, emerge from simple constituent parts? In the 1990s Walter Fontana and Leo Buss proposed a novel modeling approach to this question, based on a formal model of computation known as $\lambda$ calculus. The model demonstrated how simple rules, embedded in a combinatorially large space of possibilities, could yield complex, dynamically stable organizations, reminiscent of biochemical reaction networks. Here, we revisit this classic model, called AlChemy, which has been understudied over the past thirty years. We reproduce the original results and study the robustness of those results using the greater computing resources available today. Our analysis reveals several unanticipated features of the system, demonstrating a surprising mix of dynamical robustness and fragility. Specifically, we find that complex, stable organizations emerge more frequently than previously expected, that these organizations are robust against collapse into trivial fixed-points, but that these stable organizations cannot be easily combined into higher order entities. We also study the role played by the random generators used in the model, characterizing the initial distribution of objects produced by two random expression generators, and their consequences on the results. Finally, we provide a constructive proof that shows how an extension of the model, based on typed $\lambda$ calculus, could simulate transitions between arbitrary states in any possible chemical reaction network, thus indicating a concrete connection between AlChemy and chemical reaction networks. We conclude with a discussion of possible applications of AlChemy to self-organization in modern programming languages and quantitative approaches to the origin of life.</description>
