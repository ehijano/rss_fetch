      <title>User-Generated Content and Editors in Games: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User-Generated Content (UGC) refers to any form of content, such as posts and images, created by users rather than by professionals. In recent years, UGC has become an essential part of the evolving video game industry, influencing both game culture and community dynamics. The ability for users to actively contribute to the games they engage with has shifted the landscape of gaming from a one-directional entertainment experience into a collaborative, user-driven ecosystem. Therefore, this growing trend highlights the urgent need for summarizing the current UGC development in game industry. Our conference paper has systematically classified the existing UGC in games and the UGC editors separately into four types. However, the previous survey lacks the depth and precision necessary to capture the wide-ranging and increasingly complex nature of UGC. To this end, as an extension of previous work, this paper presents a refined and expanded classification of UGC and UGC editors within video games, offering a more robust and comprehensive framework with representative cases that better reflects the diversity and nuances of contemporary user-generated contributions. Moreover, we provide our insights on the future of UGC, involving game culture, game genre and user creative tendencies, artificial intelligence, its potential ethical considerations, and relationship between games, users and communities.</description>

      <title>SAVGBench: Benchmarking Spatially Aligned Audio-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work addresses the lack of multimodal generative models capable of producing high-quality videos with spatially aligned audio. While recent advancements in generative models have been successful in video generation, they often overlook the spatial alignment between audio and visuals, which is essential for immersive experiences. To tackle this problem, we establish a new research direction in benchmarking Spatially Aligned Audio-Video Generation (SAVG). We propose three key components for the benchmark: dataset, baseline, and metrics. We introduce a spatially aligned audio-visual dataset, derived from an audio-visual dataset consisting of multichannel audio, video, and spatiotemporal annotations of sound events. We propose a baseline audio-visual diffusion model focused on stereo audio-visual joint learning to accommodate spatial sound. Finally, we present metrics to evaluate video and spatial audio quality, including a new spatial audio-visual alignment metric. Our experimental result demonstrates that gaps exist between the baseline model and ground truth in terms of video and audio quality, and spatial alignment between both modalities.</description>

      <title>Sign-IDD: Iconicity Disentangled Diffusion for Sign Language Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13609v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sign Language Production (SLP) aims to generate semantically consistent sign videos from textual statements, where the conversion from textual glosses to sign poses (G2P) is a crucial step. Existing G2P methods typically treat sign poses as discrete three-dimensional coordinates and directly fit them, which overlooks the relative positional relationships among joints. To this end, we provide a new perspective, constraining joint associations and gesture details by modeling the limb bones to improve the accuracy and naturalness of the generated poses. In this work, we propose a pioneering iconicity disentangled diffusion framework, termed Sign-IDD, specifically designed for SLP. Sign-IDD incorporates a novel Iconicity Disentanglement (ID) module to bridge the gap between relative positions among joints. The ID module disentangles the conventional 3D joint representation into a 4D bone representation, comprising the 3D spatial direction vector and 1D spatial distance vector between adjacent joints. Additionally, an Attribute Controllable Diffusion (ACD) module is introduced to further constrain joint associations, in which the attribute separation layer aims to separate the bone direction and length attributes, and the attribute control layer is designed to guide the pose generation by leveraging the above attributes. The ACD module utilizes the gloss embeddings as semantic conditions and finally generates sign poses from noise embeddings. Extensive experiments on PHOENIX14T and USTC-CSL datasets validate the effectiveness of our method. The code is available at: https://github.com/NaVi-start/Sign-IDD.</description>

      <title>Reverse Region-to-Entity Annotation for Pixel-Level Visual Entity Linking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Visual Entity Linking (VEL) is a crucial task for achieving fine-grained visual understanding, matching objects within images (visual mentions) to entities in a knowledge base. Previous VEL tasks rely on textual inputs, but writing queries for complex scenes can be challenging. Visual inputs like clicks or bounding boxes offer a more convenient alternative. Therefore, we propose a new task, Pixel-Level Visual Entity Linking (PL-VEL), which uses pixel masks from visual inputs to refer to objects, supplementing reference methods for VEL. To facilitate research on this task, we have constructed the MaskOVEN-Wiki dataset through an entirely automatic reverse region-entity annotation framework. This dataset contains over 5 million annotations aligning pixel-level regions with entity-level labels, which will advance visual understanding towards fine-grained. Moreover, as pixel masks correspond to semantic regions in an image, we enhance previous patch-interacted attention with region-interacted attention by a visual semantic tokenization approach. Manual evaluation results indicate that the reverse annotation framework achieved a 94.8% annotation success rate. Experimental results show that models trained on this dataset improved accuracy by 18 points compared to zero-shot models. Additionally, the semantic tokenization method achieved a 5-point accuracy improvement over the trained baseline.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Position-Aware View Synthesis from Single-View Input</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in view synthesis have significantly enhanced immersive experiences across various computer graphics and multimedia applications, including telepresence, and entertainment. By enabling the generation of new perspectives from a single input view, view synthesis allows users to better perceive and interact with their environment. However, many state-of-the-art methods, while achieving high visual quality, face limitations in real-time performance, which makes them less suitable for live applications where low latency is critical. In this paper, we present a lightweight, position-aware network designed for real-time view synthesis from a single input image and a target camera pose. The proposed framework consists of a Position Aware Embedding, modeled with a multi-layer perceptron, which efficiently maps positional information from the target pose to generate high dimensional feature maps. These feature maps, along with the input image, are fed into a Rendering Network that merges features from dual encoder branches to resolve both high level semantics and low level details, producing a realistic new view of the scene. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior efficiency and visual quality compared to existing approaches, particularly in handling complex translational movements without explicit geometric operations like warping. This work marks a step toward enabling real-time view synthesis from a single image for live and interactive applications.</description>

      <title>SurgSora: Decoupled RGBD-Flow Diffusion Model for Controllable Surgical Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Medical video generation has transformative potential for enhancing surgical understanding and pathology insights through precise and controllable visual representations. However, current models face limitations in controllability and authenticity. To bridge this gap, we propose SurgSora, a motion-controllable surgical video generation framework that uses a single input frame and user-controllable motion cues. SurgSora consists of three key modules: the Dual Semantic Injector (DSI), which extracts object-relevant RGB and depth features from the input frame and integrates them with segmentation cues to capture detailed spatial features of complex anatomical structures; the Decoupled Flow Mapper (DFM), which fuses optical flow with semantic-RGB-D features at multiple scales to enhance temporal understanding and object spatial dynamics; and the Trajectory Controller (TC), which allows users to specify motion directions and estimates sparse optical flow, guiding the video generation process. The fused features are used as conditions for a frozen Stable Diffusion model to produce realistic, temporally coherent surgical videos. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SurgSora outperforms state-of-the-art methods in controllability and authenticity, showing its potential to advance surgical video generation for medical education, training, and research.</description>

      <title>A Review of Multimodal Explainable Artificial Intelligence: Past, Present and Future</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has rapidly developed through advancements in computational power and the growth of massive datasets. However, this progress has also heightened challenges in interpreting the "black-box" nature of AI models. To address these concerns, eXplainable AI (XAI) has emerged with a focus on transparency and interpretability to enhance human understanding and trust in AI decision-making processes. In the context of multimodal data fusion and complex reasoning scenarios, the proposal of Multimodal eXplainable AI (MXAI) integrates multiple modalities for prediction and explanation tasks. Meanwhile, the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to remarkable breakthroughs in natural language processing, yet their complexity has further exacerbated the issue of MXAI. To gain key insights into the development of MXAI methods and provide crucial guidance for building more transparent, fair, and trustworthy AI systems, we review the MXAI methods from a historical perspective and categorize them across four eras: traditional machine learning, deep learning, discriminative foundation models, and generative LLMs. We also review evaluation metrics and datasets used in MXAI research, concluding with a discussion of future challenges and directions. A project related to this review has been created at https://github.com/ShilinSun/mxai_review.</description>

      <title>AKiRa: Augmentation Kit on Rays for optical video generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in text-conditioned video diffusion have greatly improved video quality. However, these methods offer limited or sometimes no control to users on camera aspects, including dynamic camera motion, zoom, distorted lens and focus shifts. These motion and optical aspects are crucial for adding controllability and cinematic elements to generation frameworks, ultimately resulting in visual content that draws focus, enhances mood, and guides emotions according to filmmakers' controls. In this paper, we aim to close the gap between controllable video generation and camera optics. To achieve this, we propose AKiRa (Augmentation Kit on Rays), a novel augmentation framework that builds and trains a camera adapter with a complex camera model over an existing video generation backbone. It enables fine-tuned control over camera motion as well as complex optical parameters (focal length, distortion, aperture) to achieve cinematic effects such as zoom, fisheye effect, and bokeh. Extensive experiments demonstrate AKiRa's effectiveness in combining and composing camera optics while outperforming all state-of-the-art methods. This work sets a new landmark in controlled and optically enhanced video generation, paving the way for future optical video generation methods.</description>
