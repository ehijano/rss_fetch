      <title>Competition between allowed and first-forbidden $\beta$ decay in $r$-process waiting-point nuclei within a relativistic beyond-mean-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute $\beta$-decay half-lives of isotonic nuclear chains located at neutron shell closures $N=50$, $82$, $126$ and $184$, which are of particular importance for the $r$-process nucleosynthesis, and study the role of first-forbidden transitions in a framework that includes complex nucleonic correlations beyond the quasiparticle random phase approximation. Such correlations are accounted for by coupling single nucleons to collective degrees of freedom (nuclear vibrations), and are found essential to reproduce available experimental $\beta$-decay rates and more precise many-body methods. We find that the nucleon-vibration correlations tend to decrease the probability of decay via first-forbidden transition near stability, as they enhance Gamow-Teller transitions at low energy. While in the lighter systems allowed transitions dominate, the decay of $N=126$ and $N=184$ nuclei is found to occur to a large extent via first-forbidden transitions, and in particular those induced by $1^-$ and $0^-$ operators. Overall the many-body method based on nucleon-vibration coupling provides an ideal framework for future large-scale calculations. Upcoming experimental measurements of $\beta$-decay rates in the $N=126$ region by radioactive-beam facilities will be crucial in order to validate the approach.</description>

      <title>Inclusive and diffractive dijet photoproduction in ultraperipheral Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we summarize NLO pQCD predictions for inclusive and diffractive dijet photoproduction in Pb-Pb UPCs at the LHC. We demonstrate that the theory describes well the preliminary ATLAS data on the inclusive cross section, which probes nuclear parton distributions (PDFs) down to $x_A \approx 0.005$ and which can reduce current uncertainties of the small-$x$ nuclear gluon distribution by approximately a factor of 2. Employing predictions of the leading twist approach to nuclear shadowing for nuclear diffractive PDFs, we calculate the cross section of diffractive dijet photoproduction and show that its $x_{\gamma}$ dependence is sensitive to the effect of nuclear shadowing and the mechanism of QCD factorization breaking in hard diffraction. We also find that due to large leading twist nuclear shadowing and restricted kinematics, the diffractive contribution to the inclusive cross section of dijet photoproduction does not exceed $5-10$%, which helps with an ambiguous interpretation of the ATLAS data.</description>

      <title>Rapid neutron star equation of state inference with Normalising Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first direct detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars on the 17th of August, 2017, (GW170817) heralded the arrival of a new messenger for probing neutron star astrophysics and provided the first constraints on neutron star equation of state from gravitational wave observations. Significant computational effort was expended to obtain these first results and therefore, as observations of binary neutron star coalescence become more routine in the coming observing runs, there is a need to improve the analysis speed and flexibility. Here, we present a rapid approach for inferring the neutron star equation of state based on Normalising Flows. As a demonstration, using the same input data, our approach, ASTREOS, produces results consistent with those presented by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration but requires &lt; 1 sec to generate neutron star equation of state confidence intervals. Furthermore, ASTREOS allows for non-parametric equation of state inference. This rapid analysis will not only facilitate neutron star equation of state studies but can potentially enhance future alerts for electromagnetic follow-up observations of binary neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Nuclear matrix elements of neutrinoless double-beta decay in covariant density functional theory with different mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay in candidate nuclei play a crucial role in interpreting results from current experiments and in designing future ones. Accurate NME values serve as important nuclear inputs for constraining parameters in new physics, such as neutrino mass and the Wilson coefficients of lepton-number-violating (LNV) operators. In this study, we present a comprehensive calculation of NMEs for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se, $^{100}$Mo, $^{130}$Te, and $^{136}$Xe, using nuclear wave functions obtained from multi-reference covariant density functional theory (MR-CDFT). We employ three types of transition potentials at the leading order in chiral effective field theory. Our results, along with recent data, are utilized to constrain the coefficients of LNV operators. We find that NMEs for the standard and short-range mechanisms are significantly larger than those for the non-standard long-range mechanism. The use of NMEs from various nuclear models does not notably change the parameter space intervals for the coefficients, although MR-CDFT yields the most stringent constraint. Furthermore, our NMEs can also be used to perform a more comprehensive analysis with multiple isotopes.</description>

      <title>Estimating the detection of antineutrinos in the future Brazilian neutron source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In line with the tradition of employing nuclear reactors for neutrino physics research, we present potential experiments that could be undertaken using the new Brazilian neutron source, the Brazilian Multipurpose Reactor (RMB). This upcoming facility has clearly defined objectives, including the production of radiopharmaceuticals for the healthcare system, material irradiation testing, and research using neutron beams to investigate the micro and mesostructures of various materials. However, we anticipate that the RMB will generate up to $15,500$ antineutrinos daily, potentially expanding the facility's scope to include neutrino physics experiments involving beta and inverse beta reactions. The modern operational conditions of the RMB and its location in the Iper\'o-Brazil region may also enable neutrino oscillation experiments and the determination of the $\theta_{13}$ parameter, as well as support safeguards activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), allowing for the monitoring of nuclear fuel burning cycles and isotope fractions. We discuss the potential utilization of the RMB as an antineutrino source, proposing experiments and addressing associated technical limitations.</description>

      <title>Pomeron and Reggeon contributions to elastic proton-proton and proton-antiproton scattering in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11246v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The total and differential cross sections of elastic proton-proton and proton-antiproton scattering are studied in a holographic QCD model, considering the Pomeron and Reggeon exchanges in the Regge regime. In our model setup, the Pomeron and Reggeon exchanges are described by the Reggeized spin-2 glueball and vector meson propagators, respectively. How those contributions change with the energy is explicitly shown, focusing on the contribution ratios. The adjustable parameters included in the model are determined with the experimental data, and it is presented that the resulting total and differential cross sections are consistent with the data in a wide kinematic region.</description>
