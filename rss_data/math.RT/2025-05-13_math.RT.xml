      <title>Representation Theory of the Twisted Yangians in Complex Rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2016, Etingof defined the notion of a Yangian in a symmetric tensor category and posed the problem to study them in the context of Deligne categories. This problem was studied by Kalinov in 2020 for the Yangian $Y(\mathfrak{gl}_t)$ of the general linear Lie algebra $\mathfrak{gl}_t$ in complex rank using the techniques of ultraproducts. In particular, Kalinov classified the simple finite-length modules over $Y(\mathfrak{gl}_t)$. In this paper, we define the notion of a twisted Yangian in Deligne's categories, and we extend these techniques to classify finite-length simple modules over the twisted Yangians $Y(\mathfrak{o}_t)$ and $Y(\mathfrak{sp}_t)$ of the orthogonal and symplectic Lie algebras $\mathfrak{o}_t,\mathfrak{sp}_t$ in complex rank.</description>

      <title>Non-decreasable K-types are unitarily small</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected simple non-compact real reductive Lie group with a maximal compact subgroup $K$. This note aims to show that any non-decreasable $K$-type (in the sense of the first named author) is unitarily small (in the sense of Salamanca-Riba and Vogan). This answers Conjecture 2.1 of \cite{D} in the affirmative.</description>

      <title>Stable Higher Specht Polynomials and Representations of Infinite Symmetric Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define eventually symmetric functions to be those power series of bounded degree in infinitely many variables that are invariant under interchanging all the variables with large enough indices. We show how this ring $\tilde{\Lambda}$ is the natural place to define the stable versions of the higher Specht polynomials of Ariki, Terasoma, and Yamada and their generalized versions from the prequels to this paper, and investigate its various properties as a representation of the infinite symmetric groups. This requires defining infinite versions of Ferrers diagrams, standard Young tableau, semi-standard ones, and the appropriate representations inside $\tilde{\Lambda}$, which are irreducibe as limits of irreducible representations of finite symmetric groups. The homogeneous parts of $\tilde{\Lambda}$ and of its subring of polynomials in infinitely many variables are no longer completely reducible, and we determine the form of the maximal completely reducible sub-representations there (in several normalizations). After posing a conjecture about the decompositions of polynomials in $n$ variables using the representations of $S_{n+1}$, we obtain explicit filtrations on $\tilde{\Lambda}$ and its subring, whose graded pieces are the maximal completely reducible sub-representations at each step.</description>

      <title>A remarkable functor on $G$-modules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new functor on categories of modular representations of reductive algebraic groups. Our functor has remarkable properties. For example it is a tensor functor and sends every standard and costandard object in the principal block to a one-dimensional object. We connect our functor to recent work of Gruber and conjecture that our functor is equivalent to hypercohomology under the equivalence of the Finkelberg-Mirkovic conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish general categorical frameworks that extend Loewy's classification scheme for finite-dimensional real irreducible representations of groups and Borel--Tits' criterion for the existence of rational forms of representations of $\bar{F}\otimes_F G$ for a connected reductive algebraic group $G$ over a field $F$ of characteristic zero and its algebraic closure $\bar{F}$. We also discuss applications of these general formalisms to the theory of Harish-Chandra modules, specifically to classify irreducible Harish-Chandra modules over fields $F$ of characteristic zero and to identify smaller fields of definition of irreducible Harish-Chandra modules over $\bar{F}$, particularly in the case of cohomological irreducible essentially unitarizable modules.</description>

      <title>Hyperrigidity I: singly generated commutative $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20814v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study hyperrigidity for singly generated commutative unital $C^*$-algebras. We look at hyperrigidity from four different points of view. The first is via operator-moment characterizations of spectral measures, the subject intensively exploited in quantum theory. The second is based on dilation theory and the Stone-von Neumann calculus for normal operators. The third, inspired by a recent result by L. G. Brown, concerns the weak and strong convergence of sequences of subnormal (or normal) operators. Finally, the fourth deals with the multiplicativity of unital completely positive maps on $C^*$-subalgebras generated by single normal elements. The latter is inspired by Petz's theorem and its generalizations established first by Arveson in the finite-dimensional case and then by L. G. Brown in general. The above machinery, together with sophisticated operator inequalities (Kadison's, Hansen's and Lieb-Ruskai's), makes it possible to identify certain subsets $G$ of the set $\{t^{*m}t^n\colon m, n = 0,1,2,\ldots\}$ that are hyperrigid in $C^*(t)$, the unital $C^*$-algebra generated by a single normal element $t$. Examples based on the Choquet boundary are included to confirm the optimality of our results.</description>

      <title>Hyperrigidity II: $R$-dilations and ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study hyperrigidity for $C^*$-algebras. The absence of the unit in hyperrigid set creates the possibility of the existence of $R$-dilations with non-isometric $R$. This gives rise to the study of when a hyperrigid set is annihilated by a state, or more generally, by a UCP map, which in turn, is closely related to the concept of rigidity at $0$ introduced by G. Salomon, who studied hyperrigid subsets of Cuntz-Krieger algebras. Moreover, we obtain a characterization of hyperrigid sets analogous to that obtained by Hansen and Pedersen for operator convex functions.</description>

      <title>Compatibility of Higher Specht Polynomials and Decompositions of Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: %We show how to normalize the higher Specht polynomials of Ariki, Terasoma, and Yamada in a compatible way in order to define a stable version of these polynomials. We also decompose the non-transitive actions of Haglund, Rhoades, and Shimozono into orbits, and show how the associated basis of higher Specht polynomials of Gillespie and Rhoades respects that decomposition. For a given $n$, the orbits of the action of $S_{n}$ are associated with subsets of the set of positive integers that are smaller than $n$, and we relate the representation associated with a set $I$ to the ones of $S_{n+1}$ associated with $I$ and with its union with $n$, the latter being a lifting of the Branching Rule.</description>

      <title>Generalized Higher Specht Polynomials and Homogeneous Representations of Symmetric Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider actions, similar to those of Haglund, Rhoades, and Shimozono on ordered partitions, and their basis in terms of the higher Specht polynomials of Ariki, Terasoma, and Yamada, as carried out by Gillespie and Rhoades. By allowing empty sets and working with multi-sets and weak partitions as indices, we obtain a decomposition of the action of $S_{n}$ on homogeneous polynomials of degree $d$ into irreducible representations, in a way that lifts a formula of Stanley. By considering generalized higher Specht polynomials, we obtain yet another such decomposition, lifting another formula involving Kostka numbers. We also investigate several operations on both types of representations, which are based on normalizations of the generalized higher Specht polynomials that allow for defining their stable versions.</description>

      <title>Braided symmetric algebras and a first fundamental theorem of invariant theory for ${\rm U}_q(G_2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop invariant theory for the quantum group ${\rm U}_q$ of $G_2$ at generic $q$ in the setting of braided symmetric algebras. Let ${\mathcal A}_m$ be the braided symmetric algebra over $m$-copies of the $7$-dimensional simple ${\rm U}_q$-module. A set of ${\rm U}_q$-invariants in ${\mathcal A}_m$ attached to certain acyclic trivalent graphs is obtained, which spans the subalgebra ${\mathcal A}_m^{{\rm U}_q}$ of invariants as vector space. A finite set of homogeneous elements is constructed explicitly, which generates ${\mathcal A}_m^{{\rm U}_q}$ as algebra. Commutation relations among the algebraic generators are determined. These results may be regarded as a non-commutative first fundamental theorem of invariant theory for ${\rm U}_q$. The algebra ${\mathcal A}_m$ is a non-flat quantisation of the coordinate ring of ${\mathbb C}^7\otimes{\mathbb C}^m$. As ${\rm U}_q$-module, ${\mathcal A}_m={\mathcal A}_1^{\otimes m}$ and we decompose ${\mathcal A}_1$ into simple submodules. The affine scheme associated to the classical limit of ${\mathcal A}_m$ is described. This is a rare case where the structure of a non-flat quantisation is understood.</description>

      <title>Generically-constrained quantum isotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional unitary representation of a compact quantum group $\mathrm{G}$ and denote by $\mathrm{G}_W$ the isotropy subgroup of a linear subspace $W\le V$ regarded as a point in the Grassmannian $\mathbb{G}(V)$. We show that the space of those $W\in \mathbb{G}(V)$ for which $\mathrm{G}_W$ acts trivially on $W$ (or $V$) is open in the Zariski topology of the Weil restriction $\mathrm{Res}_{\mathbb{C}/\mathbb{R}}\mathbb{G}(V)$. More generally, this holds for the space of $W$ for which (a) the $\mathrm{G}_W$-action factors through its abelianization, or (b) the summands of the $\mathrm{G}_W$-representation on $W$ (or $V$) are otherwise dimensionally constrained.
  The results generalize analogous classical generic rigidity statements useful in establishing the triviality of the classical automorphism groups of random quantum graphs in the matrix algebra $M_n$, and can be put to similar use in fully non-commutative versions of those results (quantum graphs, quantum groups).</description>

      <title>Order polytopes of graded posets are gamma-effective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Order polytopes of posets have been a very rich topic at the crossroads between combinatorics and discrete geometry since their definition by Stanley in 1986. Among other notable results, order polytopes of graded posets are known to be $\gamma$-nonnegative by work of Br\"and\'en, who introduced the concept of sign-graded poset in the process.
  In the present paper we are interested in proving an equivariant version of Br\"and\'en's result, using the tools of equivariant Ehrhart theory (introduced by Stapledon in 2011). Namely, we prove that order polytopes of graded posets are always $\gamma$-effective, i.e., that the $\gamma$-polynomial associated with the equivariant $h^*$-polynomial of the order polytope of any graded poset has coefficients consisting of actual characters. To reach this goal, we develop a theory of order polytopes of sign-graded posets, and find a formula to express the numerator of the equivariant Ehrhart series of such an object in terms of the saturations (\`a la Br\"and\'en) of the given sign-graded poset.</description>

      <title>The Sch\"utzenberger involution and colored lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Colored lattice models can be used to describe many different types of special functions of interest in both algebraic combinatorics and representation theory, for example Schur polynomials, nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials, and characters and Whittaker functions for representations of p-adic groups. A notable example is the metaplectic ice model of which there are actually two different variants: a Gamma and a Delta variant. These variants differ in key aspects but surprisingly produce equal partition functions, which are weighted sums over admissible configurations, and this equality is called the Gamma-Delta duality. The duality was used to prove the analytic continuation of certain multiple Dirichlet series and is highly non-trivial, especially since the number of configurations on each side of the equality can differ.
  In this paper we construct a new family of solvable, colored lattice models and prove that they are dual to existing lattice models in the literature, including the above metaplectic case and the lattice model for (non-metaplectic) Iwahori Whittaker functions together with its crystal limit for Demazure atoms for Cartan type A. The equality of partition functions is shown using Yang-Baxter equations involving R-matrices mixing lattice model rows of types Gamma and Delta.
  For the crystal Demazure lattice model we show that the duality refines to a weight-respecting bijection of states given by the Sch\"utzenberger involution on the associated Gelfand-Tsetlin patterns or semistandard Young tableaux. We also show how the individual steps exchanging two rows in the proof of the duality for the partition functions refines to Berenstein-Kirillov, or Bender-Knuth involutions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03778v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops the theory of quasi-biserial and special quasi-biserial algebras, relating them to symmetric fractional Brauer graph algebras. We prove that these algebras generalize key properties of classical biserial algebras, and establish that symmetric special quasi-biserial algebras are exactly those determined by combinatorial data (a labeled ribbon graph with a multiplicity function). Furthermore, we show that Kauer moves on labeled ribbon graphs induce derived equivalences between the corresponding symmetric special quasi-biserial algebras.</description>

      <title>On a geometric comparison of representations of complex and $p$-adic $\mathbf{GL}_n$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we use geometric methods to study the relations between admissible representations of $\mathbf{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ and unramified representations of $\mathbf{GL}_m(\mathbb{Q}_p)$. We show that the geometric relationship between Langlands parameter spaces of $\mathbf{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ and $\mathbf{GL}_m(\mathbb{Q}_p)$ constructed by the first named author is compatible with the functor recently defined algebraically by Chan-Wong. We then show that the said relationship intertwines translation functors on representations of $\mathbf{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ and partial Bernstein-Zelevinskii derivatives on representations of $\mathbf{GL}_m(\mathbb{Q}_p)$, providing purely geometric counterparts to some results of Chan-Wong. In the sequels, the techniques of this work will be extended to real and $p$-adic classical groups and used to study their Arthur packets.</description>

      <title>Geometric realizations of affine Hecke algebras with unequal parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a $K$-theoretic realization of all affine Hecke algebras with two unequal parameters including exceptional types. This extends the celebrated work of Kazhdan and Lusztig, who gave a $K$-theoretic realization of affine Hecke algebras with equal parameters, and complements results of Kato, who extended this construction to the three-parameter affine Hecke algebra of type $C$. A key idea behind our new construction is to exploit the reducibility of the adjoint representation in small characteristic. We also show that under suitable geometric conditions, our construction leads to a Deligne-Langlands style classification of simple modules. We verify these geometric conditions for $G_2$ thereby obtaining a full geometric classification of the simple modules for the affine Hecke algebra of $G_2$ with two parameters away from roots of unities.</description>

      <title>A generalized character related to the local structure and representation theory of a finite group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03976v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the generalized character $\Psi_{1,p,G}$ of a finite group $G$ which vanishes on all $p$-singular elements of $G$ and whose value at each $p$-regular $y \in G$ is the number of $p$-elements of $C_{G}(y)$. We conjecture that this is always a character, and may be afforded by a projective $RG$-module, where $R$ is an appropriate complete discrete valuation ring whose residue field has characteristic $p$. We examine a number of case where this is the case, and consider consequences for the representation theory and character theory of $G$ when this conjecture is known to hold. In particular, we prove, among other things, that the conjecture is valid for all primes $p$ in the case that $G \cong {\rm PSL}(2,q)$ or ${\rm SL}(2,q)$ for every prime power $q$.</description>

      <title>Plethysm Products, Element and Plus Constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.11946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by viewing categories as bimodule monoids over their isomorphism groupoids, we construct monoidal structures called plethysm products on three levels: that is for bimodules, relative bimodules and factorizable bimodules. For the bimodules, we work in the general setting of actions by categories. We give a comprehensive theory linking these levels to each other as well as to Grothendieck element constructions, indexed enrichments, decorations and algebras.
  Specializing to groupoid actions leads to applications including the plus construction. In this setting, the third level encompasses the known constructions of Baez-Dolan and its generalizations, as we prove. One new result is that that the plus construction can also be realized an element construction compatible with monoidal structures that we define. This allows us to prove a commutativity between element and plus constructions a special case of which was announced earlier. Specializing the results on the third level yield a criterion, when a definition of operad-like structure as a plethysm monoid -- as exemplified by operads -- is possible.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative Hamiltonian structures and quantizations on preprojective algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17578v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a noncommutative Hamiltonian space $A$, we prove that the conjecture ``{\it quantization commutes with reduction}'' holds for $A$. We further construct a semidirect product algebra $A \rtimes \mG^A$, and establish the correspondence between equivariant sheaves on the representation space and left $A\rtimes\mG^A$-modules. In the quiver setting, using the quantum and classical trace maps, we establish the explicit correspondence between quantizations on a preprojective algebra and those on a quiver variety.</description>

      <title>On Matlis reflexive modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16711v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matlis duality for modules over commutative rings gives rise to the notion of Matlis reflexivity. It is shown that Matlis reflexive modules form a Krull-Schmidt category. For noetherian rings the absence of infinite direct sums is a characteristic feature of Matlis reflexivity. This leads to a discussion of objects that are extensions of artinian by noetherian objects. Classifications of Matlis reflexive modules are provided for some small examples.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic aspects of semistability of quiver representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06493v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the semistability of quiver representations from an algorithmic perspective. We present efficient algorithms for several fundamental computational problems on the semistability of quiver representations: deciding the semistability and $\sigma$-semistability, finding the maximizers of King's criterion, and computing the Harder--Narasimhan filtration. We also investigate a class of polyhedral cones defined by the linear system in King's criterion, which we refer to as King cones. For rank-one representations, we demonstrate that these King cones can be encoded by submodular flow polytopes, enabling us to decide the $\sigma$-semistability in strongly polynomial time. Our approach employs submodularity in quiver representations, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Approximable Triangulated Categories and Reflexive DG-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09461v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the theory of approximable triangulated categories to give a condition for a proper DG-category to be reflexive in the sense of Kuznetsov and Shinder. To do this we provide another description of the completion of an approximable triangulated category under a properness assumption. We apply our results to proper schemes, proper connective DG-algebras and Azumaya algebras over proper schemes.</description>

      <title>Twisted Steinberg algebras, regular inclusions and induction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11639v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a field $K$ and an ample (not necessarily Hausdorff) groupoid $G$, we define the concept of a line bundle over $G$ inspired by the well known concept from the theory of C*-algebras. If $E$ is such a line bundle, we construct the associated twisted Steinberg algebra in terms of sections of $E$, extending the original construction introduced independently by Steinberg in 2010, and by Clark, Farthing, Sims and Tomforde in a 2014 paper (originally announced in 2011). We also generalize (strictly, in the non-Hausdorff case) the 2023 construction of (cocycle) twisted Steinberg algebras of Armstrong, Clark, Courtney, Lin, Mccormick and Ramagge. We then extend Steinberg's theory of induction of modules, not only to the twisted case, but to the much more general case of regular inclusions of algebras. Among our main results, we show that, under appropriate conditions, every irreducible module is induced by an irreducible module over a certain abstractly defined isotropy algebra. We also describe a process of disintegration of modules and use it to prove a version of the Effros-Hahn conjecture, showing that every primitive ideal coincides with the annihilator of a module induced from isotropy.</description>
