      <title>Robustness of the solitons against perturbations in certain nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger type equations in Nonlinear Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonlocal nonlinear evolution equations describe phenomena in which wave evolution is influenced by local and nonlocal spatial and temporal variables. These equations have opened up a new wave of physically important nonlinear evolution equations. Their solutions provide insights into the interplay between nonlinearity and nonlocality, making it a cornerstone in the study of nonlocal nonlinear systems. However, the stability of such solutions has not been extensively explored in the literature. Stability analysis ensures that these solutions are robust and capable of persisting under real-world perturbations, making them physically meaningful. In this work, we examine the stability of soliton solutions of four types of nonlocal nonlinear evolutionary equations: (i) the space-shifted nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, (ii) the nonlocal complex time-reversed Hirota equation, (iii) the nonlocal real space-time-reversed modified Korteweg-de Vries equation, and (iv) a fourth-order nonlocal nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation. These equations arise in various physical fields such as nonlinear optics, Bose-Einstein condensates, plasmas and so on where nonlocality and nonlinearity play significant roles. We introduce certain perturbations to the soliton solutions of these equations and analyze their stability. Our findings indicate that the soliton solutions of the aforementioned equations are stable under such perturbations. To the best of our knowledge, this approach to investigating the stability of these solutions is novel.</description>

      <title>Quasi-reversible parametric instability in presence of noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an experimental and theoretical study of the effect of spatio-temporal fluctuations in quasi-reversible systems displaying a spatial quintic supercritical bifurcation. The saturation mechanism is drastically changed by the inclusion of fluctuations. Experimentally, we observe the modification of the bifurcation diagram of parametrically amplified surface waves as spatiotemporal fluctuations stemming from an underlying vortex flow are included. Theoretically, we characterize the noise-dependent effective dynamics in a model system, the parametrically driven nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation, subjected to noise which allows us to rationalize the effect of the underlying vortex flow on the surface waves</description>

      <title>Thresholdless nonlinearity-induced edge solitons in trimer arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger (DNLS) model with Kerr-type on-site nonlinearity, where the nearest-neighbor coupling constants take two different values ordered in a three-periodic sequence. The existence of localized edge states in the linear limit (Su-Schrieffer-Heeger trimer, SSH3) is known to depend on the precise location of the edge. Here, we show that for a termination that does not support linear edge states, an arbitrarily weak on-site nonlinearity will induce an edge mode with asymptotic exponential localization, bifurcating from a linear band edge. Close to the gap edge, the shape of the mode can be analytically described in a continuum approximation as one half of a standard gap soliton. The linear stability properties of nonlinear edge modes are also discussed.</description>
