      <title>Global bifurcation of homoclinic solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the analysis of parametrized nonautonomous evolutionary equations, bounded entire solutions are natural candidates for bifurcating objects. Appropriate explicit and sufficient conditions for such branchings, however, require to combine contemporary functional analytical methods from the abstract bifurcation theory for Fredholm operators with tools originating in dynamical systems.
  This paper establishes alternatives classifying the shape of global bifurcating branches of bounded entire solutions to Carath\'eodory differential equations. Our approach is based on the parity associated to a path of index 0 Fredholm operators, the global Evans function as a recent tool in nonautonomous bifurcation theory and suitable topologies on spaces of Carath\'eodory functions.</description>

      <title>Symmetric periodic solutions in the generalized Sitnikov Problem with homotopy methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper investigates a generalization of the classical Sitnikov problem, concentrating on the movement of a satellite along the Z-axis as it interacts with $n$ primary bodies in periodic motion. It establishes the existence of an infinite number of even and anti-periodic solutions with increasing periods. The proof employs the Leray-Schauder degree theory to trace the critical points of action functionals, using a homotopy from solutions when the primary bodies are transformed into circular orbits.</description>

      <title>Effective Integrability of Lins Neto's Family of Foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A. Lins Neto presented in [Lins-Neto,2002] a $1$-dimensional family of degree four foliations on the complex projective plane $\mathcal{F}_{t \in \overline{\mathbb{C}}}$ with non-degenerate singularities of fixed analytic type, whose set of parameters $t$ for which $\mathcal{F}_t$ is an elliptic pencil is dense and countable. In [McQuillan,2001] and [Guillot,2002], M. McQuillan and A. Guillot showed that the family lifts to linear foliations on the abelian surface $E \times E$, where $E = \mathbb{C}/\Gamma$, $\Gamma = &lt; 1 , \tau&gt;$ and $\tau$ is a primitive 3rd root of unity, the parameters for which $\mathcal{F}_t$ are elliptic pencils being $t\in \mathbb{Q}(\tau) \cup {\infty}$. In [Puchuri,2013], the second author gave a closed formula for the degree of the elliptic curves of $\mathcal{F}_t$ a function of $t \in \mathbb{Q}(\tau)$. In this work we determine degree, positions and multiplicities of singularities of the elliptic curves of $\mathcal{F}_t$, for any given $t \in \mathbb{Z}(\tau)$ in algorithmical way implemented in Python. And also we obtain the explicit expressions for the generators of the elliptic pencils, using the Singular software. Our constructions depend on the effect of quadratic Cremona maps on the family of foliations $\mathcal{F}_t$.</description>

      <title>Tykhyy's Conjecture on finite mapping class group orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify the finite orbits of the mapping class group action on the character variety of Deroin--Tholozan representations of punctured spheres. In particular, we prove that the action has no finite orbits if the underlying sphere has 7 punctures or more. When the sphere has six punctures, we show that there is a unique 1-parameter family of finite orbits. Our methods also recover Tykhyy's classification of finite orbits for 5-punctured spheres. The proof is inductive and uses Lisovyy--Tykhyy's classification of finite mapping class group orbits for 4-punctured spheres as the base case for the induction.
  Our results on Deroin--Tholozan representations cover the last missing cases to complete the proof of Tykhyy's Conjecture on finite mapping class group orbits for $\mathrm{SL}_2\mathbb{C}$ representations of punctured spheres, after the recent work by Lam--Landesman--Litt.</description>

      <title>Active Sampling of Interpolation Points to Identify Dominant Subspaces for Model Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Model reduction is an active research field to construct low-dimensional surrogate models of high fidelity to accelerate engineering design cycles. In this work, we investigate model reduction for linear structured systems using dominant reachable and observable subspaces. When the training set $-$ containing all possible interpolation points $-$ is large, then these subspaces can be determined by solving many large-scale linear systems. However, for high-fidelity models, this easily becomes computationally intractable. To circumvent this issue, in this work, we propose an active sampling strategy to sample only a few points from the given training set, which can allow us to estimate those subspaces accurately. To this end, we formulate the identification of the subspaces as the solution of the generalized Sylvester equations, guiding us to select the most relevant samples from the training set to achieve our goals. Consequently, we construct solutions of the matrix equations in low-rank forms, which encode subspace information. We extensively discuss computational aspects and efficient usage of the low-rank factors in the process of obtaining reduced-order models. We illustrate the proposed active sampling scheme to obtain reduced-order models via dominant reachable and observable subspaces and present its comparison with the method where all the points from the training set are taken into account. It is shown that the active sample strategy can provide us $17$x speed-up without sacrificing any noticeable accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the integrability of polynomial vector fields through the lens of duality in parameter spaces. We examine formal power series solutions anihilated by differential operators and explore the properties of the integrability variety in relation to the invariants of the associated Lie group. Our study extends to differential operators on affine algebraic varieties, highlighting the inartistic connection between these operators and local analytic first integrals. To illustrate the duality the case of quadratic vector fields is considered in detail.</description>

      <title>Element-wise and Recursive Solutions for the Power Spectral Density of Biological Stochastic Dynamical Systems at Fixed Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19890v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochasticity plays a central role in nearly every biological process, and the noise power spectral density (PSD) is a critical tool for understanding variability and information processing in living systems. In steady-state, many such processes can be described by stochastic linear time-invariant (LTI) systems driven by Gaussian white noise, whose PSD is a complex rational function of the frequency that can be concisely expressed in terms of their Jacobian, dispersion, and diffusion matrices, fully defining the statistical properties of the system's dynamics at steady-state. Here, we arrive at compact element-wise solutions of the rational function coefficients for the auto- and cross-spectrum that enable the explicit analytical computation of the PSD in dimensions n=2,3,4. We further present a recursive Leverrier-Faddeev-type algorithm for the exact computation of the rational function coefficients. Crucially, both solutions are free of matrix inverses. We illustrate our element-wise and recursive solutions by considering the stochastic dynamics of neural systems models, namely Fitzhugh-Nagumo (n=2), Hindmarsh-Rose (n=3), Wilson-Cowan (n=4), and the Stabilized Supralinear Network (n=22), as well as an evolutionary game-theoretic model with mutations (n=5, 31). We extend our approach to derive a recursive method for calculating the coefficients in the power series expansion of the integrated covariance matrix for interacting spiking neurons modeled as Hawkes processes on arbitrary directed graphs.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Lyapunov exponents for derived from Anosov diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a class of volume preserving partially hyperbolic diffeomorphisms (or non-uniformly Anosov) $f\colon {\T}^d\rightarrow{\T}^d$ homotopic to linear Anosov automorphism, we show that the sum of the positive (negative) Lyapunov exponents of $f$ is bounded above (resp. below) by the sum of the positive (resp. negative) Lyapunov exponents of its linearization. We show this for some classes of derived from Anosov (DA) and non-uniformly hyperbolic systems with dominated splitting, in particular for examples described by C. Bonatti and Viana. The results in this paper address a flexibility program by J. Bochi, A. Katok and F. Rodriguez Hertz.</description>

      <title>On the strong separation condition for self-similar iterated function systems with random translations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14175v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a self-similar iterated function system $\Phi=\{ \phi_i(x)=\rho_i O_i x+t_i \}_{i=1}^m$ acting on $\mathbb{R}^d$, we can generate a parameterised family of iterated function systems by replacing each $t_i$ with a random vector in $\mathbb{R}^d$. In this paper we study whether a Lebesgue typical member of this family will satisfy the strong separation condition. Our main results show that if the similarity dimension of $\Phi$ is sufficiently small, then a Lebesgue typical member of this family will satisfy the strong separation condition.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time dynamics, step-skew products, and pipe-flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A discrete-time deterministic dynamical system is governed at every step by a predetermined law. However the dynamics can lead to many complexities in the phase space and in the domain of observables that makes it comparable to a stochastic process. This article presents two different ways of representing a dynamical system by stochastic processes. The first is a step-skew product system, in which a finite state Markov process drives a dynamics on Euclidean space. The second is a skew-product system, in which a deterministic, mixing flow intermittently drives a deterministic flow through a topological space created by gluing cylinders. This system is called a perturbed pipe-flow. We show how these three representations are interchangeable. The inter-connections also reveal how a deterministic chaotic system partitions the phase space at a local level, and also mixes the phase space at a global level.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Sigma$ be a smooth closed oriented surface of genus $\geq 2$. We prove that two metrics on $\Sigma$ with the same marked length spectrum and Anosov geodesic flow are isometric via an isometry isotopic to the identity.

      <title>Properties of Immersions for Systems with Multiple Limit Sets with Implications to Learning Koopman Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17045v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Linear immersions (such as Koopman eigenfunctions) of a nonlinear system have wide applications in prediction and control. In this work, we study the properties of linear immersions for nonlinear systems with multiple omega-limit sets. While previous research has indicated the possibility of discontinuous one-to-one linear immersions for such systems, it has been unclear whether continuous one-to-one linear immersions are attainable. Under mild conditions, we prove that any continuous immersion to a class of systems including finite-dimensional linear systems collapses all the omega-limit sets, and thus cannot be one-to-one. Furthermore, we show that this property is also shared by approximate linear immersions learned from data as sample size increases and sampling interval decreases. Multiple examples are studied to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Hamiltonian displaceability and arbitrary symplectic squeezability for critically negligible sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We call a metric space $s$-negligible iff its $s$-dimensional Hausdorff measure vanishes. We show that every countably $m$-rectifiable subset of $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ can be displaced from every $(2n-m)$-negligible subset by a Hamiltonian diffeomorphism that is arbitrarily $C^\infty$-close to the identity. As a consequence, every countably $n$-rectifiable and $n$-negligible subset of $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is arbitrarily symplectically squeezable. Both results are sharp w.r.t. the parameter $s$ in the $s$-negligibility assumption.
  The proof of our squeezing result uses folding. Potentially, our folding method can be modified to show that the Gromov width of $B^{2n}_1\setminus A$ equals $\pi$ for every countably $(n-1)$-rectifiable closed subset $A$ of the open unit ball $B^{2n}_1$. This means that $A$ is not a barrier.</description>
