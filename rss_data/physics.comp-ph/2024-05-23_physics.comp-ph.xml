      <title>How glassy are neural networks?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) share important similarities with structural glasses. Both have many degrees of freedom, and their dynamics are governed by a high-dimensional, non-convex landscape representing either the loss or energy, respectively. Furthermore, both experience gradient descent dynamics subject to noise. In this work we investigate, by performing quantitative measurements on realistic networks trained on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, the extent to which this qualitative similarity gives rise to glass-like dynamics in neural networks. We demonstrate the existence of a Topology Trivialisation Transition as well as the previously studied under-to-overparameterised transition analogous to jamming. By training DNNs with overdamped Langevin dynamics in the resulting disordered phases, we do not observe diverging relaxation times at non-zero temperature, nor do we observe any caging effects, in contrast to glass phenomenology. However, the weight overlap function follows a power law in time, with an exponent of approximately -0.5, in agreement with the Mode-Coupling Theory of structural glasses. In addition, the DNN dynamics obey a form of time-temperature superposition. Finally, dynamic heterogeneity and ageing are observed at low temperatures. These results highlight important and surprising points of both difference and agreement between the behaviour of DNNs and structural glasses.</description>

      <title>Multi-Frequency Progressive Refinement for Learned Inverse Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interpreting scattered acoustic and electromagnetic wave patterns is a computational task that enables remote imaging in a number of important applications, including medical imaging, geophysical exploration, sonar and radar detection, and nondestructive testing of materials. However, accurately and stably recovering an inhomogeneous medium from far-field scattered wave measurements is a computationally difficult problem, due to the nonlinear and non-local nature of the forward scattering process. We design a neural network, called Multi-Frequency Inverse Scattering Network (MFISNet), and a training method to approximate the inverse map from far-field scattered wave measurements at multiple frequencies. We consider three variants of MFISNet, with the strongest performing variant inspired by the recursive linearization method -- a commonly used technique for stably inverting scattered wavefield data -- that progressively refines the estimate with higher frequency content.</description>

      <title>Enhancing lattice kinetic schemes for fluid dynamics with Lattice-Equivariant Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new class of equivariant neural networks, hereby dubbed Lattice-Equivariant Neural Networks (LENNs), designed to satisfy local symmetries of a lattice structure. Our approach develops within a recently introduced framework aimed at learning neural network-based surrogate models Lattice Boltzmann collision operators. Whenever neural networks are employed to model physical systems, respecting symmetries and equivariance properties has been shown to be key for accuracy, numerical stability, and performance.
  Here, hinging on ideas from group representation theory, we define trainable layers whose algebraic structure is equivariant with respect to the symmetries of the lattice cell. Our method naturally allows for efficient implementations, both in terms of memory usage and computational costs, supporting scalable training/testing for lattices in two spatial dimensions and higher, as the size of symmetry group grows. We validate and test our approach considering 2D and 3D flowing dynamics, both in laminar and turbulent regimes. We compare with group averaged-based symmetric networks and with plain, non-symmetric, networks, showing how our approach unlocks the (a-posteriori) accuracy and training stability of the former models, and the train/inference speed of the latter networks (LENNs are about one order of magnitude faster than group-averaged networks in 3D). Our work opens towards practical utilization of machine learning-augmented Lattice Boltzmann CFD in real-world simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the computational challenges and requirements for high-resolution climate simulations using the Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic Weather and Climate Model (ICON). We define a detailed requirements model for ICON which emphasizes the need for specialized supercomputers to accurately predict climate change impacts and extreme weather events. Based on the requirements model, we outline computational demands for km-scale simulations, and suggests machine learning techniques to enhance model accuracy and efficiency. Our findings aim to guide the design of future supercomputers for advanced climate science.</description>

      <title>Low-energy pathways lead to self-healing defects in CsPbBr$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Self-regulation of free charge carriers in perovskites via Schottky defect formation has been posited as the origin of the well-known defect tolerance of metal halide perovskite materials that are promising candidates for photovoltaic applications, like solar cells. Understanding the mechanisms of self-regulation, here for a representative of more commercially viable all-inorganic perovskites, promises to lead to the fabrication of better-performing solar cell materials with higher efficiencies. We investigated different mechanisms and pathways of the diffusion and recombination of interstitials and vacancies (Schottky pairs) in CsPbBr$_3$. We use Nudged Elastic Band calculations and ab initio-derived pseudopotentials within Quantum ESPRESSO to determine energies of formation, migration, and activation for these defects. Our calculations uncover defect pathways capable of producing an activation energy at or below the value of 0.53~eV observed for the slow, temperature-dependent recovery of light-induced conductivity in CsPbBr$_3$. Our work reveals the existence of a low-energy diffusion pathway involving a concerted "domino effect" interstitial mechanism, with the net result that interstitials can diffuse more readily over long distances than expected. Importantly, this observation suggests that defect self-healing can be promoted if the "domino effect" strategy can be engaged.</description>

      <title>A generative machine learning surrogate model of plasma turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art techniques in generative artificial intelligence are employed for the first time to construct a surrogate model for plasma turbulence that enables long time transport simulations. The proposed GAIT (Generative Artificial Intelligence Turbulence) model is based on the coupling of a convolutional variational auto-encoder, that encodes precomputed turbulence data into a reduce latent space, and a deep neural network and decoder that generate new turbulence states 400 times faster than the direct numerical integration. The model is applied to the Hasegawa-Wakatani (HW) plasma turbulence model, that is closely related to the quasigeostrophic model used in geophysical fluid dynamics. Very good agreement is found between the GAIT and the HW models in the spatio-temporal Fourier and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition spectra as well as in the flow topology characterized by the Okubo-Weiss decomposition. Agreement is also found in the probability distribution function of particle displacements and the effective turbulent diffusivity.</description>

      <title>Nucleation regions in the Large-Scale Structure I. A catalogue of cores in nearby rich superclusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We applied a Density-Based Clustering algorithm on samples of galaxies and galaxy systems belonging to 53 rich superclusters from the \textit{Main SuperCluster Catalogue} (MSCC) to identify the presence of ``central regions'', or \emph{cores}, in these large-scale structures. \emph{Cores} are defined here as large gravitationally bound galaxy structures, comprised of two or more clusters and groups, with sufficient matter density to survive cosmic expansion and virialize in the future. We identified a total of 105 galaxy structures classified as \emph{cores}, which exhibit a high density contrast of mass and galaxies. The Density-based \textit{Core} Catalogue (DCC), presented here, includes \emph{cores} that were previously reported in well-known superclusters of the Local Universe, and also several newly identified ones. We found that 83\% of the rich superclusters in our sample have at least one \emph{core}. While more than three \emph{cores} with different dynamical state are possible, the presence of a single \emph{core} in the superclusters is more common. Our work confirms the existence of nucleation regions in the internal structure of most rich superclusters and points to the fact that these \emph{cores} are the densest and most massive features that can be identified in the cosmic web with high probability for future virialization.</description>

      <title>Extension of the SpK Atomic Physics Code to Generate Global Equation of State Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global microphysics models are required for the modelling of high-energy-density physics (HEDP) experiments, the improvement of which are critical to the path to inertial fusion energy. This work presents further developments to the atomic and microphysics code, SpK, part of the numerical modelling suite of Imperial College London and First Light Fusion. We extend the capabilities of SpK to allow the calculation of the equation of state (EoS). The detailed configuration accounting calculations are interpolated into finite-temperature Thomas-Fermi calculations at high coupling to form the electronic component of the model. The Cowan model provides the ionic contribution, modified to approximate the physics of diatomic molecular dissociation. By utilising bonding corrections and performing a Maxwell construction, SpK captures the EoS from states ranging from the zero-pressure solid, through the liquid-vapour coexistence region and into plasma states. This global approach offers the benefit of capturing electronic shell structure over large regions of parameter space, building highly-resolved tables in minutes on a simple desktop. We present shock Hugoniot and off-Hugoniot calculations for a number of materials, comparing SpK to other models and experimental data. We also apply EoS and opacity data generated by SpK in integrated simulations of indirectly-driven capsule implosions, highlighting physical sensitivities to the choice of EoS models.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulations of 3D Ion Crystal Dynamics in a Penning Trap using the Fast Multipole Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate the dynamics, including laser cooling, of 3D ion crystals confined in a Penning trap using a newly developed molecular dynamics-like code. The numerical integration of the ions' equations of motion is accelerated using the fast multipole method to calculate the Coulomb interaction between ions, which allows us to efficiently study large ion crystals with thousands of ions. In particular, we show that the simulation time scales linearly with ion number, rather than with the square of the ion number. By treating the ions' absorption of photons as a Poisson process, we simulate individual photon scattering events to study laser cooling of 3D ellipsoidal ion crystals. Initial simulations suggest that these crystals can be efficiently cooled to ultracold temperatures, aided by the mixing of the easily cooled axial motional modes with the low frequency planar modes. In our simulations of a spherical crystal of 1,000 ions, the planar kinetic energy is cooled to several millikelvin in a few milliseconds while the axial kinetic energy and total potential energy are cooled even further. This suggests that 3D ion crystals could be well-suited as platforms for future quantum science experiments.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Inference in the Era of Tensor Networks and Differential Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic inference is a fundamental task in modern machine learning. Recent advances in tensor network (TN) contraction algorithms have enabled the development of better exact inference methods. However, many common inference tasks in probabilistic graphical models (PGMs) still lack corresponding TN-based adaptations. In this work, we advance the connection between PGMs and TNs by formulating and implementing tensor-based solutions for the following inference tasks: (i) computing the partition function, (ii) computing the marginal probability of sets of variables in the model, (iii) determining the most likely assignment to a set of variables, and (iv) the same as (iii) but after having marginalized a different set of variables. We also present a generalized method for generating samples from a learned probability distribution. Our work is motivated by recent technical advances in the fields of quantum circuit simulation, quantum many-body physics, and statistical physics. Through an experimental evaluation, we demonstrate that the integration of these quantum technologies with a series of algorithms introduced in this study significantly improves the effectiveness of existing methods for solving probabilistic inference tasks.</description>

      <title>Higher-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensors for Equivariant Message Passing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to perform fast and accurate atomistic simulations is crucial for advancing the chemical sciences. By learning from high-quality data, machine-learned interatomic potentials achieve accuracy on par with ab initio and first-principles methods at a fraction of their computational cost. The success of machine-learned interatomic potentials arises from integrating inductive biases such as equivariance to group actions on an atomic system, e.g., equivariance to rotations and reflections. In particular, the field has notably advanced with the emergence of equivariant message-passing architectures. Most of these models represent an atomic system using spherical tensors, tensor products of which require complicated numerical coefficients and can be computationally demanding. This work introduces higher-rank irreducible Cartesian tensors as an alternative to spherical tensors, addressing the above limitations. We integrate irreducible Cartesian tensor products into message-passing neural networks and prove the equivariance of the resulting layers. Through empirical evaluations on various benchmark data sets, we consistently observe on-par or better performance than that of state-of-the-art spherical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of complex systems such as neural networks is made particularly difficult by the overwhelming number of their interacting components. In the absence of prior knowledge, identifying a small but informative subset of network nodes on which the analysis should focus is a rather difficult task. In this work, we address this problem in the context of a Hopfield model, for which we seek representations given in terms of a subgroup of its neurons with the aim of identifying those that can reveal the largest amount of information about the system. Using a methodology based on concepts from information theory, we reveal that such optimised low-resolution representations are not only informative per se, but rather they also serve as probes of the neural network properties; these results show a tight and potentially fruitful relation between the level of detail at which the network is inspected and the type and amount of information that can be extracted from it.</description>

      <title>Lattice Boltzmann methods for soft flowing matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the last decade, the Lattice Boltzmann method has found major scope for the simulation of a large spectrum of problems in soft matter, from multiphase and multi-component microfluidic flows, to foams, emulsions, colloidal flows, to name but a few. Crucial to many such applications is the role of supramolecular interactions which occur whenever mesoscale structures, such as bubbles or droplets, come in close contact, say of the order of tens of nanometers. Regardless of their specific physico-chemical origin, such near-contact interactions are vital to preserve the coherence of the mesoscale structures against coalescence phenomena promoted by capillarity and surface tension, hence the need of including them in Lattice Boltzmann schemes. Strictly speaking, this entails a complex multiscale problem, covering about six spatial decades, from centimeters down to tens of nanometers, and almost twice as many in time. Such a multiscale problem can hardly be taken by a single computational method, hence the need for coarse-grained models for the near-contact interactions. In this review, we shall discuss such coarse-grained models and illustrate their application to a variety of soft flowing matter problems, such as soft flowing crystals, strongly confined dense emulsions, flowing hierarchical emulsions, soft granular flows, as well as the transmigration of active droplets across constrictions. Finally, we conclude with a few considerations on future developments in the direction of quantum-nanofluidics, machine learning, and quantum computing for soft flows applications.</description>

      <title>Neural Pfaffians: Solving Many Many-Electron Schr\"odinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural wave functions accomplished unprecedented accuracies in approximating the ground state of many-electron systems, though at a high computational cost. Recent works proposed amortizing the cost by learning generalized wave functions across different structures and compounds instead of solving each problem independently. Enforcing the permutation antisymmetry of electrons in such generalized neural wave functions remained challenging as existing methods require discrete orbital selection via non-learnable hand-crafted algorithms. This work tackles the problem by defining overparametrized, fully learnable neural wave functions suitable for generalization across molecules. We achieve this by relying on Pfaffians rather than Slater determinants. The Pfaffian allows us to enforce the antisymmetry on arbitrary electronic systems without any constraint on electronic spin configurations or molecular structure. Our empirical evaluation finds that a single neural Pfaffian calculates the ground state and ionization energies with chemical accuracy across various systems. On the TinyMol dataset, we outperform the `gold-standard' CCSD(T) CBS reference energies by 1.9m$E_h$ and reduce energy errors compared to previous generalized neural wave functions by up to an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Construction and sampling of alloy cluster expansions -- A tutorial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Crystalline alloys and related mixed systems make up a large family of materials with high tunability which have been proposed as the solution to a large number of energy related materials design problems. Due to the presence of chemical order and disorder in these systems, neither experimental efforts nor ab-initio computational methods alone are sufficient to span the inherently large configuration space. Therefore, fast and accurate models are necessary. To this end, cluster expansions have been widely and successfully used for the past decades. Cluster expansions are generalized Ising models designed to predict the energy of any atomic configuration of a system after training on a small subset of the available configurations. Constructing and sampling a cluster expansion consists of multiple steps that have to be performed with care. In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive guide to this process, highlighting important considerations and potential pitfalls. The tutorial consists of three parts, starting with cluster expansion construction for a relatively simple system, continuing with strategies for more challenging systems such as surfaces and closing with examples of Monte Carlo sampling of cluster expansions to study order-disorder transitions and phase diagrams.</description>

      <title>A Real-time Dyson Expansion Scheme: Efficient Inclusion of Dynamical Correlations in Non-equilibrium Spectral Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-resolved photoemission spectroscopy is the key technique to probe the real-time non-equilibrium dynamics of electronic states. Theoretical predictions of the time dependent spectral function for realistic systems is however, a challenge. Employing the Kadanoff-Baym equations to find this quantity results in a cubic scaling in the total number of time steps, quickly becoming prohibitive and often fail quantitatively and even qualitatively. In comparison, mean-field methods have more favorable numerical scaling both in the number of time steps and in the complexity associated with the cost of evolving for a single time step, however they miss key spectral properties such as emergent spectral features. Here we present a scheme that allows for the inclusion of dynamical correlations to the spectral function while maintaining the same scaling in the number of time steps as for mean-field approaches, while capturing the emergent physics. Further, the scheme can be efficiently implemented on top of equilibrium real-time many-body perturbation theory schemes and codes. We see excellent agreement with exact results for test systems. Furthermore we exemplify the method on a periodic system and demonstrate clear evidence that our proposed scheme produces complex spectral features including excitonic band replicas, features that are not observed using static mean-field approaches.</description>

      <title>Complete Realization of Energy Landscape and Non-equilibrium Trapping Dynamics in Spin Glass and Optimization Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.05330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy landscapes are high-dimensional surfaces representing the dependence of system energy on variable configurations, which determine crucially the system's emergent behavior but are difficult to be analyzed due to their high-dimensional nature. In this article, we introduce an approach to reveal the complete energy landscapes of small spin glasses and Boolean satisfiability problems, which also unravels their non-equilibrium dynamics at an arbitrary temperature for an arbitrarily long time. In contrary to our common belief, our results show that it can be less likely to identify the ground states when temperature decreases, due to trapping in individual local minima, which ceases at different time, leading to multiple abrupt jumps with time in the ground-state probability. Simulations agree well with theoretical predictions on these remarkable phenomena. Finally, for large systems, we introduce a variant approach to extract partially the energy landscapes and observe both analytically and in simulations similar phenomena. This work introduces new methodology to unravel the non-equilibrium dynamics of glassy systems, and provides us with a clear, complete and new physical picture on their long-time behaviors inaccessible by modern numerics.</description>

      <title>Fast, high-order numerical evaluation of volume potentials via polynomial density interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03844v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article presents a high-order accurate numerical method for the evaluation of singular volume integral operators, with attention focused on operators associated with the Poisson and Helmholtz equations in two dimensions. Following the ideas of the density interpolation method for boundary integral operators, the proposed methodology leverages Green's third identity and a local polynomial interpolant of the density function to recast the volume potential as a sum of single- and double-layer potentials and a volume integral with a regularized (bounded or smoother) integrand. The layer potentials can be accurately and efficiently evaluated everywhere in the plane by means of existing methods (e.g. the density interpolation method), while the regularized volume integral can be accurately evaluated by applying elementary quadrature rules. Compared to straightforwardly computing corrections for every singular and nearly-singular volume target, the method significantly reduces the amount of required specialized quadrature by pushing all singular and near-singular corrections to near-singular layer-potential evaluations at target points in a small neighborhood of the domain boundary. Error estimates for the regularization and quadrature approximations are provided. The method is compatible with well-established fast algorithms, being both efficient not only in the online phase but also to set-up. Numerical examples demonstrate the high-order accuracy and efficiency of the proposed methodology; applications to inhomogeneous scattering are presented.</description>

      <title>Quantum algorithm for collisionless Boltzmann simulation of self-gravitating systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16490v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The collisionless Boltzmann equation (CBE) is a fundamental equation that governs the dynamics of a broad range of astrophysical systems from space plasma to star clusters and galaxies. It is computationally expensive to integrate the CBE directly in a multi-dimensional phase space, and thus the applications to realistic astrophysical problems have been limited so far. Recently, Todorova &amp; Steijl (2020) proposed an efficient quantum algorithm to solve the CBE with significantly reduced computational complexity. We extend the algorithm to perform quantum simulations of self-gravitating systems, incorporating the method to calculate gravity with the major Fourier modes of the density distribution extracted from the solution-encoding quantum state. Our method improves the dependency of time and space complexities on Nv , the number of grid points in each velocity coordinate, compared to the classical simulation methods. We then conduct some numerical demonstrations of our method. We first run a 1+1 dimensional test calculation of free streaming motion on 64*64 grids using 13 simulated qubits and validate our method. We then perform simulations of Jeans collapse, and compare the result with analytic and linear theory calculations. It will thus allow us to perform large-scale CBE simulations on future quantum computers.</description>

      <title>A quantitative phase-field model for void evolution in defect supersaturated environments: a novel introduction of defect reaction asymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Voids develop in crystalline materials under energetic particle irradiation, as in nuclear reactors. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of void nucleation and growth is of utmost importance as it leads to dimensional instability of the metallic materials. In the past two decades, researchers have adopted the phase-field approach to study the phenomena of void evolution under irradiation. The approach involves modeling the boundary between the void and matrix with a diffused interface. However, none of the existing models are quantitative in nature. This work introduces a thermodynamically consistent, quantitative diffuse interface model based on KKS formalism to describe the void evolution under irradiation. The model concurrently considers both vacancies and self-interstitials in the description of void evolution. Unique to our model is the presence of two mobility parameters in the equation of motion of the phase-field variable. The two mobility parameters relate the driving force for vacancy and self-interstitial interaction to the interface motion, analogous to dislocation motion through climb and glide processes. The asymptotic matching of the phase-field model with the sharp-interface theory fixes the two mobility parameters in terms of the material parameters in the sharp-interface model. The Landau coefficient, which controls the height of the double-well function in the phase field variable, and the gradient coefficient of the phase field variable are fixed based on the interfacial energy and interface width of the boundary. With all the parameters in the model determined in terms of the material parameters, we thus have a new phase field model for void evolution. Simple test cases will show the void evolution under various defect supersaturation to validate our new phase-field model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.09782v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new velocity-gauge real-time, time-dependent density functional tight-binding (VG-rtTDDFTB) implementation in the open-source DFTB+ software package (https://dftbplus.org) for probing electronic excitations in large, condensed matter systems. Our VG-rtTDDFTB approach enables real-time electron dynamics simulations of large, periodic, condensed matter systems containing thousands of atoms with a favorable computational scaling as a function of system size. We provide computational details and benchmark calculations to demonstrate its accuracy and computational parallelizability on a variety of large material systems. As a representative example, we calculate laser-induced electron dynamics in a 512-atom amorphous silicon supercell to highlight the large periodic systems that can be examined with our implementation. Taken together, our VG-rtTDDFTB approach enables new electron dynamics simulations of complex systems that require large periodic supercells, such as crystal defects, complex surfaces, nanowires, and amorphous materials.</description>

      <title>Real-time quantum dynamics of thermal states with neural thermofields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving the time-dependent quantum many-body Schr\"odinger equation is a challenging task, especially for states at a finite temperature, where the environment affects the dynamics. Most existing approximating methods are designed to represent static thermal density matrices, 1D systems, and/or zero-temperature states. In this work, we propose a method to study the real-time dynamics of thermal states in two dimensions, based on thermofield dynamics, variational Monte Carlo, and neural-network quantum states. To this aim, we introduce two novel tools: (i) a procedure to accurately simulate the cooling down of arbitrary quantum variational states from infinite temperature, and (ii) a generic thermal (autoregressive) recurrent neural-network (ARNNO) Ansatz that allows for direct sampling from the density matrix using thermofield basis rotations. We apply our technique to the transverse-field Ising model subject to an additional longitudinal field and demonstrate that the time-dependent observables, including correlation operators, can be accurately reproduced for a 4x4 spin lattice. We provide predictions of the real-time dynamics on a 6x6 lattice that lies outside the reach of exact simulations.</description>

      <title>Adjoint Monte Carlo Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This survey explores the development of adjoint Monte Carlo methods for solving optimization problems governed by kinetic equations, a common challenge in areas such as plasma control and device design. These optimization problems are particularly demanding due to the high dimensionality of the phase space and the randomness in evaluating the objective functional, a consequence of using a forward Monte Carlo solver. To overcome these difficulties, a range of ``adjoint Monte Carlo methods'' have been devised. These methods skillfully combine Monte Carlo gradient estimators with PDE-constrained optimization, introducing innovative solutions tailored for kinetic applications. In this review, we begin by examining three primary strategies for Monte Carlo gradient estimation: the score function approach, the reparameterization trick, and the coupling method. We also delve into the adjoint-state method, an essential element in PDE-constrained optimization. Focusing on applications in the radiative transfer equation and the nonlinear Boltzmann equation, we provide a comprehensive guide on how to integrate Monte Carlo gradient techniques within both the optimize-then-discretize and the discretize-then-optimize frameworks from PDE-constrained optimization. This approach leads to the formulation of effective adjoint Monte Carlo methods, enabling efficient gradient estimation in complex, high-dimensional optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Closure Discovery for Coarse-Grained Partial Differential Equations Using Grid-based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00972v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable predictions of critical phenomena, such as weather, wildfires and epidemics often rely on models described by Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). However, simulations that capture the full range of spatio-temporal scales described by such PDEs are often prohibitively expensive. Consequently, coarse-grained simulations are usually deployed that adopt various heuristics and empirical closure terms to account for the missing information. We propose a novel and systematic approach for identifying closures in under-resolved PDEs using grid-based Reinforcement Learning. This formulation incorporates inductive bias and exploits locality by deploying a central policy represented efficiently by a Fully Convolutional Network (FCN). We demonstrate the capabilities and limitations of our framework through numerical solutions of the advection equation and the Burgers' equation. Our results show accurate predictions for in- and out-of-distribution test cases as well as a significant speedup compared to resolving all scales.</description>

      <title>TorchMD-Net 2.0: Fast Neural Network Potentials for Molecular Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Achieving a balance between computational speed, prediction accuracy, and universal applicability in molecular simulations has been a persistent challenge. This paper presents substantial advancements in the TorchMD-Net software, a pivotal step forward in the shift from conventional force fields to neural network-based potentials. The evolution of TorchMD-Net into a more comprehensive and versatile framework is highlighted, incorporating cutting-edge architectures such as TensorNet. This transformation is achieved through a modular design approach, encouraging customized applications within the scientific community. The most notable enhancement is a significant improvement in computational efficiency, achieving a very remarkable acceleration in the computation of energy and forces for TensorNet models, with performance gains ranging from 2-fold to 10-fold over previous iterations. Other enhancements include highly optimized neighbor search algorithms that support periodic boundary conditions and the smooth integration with existing molecular dynamics frameworks. Additionally, the updated version introduces the capability to integrate physical priors, further enriching its application spectrum and utility in research. The software is available at https://github.com/torchmd/torchmd-net.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Computations That Capture Strict Variationality, Volume Law Behavior, and the Efficient Representation of Neural Network States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03797v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a change of perspective on tensor network states that is defined by the computational graph of the contraction of an amplitude. The resulting class of states, which we refer to as tensor network functions, inherit the conceptual advantages of tensor network states while removing computational restrictions arising from the need to converge approximate contractions. We use tensor network functions to compute strict variational estimates of the energy on loopy graphs, analyze their expressive power for ground-states, show that we can capture aspects of volume law time evolution, and provide a mapping of general feed-forward neural nets onto efficient tensor network functions. Our work expands the realm of computable tensor networks to ones where accurate contraction methods are not available, and opens up new avenues to use tensor networks.</description>
