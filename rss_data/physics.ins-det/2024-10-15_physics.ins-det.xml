      <title>Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy of 2D Materials in a Scanning Electron Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work demonstrates electron energy loss spectroscopy of 2D materials in a 1-30 keV electron microscope, observing 100-times stronger electron-matter coupling relative to 125 keV microscopes. We observe that the universal curve relating beam energy to scattering holds for the transition from bulk graphite to graphene, albeit with a scale factor. We calculate that optimal coupling for most 2D materials and optical nanostructures falls in this range, concluding that spectroscopy of such systems will greatly benefit from use of this previously unexplored energy regime.</description>

      <title>FPGA-based digitizer for BGO-based time-of-flight PET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel FPGA-based bismuth germanate (BGO) time-of-flight (TOF) digitizer, implemented on an FPGA (VC707 evaluation kit, Xilinx). This digitizer was designed to address the recently highlighted characteristics of BGO, which generates scintillation and prompt Cerenkov photons when 511-keV photon interacts with BGO. The developed digitizer independently processes these two types of photons for precise energy and timing measurements. The digitizer incorporates a noise-resistant binary counter that measures energy signals using a time-over-threshold (TOT) method. For timing measurement, we employ an embedded dual-side monitoring time-to-digital converter (TDC), which efficiently captures timing information while maintaining low resource usage. We validated the efficacy of our FPGA-based TOF digitizer through extensive experiments, including both an electrical setup and a coincidence test using BGO pixels. Our evaluations of TOT energy and timing performance utilized two $3 \times 3 \times 20 \ \text{mm}^3$ BGO pixels coupled to CHK-HD MT silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs). The digitizer achieved a coincidence timing resolution (CTR) of 407 ps full width at half maximum (FWHM) for coincidence events falling within the full width at tenth maximum (FWTM) of the measured TOT energy spectrum. Notably, when measured with an oscilloscope, the same detector pair exhibited a CTR of 403 ps FWHM, confirming that the performance of the developed digitizer is comparable to that of oscilloscopes. With the low resource usage of our design, it offers significant potential for scalability, making it particularly promising for multi-channel BGO-based PET systems.</description>

      <title>Cross-Detection and Dual-Side Monitoring Schemes for FPGA-Based High-Accuracy and High-Precision Time-to-Digital Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based Time-to-Digital Converter (TDC) design suitable for high timing resolution applications, utilizing two new techniques. First, a cross-detection (CD) method is introduced that minimizes the occurrence of bubbles, which cause inaccuracy in the timing measurement of a TDC in thermometer codes, by altering the conventional sampling pattern, thereby yielding an average bin size half of its typical size. The second technique employs dual-side monitoring (DSM) of thermometer codes, including end-of-propagation (EOP) and start-of-propagation (SOP). Distinct from conventional TDCs, which focus solely on SOP thermometer codes, this technique utilizes EOP to calibrate SOP, simultaneously enhancing time resolution and the TDC's stability against changes in temperature and location. The proposed DSM scheme necessitates only an additional CARRY4 for capturing the EOP thermometer code, rendering it a resource-efficient solution. The CD-DSM TDC has been successfully implemented on a Virtex-7 Xilinx FPGA (a 28-nm process), with an average bin size of 6.1 ps and a root mean square of 3.8 ps. Compared to conventional TDCs, the CD-DSM TDC offers superior linearity. The successful measurement of ultra-high coincidence timing resolution (CTR) from two Cerenkov radiator integrated microchannel plate photomultiplier tubes (CRI-MCP-PMTs) was conducted with the CD-DSM TDCs for sub-100 ps timing measurements. A comparison with current-edge TDCs further highlights the superior performance of the CD-DSM TDCs.</description>

      <title>Development and performance evaluation of a thin GAGG:Ce scintillator plate for high resolution synchrotron radiation X-ray imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scintillator-based X-ray imaging detectors are pivotal in numerous scientific and practical domains, including medical imaging, and security monitoring. Recent advancements have spurred interest in 4D X-ray imaging using synchrotron radiation, necessitating higher temporal resolutions. Consequently, this places stringent demands on X-ray detector technology, especially when X-ray energy exceeds 20 keV. The selection of a suitable scintillator material is crucial for achieving optimal timing resolution, yet it poses a significant challenge in dynamic X-ray imaging. This study delves into the optimization of scintillator properties and their impact on spatial resolution and light output, elucidating the performance of Ce-doped Gd3Ga3Al2O12 (GAGG:Ce) scintillators for X-ray imaging applications. We developed a micro X-ray imaging detector using a 100 $\mu$m-thick GAGG:Ce scintillator plate and conducted X-ray imaging tests at the Aichi SR facility. The results demonstrated that the resolution, quantified as the chart slit width at a contrast transfer function (CTF) value of 10%, reached 2 - 3 $\mu$m with a 4x lens, 0.52 $\mu$m $\pm$ 0.03 $\mu$m with a 20x lens, and 0.42 $\mu$m $\pm$ 0.01 $\mu$m with a 40x lens. Although the results of this study did not achieve a spatial resolution nearing the effective pixel size of the 40x lens, the text also elucidates the underlying reasons for this limitation. Furthermore, we compared the X-ray sensitivity of our GAGG:Ce scintillator plate with that of a commercial LuAG:Ce scintillator, revealing an approximately 1.5-fold increase in light output. As a demonstration, transmission images of dried small fish were captured using the GAGG:Ce scintillator plate and the developed X-ray imaging system. These findings highlight the potential of the X-ray imaging detector devised in this study for future generations of X-ray imaging applications.</description>

      <title>Simplified Efficiency Calibration Methods for Scintillation Detectors Used in Nuclear Remediation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our study introduces innovative methods to address waste reduction and enhance resource efficiency in nuclear cleanup processes. We focus on sustainable nuclear technology, aligning with goals for cleaner production and environmental protection. We developed two novel methods, termed "oversimplified" and "simplified," for easily determining the photopeak efficiency of NaI(Tl) scintillation detectors. These methods, along with a "general" solution method, were validated with calibrated radioactive sources such as 241Am, 57Co, 133Ba, 137Cs, and 60Co, and were used to commission a NaI(Tl) scintillation detector system at Chalk River Laboratories (CRL) for nuclear remediation. The system demonstrated high accuracy, making it suitable for screening unstable isotopes at contaminated sites. This screening tool significantly reduces the number of soil samples requiring detailed characterization, thereby lowering operational costs. The NaI(Tl) detector system was calibrated for near-contact geometry, which is commonly used at CRL. Detection limits were established for this configuration. By improving the efficiency calibration of scintillation detectors, our study advances sustainable nuclear remediation practices, promoting environmental sustainability and cleaner production processes.</description>

      <title>TraX Engine: Advanced Processing of Radiation Data Acquired by Timepix Detectors in Space, Medical, Educational and Imaging Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TraX Engine is an advanced data processing tool developed by ADVACAM in collaboration with the European Space Agency (ESA), specifically designed for analyzing data from Timepix detectors equipped with various sensor materials (Si, CdTe, GaAs, SiC). TraX Engine can process large datasets across various scientific and medical applications, including space radiation monitoring, particle therapy, and imaging. In space applications, the TraX Engine has been used to process data from satellites like OneWeb JoeySat deployed in LEO orbit, where it continuously monitors space radiation environments measuring flux, dose, and dose rate in real-time. In medical applications, particularly in particle therapy, the TraX Engine is used to process data to characterize radiation fields in terms of particle flux, Linear Energy Transfer, and spatial distribution of the radiation dose. The TraX Engine can identify and classify scattered particles, such as secondary protons and electrons, and estimate their contribution to out-of-field doses. In imaging applications, the TraX Engine is integrated into Compton cameras, where it supports photon source localization through directional reconstruction of photons. The system ability to identify gamma radiation source with high precision makes it suitable for medical imaging tasks, such as tracking I-131 used in thyroid cancer treatment or localizing radiation sources. This paper presents the architecture and capabilities of the newly developed software TraX Engine, alongside results from various applications, demonstrating its role in particle tracking, radiation monitoring, imaging, and others. With its modular architecture, the TraX Engine offers multiple interfaces, including a command-line tool, an API, a web portal, and a graphical user interface, ensuring usability across different fields and user expertise levels.</description>

      <title>Dual-Mode Calorimetric Superconducting Nanowire Single Photon Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A dual-operation mode SNSPD is demonstrated. In the conventional Geiger SNSPD mode the sensor operates at temperatures well below the critical temperature, Tc, working as an event counter without sensitivity to the number of photons impinging the sensor. In the calorimetric mode, the detector is operated at temperatures just below Tc and displays photon-number sensitivity for wavelengths in the optical spectrum. In this energy sensitive mode, photon absorption causes Joule heating of the SNSPD that becomes partially resistive without the presence of latching. Depending on the application, by tuning the sample temperature and bias current using the same readout system, the SNSPD can readily switch between the two modes. In the calorimetric mode, SNSPD recovery times shorter than the ones in the Geiger mode are observed, reaching values as low as 580ps. Dual-mode SNSPD's may provide significant advancements in spectroscopy and calorimetry, where precise timing, photon counting and energy resolution are required.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ALICE apparatus at CERN has undergone significant upgrade during the LHC's Long Shutdown 2 to increase the experiment's rate capability and measurement precision for Run 3 and Run 4. One of the key detectors newly introduced to the experiment is the Fast Interaction Trigger (FIT). Featuring minimal dead time, FIT provides a comprehensive trigger menu, including the minimum bias trigger with an efficiency exceeding 90 percent in proton-proton collisions. It also provides centrality, event plane, and background measurement capabilities. Precision of the collision time measurements performed by FIT reached remarkable values of 17 ps (sigma) in proton-proton collisions and 4.4 ps (sigma) in Pb-Pb collisions. This paper details FIT's design, performance, and the technical novelties made to meet the stringent environmental requirements of ALICE.</description>

      <title>An FPGA-based Versatile and Digitalized Method for Pulse Laser Repetition Frequency Locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel method for locking the repetition frequency of pulse lasers, adaptable to different frequencies,offering significant improvements in system integration and measurement accuracy. The method consists of two primary components: an error amplification module (EAM) and a digital frequency locking module (DFLM) based on FPGA. The EAM integrates a configurable frequency generator (CFG), a configurable frequency multiplier (CFM) and a mixer,to process the laser pulse alongside a high-stability reference source, such as an atomic clock. By employing frequency multiplication and mixing, the EAM amplifies the laser's frequency error and performs frequency down-conversion,enhancing measurement sensitivity and reducing the hardware requirements of the back-end.The CFG, implemented on a phase-locked loop (PLL) chip, allows for parameter adjustments to accommodate various laser frequencies.The DFLM processes the output from the EAM using a high-speed, ADC-based dual-mixer time-difference (DMTD) method to precisely measure frequency errors.A digital proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller then provides feedback to achieve accurate frequency locking. To evaluate the proposed method, an FPGA-based electronic system was developed and tested. In laboratory experiment with a custom-built femtosecond fiber laser, the system demonstrated robust locking of the repetition rate, achieving an Allan deviation improvement from $1.51 \times 10^{-7}$ to $1.12 \times 10^{-12}$ at a gate time of 10 s.Further testing with a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) confirmed a long-term stability of $9.58 \times 10^{-14} @ 10 s$.</description>

      <title>Regression Model for Speckled Data with Extremely Variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is an efficient and widely used remote sensing tool. However, data extracted from SAR images are contaminated with speckle, which precludes the application of techniques based on the assumption of additive and normally distributed noise. One of the most successful approaches to describing such data is the multiplicative model, where intensities can follow a variety of distributions with positive support. The $\mathcal{G}^0_I$ model is among the most successful ones. Although several estimation methods for the $\mathcal{G}^0_I$ parameters have been proposed, there is no work exploring a regression structure for this model. Such a structure could allow us to infer unobserved values from available ones. In this work, we propose a $\mathcal{G}^0_I$ regression model and use it to describe the influence of intensities from other polarimetric channels. We derive some theoretical properties for the new model: Fisher information matrix, residual measures, and influential tools. Maximum likelihood point and interval estimation methods are proposed and evaluated by Monte Carlo experiments. Results from simulated and actual data show that the new model can be helpful for SAR image analysis.</description>

      <title>AI-based particle track identification in scintillating fibres read out with imaging sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the development and application of an AI-based method for particle track identification using scintillating fibres read out with imaging sensors. We propose a variational autoencoder (VAE) to efficiently filter and identify frames containing signal from the substantial data generated by SPAD array sensors. Our VAE model, trained on purely background frames, demonstrated a high capability to distinguish frames containing particle tracks from background noise. The performance of the VAE-based anomaly detection was validated with experimental data, demonstrating the method's ability to efficiently identify relevant events with rapid processing time, suggesting a solid prospect for deployment as a fast inference tool on hardware for real-time anomaly detection. This work highlights the potential of combining advanced sensor technology with machine learning techniques to enhance particle detection and tracking.</description>

      <title>Design of a CsI(Tl) Calorimeter for Muonium-to-Antimuonium Conversion Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Muonium-to-Antimuonium Conversion Experiment (MACE) is proposed to search for charged lepton flavor violation and increase the sensitivity by three orders of magnitude compared to the PSI experiment in the 1990s. A clear signature of this conversion is the positron produced from antimuonium decay. This paper presents a near-$4\pi$-coverage calorimeter designed for MACE, which can provide an energy resolution of 9% at 511 keV, and a signal efficiency of 55.5% for annihilation $\gamma$-ray events at maximum. Detailed Monte-Carlo simulations using MACE offline software based on \textsc{Geant4} are performed for geometry optimization, coincidence system design, background estimation, and benchmark detector validation.</description>

      <title>Dataset of Tensile Properties for Sub-sized Specimens of Nuclear Structural Materials</title>

Abstract: Mechanical testing with sub-sized specimens plays an important role in the nuclear industry, facilitating tests in confined experimental spaces with lower irradiation levels and accelerating the qualification of new materials. The reduced size of specimens results in different material behavior at the microscale, mesoscale, and macroscale, in comparison to standard-sized specimens, which is referred to as the specimen size effect. Although analytical models have been proposed to correlate the properties of sub-sized specimens to standard-sized specimens, these models lack broad applicability across different materials and testing conditions. The objective of this study is to create the first large public dataset of tensile properties for sub-sized specimens used in nuclear structural materials. We performed an extensive literature review of relevant publications and extracted over 1,000 tensile testing records comprising 54 parameters including material type and composition, manufacturing information, irradiation conditions, specimen dimensions, and tensile properties. The dataset can serve as a valuable resource to investigate the specimen size effect and develop computational methods to correlate the tensile properties of sub-sized specimens.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic measurements and models of energy deposition in the substrate of quantum circuits by natural ionizing radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Naturally occurring background radiation is a source of correlated decoherence events in superconducting qubits that will challenge error-correction schemes. To characterize the radiation environment in an unshielded laboratory, we performed broadband, spectroscopic measurements of background events in silicon substrates located inside a millikelvin refrigerator, an environment representative of superconducting qubit systems. We measured the background spectra in silicon substrates of two thicknesses, 0.5 mm and 1.5 mm, and obtained the average event rate and the integrated power deposition. In a 25 mm^2 area and the thinner substrate, these values are 0.023 events per second and 4.9 keV/s, counting events that deposit at least 40 keV. We find the background spectrum to be nearly featureless. Its intensity decreases by a factor of 40,000 between 100 keV and 3 MeV for silicon substrates 0.5 mm thick. We find the cryogenic measurements to be in good agreement with predictions based on measurements of the terrestrial gamma-ray flux, published models of cosmic-ray fluxes, a crude model of the cryostat, and radiation-transport simulations. No free parameters are required to predict the background spectra in the silicon substrates. The good agreement between measurements and predictions allow assessment of the relative contributions of terrestrial and cosmic background sources and their dependence on substrate thickness. Our spectroscopic measurements are performed with superconducting microresonators that transduce deposited energy to a readily detectable electrical signal. We find that gamma-ray emissions from radioisotopes are responsible for the majority of events depositing E&lt;1.5 MeV, while nucleons among the cosmic-ray secondary particles cause most events that deposit more energy. These results suggest several paths to reducing the impact of background radiation on quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Electric Field Reconstruction with Information Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing the electric field from the measured voltages in an antenna, unfolding the antenna response, comes with several problems. Due to the noisiness of the signal it is often necessary to disregard part of the bandwidth of the antenna. It is also not guaranteed, that this system of equations can be inverted at all. In any case, the noise of the measurement will be converted into noise on the electric field. This could be solved by Bayesian inference, however, the electric field is continuous, which would lead to an infinite-dimensional latent space. Information field theory (IFT) has been developed to deal with this problem and allow for Bayesian reasoning on fields. It provides a theoretical backbone and effective tools to approach the inference as a discrete problem in the continuum limit, taking the continuous nature of fields into account. We will present a first working signal model that can be used with IFT-based inference algorithms, which can successfully reconstruct the electric field. The model is based on the current understanding of air shower emission physics, modelling geomagnetic and charge-excess emission and their respective polarisation and spectra separately. Since Bayesian inference provides the posterior distribution, this method also gives an estimate on the uncertainty of the measured field. The performance of this method will be demonstrated with Monte-Carlo simulations of air shower radio signals.</description>
