      <title>Pressure dependence of liquid iron viscosity from machine-learning molecular dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have developed a machine-learning potential that accurately models the behavior of iron under the conditions of Earth's core. By performing numerous nanosecond scale equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, the viscosities of liquid iron for the whole outer core conditions are obtained with much less uncertainty. We find that the Einstein-Stokes relation is not accurate for outer core conditions. The viscosity is on the order of 10s \si{mPa.s}, in agreement with previous first-principles results. We present a viscosity map as a function of pressure and temperature for liquid iron useful for geophysical modeling.</description>

      <title>Seismic resolution enhancement via deep Learning with Knowledge Distillation and Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution processing of seismic signals is crucial for subsurface geological characterization and thin-layer reservoir identification. Traditional high-resolution algorithms can partially recover high-frequency information but often lack robustness, computational efficiency, and consideration of inter-trace structural relationships. Many deep learning methods use end-to-end architectures that do not incorporate prior knowledge or address data domain disparities, leading to limited generalization.To overcome these challenges, this paper presents the Domain-Adaptive Knowledge Distillation Network (DAKD-Net), which integrates a knowledge distillation strategy with a domain adaptation mechanism for high-resolution seismic data processing. Trained on datasets from forward modeling, DAKD-Net establishes physical relationships between low and high-resolution data, extracting high-frequency prior knowledge during a guided phase before detail restoration without prior conditions. Domain adaptation enhances the model's generalization to real seismic data, improving both generalization capability and structural expression accuracy.DAKD-Net employs a U-Net backbone to extract spatial structural information from multi-trace seismic profiles. The knowledge distillation mechanism enables prior knowledge transfer, allowing recovery of high-resolution data directly from low-resolution inputs. Domain-adaptive fine-tuning further enhances the network's performance in actual survey areas. Experimental results show that DAKD-Net outperforms traditional methods and classical deep networks in longitudinal resolution and complex structural detail restoration, demonstrating strong robustness and practicality.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Approach to Quantifying Uncertainty in Meteoroid Physical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meteoroid bulk density is a critical value required for assessing impact risks to spacecraft, informing shielding and mission design. Direct bulk density measurements for sub-millimeter to millimeter-sized meteoroids are difficult, often relying on forward modeling without robust uncertainty estimates. Methods based solely on select observables can overlook noise-induced biases and non-linear relations between physical parameters. This study aims to automate the inversion of meteoroid physical parameters from optical meteor data, focusing on bulk density and its associated uncertainties. We compare an observables-based selection method (PCA) with an RMSD-based approach used to select among millions of ablation model runs using full light and deceleration curves as constraints. After validating both approaches on six synthetic test cases, we apply them to two Perseid meteors recorded by high sensitivity Electron-Multiplied CCD (EMCCD) cameras and high precision mirror-tracked meteors detected by the Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory (CAMO). Our results show that relying only on observables, as in the PCA approach can converge to wrong solutions and can yield unphysical solutions. In contrast, the RMSD-based method offers more reliable density constraints, particularly for bright and strongly decelerating meteor. Small relative measurement precision in brightness and lag relative to the full range of observed lag and luminosity is the key to tight solution. We provide the first objectively derived uncertainty bounds for the physical properties of meteoroids. Our approach solves the solution degeneracy problem inherent in forward modelling of meteors. This strategy can be generalized to other showers, paving the way for improved meteoroid models and enhanced spacecraft safety.</description>

      <title>On the Efficacy of Ocean Formation with a Primordial Hydrogen Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that Earth's present water budget formed from oxidation reactions between its initial hydrogen-rich primordial atmosphere and its magma ocean. Here we examine this hypothesis by building a comprehensive atmosphere-magma ocean model. We find that water formation is unlikely for two reasons. First, any water formed from oxidation reactions in the magma ocean would quickly outgass because of the water-poor atmosphere above. Second, the top boundary layer of the magma ocean becomes stable against convection because the oxidation reactions produce metallic iron, which sinks to the core of a growing Earth. This iron loss makes the top boundary layer significantly more buoyant than the rest of the magma, thus becoming stable against mixing. Our results suggest that hydrogen dissolution is unlikely to play a major role in the formation of Earth's oceans.</description>
