      <title>Flip Dynamics for Sampling Colorings: Improving $(11/6-\epsilon)$ Using a Simple Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present improved bounds for randomly sampling $k$-colorings of graphs with maximum degree $\Delta$; our results hold without any further assumptions on the graph. The Glauber dynamics is a simple single-site update Markov chain. Jerrum (1995) proved an optimal $O(n\log{n})$ mixing time bound for Glauber dynamics whenever $k&gt;2\Delta$ where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the input graph. This bound was improved by Vigoda (1999) to $k &gt; (11/6)\Delta$ using a "flip" dynamics which recolors (small) maximal 2-colored components in each step. Vigoda's result was the best known for general graphs for 20 years until Chen et al. (2019) established optimal mixing of the flip dynamics for $k &gt; (11/6 - \epsilon ) \Delta$ where $\epsilon \approx 10^{-5}$. We present the first substantial improvement over these results. We prove an optimal mixing time bound of $O(n\log{n})$ for the flip dynamics when $k \geq 1.809 \Delta$. This yields, through recent spectral independence results, an optimal $O(n\log{n})$ mixing time for the Glauber dynamics for the same range of $k/\Delta$ when $\Delta=O(1)$. Our proof utilizes path coupling with a simple weighted Hamming distance for "unblocked" neighbors.</description>

      <title>Balanced assignments of periodic tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work deals with a problem of assigning periodic tasks to employees in such a way that each employee performs each task with the same frequency in the long term. The motivation comes from a collaboration with the SNCF, the main French railway company. An almost complete solution is provided under the form of a necessary and sufficient condition that can be checked in polynomial time. A complementary discussion about possible extensions is also proposed.</description>

      <title>A linear-time algorithm for $(1+\epsilon)\Delta$-edge-coloring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a randomized algorithm that, given $\epsilon &gt; 0$, outputs a proper $(1+\epsilon)\Delta$-edge-coloring of an $m$-edge simple graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta \geq 1/\epsilon$ in $O(m\,\log(1/\epsilon)/\epsilon^4)$ time. For constant $\epsilon$, this is the first linear-time algorithm for this problem without any restrictions on $\Delta$ other than the necessary bound $\Delta \geq 1/\epsilon$. The best previous result in this direction, very recently obtained by Assadi, gives a randomized algorithm with expected running time $O(m \, \log(1/\epsilon))$ under the assumption $\Delta \gg \log n/\epsilon$; removing the lower bound on $\Delta$ was explicitly mentioned as a challenging open problem by Bhattacharya, Costa, Panski, and Solomon. Indeed, even for edge-coloring with $2\Delta - 1$ colors (i.e., meeting the "greedy" bound), no linear-time algorithm covering the full range of $\Delta$ has been known until now. Additionally, when $\epsilon = 1/\Delta$, our result yields an $O(m\,\Delta^4\log \Delta)$-time algorithm for $(\Delta+1)$-edge-coloring, improving the bound $O(m\, \Delta^{17})$ from the authors' earlier work.</description>

      <title>Crossing Numbers of Beyond Planar Graphs Re-revisited: A Framework Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond planarity concepts (prominent examples include k-planarity or fan-planarity) apply certain restrictions on the allowed patterns of crossings in drawings. It is natural to ask, how much the number of crossings may increase over the traditional (unrestricted) crossing number. Previous approaches to bound such ratios, e.g. [arXiv:1908.03153, arXiv:2105.12452], require very specialized constructions and arguments for each considered beyond planarity concept, and mostly only yield asymptotically non-tight bounds. We propose a very general proof framework that allows us to obtain asymptotically tight bounds, and where the concept-specific parts of the proof typically boil down to a couple of lines. We show the strength of our approach by giving improved or first bounds for several beyond planarity concepts.</description>

      <title>$\theta$-free matching covered graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nontrivial connected graph is matching covered if each edge belongs to some perfect matching. For most problems pertaining to perfect matchings, one may restrict attention to matching covered graphs; thus, there is extensive literature on them. A cornerstone of this theory is an ear decomposition result due to Lov\'asz and Plummer. Their theorem is a fundamental problem-solving tool, and also yields interesting open problems; we discuss two such problems below, and we solve one of them.
  A subgraph $H$ of a graph $G$ is conformal if $G-V(H)$ has a perfect matching. This notion is intrinsically related to the aforementioned ear decomposition theorem -- which implies that each matching covered graph (apart from $K_2$ and even cycles) contains a conformal bisubdivision of $\theta$, or a conformal bisubdivision of $K_4$, possibly both. (Here, $\theta$ refers to the graph with two vertices joined by three edges.) This immediately leads to two problems: characterize $\theta$-free (likewise, $K_4$-free) matching covered graphs. A characterization of planar $K_4$-free matching covered graphs was obtained by Kothari and Murty [J. Graph Theory, 82 (1), 2016]; the nonplanar case is open.
  We provide a characterization of $\theta$-free matching covered graphs that immediately implies a poly-time algorithm for the corresponding decision problem. Our characterization relies heavily on a seminal result due to Edmonds, Lov\'asz and Pulleyblank [Combinatorica, 2, 1982] pertaining to the tight cut decomposition theory of matching covered graphs. As corollaries, we provide two upper bounds on the size of a $\theta$-free graph, namely, $m\leq 2n-1$ and $m\leq \frac{3n}{2}+b-1$, where $b$ denotes the number of bricks obtained in any tight cut decomposition of the graph; for each bound, we provide a characterization of the tight examples. The Petersen graph and $K_4$ play key roles in our results.</description>

      <title>A Fair Post-Processing Method based on the MADD Metric for Predictive Student Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive student models are increasingly used in learning environments. However, due to the rising social impact of their usage, it is now all the more important for these models to be both sufficiently accurate and fair in their predictions. To evaluate algorithmic fairness, a new metric has been developed in education, namely the Model Absolute Density Distance (MADD). This metric enables us to measure how different a predictive model behaves regarding two groups of students, in order to quantify its algorithmic unfairness. In this paper, we thus develop a post-processing method based on this metric, that aims at improving the fairness while preserving the accuracy of relevant predictive models' results. We experiment with our approach on the task of predicting student success in an online course, using both simulated and real-world educational data, and obtain successful results. Our source code and data are in open access at https://github.com/melinaverger/MADD .</description>

      <title>An analogue of Reed's conjecture for digraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reed in 1998 conjectured that every graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \lceil \frac{\Delta(G)+1+\omega(G)}{2} \rceil$. As a partial result, he proved the existence of $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ for which every graph $G$ satisfies $\chi(G) \leq \lceil (1-\varepsilon)(\Delta(G)+1)+\varepsilon\omega(G) \rceil$. We propose an analogue conjecture for digraphs. Given a digraph $D$, we denote by $\vec{\chi}(D)$ the dichromatic number of $D$, which is the minimum number of colours needed to partition $D$ into acyclic induced subdigraphs. We let $\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D)$ denote the size of the largest biclique (a set of vertices inducing a complete digraph) of $D$ and $\tilde{\Delta}(D) = \max_{v\in V(D)} \sqrt{d^+(v) \cdot d^-(v)}$. We conjecture that every digraph $D$ satisfies $\vec{\chi}(D) \leq \lceil \frac{\tilde{\Delta}(D)+1+\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D)}{2} \rceil$, which if true implies Reed's conjecture. As a partial result, we prove the existence of $\varepsilon &gt;0$ for which every digraph $D$ satisfies $\vec{\chi}(D) \leq \lceil (1-\varepsilon)(\tilde{\Delta}(D)+1)+\varepsilon\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D) \rceil$. This implies both Reed's result and an independent result of Harutyunyan and Mohar for oriented graphs.
  To obtain this upper bound on $\vec{\chi}$, we prove that every digraph $D$ with $\overleftrightarrow{\omega}(D) &gt; \frac{2}{3}(\Delta_{\max}(D)+1)$, where $\Delta_{\max}(D) = \max_{v\in V(D)} \max(d^+(v),d^-(v))$, admits an acyclic set of vertices intersecting each biclique of $D$, which generalises a result of King.</description>

      <title>Planar graphs in blowups of fans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that every $n$-vertex planar graph is contained in the graph obtained from a fan by blowing up each vertex by a complete graph of order $O(\sqrt{n}\log^2 n)$. Equivalently, every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ has a set $X$ of $O(\sqrt{n}\log^2 n)$ vertices such that $G-X$ has bandwidth $O(\sqrt{n}\log^2 n)$. This result holds in the more general setting of graphs contained in the strong product of a bounded treewidth graph and a path, which includes bounded genus graphs, graphs excluding a fixed apex graph as a minor, and $k$-planar graphs for fixed $k$. These results are obtained using two ingredients. The first is a new local sparsification lemma, which shows that every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ has a set of $O((n\log n)/D)$ vertices whose removal results in a graph with local density at most $D$. The second is a generalization of a method of Feige and Rao, that relates bandwidth and local density using volume-preserving Euclidean embeddings.</description>

Abstract: Logical modeling is a powerful tool in biology, offering a system-level understanding of the complex interactions that govern biological processes. A gap that hinders the scalability of logical models is the need to specify the update function of every vertex in the network depending on the status of its predecessors. To address this, we introduce in this paper the concept of strong regulation, where a vertex is only updated to active/inactive if all its predecessors agree in their influences; otherwise, it is set to ambiguous. We explore the interplay between active, inactive, and ambiguous influences in a network. We discuss the existence of phenotype attractors in such networks, where the status of some of the variables is fixed to active/inactive, while the others can have an arbitrary status, including ambiguous.</description>

      <title>Constrained Shortest-Path Reformulations via Decision Diagrams for Structured Two-stage Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.12962v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many discrete optimization problems are amenable to constrained shortest-path reformulations in an extended network space, a technique that has been key in convexification, bound strengthening, and search. In this paper, we propose a constrained variant of these models for two challenging classes of discrete two-stage optimization problems, where traditional methods (e.g., dualize-and-combine) are not applicable compared to their continuous counterparts. Specifically, we propose a framework that models problems as decision diagrams and introduces side constraints either as linear inequalities in the underlying polyhedral representation, or as state variables in shortest-path dynamic programming models. For our first structured class, we investigate two-stage problems with interdiction constraints. We show that such constraints can be formulated as indicator functions in the arcs of the diagram, providing an alternative single-level reformulation of the problem via a network-flow representation. Our second structured class is classical robust optimization, where we leverage the decision diagram network to iteratively identify label variables, akin to an L-shaped method. We evaluate these strategies on a competitive project selection problem and the robust traveling salesperson with time windows, observing considerable improvements in computational efficiency as compared to general methods in the respective areas.</description>

Abstract: For most problems pertaining to perfect matchings, one may restrict attention to matching covered graphs -- that is, connected nontrivial graphs with the property that each edge belongs to some perfect matching. There is extensive literature on these graphs that are also known as $1$-extendable graphs (since each edge extends to a perfect matching) including an ear decomposition theorem due to Lovasz and Plummer.
  A cycle $C$ of a graph $G$ is conformal if $G-V(C)$ has a perfect matching; such cycles play an important role in the study of perfect matchings, especially when investigating the Pfaffian orientation problem. A matching covered graph $G$ is cycle-extendable if -- for each even cycle $C$ -- the cycle $C$ is conformal, or equivalently, each perfect matching of $C$ extends to a perfect matching of $G$, or equivalently, $C$ is the symmetric difference of two perfect matchings of $G$, or equivalently, $C$ extends to an ear decomposition of $G$. In the literature, these are also known as cycle-nice or as $1$-cycle resonant graphs.
  Zhang, Wang, Yuan, Ng and Cheng [Discrete Mathematics, 345:7 (2022), 112876] provided a characterization of claw-free cycle-extendable graphs. Guo and Zhang [Discrete Mathematics, 275:1-3 (2004), 151-164] and independently Zhang and Li [Discrete Applied Mathematics, 160:13-14 (2012), 2069-2074], provided characterizations of bipartite planar cycle-extendable graphs. In this paper, we establish a characterization of all planar cycle-extendable graphs -- in terms of $K_2$ and four infinite families.</description>

      <title>The reflection complexity of sequences over finite alphabets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In combinatorics on words, the well-studied factor complexity function $\rho_{\bf x}$ of a sequence ${\bf x}$ over a finite alphabet counts, for any nonnegative integer $n$, the number of distinct length-$n$ factors of ${\bf x}$. In this paper, we introduce the \emph{reflection complexity} function $r_{\bf x}$ to enumerate the factors occurring in a sequence ${\bf x}$, up to reversing the order of symbols in a word. We introduce and prove results on $r_{\bf x}$ regarding its growth properties and relationship with other complexity functions. We prove that if ${\bf x}$ is $k$-automatic, then $r_{\bf x}$ is computably $k$-regular, and we use the software {\tt Walnut} to evaluate the reflection complexity of automatic sequences, such as the Thue--Morse sequence. We prove a Morse--Hedlund-type result characterizing eventually periodic sequences in terms of their reflection complexity, and we deduce a characterization of Sturmian sequences. Furthermore, we investigate the reflection complexity of episturmian, $(s+1)$-dimensional billiard, and Rote sequences. There are still many unanswered questions about this measure.</description>
