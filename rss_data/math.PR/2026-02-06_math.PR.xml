      <title>Strong local nondeterminism for stochastic time-fractional slow and fast diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of stochastic time-fractional equations on $\mathbb{R}^d$ driven by a centered Gaussian noise, involving a Caputo time derivative of order $\beta&gt;0$, a fractional (power) Laplacian of order $\alpha&gt;0$, and a Riemann-Liouville time integral of order $\gamma\ge0$ acting on the noise. The noise is fractional in time (index $H$) and Riesz-type in space (index $\ell$). We derive sharp Dalang-type necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a random field solution across almost full parameter range $(\alpha,\beta,\gamma;H,\ell)$. Under the Dalang-type conditions, we prove sharp variance bounds for temporal and spatial increments, as well as strong local nondeterminism in time in several regimes (two-sided version for $\beta=1$ and for parts of the case $\beta=2$; one-sided version for $0&lt;\beta&lt;2$) and strong local nondeterminism in space for the whole range of parameters. As applications, we derive exact uniform and local moduli of continuity, Chung-type laws of the iterated logarithm, and quantitative bounds on small ball probabilities. Along the way, we obtain sharp asymptotics for the fundamental solution kernels at $0$ and $\infty$, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Full-Covariance Chemical Langevin Predator--Prey Diffusion with Absorbing Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many stochastic Rosenzweig--MacArthur predator--prey models inject ad hoc independent (diagonal) noise and therefore cannot encode the event-level coupling created by predation and biomass conversion. We derive an absorbed, fully mechanistic diffusion approximation and its extinction structure from a continuous-time Markov chain on $\mathbb N_0^2$ with four reaction channels: prey birth, prey competition death, predator death, and a coupled predation--conversion event. Absorbing coordinate axes are imposed to represent the irreversibility of demographic extinction. Under Kurtz density-dependent scaling, the law-of-large-numbers limit recovers the classical RM ODE, while central-limit scaling yields a chemical-Langevin diffusion with explicit drift and full state-dependent covariance. A distinctive signature is the strictly negative cross-covariance $\Sigma_{12}(N,P)=-mNP/(1+N)$ induced solely by the predation--conversion increment $(-1,1)$. We define the absorbed It\^o SDE by freezing trajectories at the first boundary hit and prove strong well-posedness, non-explosion, and moment bounds up to absorption. Extinction has positive probability from every interior state, and predator extinction is almost sure when $m\le c$.</description>

      <title>On the Resistance Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an affirmative answer to the resistance conjecture on characterization of parabolic Harnack inequalities in terms of volume doubling, upper capacity bounds and a Poincar\'e inequalities. The key step is to show that these three assumptions imply the so called cutoff Sobolev inequality, an important inequality in the study of anomalous diffusions, Dirichlet forms and re-scaled energies in fractals. This implication is shown in the general setting of $p$-Dirichlet Spaces introduced by the author and Murugan, and thus a unified treatment becomes possible to proving Harnack inequalities and stability phenomena in both analysis on metric spaces and fractals and for graphs and manifolds for all exponents $p\in (1,\infty)$. As an application, we also show that a Dirichlet space satisfying volume doubling, Poincar\'e and upper capacity bounds has finite martingale dimension and admits a type of differential structure similar to the work of Cheeger. In the course of the proof, we establish methods of extension and characterizations of Sobolev functions by Poincar\'e-inequalities, and extend the methods of Jones and Koskela to the general setting of $p$-Dirichlet spaces.</description>

      <title>Long-time asymptotics for Airy wanderer line ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time behavior of the Airy wanderer line ensembles, an infinite-parameter family of Brownian Gibbsian line ensembles arising as edge-scaling limits of inhomogeneous models in the Kardar--Parisi--Zhang universality class. These ensembles are governed by sequences of nonnegative parameters that encode the asymptotic slopes of the curves at positive and negative infinity. Our main results characterize the fluctuations around this leading-order behavior and establish functional limit theorems for the ensembles near both ends of the spatial axis.
  We show that, at a macroscopic level, an Airy wanderer line ensemble organizes into groups of finitely many curves sharing a common asymptotic slope. After appropriate centering and scaling, each such group converges to a Dyson Brownian motion whose dimension equals the size of the group. In the case where only finitely many slope parameters are positive, we further prove a curve separation phenomenon: the upper curves follow deterministic parabolic trajectories, while the remaining lower curves remain globally flat and converge to the classical Airy line ensemble.</description>

      <title>Regularity Estimates for Singular Density Dependent SDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the density dependent (i.e. Nemytskii-type) SDEs on $\mathbb R^d$, where the drift $b_t(x,\rho(x),\rho)$ is locally integrable in $(t,x)\in [0,\infty)\times \mathbb R^d$ and may be singular in the distribution density function $\rho$. The relative/Renyi entropies between two time-marginal distributions are estimated by using the Wasserstein distance of initial distributions. When $d=1$ and $b_t$ decays at $t=0$ with rate $t^{\frac 1 2+}$, our the relative entropy estimate coincides with the classical entropy-cost inequality for elliptic diffusion processes. To estimate the Renyi entropy, a refined Khasminskii estimate is presented for singular SDEs which may be interesting by itself.</description>

      <title>The Ising magnetisation field and the Gaussian free field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a natural coupling between the continuum Gaussian free field (GFF) and the critical Ising magnetisation field (IMF) in a planar domain. In fact, we show that two independent IMFs with $+$ boundary conditions and two independent IMFs with free boundary conditions are a deterministic function of a single instance of the GFF together with a sequence of independent coin flips. This construction should be seen as an extension of the bosonisation phenomenon, and to the best of our knowledge its existence has not been predicted before.
  We arrive at our main result in the continuum by studying novel discrete structures. Our starting point is a coupling resembling the Edwards-Sokal coupling between the Ising model and the Fortuin-Kasteleyn random cluster model, though with role of the latter played by a different percolation model obtained from the double random current model. By taking a scaling limit of the coupling at criticality, we obtain a continuum Edwards-Sokal-like representation of the IMFs in terms of certain two-valued sets of the GFF introduced by Aru, Sep\'ulveda and Werner.</description>

      <title>Universal approximation with signatures of non-geometric rough paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a universal approximation theorem for signatures of rough paths that are not necessarily weakly geometric. By extending the path with time and its rough path bracket terms, we prove that linear functionals of the signature of the resulting rough paths approximate continuous functionals on rough path spaces uniformly on compact sets. Moreover, we construct the signature of a path extended by its pathwise quadratic variation terms based on general pathwise stochastic integration \`a la F\"ollmer, in particular, allowing for pathwise It\^o, Stratonovich, and backward It\^o integration. In a probabilistic setting, we obtain a universal approximation result for linear functionals of the signature of continuous semimartingales extended by the quadratic variation terms, defined via stochastic It\^o integration. Numerical examples illustrate the use of signatures when the path is extended by time and quadratic variation in the context of model calibration and option pricing in mathematical finance.</description>

      <title>Excursion decomposition of the XOR-Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the excursion decomposition of the two-dimensional critical XOR-Ising model with either $+$ or free boundary conditions. In the first part, we construct the decomposition directly in the continuum. This construction relies on the identification of the XOR-Ising field with the cosine or sine of a Gaussian free field (GFF) $\phi$ multiplied by $\alpha = 1/\sqrt{2}$, and is obtained by an appropriate exploration of two-valued level sets of the GFF. More generally, the same construction applies to the fields $:\! \cos(\alpha \phi) \!:$ and $:\! \sin(\alpha \phi) \!:$ for any $\alpha \in (0,1)$.
  In the second part, we show that the continuum excursion decomposition arises as the scaling limit of the double random current decomposition of the critical XOR-Ising model on the square lattice. To this end, we exploit the rich Markovian structure of the discrete decomposition and strengthen the convergence of the double random current height function to the continuum GFF by establishing joint convergence with its cosine and sine. We conjecture that for $\alpha \in [1/2,\sqrt{3}/2)$ the continuum excursion decompositions arise as the scaling limit of those of the Ashkin-Teller polarisation field along its critical line.</description>

      <title>Approximation of Singular-Stopping Control Driven by Hawkes Processes via Rescaled MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a singular-optimal stopping stochastic control problem driven by self-exciting dynamics governed by a Hawkes process. In the continuous-time setting, we show that the optimization problem reduces to solving a variational partial differential equation with gradient constraints. We then introduce its discrete-time counterpart, modeled as a Markov Decision Process. We prove that, under an appropriate rescaling procedure, the value function of the discrete-time problem converges to its continuous-time equivalent, implying that the discrete-time optimizers are asymptotically optimal for the continuous-time problem. Finally, we apply these results to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck stochastic differential equation driven by a Hawkes process with singular control, motivated by optimal power plant investment under cyber threat and we illustrate the theoretical findings through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Dead ends in square-free digit walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study "dead ends" in square-free digit walks: square-free integers $N$ such that, in base $b$, every one-digit extension $bN+d$ is non-square-free. In base $10$, the stochastic independence model of Miller et al. suggests that infinite square-free walks occur with probability near $1$, corresponding to an asymptotic dead-end density of $\approx 5.218\times 10^{-5}$. We prove that the true asymptotic dead-end density satisfies \[ c_{\mathrm{dead}} \approx 1.317\times 10^{-9}, \] roughly a factor of $\sim 4\times 10^4$ smaller than the prediction. For every base $b\geq 2$, we prove that dead-end densities exist and are given by a closed-form expression (as a finite alternating sum of Euler products). The argument is fully formalized in Lean/Mathlib, and was produced automatically by AxiomProver from a natural-language statement of the problem.</description>

      <title>Maximal Averages on the Affine Group $G_n$ and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The general affine group $G_n$ sits at the intersection of harmonic analysis on solvable groups and the geometry of negatively curved symmetric spaces. In this work, we characterize the $L^p$-behavior of maximal operators associated with the fundamental motions of $G_n$. We establish a sharp dichotomy: while translation and geodesic averages exhibit Euclidean-like or improved regularity (yielding $L^1$ boundedness for the latter), dilation averages are governed by the group's non-unimodularity. We prove that dilation averages require a modular-weighted correction to achieve $L^p$ boundedness for $p &gt; 1$, but we establish a fundamental failure at the endpoint $p=1$. Specifically, we prove that dilation maximal operators and those associated with expansive random walks fail the weak-type $(1,1)$ estimate due to an exponential drift-to-volume mismatch. These results connect analytic maximal inequalities to the transience of Brownian motion, demonstrating that modular weights are necessary to compensate for the stochastic drift in the upper half-space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies decentralized risk-sharing on networks. In particular, we consider a model where agents are nodes in a given network structure. Agents directly connected by edges in the network are referred to as friends. We study actuarially fair risk-sharing under the assumption that only friends can share risk, and we characterize the optimal signed linear risk-sharing rule in this network setting. Subsequently, we consider a special case of this model where all the friends of an agent take on an equal share of the agent's risk, and establish a connection to the graph Laplacian. Our results are illustrated with several examples.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically optimal sequential change detection for bounded means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of quickest changepoint detection under the Average Run Length (ARL) constraint where the pre-change and post-change laws lie in composite families $\mathscr{P}$ and $\mathscr{Q}$ respectively. In such a problem, a massive challenge is characterizing the best possible detection delay when the "hardest" pre-change law in $\mathscr{P}$ depends on the unknown post-change law $Q\in\mathscr{Q}$. And typical simple-hypothesis likelihood-ratio arguments for Page-CUSUM and Shiryaev-Roberts do not at all apply here. To that end, we derive a universal sharp lower bound in full generality for any ARL-calibrated changepoint detector in the low type-I error ($\gamma\to\infty$ regime) of the order $\log(\gamma)/\mathrm{KL}_{\mathrm{inf}}(Q,\mathscr{P})$. We show achievability of this universal lower bound by proving a tight matching upper bound (with the same sharp $\log\gamma$ constant) in the important bounded mean detection setting. In addition, for separated mean shifts, we also we derive a uniform minimax guarantee of this achievability over the alternatives.</description>

      <title>Unified criteria for crystallization in hard-core lattice systems with applications to polyomino fluids and chiral mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a unified extension of two sets of criteria for high-fugacity crystallization in hard-core lattice systems developed previously by Jauslin, Lebowitz, and the author. Our new criterion is formulated in terms of the existence of a volume allocation rule with desirable properties, in analogy to the scoring function constructed in Hales' proof of the Kepler conjecture. The proof uses a recent systematic extension of Pirogov--Sinai theory to systems with infinite interactions by Mazel--Stuhl--Suhov. Notably, our result applies to a large class of polyomino models with discrete rotational degrees of freedom and chiral mixtures thereof.</description>

      <title>Weak and strong averaging principle for 2D Boussinesq equations with non-Lipschitz Poisson jump noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the averaging principle for 2D Boussinesq equations with non-Lipschitz Poisson jump noise. Precisely, we will first explore the well-posedness, regularity estimates and tightness of the vorticity variable. Then, we prove the ergodicity of the temperature variable. Next, we prove that the vorticity variable converge to the solution of the averaged equation in probability and $2p$th-mean, under different conditions, as time scale parameter $\varepsilon$ goes to zero. Finally, we present a specific case study and conduct numerical simulations to substantiate the main conclusions of this paper.</description>

      <title>Wedge Sampling: Efficient Tensor Completion with Nearly-Linear Sample Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Wedge Sampling, a new non-adaptive sampling scheme for low-rank tensor completion. We study recovery of an order-$k$ low-rank tensor of dimension $n \times \cdots \times n$ from a subset of its entries. Unlike the standard uniform entry model (i.e., i.i.d. samples from $[n]^k$), wedge sampling allocates observations to structured length-two patterns (wedges) in an associated bipartite sampling graph. By directly promoting these length-two connections, the sampling design strengthens the spectral signal that underlies efficient initialization, in regimes where uniform sampling is too sparse to generate enough informative correlations.
  Our main result shows that this change in sampling paradigm enables polynomial-time algorithms to achieve both weak and exact recovery with nearly linear sample complexity in $n$. The approach is also plug-and-play: wedge-sampling-based spectral initialization can be combined with existing refinement procedures (e.g., spectral or gradient-based methods) using only an additional $\tilde{O}(n)$ uniformly sampled entries, substantially improving over the $\tilde{O}(n^{k/2})$ sample complexity typically required under uniform entry sampling for efficient methods. Overall, our results suggest that the statistical-to-computational gap highlighted in Barak and Moitra (2022) is, to a large extent, a consequence of the uniform entry sampling model for tensor completion, and that alternative non-adaptive measurement designs that guarantee a strong initialization can overcome this barrier.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we obtain stability results for the $L^{p}$-Poincar\'e inequality for both Lebesgue and Gaussian probability measures (Theorem 3.3 and Theorem 3.6). Our approach relies on properties of the first eigenfunction of the (Gaussian) $p$-Laplacian operator and weighted Poincar\'e inequalities for log-concave measures on convex domains.</description>

      <title>The Signed Wasserstein Barycenter Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barycenter problems encode important geometric information about a metric space. While these problems are typically studied with positive weight coefficients associated to each distance term, more general signed Wasserstein barycenter problems have recently drawn a great deal of interest. These mixed sign problems have appeared in statistical inference setting as a way to generalize least squares regression to measure valued outputs and have appeared in numerical methods to improve the accuracy of Wasserstein gradient flow solvers. Unfortunately, the presence of negatively weighted distance terms destroys the Euclidean convexity of the unsigned problem, resulting in a much more challenging optimization task. The main focus of this work is to study properties of the signed barycenter problem for a general transport cost with a focus on establishing uniqueness of solutions. In particular, when there is only one positive weight, we extend the uniqueness result of Tornabene et al. (2025) to any cost satisfying a certain convexity property. In the case of arbitrary weights, we introduce the dual problem in terms of Kantorovich potentials and provide a sufficient condition for a stationary solution of the dual problem to induce an optimal signed barycenter.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Model's Generalization Can Be Characterized by Inductive Biases toward a Data-Dependent Ridge Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a diffusion model is not memorizing the training data set, how does it generalize exactly? A quantitative understanding of the distribution it generates would be beneficial to, for example, an assessment of the model's performance for downstream applications. We thus explicitly characterize what diffusion model generates, by proposing a log-density ridge manifold and quantifying how the generated data relate to this manifold as inference dynamics progresses. More precisely, inference undergoes a reach-align-slide process centered around the ridge manifold: trajectories first reach a neighborhood of the manifold, then align as being pushed toward or away from the manifold in normal directions, and finally slide along the manifold in tangent directions. Within the scope of this general behavior, different training errors will lead to different normal and tangent motions, which can be quantified, and these detailed motions characterize when inter-mode generations emerge. More detailed understanding of training dynamics will lead to more accurate quantification of the generation inductive bias, and an example of random feature model will be considered, for which we can explicitly illustrate how diffusion model's inductive biases originate as a composition of architectural bias and training accuracy, and how they evolve with the inference dynamics. Experiments on synthetic multimodal distributions and MNIST latent diffusion support the predicted directional effects, in both low- and high-dimensions.</description>

      <title>1-stable fluctuations in branching Brownian motion at critical temperature II: general functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.10412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2103.10412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mu_t$ denote the critical derivative Gibbs measure of branching Brownian motion at time $t$. It has been proved by Madaule (Stochastic Process. Appl. 126 (2016), no. 2, 470--502) and Maillard and Zeitouni (Ann. Inst. Henri Poincar\'e Probab. Stat. 52 (2016), no. 3, 1144--1160) that $\mu_t$ converges weakly to the random measure $Z_\infty \sqrt{2/\pi} x^2 e^{-x^2/2} \boldsymbol 1_{x &gt;0} d x$, where $Z_\infty$ is the limit of the derivative martingale. In this paper, we are interested in the fluctuations that occur in this convergence and prove for a large class of functions $F$ that \begin{align*}
  \sqrt{t} \left(
  \int_{\mathbb R} F d \mu_t
  - Z_\infty \int_0^\infty F(x) \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} x^2 e^{-x^2/2} d x
  - \frac{c(F) \log t}{\sqrt{t}} Z_\infty \right)
  \to S(F), \end{align*} in law, as $t\to\infty$, where $c(F)$ is a constant depending on $F$ and, given $Z_\infty$, $S(F)$ has an explicit 1-stable distribution. Moreover, we extend this result to a functional convergence, and we identify precisely the particles responsible for the fluctuations. In particular, this proves the following result for the critical additive martingale $(W_t)_{t\geq 0}$: \[ \sqrt{t} \left( \sqrt{t} W_t - \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} Z_\infty \right) \xrightarrow[t\to\infty]{} C Z_\infty, \quad \text{in law}, \] where here $C$ is a Cauchy variable independent of $Z_\infty$, confirming a conjecture by Mueller and Munier (Phys. Rev. E 90 (2014), 042143) in the physics literature.</description>

      <title>Arcade Processes for Informed Martingale Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05936v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Arcade processes are a class of continuous stochastic processes that interpolate in a strong sense, i.e., omega by omega, between zeros at fixed pre-specified times. Their additive randomisation allows one to match any finite sequence of target random variables, indexed by the given fixed dates, on the whole probability space. The randomised arcade processes (RAPs) can thus be interpreted as a generalisation of anticipative stochastic bridges. The filtrations generated by these processes are utilised to construct a class of martingales that interpolate between the given target random variables. These so-called filtered arcade martingales (FAMs) are almost-sure solutions to the martingale interpolation problem and reveal an underlying stochastic filtering structure. In the special case of conditionally Markov randomised arcade processes, the dynamics of FAMs are informed by Bayesian updating. The same ideas are applied to filtered arcade reverse-martingales, which are constructed in a similar fashion, using reverse-filtrations of RAPs, instead. Several explicit examples for RAPs and FAMs are provided and simulated. This paper concludes with an outlook on potential connections between FAMs and martingale optimal transport, and related applications.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Calculus via Stopping Derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02862v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a substantial portion of stochastic calculus can be developed along similar lines to ordinary calculus, with derivative-based concepts driving the development. We define a notion of stopping derivative, which is a form of right derivative with respect to stopping times. Using this, we define the drift and variance rate of a process as stopping derivatives for (generalised) conditional expectation and conditional variance respectively. Applying elementary, derivative-based methods, we derive a calculus of rules describing how drift and variance rate transform under operations on processes, culminating in a version of the multi-dimensional It\^o formula. Our approach connects with the standard machinery of stochastic calculus via a theorem establishing that continuous processes with zero drift coincide with random translations of continuous local martingales. This equivalence allows us to derive a fundamental theorem of calculus for stopping derivatives, which relates the quantities of drift and variance rate, defined as stopping derivatives, to parameters used in the description of a process as a stochastic integral.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the well-posedness of stochastic reaction diffusion equations like \begin{equation} \begin{cases} dX(t)(\xi)=\big(\Delta_\xi X(t)(\xi)-p(X(t)(\xi))\big)dt+RdW(t)+dL(t) , \quad t\in [0,T];\\ X(0)=x\in L^2(\mathcal{O}) \end{cases} \end{equation} where $\mathcal{O}$ is a bounded open domain of $\mathbb{R}^d$ with regular boundary, $d\in\mathbb{N}$, $p:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ is a polynomial of odd degree with positive leading coefficient, $R$ is a linear bounded operator on $L^2(\mathcal{O})$, $\{W(t)\}_{t\geq 0}$ is a $L^2(\mathcal{O})$-cylindrical Wiener process, $\{L(t)\}_{t\geq 0}$ is a pure-jump L\'evy process on $L^2(\mathcal{O})$. We complement the equation with suitable boundary conditions on $\partial \mathcal{O}.$ Some papers in literature analize existence and uniqueness of mild solutions for every $x\in L^p(\mathcal{O})$, for some suitable $p\geq 2$. The results of this paper allow to study reaction diffusion equations also on the space of continuous function $C(\overline{O})$. This seems to be new in the L\'evy case (it is already done in the Wiener case).\\ We also discuss and review the previous cited works with the aim of unifying the different frameworks. We underline that when $R=0$ for every $x\in C(\overline{O})$ (or $x\in L^p(\mathcal{O})$) the mild solution to the equation has a c\`adl\`ag modifications in $C(\overline{O})$ (or $\in L^p(\mathcal{O})$), even if $\{L(t)\}_{t \geq 0}$ is not a L\'evy process taking values in $C(\overline{O})$ (or $\in L^p(\mathcal{O})$). This phenomenon for the linear problem (i.e., $F\equiv 0$ in the SPDE) has been investigated in other papers.</description>

Abstract: We study the limiting behavior of a Bienayme-Galton-Watson tree conditioned to have a large number of vertices and either a fixed number of leaves or a fixed number of internal nodes. The first biconditioning gives a universal result with respect to the offspring distribution. In contrast, the second case leads to a variety of limiting behaviors, ranging from condensation phenomena to more elongated tree structures, depending on the properties of the offspring distribution. To prove these results, we use tools from conditioned random walk theory and from analytic combinatorics.</description>

      <title>A variational approach to dimension-free self-normalized concentration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06483v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the self-normalized concentration of vector-valued stochastic processes. We focus on bounds for "sub-$\psi$" processes, a well-known and quite general class of process that encompasses a wide variety of well-known tail conditions (including sub-exponential, sub-Gaussian, sub-gamma, sub-Poisson, and several heavy-tailed settings without a moment generating function such as symmetric or bounded 2nd or 3rd moments). Our results recover and generalize the influential bound of de la Pe\~na et al. [20] (proved again in Abbasi-Yadkori et al. [2]) in the sub-Gaussian case. Further, we fill a gap in the literature between determinant-based bounds and more recent bounds based on condition numbers. As applications we prove a Bernstein inequality for random vectors satisfying a moment condition (a more general condition than boundedness), and also provide the first dimension-free self-normalized empirical Bernstein inequality. Our techniques are based on the variational (PAC-Bayes) approach to concentration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of multitype branching L\'evy processes, where particles move according to type-dependent L\'evy processes, switch types via an irreducible Markov chain, and branch according to type-dependent laws. This framework generalizes multitype branching Brownian motions.
  Using techniques of Markov additive processes, we develop a spine decomposition. This approach further enables us to prove convergence results for the additive martingales and derivative martingales, and establish the existence and uniqueness of travelling wave solutions to the corresponding multitype FKPP equations. In particular, applying our results to the on-off branching Brownian motion model resolves several open problems posed by Blath et al.(2025).</description>

Abstract: The martingale expansion provides a refined approximation to the marginal distributions of martingales beyond the normal approximation implied by the martingale central limit theorem. We develop a martingale expansion framework specifically suited to continuous stochastic volatility models. Our approach accommodates both small volatility-of-volatility and fast mean-reversion models, yielding first-order perturbation expansions under essentially minimal conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10506v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The convergence rate of a Markov chain to its stationary distribution is typically assessed using the concept of total variation mixing time. However, this worst-case measure often yields pessimistic estimates and is challenging to infer from observations. In this paper, we advocate for the use of the average-mixing time as a more optimistic and demonstrably easier-to-estimate alternative. We further illustrate its applicability across a range of settings, from two-point to countable spaces, and discuss some practical implications.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a framework for systemic risk modeling in insurance portfolios using jointly exchangeable arrays, extending classical collective risk models to account for interactions. Joint exchangeability is a more general probabilistic symmetric than de Finetti's exchangeability, characterized by the Aldous-Hoover-Kallenberg representation. We establish central limit theorems that asymptotically capture total portfolio losses, providing a theoretical foundation for approximations in large portfolios and over long time horizons. These approximations are validated through simulation-based numerical experiments. Additionally, we analyze the impact of dependence on portfolio loss distributions, with a particular focus on tail behavior.</description>

      <title>Faber polynomials in a deltoid region and power iteration momentum methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a region in the complex plane enclosed by a deltoid curve inscribed in the unit circle, and define a family of polynomials $P_n$ that satisfy the same recurrence relation as the Faber polynomials for this region. We use this family of polynomials to give a constructive proof that $z^n$ is approximately a polynomial of degree $\sim\sqrt{n}$ within the deltoid region. Moreover, we show that $|P_n| \le 1$ in this deltoid region, and that, if $|z| = 1+\varepsilon$, then the magnitude $|P_n(z)|$ is at least $\frac{1}{3}(1+\sqrt{\varepsilon})^n$, for all $\varepsilon &gt; 0$. We illustrate our polynomial approximation theory with an application to iterative linear algebra. In particular, we construct a higher-order momentum-based method that accelerates the power iteration for certain matrices with complex eigenvalues. We show how the method can be run dynamically when the two dominant eigenvalues are real and positive.</description>

      <title>The Optimal Strategy for Playing Lucky 13</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The game show Lucky 13 differs from other television game shows in that contestants are required to place a bet on their own knowledge of trivia by selecting a range that contains the number of questions that they answered correctly. We present a model for this game show using binomial random variables and generate tables outlining the optimal range the player should select based on maximization of two different utility functions. After analyzing the decisions made by some actual contestants on this show, we present a numerical simulation for how many questions an average player is expected to answer correctly based on question categories observed for two sample contestants.</description>

      <title>The Greedy Algorithm for Dissociated Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07068v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set $\mathcal S\subset \mathbb N$ is said to be a subset-sum-distinct or dissociated if all of its finite subsets have different sums. Alternately, an equivalent classification is if any equality of the form $$\sum_{s\in \mathcal S} \varepsilon_s \cdot s =0$$ where $\varepsilon_s \in \{-1,0,+1\}$ implies that all the $\varepsilon_s$'s are $0$. For a dissociated set $\mathcal S$, we prove that for $c_\ast = \frac 12 \log_2 \left(\frac \pi 2\right)$ and any $c_\ast-1&lt;C&lt;c_\ast$, we have $$\mathcal S(n) \,:=\, \mathcal S\cap [1,n] \,\le\, \log_2 n +\frac 12 \log_2\log_2 n + C$$ for all $n\in \mathcal N_C$ with asymptotic density $\mathbf d\left(\mathcal N_C\right)=2-2^{c_\ast-C}$. Further, we consider the greedy algorithm for generating these sets and prove that this algorithm always eventually doubles. Finally, we also consider some generalizations of dissociated sets and prove similar results about them.</description>
