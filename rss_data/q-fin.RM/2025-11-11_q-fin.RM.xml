      <title>Network and Risk Analysis of Surety Bonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surety bonds are financial agreements between a contractor (principal) and obligee (project owner) to complete a project. However, most large-scale projects involve multiple contractors, creating a network and introducing the possibility of incomplete obligations to propagate and result in project failures. Typical models for risk assessment assume independent failure probabilities within each contractor. However, we take a network approach, modeling the contractor network as a directed graph where nodes represent contractors and project owners and edges represent contractual obligations with associated financial records. To understand risk propagation throughout the contractor network, we extend the celebrated Friedkin-Johnsen model and introduce a stochastic process to simulate principal failures across the network. From a theoretical perspective, we show that under natural monotonicity conditions on the contractor network, incorporating network effects leads to increases in both the average risk and the tail probability mass of the loss distribution (i.e. larger right-tail risk) for the surety organization. We further use data from a partnering insurance company to validate our findings, estimating an approximately 2% higher exposure when accounting for network effects.</description>

      <title>Push-response anomalies in high-frequency S&amp;P 500 price series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We test the hypothesis that consecutive intraday price changes in the most liquid U.S. equity ETF (SPY) are conditionally nonrandom. Using NBBO event-time data for about 1,500 regular trading days, we form for every lag L ordered pairs of a backward price increment ("push") and a forward price increment ("response"), standardize them, and estimate the expected responses on a fine grid of push magnitudes. The resulting lag-by-magnitude maps reveal a persistent structural shift: for short lags (1-5,000 ticks), expected responses cluster near zero across most push magnitudes, suggesting high short-term efficiency; beyond that range, pronounced tails emerge, indicating that larger historical pushes increasingly correlate with nonzero conditional responses. We also find that large negative pushes are followed by stronger positive responses than equally large positive pushes, consistent with asymmetric liquidity replenishment after sell-side shocks. Decomposition into symmetric and antisymmetric components and the associated dominance curves confirm that short-horizon efficiency is restored only partially. The evidence points to an intraday, lag-resolved anomaly that is invisible in unconditional returns and that can be used to define tradable pockets and risk controls.</description>
