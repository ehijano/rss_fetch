      <title>A Multiscale Approach for Enhancing Weak Signal Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic resonance (SR), a phenomenon originally introduced in climate modeling, enhances signal detection by leveraging optimal noise levels within non-linear systems. Traditional SR techniques, mainly based on single-threshold detectors, are limited to signals whose behavior does not depend on time. Often large amounts of noise are needed to detect weak signals, which can distort complex signal characteristics. To address these limitations, this study explores multi-threshold systems and the application of SR in multiscale applications using wavelet transforms. In the multiscale domain signals can be analyzed at different levels of resolution to better understand the underlying dynamics.
  We propose a double-threshold detection system that integrates two single-threshold detectors to enhance weak signal detection. We evaluate it both in the original data domain and in the multiscale domain using simulated and real-world signals and compare its performance with existing methods.
  Experimental results demonstrate that, in the original data domain, the proposed double-threshold detector significantly improves weak signal detection compared to conventional single-threshold approaches. Its performance is further improved in the frequency domain, requiring lower noise levels while outperforming existing detection systems. This study advances SR-based detection methodologies by introducing a robust approach to weak signal identification, with potential applications in various disciplines.</description>

      <title>Is Repeater-Assisted Massive MIMO Compatible with Dynamic TDD?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for joint amplification and phase shift optimization of the repeater gain in dynamic time-division duplex (TDD) repeater-assisted massive MIMO networks. Repeaters, being active scatterers with amplification and phase shift, enhance the received signal strengths for users. However, they inevitably also amplify undesired noise and interference signals, which become particularly prominent in dynamic TDD systems due to the concurrent downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions, introducing cross-link interference among access points and users operating in opposite transmit directions. This causes a non-trivial trade-off between amplification of desired and undesired signals. To underpin the conditions under which such a trade-off can improve performance, we first derive DL and UL spectral efficiencies (SEs), and then develop a repeater gain optimization algorithm for SE maximization. Numerically, we show that our proposed algorithm successfully calibrates the repeater gain to amplify the desired signal while limiting the interference.</description>

      <title>6D Movable Holographic Surface Assisted Integrated Data and Energy Transfer: A Sensing Enhanced Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable holographic surface (RHS) enables cost-effective large-scale arrays with high spatial gain. However, its amplitude-controlled holographic beamforming suffers from directional fluctuations, making it difficult to fully exploit the spatial gain of RHS. Fortunately, the promising 6D movable antenna (6DMA) provides a potential solution to this problem. In this paper, we study a 6D movable holographic surface (6DMHS) integrated data and energy transfer (IDET) system, where a three-stage protocol is proposed, consisting of an uplink sensing stage, an orientation adjustment stage and a downlink transmission stage, to coordinate the 6DMHS and effectively serve the IDET receivers. Firstly, the holographic-based sensing technology is proposed and the sensing information of the IDET receivers is exploited. Secondly, by fixing the rotations with the sensing information, the orientation optimization problem is formulated for designing the holographic beamforming of the RHS and adjusting the translations of the 6DMHS. As a result, the directions with maximum beamforming gain are aligned with each IDET receiver. Thirdly, by fixing the orientation of the 6DMHS and the holographic beamforming, the equivalent wireless channel is obtained. The IDET performance optimization problem is formulated for obtaining the optimal digital beamforming, power splitting factor and energy harvesting (EH) power. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is capable of improving the IDET performance compared to the benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Track-to-Track Association for Collective Perception based on Stochastic Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective perception is a key aspect for autonomous driving in smart cities as it aims to combine the local environment models of multiple intelligent vehicles in order to overcome sensor limitations. A crucial part of multi-sensor fusion is track-to-track association. Previous works often suffer from high computational complexity or are based on heuristics. We propose an association algorithms based on stochastic optimization, which leverages a multidimensional likelihood incorporating the number of tracks and their spatial distribution and furthermore computes several association hypotheses. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in Monte Carlo simulations and a realistic collective perception scenario computing high-likelihood associations in ambiguous settings.</description>

      <title>Optimized Power Control for Multi-User Integrated Sensing and Edge AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates an integrated sensing and edge artificial intelligence (ISEA) system, where multiple devices first transmit probing signals for target sensing and then offload locally extracted features to the access point (AP) via analog over-the-air computation (AirComp) for collaborative inference. To characterize the relationship between AirComp error and inference performance, two proxies are established: the \emph{computation-optimal} proxy that minimizes the aggregation distortion, and the \emph{decision-optimal} proxy that maximizes the inter-class separability, respectively. Optimal transceiver designs in terms of closed-form power allocation are derived for both time-division multiplexing (TDM) and frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) settings, revealing threshold-based and dual-decomposition structures, respectively. Experimental results validate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Opto-Electronic Clock Regeneration -- A Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A tutorial on opto-electronic clock regeneration at very high bit rates beyond reach with purely electronic solutions is given. Emphasis is placed on sum frequency generation in a nonlinear material such as LiNbO3. We first provide a basic introduction to CR (clock recovery) and a PLL (phase-locked loop); two examples are considered, an input signal frequency step and a slow input signal frequency. Next we discuss opto-electronic clock recovery based on an OPLL (opto-electronic PLL). The OPLL contains a phase comparator consisting of a planar LiNbO3 waveguide, a lowpass filter, a VCO (voltage controlled oscillator) and a local oscillator laser. The error signal from the comparator determined by the difference in electrical phase between the signal and the VCO controls the VCO. The VCO has two outputs; one that modulates the local oscillator laser and another that triggers a decision circuit that samples the output from the OPLL. The VCO is continuously adjusted by the OPLL so that it will ensure sampling of the signal in the optimal moments.</description>

      <title>A Short Note on Upper Bounds for Graph Neural Operator Convergence Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphons, as limits of graph sequences, provide a framework for analyzing the asymptotic behavior of graph neural operators. Spectral convergence of sampled graphs to graphons yields operator-level convergence rates, enabling transferability analyses of GNNs. This note summarizes known bounds under no assumptions, global Lipschitz continuity, and piecewise-Lipschitz continuity, highlighting tradeoffs between assumptions and rates, and illustrating their empirical tightness on synthetic and real data.</description>

      <title>NeuroPilot: A Realtime Brain-Computer Interface system to enhance concentration of students in online learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prevalence of online learning poses a vital challenge in real-time monitoring of students' concentration. Traditional methods such as questionnaire assessments require manual interventions and webcam-based monitoring fails to provide accurate insights into learners' mental focus as they are deceived by mere screen fixation without cognitive engagement. Existing BCI-based approaches lack real-time validation and evaluation procedures. To address these limitations, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is developed using a non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband, FocusCalm, to record brainwave activity under attentive and non-attentive states. 20 minutes of data were collected from each of 20 participants watching a pre-recorded educational video. The data validation employed a novel intra-video questionnaire assessment. Subsequently, collected signals were segmented (sliding window), filtered (butterworth bandpass), and cleaned (removal of high-amplitude and EOG artifacts such as eye blinks). Time, frequency, wavelet and statistical features have been extracted, followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE) with Support vector machines (SVMs) to classify attention and non-attention states. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation accuracy has been tested to be 88.77%. The system provides feedback alerts upon non-attention state detection and keeps focus profile logs. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of real-time feedback. Five participants completed a 10-minute session consisting of a 5-minute baseline phase without feedback followed by a 5-minute feedback phase, during which alerts were issued if participants remained non-attentive for approximately 8 consecutive seconds. A paired t-test (t = 5.73, p = 0.007) indicated a statistically significant improvement in concentration during the feedback phase.</description>

      <title>AL-CoLe: Augmented Lagrangian for Constrained Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20995v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the non-convexity of most modern machine learning parameterizations, Lagrangian duality has become a popular tool for addressing constrained learning problems. We revisit Augmented Lagrangian methods, which aim to mitigate the duality gap in non-convex settings while requiring only minimal modifications, and have remained comparably unexplored in constrained learning settings. We establish strong duality results under mild conditions, prove convergence of dual ascent algorithms to feasible and optimal primal solutions, and provide PAC-style generalization guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate its effectiveness on fairness constrained classification tasks.</description>

      <title>The Role of Information Incompleteness in Defending Against Stealth Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effectiveness of Data Injections Attacks (DIAs) critically depends on the completeness of the system information accessible to adversaries. This relationship positions information incompleteness enhancement as a vital defense strategy for degrading DIA performance. In this paper, we focus on the information-theoretic stealth attacks, where the attacker encounters a fundamental tradeoff between the attack stealthiness and destructiveness. Specifically, we systematically characterize how incomplete admittance information impacts the dual objectives. In particular, we establish sufficient conditions for two distinct operational regimes: (i) stealthiness intensifies while destructive potential diminishes and (ii) destructiveness increases while stealth capability weakens. For scenarios beyond these regimes, we propose a maximal incompleteness strategy to optimally degrade stealth capability. To solve the associated optimization problem, the feasible region is reduced without excluding the optimal solution, and a heuristic algorithm is then introduced to effectively identify the near-optimal solutions within the reduced region. Numerical simulations are conducted on IEEE test systems to validate the findings.</description>

      <title>Compressing Quaternion Convolutional Neural Networks for Audio Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the real domain have been widely used for audio classification. However, their convolution operations process multi-channel inputs independently, limiting the ability to capture correlations among channels. This can lead to suboptimal feature learning, particularly for complex audio patterns such as multi-channel spectrogram representations. Quaternion Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) address this limitation by employing quaternion algebra to jointly capture inter-channel dependencies, enabling more compact models with fewer learnable parameters while better exploiting the multi-dimensional nature of audio signals. However, QCNNs exhibit higher computational complexity due to the overhead of quaternion operations, resulting in increased inference latency and reduced efficiency compared to conventional CNNs, posing challenges for deployment on resource-constrained platforms. To address this challenge, this study explores knowledge distillation (KD) and pruning, to reduce the computational complexity of QCNNs while maintaining performance. Our experiments on audio classification reveal that pruning QCNNs achieves similar or superior performance compared to KD while requiring less computational effort. Compared to conventional CNNs and Transformer-based architectures, pruned QCNNs achieve competitive performance with a reduced learnable parameter count and computational complexity. On the AudioSet dataset, pruned QCNNs reduce computational cost by 50\% and parameter count by 80\%, while maintaining performance comparable to the conventional CNNs. Furthermore, pruned QCNNs generalize well across multiple audio classification benchmarks, including GTZAN for music genre recognition, ESC-50 for environmental sound classification and RAVDESS for speech emotion recognition.</description>

      <title>FlexIO: Flexible Single- and Multi-Channel Speech Separation and Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speech separation and enhancement (SSE) has advanced remarkably and achieved promising results in controlled settings, such as a fixed number of speakers and a fixed array configuration. Towards a universal SSE system, single-channel systems have been extended to deal with a variable number of speakers (i.e., outputs). Meanwhile, multi-channel systems accommodating various array configurations (i.e., inputs) have been developed. However, these attempts have been pursued separately. In this paper, we propose a flexible input and output SSE system, named FlexIO. It performs conditional separation using prompt vectors, one per speaker as a condition, allowing separation of an arbitrary number of speakers. Multi-channel mixtures are processed together with the prompt vectors via an array-agnostic channel communication mechanism. Our experiments demonstrate that FlexIO successfully covers diverse conditions with one to five microphones and one to three speakers. We also confirm the robustness of FlexIO on CHiME-4 real data.</description>

      <title>COMET: Co-Optimization of a CNN Model using Efficient-Hardware OBC Techniques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are highly effective for computer vision and pattern recognition tasks; however, their computational intensity and reliance on hardware such as FPGAs pose challenges for deployment on low-power edge devices. In this work, we present COMET, a framework of CNN designs that employ efficient hardware offset-binary coding (OBC) techniques to enable co-optimization of performance and resource utilization. The approach formulates CNN inference with OBC representations of inputs (Scheme A) and weights (Scheme B) separately, enabling exploitation of bit-width asymmetry. The shift-accumulate operation is modified by incorporating the offset term with the pre-scaled bias. Leveraging inherent symmetries in Schemes A and B, we introduce four novel look-up table (LUT) techniques -- parallel, shared, split, and hybrid -- and analyze them to identify the most efficient options. Building on this foundation, we develop an OBC-based general matrix multiplication core using the im2col transformation, enabling efficient acceleration of a fixed-point modified LeNet-5 model. FPGA evaluations demonstrate that the proposed co-optimization approach significantly reduces resource utilization compared to state-of-the-art LeNet-5 based CNN designs, with minimal impact on accuracy.</description>

      <title>Time-causal and time-recursive wavelets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05834v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When to apply wavelet analysis to real-time temporal signals, where the future cannot be accessed, it is essential to base all the steps in the signal processing pipeline on computational mechanisms that are truly time-causal.
  This paper describes how a time-causal wavelet analysis can be performed based on concepts developed in the area of temporal scale-space theory, originating from a complete classification of temporal smoothing kernels that guarantee non-creation of new structures from finer to coarser temporal scale levels. By necessity, convolution with truncated exponential kernels in cascade constitutes the only permissable class of kernels, as well as their temporal derivatives as a natural complement to fulfil the admissibility conditions of wavelet representations. For a particular way of choosing the time constants in the resulting infinite convolution of truncated exponential kernels, to ensure temporal scale covariance and thus self-similarity over temporal scales, we describe how mother wavelets can be chosen as temporal derivatives of the resulting time-causal limit kernel.
  By developing connections between wavelet theory and scale-space theory, we characterize and quantify how the continuous scaling properties transfer to the discrete implementation, demonstrating how the proposed time-causal wavelet representation can reflect the duration of locally dominant temporal structures in the input signals.
  We propose that this notion of time-causal wavelet analysis could be a valuable tool for signal processing tasks, where streams of signals are to be processed in real time, specifically for signals that may contain local variations over a rich span of temporal scales, or more generally for analysing physical or biophysical temporal phenomena, where a fully time-causal analysis is called for to be physically realistic.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Satellites for Enhanced Ground-to-Space Direct Uplink Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance advantages of Rydberg atomic quantum (RAQ)-based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) satellites for enhancing direct ground-to-space uplink access.We analytically evaluate the impact of Rydberg atoms on channel estimation by deriving closed-form expressions for the mean-square error (MSE) and normalized mean-square error (NMSE). Based on the estimated channels, we further derive lower bounds on the achievable data rates for maximum ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) detection schemes. Rigorous analysis demonstrates that RAQ-MIMO outperforms conventional radio-frequency (RF) MIMO under both Rayleigh and satellite channel conditions. Specifically, compared with conventional MIMO, RAQR achieves a ``squaring" gain under Rayleigh fading, especially in long-distance transmission scenarios with stringent power constraints. In contrast, under line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated satellite channels, this gain saturates as channel-estimation benefits diminish, with the remaining improvement primarily arising from the normalized noise background. Monte Carlo simulations validate the analytical results and show that the performance gains of RAQ-MIMO satellites translate into smaller antenna apertures, lower transmit power, and longer communication ranges, thereby paving the way for next-generation satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Feed-forward active magnetic shielding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields from the brain are tiny relative to ambient fields which therefore need to be suppressed. The common solution of passive shielding is expensive, bulky and insufficiently effective, thus motivating research into the alternative of active shielding which comes in two flavours: feed-back and feed-forward. In feed-back designs (the most common), corrective fields are created by coils driven from sensors within the area that they correct, for example from the main sensors of an MEG device. In feed-forward designs (less common), corrective fields are driven from dedicated reference sensors outside the area they correct. Feed-forward can achieve better performance than feed-back, in principle, however its implementation is hobbled by an unavoidable coupling between coils and reference sensors, which reduces the effectiveness of the shielding and may affect stability, complicating the design. This paper suggests a solution that relies on a ``decoupling matrix," inserted in the signal pathway between sensors and corrective coils, to counteract the spurious coupling. This allows feed-forward shielding do reduce the ambient field to zero across the full frequency range, in principle, although performance may be limited by other factors such as current noise. The solution, which is fully data-driven and does not require geometric calculations, high-tolerance fabrication, or physical calibration, has been evaluated by simulation, but not implemented in hardware. It might contribute to the deployment of a new generation of measurement systems based on optically-pumped magnetometers (OPM). The lower cost and reduced constraints of those systems are a strong incentive to likewise reduce the cost and constraints of the shielding required to operate them, hence the appeal of active shielding.</description>

      <title>Guided MRI Reconstruction via Schr\"odinger Bridge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an inherently multi-contrast modality, where cross-contrast priors can be exploited to improve image reconstruction from undersampled data. Recently, diffusion models have shown remarkable performance in MRI reconstruction. However, they still struggle to effectively utilize such priors, mainly because existing methods rely on feature-level fusion in image or latent spaces, which lacks explicit structural correspondence and thus leads to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we propose $\mathbf{I}^2$SB-Inversion, a multi-contrast guided reconstruction framework based on the Schr\"odinger Bridge (SB). The proposed method performs pixel-wise translation between paired contrasts, providing explicit structural constraints between the guidance and target images. Furthermore, an Inversion strategy is introduced to correct inter-modality misalignment, which often occurs in guided reconstruction, thereby mitigating artifacts and improving reconstruction accuracy. Experiments on paired T1- and T2-weighted datasets demonstrate that $\mathbf{I}^2$SB-Inversion achieves a high acceleration factor of up to 14.4 and consistently outperforms existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.</description>

      <title>Fr\'{e}chet Power-Scenario Distance: A Metric for Evaluating Generative AI Models across Multiple Time-Scales in Smart Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08082v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models in smart grids have advanced significantly in recent years due to their ability to generate large amounts of synthetic data, which would otherwise be difficult to obtain in the real world due to confidentiality constraints. A key challenge in utilizing such synthetic data is how to assess the data quality produced from such generative models. Traditional Euclidean distance-based metrics only reflect pair-wise relations between two individual samples, and could fail in evaluating quality differences between groups of synthetic datasets. In this work, we propose a novel metric based on the Fr\'{e}chet Distance (FD) estimated between two datasets in a learned feature space. The proposed method evaluates the quality of generation from a distributional perspective. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed metric across timescales and models, enhancing the reliability of data-driven decision-making in smart grid operations.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Flow Matching for Brain Connectivity Matrices via Pullback Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18193v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generating realistic brain connectivity matrices is key to analyzing population heterogeneity in brain organization, understanding disease, and augmenting data in challenging classification problems. Functional connectivity matrices lie in constrained spaces, such as the set of symmetric positive definite or correlation matrices, that can be modeled as Riemannian manifolds. However, using Riemannian tools typically requires redefining core operations (geodesics, norms, integration), making generative modeling computationally inefficient. In this work, we propose DiffeoCFM, an approach that enables conditional flow matching (CFM) on matrix manifolds by exploiting pullback metrics induced by global diffeomorphisms on Euclidean spaces. We show that Riemannian CFM with such metrics is equivalent to applying standard CFM after data transformation. This equivalence allows efficient vector field learning, and fast sampling with standard ODE solvers. We instantiate DiffeoCFM with two different settings: the matrix logarithm for covariance matrices and the normalized Cholesky decomposition for correlation matrices. We evaluate DiffeoCFM on three large-scale fMRI datasets with more than 4600 scans from 2800 subjects (ADNI, ABIDE, OASIS-3) and two EEG motor imagery datasets with over 30000 trials from 26 subjects (BNCI2014-002 and BNCI2015-001). It enables fast training and achieves state-of-the-art performance, all while preserving manifold constraints. Code: https://github.com/antoinecollas/DiffeoCFM</description>

      <title>NPN: Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space for Imaging Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Imaging inverse problems aim to recover high-dimensional signals from undersampled, noisy measurements, a fundamentally ill-posed task with infinite solutions in the null-space of the sensing operator. To resolve this ambiguity, prior information is typically incorporated through handcrafted regularizers or learned models that constrain the solution space. However, these priors typically ignore the task-specific structure of that null-space. In this work, we propose Non-Linear Projections of the Null-Space (NPN), a novel class of regularization that, instead of enforcing structural constraints in the image domain, promotes solutions that lie in a low-dimensional projection of the sensing matrix's null-space with a neural network. Our approach has two key advantages: (1) Interpretability: by focusing on the structure of the null-space, we design sensing-matrix-specific priors that capture information orthogonal to the signal components that are fundamentally blind to the sensing process. (2) Flexibility: NPN is adaptable to various inverse problems, compatible with existing reconstruction frameworks, and complementary to conventional image-domain priors. We provide theoretical guarantees on convergence and reconstruction accuracy when used within plug-and-play methods. Empirical results across diverse sensing matrices demonstrate that NPN priors consistently enhance reconstruction fidelity in various imaging inverse problems, such as compressive sensing, deblurring, super-resolution, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging, with plug-and-play methods, unrolling networks, deep image prior, and diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Reliable Inference in Edge-Cloud Model Cascades via Conformal Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Edge intelligence enables low-latency inference via compact on-device models, but assuring reliability remains challenging. We study edge-cloud cascades that must preserve conditional coverage: whenever the edge returns a prediction set, it should contain the true label with a user-specified probability, as if produced by the cloud model. We formalize conditional coverage with respect to the cloud predictive distribution, and introduce a conformal alignment-based (CAb) cascading mechanism that certifies this property with user control over the risk level. Our method casts escalation from edge to cloud models as a multiple-hypothesis testing (MHT) problem, tailoring conformal alignment (CA) to select which inputs can be safely handled at the edge. The proposed CAb model cascading method yields statistical guarantees on the average fraction of edge decisions that satisfy cloud-level conditional coverage. The procedure applies to arbitrary edge prediction sets, including variants of conformal prediction (CP), and exposes a tunable trade-off among coverage, deferral rate, and set size. Experiments on CIFAR-100 image classification and the TeleQnA question-answering (QA) benchmark show that the proposed CAb cascade maintains the target conditional coverage for edge predictions while substantially reducing offloading to the cloud and incurring modest increases in prediction-set size.</description>
