      <title>The First Quantitative Study of Tail Regrowth of CME-Driven Disconnection in Comet C/2023 P1 Nishimura</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comet C/2023 P1 (Nishimura) was observed by the Solar Orbiter Heliospheric Imager (SoloHI), onboard the Solar Orbiter spacecraft, from 2023 September 1 to 14. During this period, the ion tail of the comet exhibited continual fluctuations and four tail disconnection events (TDEs), each coinciding with the passage of a coronal mass ejection (CME). In this work, we report on the ion tail dynamics of the best observed TDE, which occurred on September 11. The SoloHI white-light images reveal an abrupt bending, subsequent kinks, and severing of a downstream portion of the pre-existing ion tail. The onset of disconnection occurred $\sim$6.5 hours after the projected passage of the CME leading edge in the images, consistent with a CME flank encounter. After the disconnection, the ion tail reformed within $\sim$24 hours, with a regrowth rate of $\sim$86$\pm7~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, indicating the rate at which newly ionized material forms along the magnetic field draped around the comet's coma. After the TDE, the detached tail drifted anti-sunward at an estimated speed of $\sim$295$\pm20~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, comparable to the local CME flank's speed, suggesting that the severed plasma was most likely carried away from the comet by the CME. This study provides the first direct, quantitative characterization of comet-CME interactions and the subsequent regrowth phase of a cometary TDE. These measurements were achievable by SoloHI's unique inner-heliospheric coverage, thanks to a combination of high photometric sensitivity, short exposure times, and a wide field of view that preserves the fine-scale tail dynamics.</description>

      <title>Wave generation via oscillatory reconnection at a three-dimensional magnetic null point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work conducts a three-dimensional (3D), nonlinear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation to investigate wave generating, time-dependent reconnection around a magnetic null point. A non-periodic perturbation (in the $xz$-plane) triggers oscillatory reconnection (OR) at the 3D null, resulting in a self-sustained oscillation with a constant period $P$. We investigate the response of the system using three distinct wave proxies (compressible parallel, compressible transverse and incompressible parallel) as well as Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition for decoupling and analyzing the resultant MHD wave behavior. We find that OR generates a slow magnetoacoustic wave of period $P$ that propagates outwards in all directions along the spine and fan plane of the 3D null point. We also find the generation of a propagating Alfv\'en wave of period $P$, exclusively along the $y$-axis in the fan plane, i.e. in the direction perpendicular to the spine motion. These findings provide new insights into waves generated from a 3D null point and their implications for coronal seismology.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Irregularities Product: a data product utilizing the high-resolution Swarm plasma density data for space weather applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15762</link>

Abstract: We use the high-resolution Swarm faceplate plasma density data at 16 Hz to develop a set of parameters that can characterize multi-scale ionospheric structures and irregularities along the Swarm orbit. We present the methods for calculating density gradients over different window sizes, rate of change of density index, power spectral density and the spectral slope at both low and high latitudes. The faceplate plasma data are not continuously available through the years. However, about 8 years of data from Swarm A are processed from late 2014 to the end of 2025. Some statistical results from Swarm A are presented. The variations of plasma structures and irregularities are dependent on solar activity, season, local time and geomagnetic activities, and the variations show different patterns between low and high latitudes. For example, the high-latitude ionosphere is characterized by persistent ionospheric structures and irregularities poleward of 60 magnetic latitude, while the low-latitude ionospheric irregularities are only dominant during 19-01 local time near the magnetic equator. The occurrence of steep spectral slope at high latitudes shows clear seasonal variations, i.e., it maximizes during local summer and minimizes during local winter in both hemispheres. However, the occurrence of steep spectral slope at low latitudes is only sensible when significant plasma structures and irregularities are present. We further calculate the histogram of spectral slopes at low latitudes when the rate of change of density index is enhanced. The histogram resembles a Gaussian distribution with an expected value of 1.97. The processed data are available to the wider community. Given the high resolution, this new data product will be useful for the scientific communities that are interested in the magnetosphere-ionosphere-thermosphere coupling and near-Earth space environment.</description>
