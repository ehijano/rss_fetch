      <title>Statistical Analysis of High-frequency Whistler Waves at Earth's Bow Shock: Further Support for Stochastic Shock Drift Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We statistically investigate high-frequency whistler waves (with frequencies higher than $\sim 10$ % of the local elect ron cyclotron frequency) at Earth's bow shock using Magnetospheric Multi-Scale (MMS) spacecraft observations. We focus specifically on the wave power within the shock transition layer, where we expect electron acceleration via stochastic sh ock drift acceleration (SSDA) to occur associated with efficient pitch-angle scattering by whistler waves. We find that the wave power is positively correlated with both the Alfv\'en Mach number in the normal incidence frame $M_{\rm A}$ and in the de Hoffmann-Teller frame $M_{\rm A}/\cos \theta_{Bn}$. The empirical relation with $M_{\rm A}/\cos \theta_{Bn}$ is compared with the theory of SSDA that predicts a threshold wave power proportional to $(M_{\rm A}/\cos \theta_{Bn})^{-2}$. The result suggests that the wave power exceeds the theoretical threshold for $M_{\rm A} / \cos \theta_{Bn} \gtrsim 30-60$, beyond which efficient electron acceleration is expected. This aligns very well with previous statistical analysis of electron acceleration at Earth's bow shock (M. Oka, G eophys.~Res.~Lett., 33, 5, 2006). Therefore, we consider that this study provides further support for SSDA as the mechanism of electron acceleration at Earth's bow shock. At higher-Mach-number astrophysical shocks, SSDA will be able to inject electrons into the diffusive shock acceleration process for subsequent acceleration to cosmic-ray energies.</description>

      <title>The solar dynamo begins near the surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sun's magnetic dynamo cycle features a distinct pattern: a propagating region of sunspot emergence appears around 30 degrees latitude and vanishes near the equator every 11 years. Moreover, longitudinal flows called ``torsional oscillations" closely shadow sunspot migration, undoubtedly sharing a common. Contrary to theories suggesting deep origins for these phenomena, helioseismology pinpoints low-latitude torsional oscillations to the Sun's outer 5-10 percent, the ``Near-Surface Shear Layer". Within this zone, inwardly increasing differential rotation coupled with a poloidal magnetic field strongly implicates the Magneto-Rotational Instability renowned in accretion-disk theory and observed in laboratory experiments. Together, these two facts prompt the general question: Is it possible that the solar dynamo is a near-surface instability? Here, we report strong affirmative evidence in stark contrast to traditional paradigms focusing on the deeper tachocline. Simple analytic estimates show that the near-surface magneto-rotational instability better explains the spatiotemporal scales of the torsional oscillations and inferred subsurface magnetic field amplitudes. State-of-the-art numerical simulations corroborate these estimates and, strikingly, reproduce hemispherical magnetic current helicity laws. The dynamo resulting from a well-understood near-surface phenomenon improves prospects for accurate predictions of full magnetic cycles and space weather, impacting Earth's electromagnetic infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Impact of solar wind disappearance event on the Martian nightside ionospheric species: First results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.20003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of a rarest solar wind phenomenon [disappearing solar wind (DSW) event during 26-28 December 2022] on the Martian nightside ionosphere is investigated, for the first time, using MAVEN datasets. During an extremely low solar wind density, the Martian top nightside ionospheric species underwent significant enhancements. At a given altitude, the density of electron increased by ~2.5 times, while for ions (NO+, O2+, CO2+, C+, N+, O+, and OH+), it increased by &gt;10 times, respectively, compared to their typical average quiet-time periods. The extremely low dynamic pressure during the DSW event, contrasting with relatively higher nightside ionospheric thermal pressure nearly by an order, suggests an upward ionospheric expansion as a direct consequence. This causes an increased topside ionospheric density. Additionally, the day-to-night plasma transport may also be a contributing factor to increased plasma density. Thus, this study presents a new insight about planetary atmosphere/ionosphere response to the rarest event.</description>
