      <title>Molecular Control of Floquet Topological Phase in Non-adiabatic Thouless Pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonadiabatic Thouless pumping of electrons is studied in the framework of topological Floquet engineering, particularly focused on how changes to chemical moieties can control the emergence of the Floquet topological phase. We employ real-time time-dependent density functional theory to investigate the extent to which the topological invariant, the winding number, is impacted by molecular-level changes to trans-polyacetylene. In particular, several substitutions to trans-polyacetylene are studied to examine different effects on the electronic structure including mesomeric effect, inductive effect, and electron conjugation effect. Maximally-localized Wannier functions are employed to relate the winding number to the valence bond description by expressing the topological pumping as the transport dynamics of the localized Wannier functions. By further exploiting the gauge invariance of the quantum dynamics in terms of the minimal particle-hole excitations, the topological pumping of electrons can be also represented as a cyclic transition among the bonding and antibonding orbitals. Having connected the topological invariant to chemically intuitive concepts, we show the molecular-level control on the emergence of the Floquet topological phase, presenting us with a great opportunity for the intuitive engineering of molecular systems for such an exotic topological phase.</description>

      <title>Updated line list for the principal isotopologue of carbon monoxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The line list for the principal isotopologue of CO calculated earlier by the present authors [1, 2] with the irregular dipole-moment function (DMF) is updated with use of the recent high-precision measurements in the 3-0 [3, 4] (Bielska et al. 2022, Hodges et al. 2025) and 7-0 [5] (Balashov et al. 2023) bands. The new data came in contradiction with the experimental data on the 1-0 band [6, 7]. Therefore, we performed fitting several model DMFs to the modified original data set of Meshkov et al. [8] by including the new above-referenced data and by excluding the data for the 1-0 band. The updated line list is calculated with the irregular DMF. In particular, excellent agreement with recent high-level ab initio calculations on the 3-0 band [3] is emphasized and predictions for the 1-0 and 8-0 bands are outlined. In the new update of the HITRAN database [9], new high-precision measurements in the cold and hot fundamental bands are announced. When these data are published, they will be compared with the predictions of our new line list.</description>

      <title>Prediction of the aqueous redox properties of functionalized quinones using a new QM/MM variational formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recently proposed a method coupling quantum mechanics (QM) methods and molecular density functional theory (MDFT) to describe mixed quantum-classical systems [J. Chem. Phys. 161, 014113 (2024)]. This approach is particularly appropriate to account for solvent effect into QM calculations. We introduce a new variational formulation for the grand potential of a mixed quantum-classical system. Within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and neglecting electronic entropy, the quantum solute is described by a product of electronic and nuclear density matrices, both depending parametrically on coordinates of the classical solvent. It can then be shown that a functional of the total density matrix satisfies a variational principle for the grand potential. Using a mean-field approximation, we express the grand potential of the mixed quantum-classical system as a variational problem which depends only on the nuclear density matrix, which experiences an external field generated by the electronic and classical one-particle densities. In practice, the grand potential is computed by a series of coupled classical and quantum DFT calculations, together with geometry optimization.</description>

      <title>Efficient vectorized evaluation of Gaussian AO integrals on modern central processing units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report an implementation of the McMurchie-Davidson evaluation scheme for 1- and 2-particle Gaussian AO integrals designed for efficient execution on modern central processing units (CPUs) with Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) instruction sets. Like in our recent MD implementation for graphical processing units (GPUs) [J. Chem. Phys. 160, 244109 (2024)], variable-sized batches of shellsets of integrals are evaluated at a time. By optimizing for the floating point instruction throughput rather than minimizing the number of operations, this approach achieves up to 50% of the theoretical hardware peak FP64 performance for many common SIMD-equipped platforms (AVX2, AVX512, NEON), which translates to speedups of up to 30 over the state-of-the-art one-shellset-at-a-time implementation of Obara-Saika-type schemes in Libint for a variety of primitive and contracted integrals. As with our previous work, we rely on the standard C++ programming language -- such as the std::simd standard library feature to be included in the 2026 ISO C++ standard -- without any explicit code generation to keep the code base small and portable. The implementation is part of the open source LibintX library freely available at https://github.com/ValeevGroup/libintx.</description>

      <title>Newton optimization for the Multiconfiguration Self Consistent Field method at the basis set limit: closed-shell two-electron systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multiconfiguration self-consistent-field (MCSCF) method is revisited with the specific focus on the two electron systems for simplicity. A wave function is represented as a linear combination of Slater determinants. Both orbitals and coefficients of this configuration interaction expansion are optimized following the variational principle making use of the Newton optimization technique. It reduces the MCSCF problem to solving a particular differential Newton system, which can be discretized with multiwavelets and solved iteratively.</description>

      <title>A deep learning model for chemical shieldings in molecular organic solids including anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) chemical shifts are powerful probes of local atomic and electronic structure that can be used to resolve the structures of powdered or amorphous molecular solids. Chemical shift driven structure elucidation depends critically on accurate and fast predictions of chemical shieldings, and machine learning (ML) models for shielding predictions are increasingly used as scalable and efficient surrogates for demanding ab initio calculations. However, the prediction accuracies of current ML models still lag behind those of the DFT reference methods they approximate, especially for nuclei such as $^{13}$C and $^{15}$N. Here, we introduce ShiftML3.0, a deep-learning model that improves the accuracy of predictions of isotropic chemical shieldings in molecular solids, and does so while also predicting the full shielding tensor. On experimental benchmark sets, we find root-mean-squared errors with respect to experiment for ShiftML3.0 that approach those of DFT reference calculations, with RMSEs of 0.53 ppm for $^{1}$H, 2.4 ppm for $^{13}$C, and 7.2 ppm for $^{15}$N, compared to DFT values of 0.49 ppm, 2.3 ppm, and 5.8 ppm, respectively.</description>

      <title>Leveraging active learning-enhanced machine-learned interatomic potential for efficient infrared spectra prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is a pivotal analytical tool as it provides real-time molecular insight into material structures and enables the observation of reaction intermediates in situ. However, interpreting IR spectra often requires high-fidelity simulations, such as density functional theory based ab-initio molecular dynamics, which are computationally expensive and therefore limited in the tractable system size and complexity. In this work, we present a novel active learning-based framework, implemented in the open-source software package PALIRS, for efficiently predicting the IR spectra of small catalytically relevant organic molecules. PALIRS leverages active learning to train a machine-learned interatomic potential, which is then used for machine learning-assisted molecular dynamics simulations to calculate IR spectra. PALIRS reproduces IR spectra computed with ab-initio molecular dynamics accurately at a fraction of the computational cost. PALIRS further agrees well with available experimental data not only for IR peak positions but also for their amplitudes. This advancement with PALIRS enables high-throughput prediction of IR spectra, facilitating the exploration of larger and more intricate catalytic systems and aiding the identification of novel reaction pathways.</description>

      <title>Assignment of collision-induced four-level double-resonance transitions in the 3${\nu}$${_3}$ ${\Leftarrow}$ ${\nu}$${_3}$ spectral region of methane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical-optical double-resonance (OODR) spectroscopy using a narrow-linewidth pump and a frequency comb probe has previously been used to measure and assign sub-Doppler transitions in the 3${\nu}$${_3}$ ${\Leftarrow}$ ${\nu}$${_3}$ spectral region [J. Chem. Phys. 161, 124311 (2024)] when pumping from the J = (7, A${_2}$) ground state. Doppler-broadened double-resonance transitions were also observed in those OODR spectra. In this paper, 68 of these Doppler-broadened transitions are assigned to four-level double-resonance transitions involving collisional transfer from the pumped A${_1}$ symmetry state to other A${_1}$ and A${_2}$ symmetry (I = 2 meta nuclear spin) levels of the ${\nu}$${_3}$ fundamental state. Assignments are made using combination differences and comparison with the term values and intensities of lines predicted by a new effective Hamiltonian, the accuracy of which has been validated by the sub-Doppler transitions.</description>

      <title>Multireference equation-of-motion driven similarity renormalization group: theoretical foundations and applications to ionized states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a formulation and implementation of an equation-of-motion (EOM) extension of the multireference driven similarity renormalization group (MR-DSRG) formalism for ionization potentials (IP-EOM-DSRG). The IP-EOM-DSRG formalism results in a Hermitian generalized eigenvalue problem, delivering accurate ionization potentials for systems with strongly correlated ground and excited states. The EOM step scales as $O(N^5)$ with the basis set size $N$, allowing for efficient calculation of spectroscopic properties, such as transition energies and intensities. The IP-EOM-DSRG formalism is combined with three truncation schemes of the parent MR-DSRG theory: an iterative nonperturbative method with up to two-body excitations [MR-LDSRG(2)] and second- and third-order perturbative approximations [DSRG-MRPT2/3]. We benchmark these variants by computing 1) the vertical valence ionization potentials of a series of small molecules at both equilibrium and stretched geometries; 2) the spectroscopic constants of several low-lying electronic states of the OH, CN, N2+, and CO+ radicals; and 3) the binding curves of low-lying electronic states of the CN radical. A comparison with experimental data and theoretical results shows that all three IP-EOM-DSRG methods accurately reproduce the vertical ionization potentials and spectroscopic constants of these systems. Notably, the DSRG-MRPT3 and MR-LDSRG(2) versions outperform several state-of-the-art multireference methods of comparable or higher cost.</description>

      <title>Perspective on Utilizing Foundation Models for Laboratory Automation in Materials Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review explores the potential of foundation models to advance laboratory automation in the materials and chemical sciences. It emphasizes the dual roles of these models: cognitive functions for experimental planning and data analysis, and physical functions for hardware operations. While traditional laboratory automation has relied heavily on specialized, rigid systems, foundation models offer adaptability through their general-purpose intelligence and multimodal capabilities. Recent advancements have demonstrated the feasibility of using large language models (LLMs) and multimodal robotic systems to handle complex and dynamic laboratory tasks. However, significant challenges remain, including precision manipulation of hardware, integration of multimodal data, and ensuring operational safety. This paper outlines a roadmap highlighting future directions, advocating for close interdisciplinary collaboration, benchmark establishment, and strategic human-AI integration to realize fully autonomous experimental laboratories.</description>

      <title>Electron Impact Fragmentation Dynamics of Carbonyl Sulfide: A Combined Experimental and Theoretical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the interactions of low- to intermediate-energy electrons (0$-$45 eV) with carbonyl sulfide (OCS). These collisions lead to the formation of several anionic fragments, including C$^-$, O$^-$, S$^-$, and SO$^-$. When the incident electron energy is below the first ionization potential of the molecule, dissociative electron attachment (DEA) process dominates, primarily yielding O$^-$ and S$^-$ fragments. At higher energies, beyond the ionization potential, ion-pair dissociation (IPD) becomes the dominant process, resulting in the emergence of additional fragments such as C$^-$ and SO$^-$. This leads to an increasingly intricate mechanism, necessitating a detailed analysis to elucidate the ion-pair dissociation pathways. The absolute cross section for S$^-$ ions has been determined using the well-established relative flow technique. Theoretical cross sections are calculated using the multi-configurational time-dependent hartree (MCTDH) method, with each potential energy curve obtained from equation-of-motion coupled-cluster singles and doubles (EOM-CCSD) calculations. The computed values are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. The analysis reveals contributions from both linear and bent anionic resonant states. Due to low count rates, only relative cross section curves have been obtained for the O$^-$ and SO$^-$ ions. At higher energies, the ion pair thresholds are evaluated using the Wannier threshold law, yielding values consistent with those derived from thermochemical data.</description>

      <title>The Software Landscape for the Density Matrix Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm is a cornerstone computational method for studying quantum many-body systems, renowned for its accuracy and adaptability. Despite DMRG's broad applicability across fields such as materials science, quantum chemistry, and quantum computing, numerous independent implementations have been developed. This survey maps the rapidly expanding DMRG software landscape, providing a comprehensive comparison of features among 35 existing packages. We found significant overlap in features among the packages when comparing key aspects, such as parallelism strategies for high-performance computing and symmetry-adapted formulations that enhance efficiency. This overlap suggests opportunities for modularization of common operations, including tensor operations, symmetry representations, and eigensolvers, as the packages are mostly independent and share few third-party library dependencies where functionality is factored out. More widespread modularization and standardization would result in reduced duplication of efforts and improved interoperability. We believe that the proliferation of packages and the current lack of standard interfaces and modularity are more social than technical. We aim to raise awareness of existing packages, guide researchers in finding a suitable package for their needs, and help developers identify opportunities for collaboration, modularity standardization, and optimization. Ultimately, this work emphasizes the value of greater cohesion and modularity, which would benefit DMRG software, allowing these powerful algorithms to tackle more complex and ambitious problems.</description>

      <title>Assessing Vibrational Frequencies of CO Adsorbed on Cerium Oxide Surfaces Using SCAN and r2SCAN Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vibrational frequency of carbon monoxide (CO) adsorbed on ceria-based catalysts serves as a sensitive probe for identifying exposed surface facets, provided that experimental reference data on well-defined single-crystal surfaces and reliable theoretical assignments are available. Previous studies have shown that the hybrid DFT approach using the HSE06 functional yields good agreement with experimental observations, whereas the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with PBE+U does not. In this work, we assess the performance of different exchange-correlation functionals by comparing the meta-GGA functionals SCAN and r2SCAN meta-GGA functionals with HSE06 in predicting CO vibrational frequencies on cerium oxide surfaces. The meta-GGA functionals offer no significant improvement for oxidized CeO2(111) and CeO2(110) surfaces and fail to localize excess charge on the reduced surfaces. Adding a Hubbard U term improves charge localization, but the predicted vibrational frequencies still fall short of HSE06 accuracy. These limitations are attributed to the meta-GGA's inability to adequately capture facet- and configuration-specific donation and back-donation effects, which influence the C-O bond length and CO force constant upon adsorption. Despite the higher computational cost when used with plane-wave basis sets, hybrid DFT remains essential for accurate interpretation of experimental results.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of Activator Solutions for Geopolymer Synthesis: Thermochemical Stability, Sequencing, and Standardisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geopolymers present a sustainable alternative to conventional binders, however, their commercial viability is hindered by a lack of standardised methods for preparing stabile activator solutions; alkaline feedstocks critical to geopolymer synthesis. This study presents a combined experimental and modelling approach to evaluate the thermochemical stability, solubility constraints, and silica speciation behaviour of sodium silicate-based activators. Using quantitative 29Si NMR analysis, thermodynamic stability and three-dimensional solubility modelling, this research identifies optimal preparation conditions that minimise irreversible precipitation risks and optimises mixing periods. Key findings indicate that higher solution temperatures associated with optimised activator solution preparation were found to enhance thermochemical stability and reactivity, while cooling increased viscosity and the likelihood of unstable solution behaviour, which may necessitate discarding. The order in which feedstocks are combined directly affects whether the solution becomes unstable, with an optimal sequence of water, alkali-hydroxide, soluble silicate found to ensure greater process reliability. A predictive model and accompanying visual tools enable practitioners to assess solution viability and define stability windows by quantifying initial and final/unstable periods and temperatures based on feedstock composition and solution temperature. These results contribute to improved reproducibility and quality control in geopolymer research and represent a step toward developing standard operating procedures for activator solution synthesis.</description>

      <title>Magnetic hyperfine structure constants of $^{137}$BaF in the $^2\Pi_{1/2}$ and $^2\Pi_{3/2}$ excited states</title>

Abstract: High-precision molecular experiments testing the Standard Model of particle physics require an accurate understanding of the molecular structure at the hyperfine level, both for the control of the molecules and for the interpretation of the results. In this work, we calculate the hyperfine structure constants for the excited states $^2\Pi_{1/2}$ and $^2\Pi_{3/2}$ of $^{137}$BaF due to the $^{137}$Ba nucleus. We use the 4-component relativistic Fock-space coupled-cluster method, extrapolating our results to the complete basis set limit. We investigate the effect of the basis sets and electron correlation, and estimate the uncertainty in our final results. Our results are used in the interpretation of the experimental spectroscopy of the hyperfine and rovibrational spectra of BaF, and the planning of laser-cooling schemes for future parity-violating anapole moment measurements [1].</description>

      <title>Efficient algorithms for quantum chemistry on modular quantum processors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum chemistry is a promising application of future quantum computers, but the requirements on qubit count and other resources suggest that modular computing architectures will be required. We introduce an implementation of a quantum chemistry algorithm that is distributed across several computational modules: the distributed unitary selective coupled cluster (dUSCC). We design a packing scheme using the pseudo-commutativity of Trotterization to maximize the parallelism while optimizing the scheduling of all inter-module gates around the buffering of inter-module Bell pairs. We demonstrate dUSCC on a 3-cluster (H$_4$)$_3$ chain and show that it naturally utilizes the molecule's structure to reduce inter-module latency. We show that the run time of dUSCC is unchanged with inter-module latency up to $\sim$20$\times$ slower than intra-module gates in the (H$_4$)$_3$ while maintaining chemical accuracy. dUSCC should be "free" in the weakly entangled systems, and the existence of "free" dUSCC can be found efficiently using classical algorithms. This new compilation scheme both leverages pseudo-commutativity and considers inter-module gate scheduling, and potentially provides an efficient distributed compilation of other Trotterized algorithms.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the nanoscopic phase behavior of ternary solutions in the presence of electrolytes: from pre-Ouzo to Ouzo region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we report a comprehensive study of how electrolyte addition governs the structure and stability of surfactant-free microemulsions in a trans-anethol/ethanol/water system. The universal structural response has been validated, spanning the full range of solution dispersed-phase structurings, from sub-10 nm W/O reverse-aggregates to O/W mesoscopic droplets (~100 nm) and classical Ouzo droplets (~1 {\mu}m). Experimental results reveal that there is a threshold for electrolyte levels above which oil-in-water nanodroplet coalescence and phase separation are triggered: screening of electrical double layers and "salting out" of hydrophobic components drives hydrotrope into fewer, larger droplets. The total oil volume sequestered in the dispersed phase remains essentially constant, indicating oil redistribution rather than dissolution. In contrast, water-in-oil nanodroplets in a predominantly organic medium display near-complete insensitivity to ionic strength, owing to low dielectric screening and tight interfacial packing that exclude substantial ion uptake. Finally, addition of high salt to Ouzo droplets accelerates their collapse: large droplets fuse and sediment, leaving only residual nanostructures and confirming electrolyte-driven phase demixing. This insight offers clear guidelines for designing additive-free emulsions with tailored lifetimes and nanostructure architectures across pharmaceutical, food, and materials applications.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-minimized orbitals enable faster quantum simulation of molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computation offers significant potential for accelerating the simulation of molecules and materials through algorithms such as quantum phase estimation (QPE). However, the expected speedup in ground-state energy estimation depends critically on the ability to efficiently prepare an initial state with high overlap with the true ground state. For strongly correlated molecules such as iron-sulfur clusters, this overlap is demonstrated to decay exponentially with system size. To alleviate this problem, we introduce an efficient classical algorithm to find entanglement-minimized orbitals (EMOs) using spin-adapted matrix product states (MPS) with small bond dimensions. The EMO basis yields a more compact ground-state representation, significantly easing initial state preparation for challenging systems. Our algorithm improves initial state overlap by nearly an order of magnitude over prior orbital optimization approaches for an iron-sulfur cluster with four irons, and is scalable to larger systems with many unpaired electrons, including the P-cluster and FeMo-cofactor in nitrogenase with eight transition metal centers. For these systems, we achieve substantial enhancements on initial state overlap by factors of $O(10^2)$ and $O(10^5)$, respectively, compared to results obtained using localized orbitals. Our results show that initial state preparation for these challenging systems requires far fewer resources than prior estimates suggested.</description>

      <title>Nudged-Elastic Band Calculations of Polymorph Transitions and Solid-State Reactions in Molecular Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10506v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The modeling of solid-state transformations, such as polymorphic transitions and chemical reactions in molecular crystals, is vital for many applications including drug design or the development of new synthesis methods. However, a description via nudged-elastic band (NEB) calculations faces several crucial challenges. First, the automatic initial pathway generation based on a linear interpolation often fails for periodic systems, leading to unrealistic geometries and atomic collisions. Second, the necessary system sizes are typically beyond the scope of density functional theory (DFT) calculations in terms of computational cost, but the associated accuracy is vitally needed. To address these issues, we introduce a hybrid interpolation method that combines linear interpolation for cell parameters with spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) for molecular structures or intramolecular fragments, ensuring smooth and realistic transitions. Moreover, we train and benchmark machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) based on the SO3krates equivariant neural network architecture to accelerate NEB calculations while retaining near-DFT accuracy. We apply our approach to two polymorph transitions and a solid-state Diels-Alder reaction and show that our new interpolation method reliably produces viable initial pathways. The MLFFs are trained on PBE+MBD reference data and reproduce DFT lattice energies with a mean absolute error of 0.4 kJ/mol along the minimum-energy paths. These results highlight the potential of combining advanced interpolation techniques with MLFFs to enable automated, accurate, and efficient exploration of solid-state transformations in molecular crystals.</description>

      <title>ILVES: Accurate and efficient bond length and angle constraints in molecular dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All-atom, force field-based molecular dynamics simulations are essential tools in computational chemistry, enabling the prediction and analysis of biomolecular systems with atomic-level resolution. However, as system sizes and simulation timescales increase, so does the associated computational cost. To extend simulated time using the same resources, a common strategy is to constrain the fastest degrees of freedom, such as bond lengths, allowing for larger integration time steps without compromising accuracy. The de facto state-of-the-art algorithms for this purpose (SHAKE, LINCS, and P-LINCS) are integrated into most molecular dynamics packages and widely adopted across the field. Despite their impact, these methods exhibit limitations: all converge slowly when high numerical accuracy is required, and the LINCS and P-LINCS algorithms cannot handle general angular constraints, limiting further increases in time step.
  In this article, we introduce ILVES, a family of parallel algorithms that converge so rapidly that it is now practical to solve bond length and associated angular constraint equations as accurately as the hardware will allow. We have integrated ILVES into Gromacs and our analysis demonstrates that it is superior to the state-of-the-art when constraining bond lengths. Due to its better convergence properties, we also show that if the time step is increased up to 3.5 fs by enforcing angular constraints, ILVES enables a 1.65x increase in simulated time using the same computational resources and wall-clock time, an outcome unattainable with current methods. This advance can significantly reduce the computational cost of most all-atom molecular dynamics simulations while improving their accuracy and extending access to larger systems and longer timescales.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Core-Valence-Separated Molecular Mean-Field Exact-Two-Component Equation-of-Motion Coupled Cluster Theory: Applications to L-edge X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: L-edge X-ray absorption spectra for first-row transition metal complexes are obtained from relativistic equation-of-motion singles and doubles coupled-cluster (EOM-CCSD) calculations that make use of the core-valence separation (CVS) scheme, with scalar and spin--orbit relativistic effects modeled within the molecular mean-field exact two-component (X2C) framework. By incorporating relativistic effects variationally at the Dirac--Coulomb--Breit (DCB) reference level, this method delivers accurate predictions of L-edge features, including energy shifts, intensity ratios, and fine-structure splittings, across a range of molecular systems. Benchmarking against perturbative spin--orbit treatments and relativistic TDDFT highlights the superior performance and robustness of the CVS-DCB-X2C-EOM-CCSD approach, including the reliability of basis set recontraction schemes. While limitations remain in describing high-density spectral regions, our results establish CVS-DCB-X2C-EOM-CCSD as a powerful and broadly applicable tool for relativistic core-excitation spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>On data and dimension in chemistry -- irreversibility, concealment and emergent conservation laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09553v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical systems are interpreted through the species they contain and the reactions they may undergo, i.e., their chemical reaction network (CRN). In spite of their central importance to chemistry, the structure of CRNs continues to be challenging to deduce from data. Although there exist structural laws relating species, reactions, conserved quantities and cycles, there has been limited attention to their measurable consequences. One such is the dimension of the chemical data: the number of independent reactions or equivalently independent species, which corresponds to the number of measured variables minus the number of constraints. In this paper we attempt to relate the experimentally observed dimensional features to conservation laws and underlying CRN structure. Our approach extends to any Markov model as well as many nonlinear models in statistical physics and furnishes new analytical tools to find exact solutions.
  In particular, we investigate the effects of species that are concealed and reactions that are irreversible. For instance, irreversible reactions can have proportional rates. The resulting reduction in degrees of freedom can be captured by the co-production law relating co-production relationships to emergent non-integer conservation laws and broken cycles. This law resolves a recent conundrum posed by a machine-discovered candidate for a non-integer conservation law, and characterizes certain types of CRN behavior. We also obtain laws that allow us to relate data dimension to network structure in cases where some species cannot be discerned or distinguished by a given analytical technique, allowing to narrow down candidate CRNs from experimental data more effectively.</description>

      <title>Effects of scalar correlation and evaporation-induced enthalpy reduction in LES-FGM simulations of ethanol spray flames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01045v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the objective of carbon neutrality, accurate simulation of ethanol spray combustion is imperative for advanced engine design. In spray flames, the droplet evaporation not only reduces the ambient gas-phase temperature, but also influences flame dynamics by generating substantial local fluctuations of the mixture fraction $\widetilde{Z}$ and progress variable $\widetilde{c}$. These two scalars, conventionally assumed independent in flamelet models, exhibit significant correlations arising from the coupling among evaporation, turbulent mixing and chemical reactions. This study proposes a six-dimensional flamelet-generated manifolds (FGM) method, considering the evaporation-induced specific enthalpy reduction and scalar correlation. A novel joint presumed probability density function (PDF) method is derived using the copula theory, achieving rapid grid convergence and good feasibility. Large-eddy simulation (LES) is performed on the Sydney ethanol turbulent spray flames (EtF1, EtF4 and EtF7), which feature different ethanol mass flow rates and jet Reynolds numbers. Both gas and liquid phase statistics show good agreement with experimental data across the three flames. The incorporation of specific enthalpy reduction and scalar correlation in FGM modeling improves gas temperature predictions, along with enhanced liquid-phase prediction through refined gas-field resolution. The correlation coefficient of $\widetilde{Z}$ and $\widetilde{c}$ is found to be a competing result of local evaporation and combustion, since evaporation elevates mixture fraction and dilutes reaction progress variable, whereas chemical reactions enhance progress variable fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Finding Thermodynamically Favorable Pathways in Chemical Reaction Networks Using Flows in Hypergraphs and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for pathways that optimize the formation of a particular target molecule in a reaction network is a key problem in many settings, including reactor systems. Chemical reaction networks are mathematically well represented as hypergraphs, modeling that facilitates the search for pathways by computational means. We propose to enrich an existing search method for pathways by including thermodynamic principles. In more detail, we give a mixed-integer linear programming (mixed ILP) formulation of the search problem into which we integrate chemical potentials and concentrations for individual molecules, enabling us to constrain the search to return pathways containing only thermodynamically favorable reactions. Moreover, if multiple possible pathways are found, we can rank these by objective functions based on thermodynamics. As an example of use, we apply the framework to a reaction network representing the HCN-formamide chemistry. Alternative pathways to the one currently hypothesized in the literature are queried and enumerated, including some that score better according to our chosen objective function.</description>

Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators with propagating topological edge states are promising for dissipationless transport, while their one-dimensional analogs are capable of hosting localized topological junction states that are mainly envisaged for quantum computing and spintronics. Here, in contrast, we propose to use the localized nature of topological junction states for sensing applications. We report a systematic topological classification of a wide class of graphene nanoribbons represented by already synthesized extended chevron species. Using this classification, we theoretically model a double junction transport that shows an enhanced interaction with the NO$_2$ molecule. Our results show that topological junction states of nanoribbons can open an avenue for topological sensing and junction-assisted chemistry applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new set of correlation-consistent effective core potentials (ccECPs) for selected heavy $s$, $p$, $d$, and $f$-block elements significant in materials science and chemistry (Rb, Sr, Cs, Ba, In, Sb, Pb, Ru, Cd, La, Ce, and Eu). The ccECPs are designed using minimal Gaussian parameterization to achieve smooth and bounded potentials. They are expressed as a combination of averaged relativistic effective potentials (AREP) and effective spin-orbit (SO) terms, developed within a relativistic coupled-cluster framework. The optimization is driven by correlated all-electron (AE) atomic spectra, norm-conservation, and spin-orbit splittings, with considerations for plane wave cut-offs to ensure accuracy and viability across various electronic configurations. Transferability of these ccECPs is validated through testing on molecular oxides and hydrides, emphasizing discrepancies in molecular binding energies across a spectrum of bond lengths and electronic environments. The ccECPs demonstrate excellent agreement with AE reference calculations, attaining chemical accuracy in bond dissociation energies and equilibrium bond lengths, even in systems characterized by substantial relativistic and correlation effects. These ccECPs provide accurate and transferable framework for valence-only calculations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuits for the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Szegedy's quantization of a reversible Markov chain provides a quantum walk whose mixing time is quadratically smaller than that of the classical walk. Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the acceptance probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH simulations.</description>
