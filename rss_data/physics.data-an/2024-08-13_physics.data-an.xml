      <title>Predictive maintenance solution for industrial systems -- an unsupervised approach based on log periodic power law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new unsupervised predictive maintenance analysis method based on the renormalization group approach used to discover critical behavior in complex systems has been proposed. The algorithm analyzes univariate time series and detects critical points based on a newly proposed theorem that identifies critical points using a Log Periodic Power Law function fits. Application of a new algorithm for predictive maintenance analysis of industrial data collected from reciprocating compressor systems is presented. Based on the knowledge of the dynamics of the analyzed compressor system, the proposed algorithm predicts valve and piston rod seal failures well in advance.</description>

      <title>Superuniversal Statistics of Complex Time-Delays in Non-Hermitian Scattering Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Wigner-Smith time-delay of flux conserving systems is a real quantity that measures how long an excitation resides in an interaction region. The complex generalization of time-delay to non-Hermitian systems is still under development, in particular, its statistical properties in the short-wavelength limit of complex chaotic scattering systems has not been investigated. From the experimentally measured multi-port scattering ($S$)-matrices of one-dimensional graphs, a two-dimensional billiard, and a three-dimensional cavity, we calculate the complex Wigner-Smith ($\tau_{WS}$), as well as each individual reflection ($\tau_{xx}$) and transmission ($\tau_{xy}$) time-delays. The complex reflection time-delay differences ($\tau_{\delta R}$) between each port are calculated, and the transmission time-delay differences ($\tau_{\delta T}$) are introduced for systems exhibiting non-reciprocal scattering. Large time-delays are associated with coherent perfect absorption, reflectionless scattering, slow light, and uni-directional invisibility. We demonstrate that the large-delay tails of the distributions of the real and imaginary parts of each of these time-delay quantities are superuniversal, independent of experimental parameters: uniform attenuation $\eta$, number of scattering channels $M$, wave propagation dimension $\mathcal{D}$, and Dyson symmetry class $\beta$. This superuniversality is in direct contrast with the well-established time-delay statistics of unitary scattering systems, where the tail of the $\tau_{WS}$ distribution depends explicitly on the values of $M$ and $\beta$. Due to the direct analogy of the wave equations, the time-delay statistics described in this paper are applicable to any non-Hermitian wave-chaotic scattering system in the short-wavelength limit, such as quantum graphs, electromagnetic, optical and acoustic resonators, etc.</description>

      <title>On how to determine surface roughness power spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analytical contact mechanics theories depend on surface roughness through the surface roughness power spectrum. In the present study, we evaluated the usability of various experimental methods for studying surface roughness. Our findings indicated that height data obtained from optical methods often lack accuracy and should not be utilized for calculating surface roughness power spectra. Conversely, engineering stylus instruments and atomic force microscopy (AFM) typically yield reliable results that are consistent across the overlapping roughness length scale region. For surfaces with isotropic roughness, the two-dimensional (2D) power spectrum can be derived from the one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum using several approaches, which we explored in this paper.</description>

      <title>Exponentially improved efficient machine learning for quantum many-body states with provable guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving the ground state and the ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems is generically a hard task for classical algorithms. For a family of Hamiltonians defined on an $m$-dimensional space of physical parameters, the ground state and its properties at an arbitrary parameter configuration can be predicted via a machine learning protocol up to a prescribed prediction error $\varepsilon$, provided that a sample set (of size $N$) of the states can be efficiently prepared and measured. In a recent work [Huang et al., Science 377, eabk3333 (2022)], a rigorous guarantee for such a generalization was proved. Unfortunately, an exponential scaling for the provable sample complexity, $N=m^{{\cal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)}$, was found to be universal for generic gapped Hamiltonians. This result applies to the situation where the dimension of the parameter space is large while the scaling with the accuracy is not an urgent factor. In this work, we consider an alternative scenario where $m$ is a finite, not necessarily large constant while the scaling with the prediction error becomes the central concern. By jointly preserving the fundamental properties of density matrices in the learning protocol and utilizing the continuity of quantum states in the parameter range of interest, we rigorously obtain a polynomial sample complexity for predicting quantum many-body states and their properties, with respect to the uniform prediction error $\varepsilon$ and the number of qubits $n$. Moreover, if restricted to learning local quantum-state properties, the number of samples with respect to $n$ can be further reduced exponentially. Our results provide theoretical guarantees for efficient learning of quantum many-body states and their properties, with model-independent applications not restricted to ground states of gapped Hamiltonians.</description>

      <title>Efficient Generation of Grids and Traversal Graphs in Compositional Spaces towards Exploration and Path Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many disciplines of science and engineering deal with problems related to compositions, ranging from chemical compositions in materials science to portfolio compositions in economics. They exist in non-Euclidean simplex spaces, causing many standard tools to be incorrect or inefficient, which is significant in combinatorically or structurally challenging spaces exemplified by Compositionally Complex Materials (CCMs) and Functionally Graded Materials (FGMs). Here, we explore them conceptually in terms of problem spaces and quantitatively in terms of computational feasibility.
  This work implements several essential methods specific to the compositional (simplex) spaces through a high-performance open-source library nimplex. Most significantly, we derive and implement an algorithm for constructing a novel n-dimensional simplex graph data structure, which contains all discretized compositions and all possible neighbor-to-neighbor transitions as pointer arrays. Critically, no distance or neighborhood calculations are performed, instead leveraging pure combinatorics and the ordering in procedurally generated simplex grids, keeping the algorithm $\mathcal{O}(N)$, so that graphs with billions of transitions take seconds to construct on a laptop. Furthermore, we demonstrate how such graph representations can be combined to express path-planning problem spaces and to incorporate prior knowledge while keeping the problem space homogeneous. This allows for efficient deployment of existing high-performance gradient descent, graph traversal search, and other path optimization algorithms.</description>

      <title>Capturing the Variability of the Nocturnal Boundary Layer through Localized Perturbation Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07602v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A single-column model is used to investigate regime transitions within the stable atmospheric boundary layer, focusing on the role of small-scale fluctuations in wind and temperature dynamics and of turbulence intermittency as triggers for these transitions. Previous studies revealed abrupt near-surface temperature inversion transitions within a limited wind speed range. However, representing these transitions in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and climate models is a known difficulty. To shed light on boundary layer processes that explain these abrupt transitions, the Ekman layer height and its correlation with regime shifts are analyzed. A sensitivity study is performed with several types of perturbations of the wind and temperature tendencies, as well as with the inclusion of intermittent turbulent mixing through a stochastic stability function, to quantify the effect of small fluctuations of the dynamics on regime transitions. The combined results for all tested perturbation types indicate that small-scale phenomena can drive persistent regime transitions from very to weakly stable regimes, but for the opposite direction, no evidence of persistent regime transitions was found. The inclusion of intermittency prevents the model from getting trapped in the very stable regime, thus preventing the so-called "runaway cooling", an issue for commonly used short-tail stability functions. The findings suggest that using stochastic parameterizations of boundary layer processes, either through stochastically perturbed tendencies or parameters, is an effective approach to represent sharp transitions in the boundary layer regimes and is, therefore, a promising avenue to improve the representation of stable boundary layers in NWP and climate models.</description>
