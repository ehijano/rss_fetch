      <title>Tfin Crypto: From Speculation to Optimization in Risk Managed Crypto Portfolio Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cryptocurrency trading has attracted tremendous attention from both retail and institutional investors. However, most traders fail to scale their assets under management due to fragile strategies that collapse during adverse markets. The primary causes are oversized leverage, speculative position sizing, and the absence of robust risk management or hedging mechanisms. This paper introduces Tfin Crypto, an end to end framework for crypto portfolio allocation that shifts the paradigm from speculation to optimization. The proposed pipeline consists of four stages: universe selection, alpha backtesting, volatility aware portfolio optimization, and dynamic drawdown based risk management. By combining operations research techniques with practical risk controls, Tfin Crypto enables scalable crypto portfolios that can withstand market downturns. In live 30 day trading on Binance Futures, the framework achieved a return on investment (ROI) of +16.68%, with the Sharpe ratio reaching 5.72 and the maximum drawdown contained at just 4.56%, demonstrating strong downside risk control. The system executed 227 trades, of which 131 were profitable, resulting in a win rate of 57.71% and a PnL of +1,137.49 USDT. Importantly, these results outperformed the buy and hold baseline (Sharpe 1.79, ROI 4.36%, MDD 4.96%) as well as several top leader copy trading bots on Binance, highlighting both the competitiveness and scalability of Tfin Crypto in real world trading environments.</description>

      <title>Sharpe-Driven Stock Selection and Liquidiy-Constrained Portfolio Optimization: Evidence from the Chinese Equity Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops and empirically evaluates a Sharpe-driven stock selection and liquidity-constrained portfolio optimization framework designed for the Chinese equity market. The proposed methodology integrates three sequential stages: Sharpe-ratio-based universe selection, liquidity-adjusted mean-variance optimization, and multi-layered risk management implemented within an automated trading bot. Using daily price and volume data from 2023 to 2025 across the A-share universe, the framework dynamically identifies stocks exhibiting strong risk-adjusted performance while accounting for trading frictions and liquidity asymmetries that are common in emerging markets. Empirical backtests reveal that the proposed strategy achieves an annualized return of 25 percent, a Sharpe ratio of 1.71, and a maximum drawdown of 8.2 percent. These results significantly outperform the Buy-and-Hold benchmark, which records an annualized return of 21 percent, a Sharpe ratio of 1.62, and a drawdown of 7.6 percent over the same period. The superior performance demonstrates that incorporating risk-adjusted selection and liquidity-aware constraints enhances both profitability and stability, enabling the portfolio to capture upside potential while maintaining drawdown resilience. Beyond its empirical success, this study contributes methodologically by bridging classical mean-variance theory with practical liquidity adjustments and dynamic Sharpe-based screening. The resulting system not only improves the tradability of optimized portfolios but also provides a scalable and adaptive framework for quantitative asset allocation in liquidity-sensitive markets, offering new evidence that disciplined risk-return optimization can outperform passive investment strategies in the post-2023 Chinese equity landscape.</description>
