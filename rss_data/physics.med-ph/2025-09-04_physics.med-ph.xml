      <title>Advancing Positron Emission Tomography Image Quantification: Artificial Intelligence-Driven Methods, Clinical Challenges, and Emerging Opportunities in Long-Axial Field-of-View Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MTV is increasingly recognized as an accurate estimate of disease burden, which has prognostic value, but its implementation has been hindered by the time-consuming need for manual segmentation of images. Automated quantitation using AI-driven approaches is promising. AI-driven automated quantification significantly reduces labor-intensive manual segmentation, improving consistency, reproducibility, and feasibility for routine clinical practice. AI-enhanced radiomics provides comprehensive characterization of tumor biology, capturing intratumoral and intertumoral heterogeneity beyond what conventional volumetric metrics alone offer, supporting improved patient stratification and therapy planning. AI-driven segmentation of normal organs improves radioligand therapy planning by enabling accurate dose predictions and comprehensive organ-based radiomics analysis, further refining personalized patient management.</description>

      <title>High-Flux Entangled Photon Generation via Clinical Megavoltage Radiotherapy Beams for Quantum Imaging and Theranostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional sources of quantum-entangled photons, such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion, suffer from low flux, limiting clinical applications. We investigated whether clinical megavoltage (MV) radiotherapy beams can serve as dual-purpose sources, delivering therapeutic dose while simultaneously generating high-flux entangled photon pairs for quantum ghost imaging, quantum theranostics (QTX), and related applications. Using GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulations, we modeled water-equivalent phantoms containing 2 cm spherical tumors loaded with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs, 10 mg/mL). Clinical spectra at 6, 10, and 15 MV were simulated. Key metrics included 511 keV photon-pair yield, positronium lifetimes (time-resolved), Doppler and energy broadening (energy-resolved), signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), and entanglement retention at depths from 5 to 15 cm. Pair yields scaled with beam energy and AuNP concentration, reaching about 10^8 pairs per Gy per cm^3 in AuNP-loaded tumors. Positronium lifetime shifts (about 100 ps) reflected tumor oxygenation and reactive oxygen species, offering potential functional biomarkers. Doppler (1-3 keV) and AuNP-induced line broadening (0.5-1 keV) produced distinct spectroscopic signatures of electron density, tissue composition, and nanoparticle uptake. Time-resolved QTX revealed oxygenation and ROS levels, energy-resolved QTX probed tissue density and atomic composition, and combined modes enabled comprehensive theranostic imaging. Depth-dependent simulations achieved voxel SNRs exceeding 100. These findings demonstrate that clinical MV beams can serve as practical, high-flux entangled photon sources. Integrated time- and energy-resolved QTX supports functional and spectroscopic tumor imaging, enables nanoparticle optimization, and expands quantum imaging platforms from optical (eV) to therapeutic (hundreds of keV) regimes.</description>

      <title>Electromechanical human heart modeling for predicting endocardial heart motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a biventricular electromechanical human heart model that is comprehensive and clinically relevant, integrating a realistic 3D heart geometry with both systemic and pulmonary hemodynamics. The model uses a two-way fluid-structure-interaction (FSI) formulation with actual 3D blood meshes to accurately investigate the effect of blood flow on the myocardium. It couples a reaction-diffusion framework and a voltage-dependent active stress term to replicate the link between electrical excitation and mechanical contraction. Additionally, the model incorporates innovative epicardial boundary conditions to mimic the stiffness and viscosity of neighboring tissues. The model's ability to replicate physiological heart motion was validated against Cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, which demonstrated a high degree of consistency in regional displacement patterns. The analysis of the right ventricle showed that the basal and mid free walls experience the largest motion, making these regions ideal for implanting motion-driven energy harvesting devices. This validated model is a robust tool for enhancing our understanding of cardiac physiology and optimizing therapeutic interventions before clinical implementation.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating a family of X-ray dark-field retrieval approaches on a common set of samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensitive to scattering from unresolved sample structures, the dark-field channel in full-field X-ray imaging provides complementary information to that offered by conventional attenuation and phase-contrast methods. A range of experimental dark-field techniques and retrieval algorithms have been recently developed to extract this signal by directly resolving dark-field-associated local image blurring with a high-resolution camera. While the underlying physical mechanism that generates dark-field contrast is generally defined similarly across the methods, no comparison of these dark-field techniques using identical samples has been conducted. In this paper, dark-field imaging data from two samples were acquired using three emerging dark-field setups at a synchrotron: propagation-based, single-grid, and speckle-based X-ray imaging. Dark-field images were then reconstructed using a variety of retrieval algorithms--some requiring only a single sample exposure, others multiple; some performing local, pixel-wise analysis, and others operating globally on entire images. We find that the dominant contribution to dark-field contrast--arising from diffuse scattering from unresolved microstructures or multiple refractions through larger, potentially resolved structures--is consistently recovered across all approaches, demonstrating mutual agreement. However, some differences emerge for structures that are spatially varying. We attribute these differences to the idea that each technique has a different internal ruler, a sensitivity scale for dark-field retrieval influenced by both the experimental design and algorithmic assumptions of the technique. This study is intended to guide dark-field imaging users in selecting the most appropriate technique for their imaging goals and to motivate future research into dark-field sensitivity and sources of dark-field contrast across different methods.</description>

      <title>From Lines to Shapes: Geometric-Constrained Segmentation of X-Ray Collimators via Hough Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collimation in X-ray imaging restricts exposure to the region-of-interest (ROI) and minimizes the radiation dose applied to the patient. The detection of collimator shadows is an essential image-based preprocessing step in digital radiography posing a challenge when edges get obscured by scattered X-ray radiation. Regardless, the prior knowledge that collimation forms polygonal-shaped shadows is evident. For this reason, we introduce a deep learning-based segmentation that is inherently constrained to its geometry. We achieve this by incorporating a differentiable Hough transform-based network to detect the collimation borders and enhance its capability to extract the information about the ROI center. During inference, we combine the information of both tasks to enable the generation of refined, line-constrained segmentation masks. We demonstrate robust reconstruction of collimated regions achieving median Hausdorff distances of 4.3-5.0mm on diverse test sets of real Xray images. While this application involves at most four shadow borders, our method is not fundamentally limited by a specific number of edges.</description>

      <title>A Kinematic and Kinetic Dataset of Lower Limb Joints During Obstacle Crossing in Healthy Young Adults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obstacle crossing is an essential component of human locomotion, particularly for individuals with lower limb amputations who face elevated risks of imbalance and falls. While prior studies have explored this task, they often lack a comprehensive examination of kinematic and kinetic changes throughout the entire gait cycle across varying obstacle heights. This study creates a novel dataset collected from ten healthy adults performing obstacle crossing at four different heights (7.5 cm, 15 cm, 22.5 cm, and 30 cm). Kinematic and kinetic data (angles and torques of hip, knee, and ankle) were recorded and analyzed. Results indicate that increased obstacle height leads to a longer swing phase and significant increases in both hip and knee joint angles (1.5* and 1.0*, respectively) and torques. In contrast, ankle joint angles and moments exhibited minimal variation across obstacle heights, indicating a relatively consistent movement strategy at the ankle. Furthermore, significant asymmetries were observed between the dominant and non-dominant foot: the dominant foot demonstrated larger hip and knee joint angles and more consistent ankle behavior, reflecting greater coordination. These findings offer valuable biomechanical insights for improving fall prevention strategies and informing the design of assistive devices such as prostheses and exoskeletons.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.00304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LAFOV PET/CT has the potential to unlock new applications such as ultra-low dose PET/CT imaging, multiplexed imaging, for biomarker development and for faster AI-driven reconstruction, but further work is required before these can be deployed in clinical routine. LAFOV PET/CT has unrivalled sensitivity but has a spatial resolution of an equivalent scanner with a shorter axial field of view. AI approaches are increasingly explored as potential avenues to enhance image resolution.</description>

      <title>Res-MoCoDiff: Residual-guided diffusion models for motion artifact correction in brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objective. Motion artifacts in brain MRI, mainly from rigid head motion, degrade image quality and hinder downstream applications. Conventional methods to mitigate these artifacts, including repeated acquisitions or motion tracking, impose workflow burdens. This study introduces Res-MoCoDiff, an efficient denoising diffusion probabilistic model specifically designed for MRI motion artifact correction.Approach.Res-MoCoDiff exploits a novel residual error shifting mechanism during the forward diffusion process to incorporate information from motion-corrupted images. This mechanism allows the model to simulate the evolution of noise with a probability distribution closely matching that of the corrupted data, enabling a reverse diffusion process that requires only four steps. The model employs a U-net backbone, with attention layers replaced by Swin Transformer blocks, to enhance robustness across resolutions. Furthermore, the training process integrates a combined l1+l2 loss function, which promotes image sharpness and reduces pixel-level errors. Res-MoCoDiff was evaluated on both an in-silico dataset generated using a realistic motion simulation framework and an in-vivo MR-ART dataset. Comparative analyses were conducted against established methods, including CycleGAN, Pix2pix, and a diffusion model with a vision transformer backbone, using quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and NMSE.Main results. The proposed method demonstrated superior performance in removing motion artifacts across minor, moderate, and heavy distortion levels. Res-MoCoDiff consistently achieved the highest SSIM and the lowest NMSE values, with a PSNR of up to 41.91+-2.94 dB for minor distortions. Notably, the average sampling time was reduced to 0.37 seconds per batch of two image slices, compared with 101.74 seconds for conventional approaches.</description>
