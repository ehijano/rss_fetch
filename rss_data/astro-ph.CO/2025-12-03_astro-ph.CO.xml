      <title>How Dark is Dark Energy? A Lightcones Comparison Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometrical approach that provides a non-perturbative technique, allowing the standard FLRW observer to evaluate a measurable, scale-dependent distance functional between her idealized FLRW past light cone and the actual physical past light cone. From the point of view of the FLRW observer, gathering data from sources at cosmological redshift $\widehat{z}$, this functional generates a geometry--structure--growth contribution ${\Omega_\Lambda(\widehat{z})}$ to the FLRW cosmological constant ${\widehat\Omega_\Lambda}$. This redshift--dependent contribution erodes the interpretation of ${\widehat\Omega_\Lambda}$ as representing constant dark energy. In particular, ${\Omega_\Lambda(\widehat{z})}$ becomes significantly large at very low $\widehat{z}$, where structures dominate the cosmological landscape. At the pivotal galaxy cluster scale, where cosmological expansion decouples from the local gravitation dynamics, we get ${\Omega_\Lambda(\widehat{z})/\widehat\Omega_\Lambda}\,=\,\mathscr{O}(1)$, showing that late--epoch structures provide an effective field contribution to the FLRW cosmological constant that is of the same order of magnitude as its assumed value. We prove that ${\Omega_\Lambda(\widehat{z})}$ is generated by a scale-dependent effective field governed by structure formation and related to the comparison between the idealized FLRW past light cone and the actual physical past light cone. These results are naturally framed in the mainstream FLRW cosmology; they do not require exotic fields and provide a natural setting for analyzing the coincidence problem, leading to an interpretative shift in the current understanding of constant dark energy.</description>

      <title>Photon (Non)Conservation in the Reduced Speed of Light Approximation and How to (Almost) Fix It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "Reduced Speed of Light" (RSL) approximation is commonly used to speed up radiative transfer calculations in cosmological simulations. However, it has been shown previously that the RSL approximation leads to photon non-conservation in some regimes. I show that these missing photons can be counted exactly for some numerical schemes. Adding them back into a simulation, however, is a much harder task. I show one example of such a scheme, which achieves sub-percent accuracy on simple tests. Unfortunately, the scheme performs much worse on semi-realistic simulations of cosmic reionization, leading to a faster overlap and significant errors in the point-to-point comparison of the RSL radiation field with the reference simulation that maintains the full speed of light for the radiative transfer.</description>

      <title>Cosmic chronometers with galaxy clusters: a new avenue for multi-probe cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new measurement of the expansion history of the Universe at $z=0.54$ with the cosmic chronometers (CC) method, exploiting the high-quality spectroscopic VLT/MUSE data for three galaxy clusters in close-by redshift bins: SDSS J2222+2745 ($z=0.49$), MACS J1149.5+2223 ($z=0.54$), and SDSS J1029+2623 ($z=0.59$). The central one, MACS J1149.5+2223, hosts the well-known supernova 'Refsdal', which allowed for $H_0$ measurements via time delay cosmography (TDC). This represents the first step for a self-consistent probe combination, where different methods are applied to the same data sample. After selecting the most passive and massive cluster members (38 CCs), we derive their age and physical parameters via full spectrum fitting. We use the code Bagpipes, specifically modified to remove the cosmological prior on ages. On average, the CC sample shows super-solar metallicities $Z/Z_{\odot} = 1.3 \pm 0.7$, low dust extinction $A_{\rm{V}} = 0.3 \pm 0.3$ mag and to have formed in short bursts $\tau = 0.6 \pm 0.2$ Gyr. We also observe both an ageing trend in redshift and a mass-downsizing pattern. From the age-redshift trend, implementing the CC method through a bootstrap approach, we derive a new $H(z)$ measurement: $H$($z$=0.542) = $66_{-29}^{+81}$ (stat) $\pm$13 (syst) km/s/Mpc. We also simulate the impact of increased statistics and extended redshift coverage, finding that $H$($z$) uncertainties can be reduced by up to a factor of 4 with $\sim$100 CCs and a slightly broader redshift range (d$z\sim$0.2).</description>

      <title>"SNe Ia twins" in the Hubble flow, and the determination of H0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have applied our approach of using ''SNe Ia twins''in the Hubble flow to obtain distances to SNe Ia at z $&gt;$ 0.015 and derive H$_{0}$.
  Our results, taking a single step between the low z domain and the Hubble flow, validate the three rung classical method.
  We find, however, that the full compilation of distances, both in Pantheon+ and in the Carnegie-Chicago Hubble Program (CCHP),
  contain some inaccurate values in the colors due to an underestimate of reddening by dust. This produces odd individual values for H$_{0}$
  from single SNe Ia.
  On the average, those erroneous estimates do not affect the mean value of H$_{0}$, which is characterized by the bulk of well--modeled SNe Ia.
  Our sample of carefully addressed SNe Ia in the Hubble flow contains a dozen supernovae, for which the distances are determined with high accuracy.
  Three of these SNe Ia are of the Broad Line subtype and can be compared with SN 1989B in M66, a host galaxy with a unique convergence of the
  Cepheid distance determination and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch stars (TRGB) determination by the CCHP group. They point to a weighted average of
  H$_{0}$ $=$ 73.556 $\pm$ 2.084 (stat) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc $^{-1}$.
  There is as well a very good agreement on the distances to NGC 7250 and NGC 5643 between those derived with Cepheids by SH0ES and those derived with
  the use of J-Asymptotic Giant Branch stars (JAGB stars) by the CCHP, which makes them very good anchors.
  The sample of 12 SNe Ia gives a value of H$_{0}$ $=$ 72.833 $\pm$ 1.306(stat) $\pm$ 1.151 (sys) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, when anchored in Cepheids,
  and of H$_{0}$ $=$ 72.388 $\pm$ 1.272 (stat) $\pm$ 1.015 (sys) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, when anchored in JAGBs by the CCHP. We take a mean of the two
  values of H$_{0}$ and obtain H$_{0}$ $=$ 72.610 $\pm$ 1.289(stat) $\pm$ 1.085 (sys) km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Updates on dipolar anisotropy in local measurements of the Hubble constant from Cosmicflows-4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations show a persistent tension in the Hubble constant $H_0$, suggesting an incomplete understanding of cosmic expansion and local dynamics. Using the Cosmicflows-4 catalogue, we mapped the angular and radial variations of $H_0$ in radial shells with a distance modulus $\mu \in [29,36]$ (approximately corresponding to $[20,100]$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc) and equal-area sky patches, applied adaptive weighing, and fitted spherical harmonics up to the octupole. Our results reveal a clear, distance-decreasing dipole that remains coherent across shells, with subdominant higher-order multipoles, and the octupole fit capturing the main anisotropic features except in sparsely sampled or SDSS-dominated shells. The direction and amplitude of the dipole depend on whether the observed radial recessional velocities are corrected for peculiar velocities or not. If the correction is not applied, the dipole aligns with the major gravitational structures in the local universe. If it is applied, a global dipole still seems to be present, but the signal is much weaker and with much lower statistical significance. This decrease in the amplitude of the dipole supports the idea of a differential expansion rate in our universe, but does not clarify whether the origin is astrophysical or cosmological. Finally, we verify that, while this anisotropy could influence local measurements of the Hubble constant, its effect on the large-scale Hubble tension appears to be limited, as the distribution of galaxies hosting SNeIa, both used as calibrators to constrain $H_0$ and in the Hubble-flow, does not show a strong correlation with the dipole signal.</description>

      <title>The suppression of the matter power spectrum: strong feedback from X-ray gas mass fractions, kSZ effect profiles, and galaxy-galaxy lensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Baryon feedback redistributes gas relative to the underlying dark matter distribution and suppresses the matter power spectrum on small scales, but the amplitude and scale dependence of this effect are uncertain. We constrain the impact of baryon feedback on the matter power spectrum by jointly analysing X-ray gas mass fractions from the eROSITA and HSC-XXL samples and SDSS/DESI+ACT kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect profiles; the samples are characterised with galaxy-galaxy lensing and together span group and cluster masses at $0&lt;z&lt;1$. Using the baryonification framework, our joint eROSITA and kSZ model gives precise constraints on the suppression of the matter power spectrum: $10 \pm 2\%$ at $k=1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. The inferred gas profiles are more extended and the power suppression is stronger than predicted by the fiducial models of recent hydrodynamical simulation suites, including FLAMINGO and BAHAMAS. The HSC-XXL gas mass fractions, which the fiducial simulations were calibrated to reproduce, prefer more moderate power suppression than the kSZ and eROSITA data: $5 \pm 4\%$ at $k=1~h~\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$. With a simulated LSST Year 1 weak lensing analysis, we demonstrate a framework for next-generation surveys: calibrating feedback models with multi-wavelength gas observables to recover the small-scale statistical power of cosmic shear.</description>

      <title>A new constraint on the $y$-distortion with FIRAS: implications for feedback models in galaxy formation and cosmic shear measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $y$-type distortion of the blackbody spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation probes the pressure of the gas trapped in galaxy groups and clusters. We reanalyze archival data of the FIRAS instrument with an improved astrophysical foreground cleaning technique, and measure a mean $y$-distortion of $\langle y\rangle = (1.2\pm 2.0) \times 10^{-6}$ ($\langle y\rangle\lesssim 5.2\times 10^{-6}$ at 95\% C.L.), a factor of $\sim 3$ tighter than the original FIRAS results. This measurement directly rules out many models of baryonic feedback as implemented in cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, mostly using information in objects with mass $M\lesssim 10^{14} {\rm M}_{\odot}$. We discuss its implications for the analysis of cosmic shear and kinetic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect data, and future spectral distortion experiments.</description>

      <title>Linearly Polarized Gravitational Waves from Bubble Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics beyond the Standard Model may give rise to first-order phase transitions proceeding via the nucleation of vacuum bubbles, whose subsequent collisions generate gravitational waves (GWs). Their detection would open the possibility of investigating the universe in its first instants. If the transition is slow enough, such that it completes with the nucleation and collision of only two bubbles, the resulting GW signal is linearly polarized. We show that in this case triangular interferometers such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope could be able to not only measure the magnitude of the GW but also establish its linear polarization. This would give a strong hint about the origin of the signal.</description>

      <title>Pad\'e Approximants for Fast Radio Bursts Diffuse Dispersion Measure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have become an indispensable tool for studying the Universe's ionisation properties, as well as its cosmological parameters. This is achieved by analysing their diffuse dispersion measure (${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$) as a function of redshift. However, this requires an integration along the line-of-sight, which is time-consuming. In this work, we derive an analytical approximation formula for ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$ for flat, $\Lambda$CDM and $w$CDM universes. We show that our approximation works well for the ranges $0.01 \leq z \leq 2$, $0.2 \leq \Omega_m \leq 1.0$ and $-3.0 \leq w \leq -0.5$, with relative fractional error to a numerically evaluated ${\rm DM}_{\rm diff}$ always smaller than $3.5\ \%$, in the worst case scenario, and in most cases smaller than $0.5\ \%$. Moreover, the approximation is more than $15$ ($2$) times faster than the numerical solution of $\Lambda$CDM ($w$CDM). Therefore, we hope that it could be a useful tool for the FRB community.</description>

      <title>The role of the galaxy stellar mass function in determining the cosmological distribution of astrophysical transients with applications to fast radio bursts and merging binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmological distribution and formation rate of compact astrophysical objects such as fast radio bursts (FRBs) are typically assumed to be proportional to a linear combination of cosmological star formation rate and stellar mass. In the literature, a template for star formation rate, which is just a function of redshift, is typically used. In this work, we point out the importance of galaxy stellar mass function which captures the host galaxy information of observed FRBs as well as the redshift evolution of galaxy stellar mass. Using this information, we find that FRB formation efficiency per stellar mass has to be more efficient (by a factor of $\approx 3$) than previously calculated, in order to reproduce the observed volumetric rate of FRBs at $z=0$. We show that cosmological population studies of FRBs have to include host galaxy information along with its redshift evolution in order to obtain unbiased results. This consideration is also applicable to other transients, e.g. gamma-ray bursts and merging binary black hole events. We show that our approach may open up the possibility to infer the host galaxy stellar mass of merging binary black holes with a detection of few thousand gravitational wave events.</description>

      <title>Exploring Leptogenesis, WIMP Dark Matter, and Gravitational Waves in an extended Scalar Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore extensions of type I seesaw framework with a scalar mediator ($\Phi$) connecting to a complex scalar dark field ($S$), and right handed neutrinos ($N_i$), with an aim to correlate neutrino mass generation, leptogenesis, and dark matter. $\mathcal{Z}_4\times CP$ turns out to be a phenomenologically viable choice of the extended symmetry, which can accommodate a dimension five effective interaction $\bar{l}_L^\alpha \tilde{H}\Phi N_i$, involving the SM lepton isodoublet ${l}_L$, and Higgs $H$; prohibiting the canonical Yukawa term $\bar{l}_L^\alpha \tilde{H} N_i$. The $\mathcal{Z}_{4}$ symmetry is spontaneously broken via the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the $\Phi$ filed, which directly affects neutrino mass generation and leptogenesis; while the $CP$ symmetry stabilises one component of $S$, making it a viable dark matter candidate. The discrete symmetry breaking creates domain wall, which needs to be annihilated before the over-closure of the Universe. This paves the way for gravitational wave signal associated with the model set up, which probes the symmetry breaking scale, and indirectly connects to the other phenomena.</description>

      <title>Search for persistent radio emission towards selected localised Fast Radio Burst positions using the MeerKAT Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are millisecond-duration radio pulses originating from cosmological distances, as indicated by their large dispersion measures. While numerous FRBs have now been localised to their host galaxies, a distinct class of compact electromagnetic counterpart, a Persistent Radio Source (PRS), has also been identified in some cases. Currently, only three, and possible a fourth repeating FRBs (FRB20121102A, FRB20190417A, FRB20190520B, and FRB20240114A) have confirmed associations with a PRS. Insight into progenitors, local environments, and the evolution of FRBs can be clarified by characterising these PRSs. In this work, we present 2 detected candidate PRSs using MeerKAT radio telescope data and one non-detection (as part of a larger study involving 25 FRB positions). Both FRB20221106 and FRB20181112 were found to have a host galaxy, and whether the detected radio continuum emission comes from the host galaxy or PRS is still an open question. High-resolution observations from a telescope such as e-MERLIN are required to resolve this question. If a compact PRS is detected, this telescope will provide the size, and investigate the flux variability and spectral shape of this compact PRS. Lastly, in the case of FRB220190102, which was observed over two epochs, no radio continuum was detected. However, a flux upper limit is provided for both epochs.</description>

      <title>Inflationary assessment of $F(\mathcal{R},\tilde{\mathcal{R}})$ Einstein-Cartan models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the framework of $F(\mathcal{R},\tilde{\mathcal{R}})$ Einstein-Cartan gravity with an action depending both of the Ricci scalar and the so-called Holst-invariant curvature we consider models that include cubic terms of the latter in the action and study their inflationary behavior. These terms can have a considerable effect either positive or negative in relation to the agreement with present observational data, depending on parameters. In parameter regions where the quadratic models fail to produce results consistent with observational data, the presence of these additional cubic terms can lead to compatible predictions.</description>

      <title>Singular $\alpha$-attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\alpha$-attractor models naturally appear in supergravity with hyperbolic geometry. The simplest versions of $\alpha$-attractors, T- and E-models, originate from theories with non-singular potentials. In canonical variables, these potentials have a plateau that is approached exponentially fast at large values of the inflaton field $\varphi$. In a closely related class of polynomial $\alpha$-attractors, or P-models, the potential is not singular, but its derivative is singular at the boundary. The resulting inflaton potential also has a plateau, but it is approached polynomially. In this paper, we will consider a more general class of potentials, which can be singular at the boundary of the moduli space, S-models. These potentials may have a short plateau, after which the potential may grow polynomially or exponentially at large values of the inflaton field. We will show that this class of models may provide a simple solution to the initial conditions problem for $\alpha$-attractors and may account for a very broad range of possible values of $n_{s}$ matching the recent ACT, SPT, and DESI data.</description>

      <title>Scaling relations, dynamical heating and tidal disruption in spin $s$ ultralight dark matter models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the impact of spin 0, spin 1 and spin 2 ultralight dark Matter (ULDM) on small scales by numerically solving the Schr\"odinger-Poisson system using the time-split method. We perform simulations of ULDM for each spin, starting with different numbers of identical initial solitons and analyse the properties of the resulting haloes after they merge. Our findings reveal that higher spin lead to broader, less dense haloes with more prominent Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) tails, a characteristic that persists regardless of the number of solitons involved. Additionally, we study the process of dynamical heating for these haloes, and find that the heating time-scale for higher spin increases order an of magnitude compared to the spin 0 case. Then, we identify scaling relations that describe the density profile, core-NFW of spin~$s$ ULDM haloes as a function of the number of initial solitons $N_{\text{sol}}$. These relations allow us to construct equivalent haloes based on average density or total mass, for arbitrarily large $N_{\text{sol}}$, without having to simulate those systems. We simulate the orbit of an ULDM satellite in a constructed halo treated as an external potential, and find that for host haloes having the same average density, the disruption time of the satellite is as predicted for a uniform sphere regardless of the spin. However, satellites orbiting haloes having the same mass for each spin, result in faster disruption in the case of spin 0, whereas for haloes having the same core size result in faster disruption in the case of spin 2.</description>

      <title>Probing the Distance Duality Relation with Machine Learning and Recent Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The distance duality relation (DDR) relates two independent ways of measuring cosmological distances, namely the angular diameter distance and the luminosity distance. These can be measured with baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) and Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), respectively. Here, we use recent DESI DR1, Pantheon+, SH0ES and DES-SN5YR data to test this fundamental relation. We employ a parametrised approach and also use model-independent Generic Algorithms (GA), which are a machine learning method where functions evolve loosely based on biological evolution. When we use DESI and Pantheon+ data without Cepheid calibration or big bang nucleosynthesis (BBN), there is a $2\sigma$ violation of the DDR in the parametrised approach. Then, we add high-redshift BBN data and the low-redshift SH0ES Cepheid calibration. This reflects the Hubble tension since both data sets are in tension in the standard cosmological model $\Lambda$CDM. In this case, we find a significant violation of the DDR in the parametrised case at $6\sigma$. Replacing the Pantheon+ SNe Ia data by DES-SN5YR, we find similar results. For the model-independent approach, we find no deviation in the uncalibrated case and a small deviation with BBN and Cepheids which remains at 1$\sigma$. This shows the importance of considering model-independent approaches for the DDR.</description>

Abstract: We present projected constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as a constituent of dark matter, based on microlensing observations from the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We use a catalogue of microlensing light curves simulated with Rubin Observatory's OpSims to demonstrate that competitive constraints crucially rely on minimising the false positive rate (FPR) of the classification algorithm. We propose the Bayesian information criterion and a Boosted Decision Tree as effective discriminators and compare their derived efficiency and FPR to a more standard $\chi^2$-test.</description>

      <title>Planck Constraints on Axion-Like Particles through Isotropic Cosmic Birefringence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present constraints on isotropic cosmic birefringence induced by axion-like particles (ALPs), derived from the analysis of cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization measurements obtained with the high-frequency channels of Planck. Recent measurements report a hint of isotropic cosmic birefringence, though its origin remains uncertain. The detailed dynamics of ALPs can leave characteristic imprints on the shape of the $EB$ angular power spectrum, which can be exploited to constrain specific models of cosmic birefringence. We first construct a multi-frequency likelihood that incorporates an intrinsic nonzero $EB$ power spectrum. We also show that the likelihood used in previous studies can be further simplified without loss of generality. Using this framework, we simultaneously constrain the ALP model parameters, the instrumental miscalibration angle, and the amplitudes of the $EB$ power spectrum of a Galactic dust foreground model. We find that, if ALPs are responsible for the observed cosmic birefringence, ALP masses at $\log_{10}m_{\phi}[{\rm eV}]\simeq-27.8$, $-27.5$, $-27.3$, $-27.2$, $-27.1$, as well as $\log_{10}m_{\phi}[{\rm eV}]\in[-27.0,-26.5]$, are excluded at more than $2\,\sigma$ statistical significance.</description>

      <title>A general polynomial emulator for cosmology via moment projection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02179v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present MomentEmu, a general-purpose polynomial emulator for fast and interpretable mappings between theoretical parameters and observational features. The method constructs moment matrices to project simulation data onto polynomial bases, yielding symbolic expressions that approximate the target mapping. Compared to neural-network-based emulators, MomentEmu offers negligible training cost, millisecond-level evaluation, and transparent functional forms. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we develop two emulators: PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$, which maps six cosmological parameters to the CMB power spectra (TT, EE, BB, TE), and PolyCAMB-peak, which enables a bidirectional mapping between the cosmological parameters and the acoustic peak features of $D_\ell^{\rm TT}$. PolyCAMB-$D_\ell$ achieves sub-percent accuracy over multipoles $\ell \leq 4050$, while PolyCAMB-peak also attains comparable precision and produces symbolic forms consistent with known analytical approximations. The method is well suited for forward modelling, parameter inference, and uncertainty propagation, particularly when the parameter space is moderate in dimensionality and the mapping is smooth. MomentEmu offers a lightweight and portable alternative to regression-based or black-box emulators in cosmological analysis.</description>

      <title>Dark energy constraints in light of theoretical priors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19450v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to derive model-independent observational bounds on dark energy/modified gravity theories, a typical approach is to constrain parametrised models intended to capture the space of dark energy theories. Here we investigate in detail the effect that the nature of these parametrisations can have, finding significant effects on the resulting cosmological dark energy constraints. In order to observationally distinguish well-motivated and physical parametrisations from unphysical ones, it is crucial to understand the theoretical priors that physical parametrisations place on the phenomenology of dark energy. To this end we discuss a range of theoretical priors that can be imposed on general dark energy parametrisations, and their effect on the constraints on the phenomenology of dynamical dark energy. More specifically, we investigate both the phenomenological $\{\mu,\Sigma\}$ parametrisation as well as effective field theory (EFT) inspired approaches to model dark energy interactions. We compare the constraints obtained in both approaches for different phenomenological and theory-informed time-dependences for the underlying functional degrees of freedom, discuss the effects of priors derived from gravitational wave physics, and investigate the interplay between constraints on parameters constraining only the background evolution vs. parameters controlling linear perturbations.</description>

      <title>Macromodel-free flux-ratio prediction in quadruply imaged quasars with local constraints from lensed arcs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.05416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing is a powerful cosmological probe, providing a direct tool to unveil the properties of dark matter (DM) on sub-galactic scales. In particular, flux-ratio anomalies in quadruply imaged quasars ("quads") can reveal the presence of dark substructure, such that population-level statistics can be used to constrain the particle nature of DM. Current methods, however, rely on globally parametrized models ("macromodels") of the lens mass distribution, which impose rigid physical assumptions on the deflection field. Given the high stakes, it is important to develop complementary methods that do not require the assumption of a macromodel. One promising avenue consists of modeling the resolved emission from the quasar host galaxy (lensed arcs) using a local lensing formalism like the Curved Arc Basis (CAB) description. In this paper, we test the ability of CAB models to predict flux ratios from mock imaging data. We find that CAB model-predicted flux ratios accurately reproduce the expected values, with a typical precision of $\sim 3-5\%$. While a macromodel-based approach yields smaller uncertainties, as expected, the CAB method permits a more flexible, local description of the deflection field, thus being more robust to angular structure in the main deflector mass profile, in particular avoiding false-positive detections of flux-ratio anomalies that can arise with overly simplistic parametrizations. On the other hand, by injecting individual DM halos near quasar images, we demonstrate that CAB models do not absorb the local lensing perturbations from DM substructure, and can therefore distinguish flux-ratio anomalies caused by DM substructure from other sources of small-scale perturbation. We conclude that CAB models can be used to infer DM properties from flux-ratio anomaly statistics with minimal assumptions, complementing the traditional macromodel based approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In loop quantum cosmology (LQC), the initial singularity is replaced by a quantum bounce, leading to a universal post-bounce evolution characterized by three distinct epochs: bouncing, transition, and slow-roll inflation, before the hot big-bang universe starts. While the generic nature of inflation in LQC is well-established, the subsequent reheating phase-the process that thermalizes the universe and marks the beginning of the hot big bang has remained unexplored in this quantum gravitational framework. This paper presents the first comprehensive integration of the (generalized) reheating mechanism into the LQC paradigm. Using the Power Law Plateau potential and comparing predictions with the latest Planck 2018 and ACT 2025 data, we demonstrate that the inclusion of a reheating phase with a generic equation of state is fully consistent with the cosmological constraints. In addition, using the observational data for the amplitude and spectral index of the scalar perturbations and the tensor-to-scalar ratio, we also constrain the total number of e-folds from the bounce to the present day and find a lower bound, which is less constrained than that obtained previously from the fitting of the high-$l$ CMB temperature power spectrum (TT), the polarization data (TT, TE, EE) and the low-$l$ polarization data (lowP).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Past millimeter-wave galaxy surveys have primarily probed the brightest starburst galaxies only and suffered heavily from confusion. The interpretation of existing surveys has also been hindered by the lack of reliable redshift indicators for measuring distances for entire samples. Thanks to recent advances in mm-wave detector technologies we can now overcome these limitations, and conduct the first truly volumetric surveys of star-forming galaxies at mm-wavelengths approaching the L* luminosities of typical galaxies, with ~1000 redshift slices spanning most of the Cosmic star-forming volume (z ~ 1--12) with nearly uniform mass and luminosity selection. We describe an instrument concept capable of delivering such surveys with the technologies available today, which can be built and operated on a ground-based mm-wave facility in the near future. Such integral field unit spectrometers can resolve and identify redshifts for up to to 25,000 star-forming galaxies per year even when operated on a 10-m class telescope. On a larger aperture it can do the same faster or probe even deeper. We propose a collaboration open-source initiative to design, build, and operate one or several such cameras through the shared contributions of leading experts and telescopes from around the globe.</description>

      <title>Superheavy dark matter from the natural inflation in light of the highest-energy astroparticle events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superheavy dark matter has been attractive as a candidate of particle dark matter. We propose a ``natural" particle model, in which the dark matter serves as the inflaton in natural inflation, while decaying to high-energy particles at energies of $10^{9}-10^{13} \, \text{GeV}$ from the prediction of the inflation. A scalar field responsible for diluting the dark matter abundance revives the natural inflation either with or without the recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and baryon acoustic oscillation results from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. Since the dark matter must be a spin-zero scalar, we carefully study the galactic dark matter 3-body decay into fermions and two body decays into a gluon pair, and point out relevant multi-messenger bounds that constrain these decay modes. Interestingly, the predicted energy scale may coincide with the AMATERASU event and/or the KM3NeT neutrino event, KM3-230213A. We also point out particle models with dark baryon to further alleviate $\gamma$-ray bounds. This scenario yields several testable predictions for the UHECR observations, including the highest-energy neutrons that are unaffected by magnetic fields, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the running of spectral indices, $\alpha_s\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(0.001)$, and the existence of light new colored particles that could be accessible at future collider experiments. Further measurements of high-energy cosmic rays, including their components and detailed directions, may provide insight into not only the origin of the cosmic rays but also inflation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10081v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Starobinsky's $R+\alpha R^2$ inflation provides a compelling one-parameter inflationary model that is supported by current cosmological observations. However, at the same order in spacetime derivatives as the $R^2$ term, an effective theory of spacetime geometry must also include the Weyl-squared curvature invariant $W^2$. In this paper, we study the inflationary predictions of the gravitational theory with action of the form $R+\alpha R^2 - \beta W^2$, where the coupling constant $\alpha$ sets the scale of inflation, and corrections due to the $W^2$ term are treated self-consistently via reduction of order in an expansion in the coupling constant $\beta$, at the linear order in $\beta/\alpha$. Cosmological perturbations are found to be described by an effective action with a nontrivial speed of sound $c_{\textrm{s}}$ for scalar and $c_{\textrm{t}}$ for tensor modes, satisfying the relation $c_{\textrm{t}}/c_{\textrm{s}} \simeq 1+ \frac{\beta}{6\, \alpha}$ during the inflationary phase. Within this self-consistent framework, we compute several primordial observables up to the next-to-next-to-next-to leading order (N3LO). We find the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \simeq 3(1-\frac{\beta}{6\alpha})(n_\textrm{s}-1)^2$, the tensor tilt $n_{\textrm{t}}\simeq-\frac{r}{8}$ and the running of the scalar tilt $\mathfrak{a}_{\textrm{s}}\simeq-\frac{1}{2} (n_{\textrm{s}} - 1)^2$, all expressed in terms of the observed scalar tilt $n_{\textrm{s}}$. We also provide the corresponding corrections up to N3LO, $\mathcal{O}((n_{\textrm{s}} - 1)^3)$.</description>

      <title>XMAGNET : Kinetic, Thermal and Magnetic AGN Feedback in Massive Galaxies at Halo Masses $\sim 10^{13.5}$ M$_\odot$</title>

Abstract: The interplay between radiative cooling of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and feedback heating governs the evolution of the universe's most massive galaxies. This paper presents simulations of feedback processes in massive galaxies showing how kinetic, thermal, and magnetic active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback interacts with the CGM under different environmental conditions. We find that in massive galaxies with shallower central gravitational potential and higher CGM pressure (multiphase galaxy; MPG) pure kinetic AGN feedback is most efficient in preventing CGM cooling from becoming catastrophic while maintaining the CGM entropy within the observed range. For the same galaxy, partitioning AGN energy injection into kinetic ($75\%$) and thermal ($25\%$) energy results in an entropy bump within $r\lesssim15$ kpc while also having a larger amount of cold gas extending out to $r\sim80$ kpc. A magnetohydrodynamic MPG run with seed magnetic field in the CGM (1~$\mu$G) and partial magnetised AGN feedback ($1\%$ of total AGN power) also shows a higher entropy (within $r&lt;15$ kpc) and cold gas mass, albeit the cold gas remains constrained within $r\lesssim30$ kpc. For a similarly massive galaxy with deeper potential well and low CGM pressure (single phase galaxy; SPG) our simulations show that for both hydro and MHD runs with partial thermal AGN energy, the feedback mechanism remains tightly self-regulating with centrally concentrated cooling (within $r&lt;1$ kpc). Our simulations of a similar mass galaxy with a deeper potential well and higher CGM pressure (SPG-Cool) show that our AGN feedback mechanism cannot get rid of the high CGM density and pressure and its long term evolution is similar to the multiphase galaxy.</description>

      <title>LIMFAST. IV. Learning High-Redshift Galaxy Formation from Multiline Intensity Mapping with Implicit Likelihood Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By opening up new avenues to statistically constrain astrophysics and cosmology with large-scale structure observations, the line intensity mapping (LIM) technique calls for novel tools for efficient forward modeling and inference. Implicit likelihood inference (ILI) from semi-numerical simulations provides a powerful setup for investigating a large model parameter space in a data-driven manner, therefore gaining significant recent attention. Using simulations of high-redshift 158$\mu$m [CII] and 88$\mu$m [OIII] LIM signals created by the LIMFAST code, we develop an ILI framework in a case study of learning the physics of early galaxy formation from the auto-power spectra of these lines or their cross-correlation with galaxy surveys. We leverage neural density estimation with normalizing flows to learn the mapping between the simulated power spectra and parameters that characterize the physics governing the star formation efficiency and the $\dot{\Sigma}_{\star}$-$\Sigma_\mathrm{g}$ relation of high-redshift galaxies. Our results show that their partially degenerate effects can be unambiguously constrained when combining [CII] with [OIII] measurements to be made by new-generation mm/sub-mm LIM experiments.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Inflation RIDES Again</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Following the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) results, we revisit chaotic inflation based on a single complex scalar field with mass term $M^2 |\Phi|^2$, which usually predicts a spectra index $n_s\approx 0.96$ but a too-large tensor to scalar ratio $r\approx 0.16$. With radiative corrections, the potential $M^2 |\Phi|^2 \ln \left( |\Phi|^2/\Lambda^2 \right)$ induces spontaneous symmetry breaking near the scale $\Lambda$, yielding a Pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson which can play the role of a quintessence field, hence radiative inflation and dark energy (RIDE). Including a non-minimal coupling to gravity
  $\xi |\Phi|^2 R^2$ reduces $r$, allowing a good fit of the RIDE model to Planck data. Allowing a small additional quartic coupling correction $\lambda |\Phi|^4$ increases both $n_s$ and $r$, with a good fit to ACT data sets achieved for $\xi \approx 1$.</description>

      <title>Kinematic scaling relations of disc galaxies from ionised gas at $z\sim1$ and their connection with dark matter haloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08685v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the Tully-Fisher (TFR, $M_\ast-V_{\rm circ,f}$) and Fall (FR, $j_\ast-M_\ast$) relations at redshift $z = 0.9$ using a sample of 43 main-sequence disc galaxies with H$\alpha$ IFU data and JWST/HST imaging. The strength of our analysis lies in the use of state-of-the-art 3D kinematic models to infer galaxy rotation curves, the inclusion and morphological modelling of NIR bands, and the use of SED modelling applied to our photometry measurements to estimate stellar masses. After correcting the inferred H$\alpha$ velocities for asymmetric drift, we find a TFR of the form $\log(M_\ast / M_\odot) = a \log(V_{\rm circ,f} / 150~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}) + b$, with $a=3.82^{+0.55}_{-0.40}$ and $b=10.27^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$, as well as a FR of the form $\log(j_\ast / \mathrm{kpc\,km\,s^{-1}}) = a \log(M_\ast / 10^{10.5} M_\odot) + b$, with $a=0.44^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$ and $b=2.86^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$. Compared with their $z=0$ counterparts, we find moderate evolution in the TFR and strong evolution in the FR over the past 8 Gyr. We interpret our findings in the context of the galaxy-to-halo scaling parameters $f_{\rm M}=M_\ast/M_{\rm vir}$ and $f_{\rm j}=j_\ast/j_{\rm vir}$. We infer that $f_{\rm j}$ shows little redshift evolution and depends very weakly on $M_\ast$, with typical values around $f_{\rm j}\sim0.8$. As for $f_{\rm M}$, we find it to be higher and less dependent on $M_\ast$ at $z=0.9$ than at $z=0$. Interpreting our observed $f_{\rm M}-M_\ast$ relations within the Cold Dark Matter framework implies necessarily that the galaxy populations at $z=0.9$ and $z=0$ are not the progenitor/descendant of one another. The alternative scenario is that the $z=0.9$ relations are incorrect due to strong selection effects, unidentified systematics, or the possibility that H$\alpha$ kinematics may not be a reliable dynamical tracer. Such problems would also affect previous studies on the same subject.</description>

      <title>Kinematic Mapping of Giant Arcs: A New Method to Locate Lensing Critical Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18479v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proximity of lensing critical curves features highly magnified portions of lensed galaxies. Accurate knowledge of the location and shape of the critical curve will be useful for understanding the nature of highly magnified stellar sources near critical curves and for revealing sub-galactic dark matter structures within the lens. In galaxy-cluster lenses, however, prediction of critical curves can be uncertain due to complexity in global mass modeling. We explore and validate a kinematics-based method for locating the critical curve. This method leverages the continuous line-of-sight velocity profile of the lensed galaxy mapped through integral field spectroscopy of emission lines, and combines an agnostic local lens model and a disk rotation model. Applying our method to a highly magnified region of the Dragon Arc in the Abell 370 cluster lensing field using archival VLT/MUSE IFU mapping of the H$\beta$ line, we constrain the critical curve to an uncertainty band with a half-width of 0.23" ($1\sigma$). This result reveals locations of recently detected extremely magnified stars biased toward the negative-parity side of the critical curve, as predicted for intracluster microlensing. With future JWST/NIRSpec IFU mapping of the H$\alpha$ line at SNR $\simeq$ 10 (20), uncertainty could improve to 0.12" (0.08"). A measurement of this type with sufficiently small uncertainty may reveal small-scale wiggles in the shape of the critical curve, which can arise from the lensing perturbation of sub-galactic dark matter substructure. Our approach is generally applicable to caustic-crossing giant arcs and can be incorporated into global lens modeling.</description>
