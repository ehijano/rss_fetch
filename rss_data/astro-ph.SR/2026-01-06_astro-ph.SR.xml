      <title>JWST observations of three long-period AM CVn binaries: detection of the donors and hints of magnetically truncated disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST/NIRSpec high-cadence infrared spectroscopy of three long-period, eclipsing AM CVn binaries, Gaia14aae, SRGeJ0453, and ZTFJ1637. These systems have orbital periods of 50-62 minutes and cool donors that are undetectable in the optical. The data cover a wavelength range of 1.6-5.2 $\mu$m at resolution $R=1000-2000$. We obtained 150-200 spectra of each system over two orbits, split between the G235M and G395M gratings. All three systems show strong, double-peaked He I emission lines dominated by an accretion disk. These lines are nearly stationary but contain radial velocity (RV) variable sub-components that trace stream-disk interactions. In Gaia14aae and SRGeJ0453, we detect two Na I doublets in emission whose RVs track the irradiated face of the donor, marking the first direct detection of the donors of long-period AM CVns. No absorption lines from the donors are detected, implying that the IR excesses observed in many long-period AM CVns primarily trace disks, not donors. The He I emission profiles in all systems lack high-velocity wings and show no emission beyond $\approx 1500,\rm km,s^{-1}$. The morphology of the disk eclipses and Doppler tomograms are best reproduced by models in which the disk is truncated well outside the white dwarf and only material at $r \gtrsim 0.07,R_{\odot}$ contributes to the disk emission. We interpret this as possible evidence of magnetized white dwarf accretors. For plausible mass transfer rates, the truncation radii imply surface magnetic fields of $B = 30-100$ kG, consistent with recent constraints based on X-ray periodicity. The absence of cyclotron humps out to 5 $\mu$m rules out stronger MG-level fields. We make the data from the program publicly available to the community.</description>

      <title>A statistical framework for quantitative spectroscopy of luminous blue stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Quantitative spectroscopy of luminous blue stars relies on detailed non-LTE model atmospheres whose increasing physical realism makes direct, iterative analyses computationally demanding. Aims: We introduce MAUI (Machine-learning Assisted Uncertainty Inference), a statistical framework designed for efficient Bayesian inference of stellar parameters using emulator-based spectral models. Methods: MAUI employs Gaussian-process-based emulators trained on a limited set of non-LTE simulations, combined with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to explore posterior distributions. We validate the approach with recovery experiments and demonstrate it on Galactic late-type O dwarf and early-type B dwarf/subgiant stars. Results: The emulator reproduces the predictions of full atmosphere models within quoted uncertainties while reducing computational cost by orders of magnitude. Posterior distributions are well calibrated, with conservative coverage across all stellar parameters. Conclusions: Emulator-driven Bayesian inference retains the accuracy of classical analyses at a fraction of the computational expense, enabling posterior sampling that would be prohibitive with direct model evaluations. This positions emulators as a practical tool for high-fidelity spectroscopy of massive stars as atmosphere models grow more demanding.</description>

      <title>Solar-like oscillations in accreting pre-main sequence stars: Insights and prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present theoretical predictions for solar-like oscillators in the pre-main sequence phase of stellar evolution. Our pre-main sequence models start from a stellar seed of 0.01 solar masses that gains mass through accretion, offering an alternative description to the classical approach segmented into the Hayashi and Henyey tracks. Evolutionary models are calculated using the \mesa stellar evolution code with a custom accretion routine and pulsation properties are investigated using the \GYRE oscillation code. We present evolutionary tracks and internal structures for accreting pre-main sequence solar-like stars in the mass range from 0.7 to 1.6 solar masses, adopting 35 mass accretion histories previously extracted from two-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical simulations. Atmospheric parameters of our models constrain characteristic frequencies of pre-main sequence solar-like oscillators to be generally greater than 500 $\mu\text{Hz}$. We highlight the imprint of accretion on the buoyancy and Lamb profiles and illustrate the effects on the small- and large frequency separations. We additionally quantify individual frequency differences across the 35 accretion histories at the zero-age main-sequence, showcasing differences no larger than $20 \ \mu\text{Hz}$ for an exemplary model. Finally, we discuss the potential of detecting solar-like oscillations in pre-main sequence stars with the upcoming ESA PLATO mission.</description>

      <title>Inferring physical parameters of solar filaments from simultaneous longitudinal and transverse oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Different modes of oscillations are frequently observed in solar prominences/filaments, and prominence seismology helps estimate important physical parameters like the magnetic field strength. Although the simultaneous detection of longitudinal and transverse oscillations in the same filament is not common, such rare observations provide a unique opportunity to constrain the physical parameters of interest. Aims. In this study, we aim to estimate the physical parameters of prominences undergoing simultaneous longitudinal and transverse oscillations. Methods. We apply Bayesian seismology techniques to observations of longitudinal and transverse filament oscillations to infer the magnetic field strength, the length, and the number of twists in the flux tube holding the prominence plasma. We first use the observations of longitudinal oscillations and the pendulum model to infer the posterior probability density for the magnetic field strength. The obtained marginal posterior of the magnetic field, combined with the observations of the transverse oscillations, is then used to estimate the probable values of the length of the magnetic flux tube that supports the filament material using Bayesian inference. This estimated length is used to compute the number of twists in the flux tube. Results. For the prominences under study, we find that the length of the flux tubes supporting the quiescent prominences can be very large (from 100 to 1000 Mm) and the number of twists in the flux tube are not more than three. Conclusions. Our results demonstrate that Bayesian analysis offers valuable methods to perform parameter inference in the context of prominence seismology.</description>

      <title>Light curve modeling of the nearest neutron star candidate LAMOST J235456.73+335625.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of heavy radioactive elements (e.g., $^{60}\mathrm{Fe}$) on Earth suggests that supernova explosions may have occurred near our planet within the past million years, potentially having a significant impact on the ecological environment. This finding has motivated the search for nearby neutron stars in the Solar neighborhood. In a recent study, a candidate for one of the closest neutron stars to Earth, LAMOST J235456.73+335625.9 (hereafter J2354), was reported. Based on dynamical mass measurements under different inclination angle assumptions, the inferred mass range for the unseen compact companion in the system is $1.4$--$1.6$ $M_{\odot}$. Hence, the unseen companion in J2354 is either a massive cold white dwarf or a neutron star. Here we model the flux variations of J2354 as a combination of ellipsoidal modulation and surface spots. We test both cold spot and hot spot models, setting the number of spots to two in each case, and constrain the spot properties through light curve fitting. In the cold spot scenario, the spots are mostly visible at phases $0.5$--$0.75$, whereas in the hot spot scenario, the spots appear predominantly at phases $0.25$--$0.5$. The hot spot model shows better agreement with the observed H$\alpha$ phase variation than the cold spot model. Furthermore, the thermal radiation of a massive but cold white dwarf cannot produce the level of localized heating required to explain the hot spot unless additional heating mechanisms are involved; in contrast, a neutron star can naturally provide such heating through energetic winds. Our results are consistent with the neutron star interpretation of the compact object in J2354.</description>

      <title>Statistical Study of Appearance Timing of H$\alpha$ Postflare Loops: Simple Scaling Law Based on Radiative Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Sun-as-a-star studies have shown that postflare loops can manifest as a secondary peak in the H$\alpha$ light curve, suggesting that stellar postflare loops are detectable. To understand what determines the timing of such a secondary peak in the H$\alpha$ light curve associated with postflare loops, we must quantitatively identify the key physical processes controlling the appearance of H$\alpha$ postflare loops. Previous case studies have indicated that the appearance timing of H$\alpha$ postflare loops is likely governed by radiative cooling. However, the statistical characteristics of the timing of H$\alpha$ postflare loops appearance remain insufficiently investigated. In this study, we statistically investigated the appearance timing of H$\alpha$ postflare loops to quantify their cooling processes. As a result, we found a negative correlation between the time difference between the soft X-ray peak and the appearance of the H$\alpha$ postflare loops ($\Delta t$) and the soft X-ray peak flux ($F_\mathrm{X}$). This relationship is consistent with the theoretical scaling between radiative cooling timescale ($\tau_{\mathrm{rad}}$) and $F_\mathrm{X}$, where $\tau_{\mathrm{rad}} \propto~F_\mathrm{X}^{-1/2}$. This statistical result indicates that the appearance timing of H$\alpha$ postflare loops relative to the soft X-ray peak is primarily controlled by radiative cooling. Furthermore, we examined the dependence of the scaling law on flare spatial scales ($L$). Consequently, we demonstrated that spatial scale of unresolved stellar flares can be estimated using the following scaling law: $L\propto F_\mathrm{X}^{1/3}\Delta t^{2/3}$. Our results are useful for interpreting secondary peaks in the H$\alpha$ data of stellar flares and provide new method to estimate spatial scale of unresolved stellar flares.</description>

      <title>The Betelgeuse Enigma: The Betelbuddy Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past six years, Betelgeuse has been in the news and drawn significant public interest. Starting in October 2019, Betelgeuse underwent a striking dimming event, fading from magnitude 0.5 to 1.7 by mid February 2020 a threefold decrease in brightness This gave rise to a number of speculative debates that the star was on the verge of a supernova, a moment of eerie quiet before the cosmic outburst. In a previous article, the author discussed the most accepted explanation to the dimming caused by episodic mass loss that released large dust grains, which obscured Betelgeuse's light and made it appear fainter. This interpretation suggested that the dimming was not a precursor to a supernova, as Betelgeuse is likely still far from reaching that stage.
  On 21 July 2025, the existence of the companion star was confirmed with direct imaging, for the first time, by the alopeke instrument on the 8.1 m Gemini North telescope. The companion is 6 magnitudes fainter than Betelgeuse and orbits close to Betelgeuse itself, within the supergiant star's extended outer atmosphere. The stellar companion was detected at an angular separation of 52 mas and a position angle of 115 deg east of north. These measurements, along with its brightness, being roughly 6 magnitudes fainter than Betelgeuse at 466 nm, are in excellent agreement with dynamical predictions. Although this was only a 1.5 sigma detection, the agreement in the companion's appearance, separation, position angle, magnitude difference, and estimated mass is reasonable, making the result tentatively acceptable. The next optimum period for observations is November 2027, when we hope to get better observations. This article describes the interesting twists and turns of this study and what lies in the future for Betelgeuse and its companion, Betelbuddy or Siwarha.</description>

      <title>The SALT survey of helium-rich hot subdwarfs: unsupervised classification and kinematic analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen-deficient stars form sequences across the HR diagram from cool R CrB stars to helium-rich hot subdwarfs and PG1159 stars, tracing multiple evolution pathways. The Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) has been used to conduct a medium-resolution spectroscopic survey of 697 helium-rich hot subdwarfs and related stars. Using 587 stars from the full SALT sample, we define an unsupervised data-led classification system based on Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and Spectral Clustering (SC), designed as a data-discovery tool to identify possible new groups and sequences within the data. Using the first 3 principal components (PCs), we identify 6 major clusters of hot subdwarf spectra, identified with the traditional spectral classes of classical sdB and sdO stars, helium-rich He-sdO stars and very hot subdwarfs. Two clusters covering large volumes of PC space include a) He-sdB and He-sdOB stars and b) intermediate iHe-sdB and iHe-sdOB stars. Most spectra in these major clusters form connected sequences in PC space. Using a second stage of PCA and SC, we identify sub-clusters within 4 major clusters, particularly in the He-sdB/OB and iHe-sdB/OB clusters. In comparison with traditional MK-like classification, we find that the PC clusters are reasonably well separated, with some overlap at cluster boundaries. For very hot sdOs, where the number of standards is small, PC classification has led to a revision of the Drilling MK-like system. Gaia DR3 measurements have been used to determine kinematic parameters for the PC-defined classes. Although disk stars account for a significant fraction of all classes, He-sdOs and Hot-sdOs include a higher fraction of halo stars.</description>

      <title>A phoenix rises from the ashes: WOH G64 is still a red supergiant, for now</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a long time, WOH G64 was known as the most extreme red supergiant outside our Galaxy. However, in a matter of years it has faded, its pulsations have become suppressed and the spectrum has become dominated by emission lines from ionised gas, a far cry from the Mira-like pulsation and late M-type spectrum it used to display. Around the same time, a hot dust cloud was discovered using the VLT interferometer. WOH G64 has been claimed to have turned into a yellow hypergiant, which could signal a pre-supernova post-red supergiant evolution. Here we present spectra of WOH G64 obtained with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) between November 2024 and December 2025. Molecular absorption bands from TiO are seen at all times. This implies that WOH G64 is currently a red supergiant, and may never have ceased to be. However, the shallow, resolved bands and possible detection of VO hint at a highly extended atmosphere. The continuum appears to be varying, while the line emission shows a different behaviour, suggesting two separate components in the system. Meanwhile, atomic absorption lines are deepening. This places important constraints on scenarios for the dramatic events that are unfolding.</description>

      <title>New branch of the Tayler-Spruit dynamo in stellar radiative zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent asteroseismic observations constitute a great challenge for rotating stellar evolution models, which predict too fast internal rotation rates when only hydrodynamic processes are included. This suggests the absence of one or several unidentified angular momentum transport processes in these models. Transport by large-scale and strong magnetic fields in the radiative zone is a promising candidate to explain the observations. While these fields may have a fossil origin, a dynamo driven by the Tayler instability in a shear flow constitute a primary mechanism to form the necessary magnetic fields. Despite recent numerical studies, this mechanism remains poorly known. Motivated by this, we investigate the Tayler-Spruit dynamo through a new set of three-dimensional direct numerical simulations. We model the radiative zone as a Boussinesq stably stratified fluid whose differential rotation is maintained by a volumetric body force. We report for the first time the existence of two bistable dynamo branches, which mainly differ by the magnetic field location (near the equator and the polar axis). While the equatorial branch is driven by the magnetorotational instability, we mainly investigate the newly identified polar branch, which is driven by the Tayler instability. We show that this branch can still operate and transport angular momentum efficiently in a very strong stratification regime. We extract new scaling laws for the different magnetic field components, transports processes, and the minimum shear to trigger the Tayler instability-driven dynamo. Finally, we roughly constrain the signature of the generated magnetic fields on asteroseismic modes propagating in main-sequence and evolved stars. Thus, our results fosters new studies using stellar evolution models including our prescriptions and the search of asteroseismic signals impacted by large-scale azimuthal magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Constraints on sunspot group lifetimes from far-side Sun-as-a-star helioseismology with BiSON</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequencies of low-degree solar p modes are sensitive to activity over the entire Sun, including the unobservable far-side hemisphere. When frequency shifts extracted from week-long BiSON datasets are fitted to a linear combination of observed near-side activity and a far-side proxy made from the near-side measures shifted by half the solar rotation period, the solution favours a slightly higher weighting from the far-side contribution. Here, we demonstrate that this unphysical mismatch is due to the inherent inaccuracy of the far-side proxy, which fails to capture active regions that evolve fully on the solar far side, or that evolve (or have evolved) significantly as they rotate off (or onto) the visible disc. By simulating the evolution of sunspot group areas over time, which act as a suitable measure of solar activity, we show that the solution is sensitive to the lifetime of the activity. Assuming an underlying mapping from maximum group areas $A_{\rm max}$ (measured in millionths of the solar hemispheric area, MSH) to group lifetimes $\tau$ (measured in days) of the form $\tau = \alpha A_{\rm max}$, we find that $\alpha \simeq 0.025^{+0.055}_{-0.016}\,\rm d\,MSH^{-1}$ gives results consistent with the BiSON finding. This is to be compared with the value of $\alpha = 0.1\,\rm d\,MSH^{-1}$ implied by the well-known Gnevyshev-Waldmeier rule. While our best-fitting $\alpha$ maps to an average group lifetime of $\tau \simeq 5^{+10}_{-3}\,\rm d$, the best-fitting distribution includes a reasonable fraction of groups with lifetimes longer than the solar rotation period, which is essential to reproducing the mismatch.</description>

      <title>Can instrumental effects obscure the true photospheric wave spectrum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical aberrations and instrument resolution can affect the observed morphological properties of features in the solar atmosphere. However, little work has been done to study the effects of spatial resolution on the dynamical processes occurring in the Sun's atmosphere. In this work, owing to the availability of high-resolution observations of a magnetic pore captured with the Interferometric BIdimensional Spectrometer mounted at the Dunn Solar Telescope, we studied the impact of the diffraction limit and the sampling of an instrument on line-of-sight Doppler velocity oscillations. We reported a noticeable shift in the dominant frequency band from $5$ to $3$ mHz, as both the angular and detector resolutions of the instruments were degraded. We argue that the observed behaviour is a result of the increased contamination of straylight from neighbouring quiet Sun regions, masking the true behaviour of umbral oscillations. These results suggest that the wave energy contributions reported in the literature and based on low-resolution instrumentation may be fundamentally underestimated. As we move into the era of high-resolution instrumentation such as DKIST and MUSE, this work will offer a critical baseline for interpreting new observations, especially in terms of distinguishing true dynamic behaviours from artefacts introduced by instrument-related limitations.</description>

      <title>Spectral signatures of bright grains determine chromospheric heating</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chromospheric heating is an important ingredient in the energy budget of the solar atmosphere, which is challenging to quantify from observations. By using 3D radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the solar atmosphere combined with non-LTE spectral synthesis, we estimated chromospheric heating from synthetic spectra and studied the spectral and temporal signatures of heating events. We performed k-means clustering on the Mg II h, Ca II H, and Ca II 8542 {\AA} lines to identify representative profiles associated with elevated chromospheric heating and studied their atmospheric stratification. We find that locations with the strongest chromospheric heating show spectral signatures with strong emission. Profiles with strong emission in the blue wing of the lines (blue grains) are created by upward-propagating shock waves and have an order of magnitude higher heating in the chromosphere than the ambient heating. Profiles with strong emission in the red wing (red grains) also display heating that is an order of magnitude stronger than the baseline, but these spectra do not show a characteristic atmospheric stratification. Spectra classified as blue grains have a consistent temporal evolution, which is an oscillating sawtooth pattern in the line core and emission in the blue wing. However, spectra classified as red grains did not show a consistent temporal signature: Red wing emission from the simulations can appear spontaneously or be associated with an oscillation. While red and blue grain profiles account for around 3% of our synthetic spectra, they account for more than 12% of the total chromospheric heating in these simulations. By comparing two quiet Sun simulations, we find that the prevalence of bright grains is influenced by the magnetic field configuration, with a unipolar configuration showing fewer bright grains and consequently a lower share of heating from such events.</description>

      <title>A 500 pc volume-limited sample of hot subluminous stars II. Atmospheric parameters, mass distribution, and kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantitative spectroscopic and kinematic analysis of a volume-complete sample of hot subluminous stars within 500 pc of the Sun, assembled using accurate parallax measurements from Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3). In total, 3226 spectra of 253 hot subdwarf stars were analysed to derive atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, surface gravity, and helium abundance) and radial velocities. Spectral energy distributions (SEDs) combined with Gaia parallaxes were used to measure stellar radii, luminosities, and masses. The derived atmospheric parameters reveal a consistent alignment between sdB and sdO stars in the Kiel diagram when compared to theoretical evolutionary models. We identify a population (about 10%) of hot subdwarfs located below the 0.45 Msun zero-age EHB in both the Kiel and Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams, which likely originate from intermediate-mass progenitors (1.8-8 Msun). The overall mass distribution peaks at 0.48 pm 0.12 Msun, while hot subdwarfs below the EHB peak at 0.43 pm 0.10 Msun, supporting non- or semi-degenerate helium ignition characteristic of intermediate-mass stars. Interpolation of EHB and post-EHB tracks yields mass distributions consistent with those derived from SEDs and parallaxes. Assuming a mass range between 0.40 and 0.50 Msun, we find that the post-EHB birthrate is 2-3 times higher than the EHB birthrate, suggesting overestimated EHB lifetimes or contamination from additional formation channels. Our kinematic analysis shows that 86 pm 2% of the stars belong to the Galactic thin disk, with 13 pm 1% and 1 pm 1% associated with the thick disk and halo. The below-EHB population is found exclusively in the thin disk, the only Galactic component young enough to host intermediate-mass progenitors. Its absence from other large samples suggests that non-degenerate formation channels play a more prominent role in the Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>The Stellar Winds Atlas I: Current uncertainties in mass-loss rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar winds are a major source of uncertainty in understanding the life and deaths of massive stars. Across studies in the field, prescriptions for stellar winds differ substantially in both their physical assumptions and implementation, making them a dominant contributor to model-to-model variation. In this work, we present a systematic analysis of the physical assumptions underlying commonly adopted wind prescriptions for optically thin and optically thick winds of hot stars, as well as the winds of cool supergiants. Our analysis reveals substantial discrepancies across all regimes: predicted mass-loss rates for optically thin winds differ by more than an order of magnitude, while rates for cool supergiants vary by several orders of magnitude, with even wider uncertainties arising in extrapolation regimes beyond the Humphreys-Davidson limit. These disparities introduce significant ambiguity into the predicted formation of Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars, a problem further compounded by the inconsistent application of transition criteria. A central issue is the "cool Wolf-Rayet problem", a temperature regime where the classical electron-scattering Eddington factor ($\Gamma_{\rm e}$) loses physical consistency. Because this factor is widely used to determine WR mass-loss rates, its failure forces models to rely on uncertain extrapolations and ad-hoc corrections. We conclude that the dominant stellar wind uncertainties arise from a mismatch between the physical assumptions in stellar wind models and the structure of the stars to which they are applied. Our framework clarifies the origins of current theoretical discrepancies and identifies the key physical bottlenecks that must be addressed to improve mass-loss modeling for massive stars.</description>

      <title>Observable Metal Pollution in Main-Sequence Stars: Simulations of Rocky Planets Engulfed by Stars in the $0.5$ to $1.4$ M$_\odot$ Range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The engulfment of planets by their host stars is an expected outcome of various dynamical processes and has been invoked to explain a variety of observed stellar properties, such as rapid rotation, chemical abundance abnormalities, and other transient phenomena. Recent observations support engulfment as the cause of such signatures; however, many engulfment process details remain uncertain. Here, we present a model for determining the chemical signatures produced due to the pollution of main sequence stars by rocky planets, a common engulfment scenario due to the high frequency of observed short-period rocky exoplanets. A key novel element of our model is that we calculate the gradual evaporation of the planet due to drag interactions with the stellar envelope, which can lead to observable pollution on the stellar surface even if the bulk of the planet is only destroyed below the star's outer convective zone. Our results indicate that rocky planet pollution is most easily measurable for stars in the $1.0$ to $1.4$ M$_\odot$ range and that elements such as aluminium, calcium, and vanadium, in addition to lithium, are most suited to detect pollution. We predict that it is also possible to differentiate between the engulfment of one large planet versus several small planets, for the same total pollution mass, for some stellar hosts. We find that rocky planet engulfment events generally take years to decades for most stars. Our results can guide future observational campaigns that may search for sites of past or current engulfment events.</description>

      <title>Is the Conventional Picture of Coherence Time Complete? Dark Matter Recoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.00955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The local solar gravitational potential forms a basin for ultralight dark matter (ULDM), with discrete energy levels. Even if barely populated, it introduces a new characteristic timescale in DM dynamics. This necessitates a generalization of the notion of coherence time. We find that, at long times, the phenomenon of recoherence emerges, whereby a subcomponent of ULDM exhibits a formally divergent coherence time. The fact that this generalized coherence time can significantly exceed the naive estimate implies an enhanced sensitivity for dark matter searches that accumulate data over extended observation periods.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study of the relations between the properties of planetary systems and the chemical compositions of their host stars</title>

Abstract: The giant planet-metallicity correlation revealed that planetary formation depends on the stellar properties. There is growing evidence that it is also valid for smaller hot planets, but it is not clear whether elements other than iron also influence the properties of planetary systems. To investigate this, we determined the abundances of 13 chemical elements (Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Sc, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni and Cu) for a sample of 561 Kepler exoplanet-hosting stars using high-resolution Keck/HIRES spectra. We find that stars in systems having only large or hot planets are enriched in some elements relative to those having only small or warm planets, respectively, with this signature being related to the underlying stellar metallicity. This Kepler sample is composed of stars belonging to the Galactic low- and high-$\alpha$ sequences, corresponding to the chemical thin and thick disks. Our results reveal that stars enhanced in $\alpha$-elements may facilitate the formation of large planets in metal-poor environments although the iron abundance is still a limiting factor. We also investigated chemical abundances as a function of elemental condensation temperatures and found that there is a diversity of slopes of regardless of the exoplanetary systems hosted by the star. We confirmed that the Sun is depleted in refractory elements relative to the solar twins in our sample, all of which host a diversity of exoplanets, suggesting that this depletion is caused by processes not related to planet formation.</description>

      <title>The internal kinematics of local young stellar associations. Identifying correlations among age, expansion, rotation, and shear</title>

Abstract: Context. The local (&lt;200 pc away) young (&lt;50 Myr old) stellar associations (LYSA) provide fundamental evidence for the study of the star formation process in the local neighbourhood. Aims. We aim at exploring robust statistical correlations in the internal kinematics of LYSAs and of these with age. Methods. We analyse a public data set containing the linear velocity field parameters and expansion ages of 18 LYSAs. We identify the most robust correlations using frequentist and Bayesian methods. Results. Among the 45 correlations, we identify only four that passed both frequentist and Bayesian criteria, with these four related to radial motions in the Galactic Z direction. We hypothesise several origins for these four correlations and identify the gravitational potential of the Galactic disk as the most likely driving element. It imprinted the observed motions in the parent molecular clouds, and once the stars were formed, it also damped these motions on a timescale shorter than the LYSAs' ages. Conclusions. The internal kinematics of local young stellar associations contain fundamental information about the star-formation process that is not fully addressed by star-formation theories, in particular, rotation and shear. Although the Galactic potential appears to be the driving force of these correlations, we urge the theoretical community to provide predictions about the internal motions of expansion, rotation, and shear of stellar associations.</description>

      <title>Exploring the formation mechanisms of tidal structures in globular clusters of extragalactic origin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal structures around globular clusters provide valuable insights into cluster evolution and the hierarchical assembly of the Milky Way. Using wide-field imaging data from the DESI Legacy Survey combined with a color-magnitude matched-filter technique, we perform a systematic analysis of extra-tidal features in 28 Galactic globular clusters of likely extragalactic origin, representing the largest homogeneous sample examined in this context to date. The clusters display diverse morphologies: 12 exhibit tidal tails, 9 show diffuse envelopes, and 7 reveal no clear extra-tidal features. Notably, we report the first detection of an extended tidal structure around the Sagittarius-associated cluster Terzan 7. To explore the underlying drivers, we compare intrinsic properties, orbital dynamics, and possible accretion associations across morphological groups. From the parameter distributions, complemented by Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests, we find that total mass, escape velocity, concentration, tidal filling factor, pericentric radius, eccentricity and radial angle in action-angle coordinates are all likely group-sensitive parameters. These results suggest that both internal cluster properties and orbital configurations play important roles in shaping extra-tidal morphologies. In addition, the cluster's accretion history shows no clear correlation with the presence of tidal features, indicating that it is not a direct driver of outer structure formation. Overall, the diversity of tidal structures is unlikely to be governed by a single factor, but instead reflects the interplay between internal dynamical evolution and the external Galactic environment. This study provides the most comprehensive constraints so far on the physical processes driving extra-tidal structures in accreted globular clusters.</description>

      <title>SN 2024abvb: A Type Icn Supernova in the Outskirts of its Host Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present multiband photometric and spectroscopic observations of supernova (SN) 2024abvb, which exhibits early-time prominent photoionized narrow emission lines of C II superposed on a blue continuum. The absence of Balmer features indicates that the SN exploded within hydrogen-poor circumstellar matter (CSM). Together with the lack of explicit evidence of helium signatures, we tentatively identify SN 2024abvb as a Type Icn SN (SN Icn). After correcting for extinction, we estimate an r-band peak absolute magnitude of -19.7, placing SN 2024abvb in the luminous regime of SNe Icn. We adopted a hybrid model that accounts for both the energy released by the ejecta-CSM interaction and the radioactive decay of nickel synthesized in the SN ejecta to fit the light curve of SN 2024abvb. The best-fit model to the multiband light curves within the first ~ 40 days after explosion suggests that the CSM, radioactive nickel, and ejecta masses to be 0.28 Msun, 3.54 * 10-3 Msun, and 0.12 Msun, respectively. Such a low ejecta mass indicates that the progenitor star of SN 2024abvb experienced a significant mass-stripping process, consistent with the hydrogen-poor and helium-poor spectral features. SN 2024abvb provides important insights into the physical origins of the rare subclass of SNe Icn.</description>

      <title>Turbulence driving in a star-forming Milky-Way-type galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The life-cycle, structure, and dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM) is regulated by turbulence. Complex physical processes, including supernova (SN) explosions, shear, and gravitational collapse, drive and maintain turbulence, but it is still an open question what turbulence driving mode is primarily excited by these different mechanisms. The turbulence driving parameter, b, can be used to quantify the ratio of solenoidal to compressive modes in the acceleration field that drives the turbulence. Compressive driving is characterised by b ~ 1, while purely solenoidal driving gives b ~ 0.3. To quantify the turbulence in the galactic ISM, we investigate the time evolution of b, as well as the turbulent Mach number, and plasma beta (thermal-to-magnetic pressure ratio), and its correlation with star formation in the magnetised warm neutral medium (WNM) of the TIGRESS shearing-box simulations of a kpc-sized patch of a Milky-Way-like galaxy, over a 100 Myr time period (~ half an orbital time). In this simulation the turbulence is driven by a combination of shear, gravitational collapse, and star formation feedback in the form of radiation and SNe. We find that the turbulence driving parameter fluctuates in time between b ~ 0.4 and b ~ 1. We find a time-dependent correlation of b with star formation activity, such that high star formation rates follow about one turbulent turnover time (~ 10 Myr) after phases of highly compressive driving (b &gt; 0.5). About 20 Myr after the peak in star formation, type-B SN feedback drives up the WNM fraction and turbulent Mach numbers, and reduces plasma beta and the driving to b ~ 0.4-0.5.</description>

      <title>The MUSCLES Extension for Atmospheric Transmission Spectroscopy: Spectral energy distributions for 20 exoplanet host stars that JWST observed in Cycle 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correctly interpreting JWST spectra of close-in exoplanets requires a measurement of the X-ray and ultraviolet light that the planets receive from their host stars. Here we provide spectral energy distributions (SEDs) covering the range $\approx5-1\times10^7$A for 20 transiting exoplanet host stars observed in JWST Cycle 1. The SEDs are constructed out of new and archival Hubble Space Telescope, Chandra X-ray Observatory and/or XMM-Newton data combined with spectra from models or stars with similar properties (proxies) filling in unobserved gaps. We have also constructed SEDs of likely Habitable Worlds Observatory targets $\kappa^1$ Ceti, $\tau$ Ceti, $\epsilon$ Indi and 70 Oph B for use as proxies. We find that the JWST target planets almost all experience much stronger ultraviolet fluxes than the Earth, especially in the extreme ultraviolet, even for planets with similar overall instellation. Strong ongoing or past atmospheric escape is possible for a majority of these planets. We also assess the now considerable sample of panchromatic stellar SEDs and its applicability for current JWST observations and beyond.</description>

      <title>Complex dynamical regimes of the Tayler-Spruit dynamo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical dynamos feature various spatial structures and dynamical regimes, ranging from hemispherical magnetic fields to the random reversals of the geodynamo. The recently observed Tayler-Spruit dynamo has been invoked to explain angular momentum transport in stellar radiative zones and magnetar formation in a proto-neutron star spun-up by fallback accretion. Whether this dynamo mechanism can lead to different dynamical regimes remains an open question. Using three-dimensional direct numerical simulations, we model the dynamics of a stably stratified spherical Couette flow, with the outer sphere rotating faster than the inner one. While the generation of strong stationary and hemispherical dynamos has been observed in our previous studies, we report for the first time the existence of reversals and complex temporal dynamics. We observe that the dynamics is strongly correlated with the equatorial symmetry breaking of the flow. Focusing on a fiducial dynamo simulation, we propose a simple interpretation of its dynamics, which consists in the coupling of two large-scale magnetic modes with two opposite equatorial symmetries by the flow symmetry breaking. While this interpretation captures the simplest observed dynamics, the nonlinear interaction between a higher number of magnetic modes is certainly required to describe some of the more complex regimes. The wide diversity of dynamical regimes generated by the Tayler-Spruit dynamo may have interesting implications for the geometry of the neutron star magnetic fields, and therefore neutron star emissions.</description>

Abstract: Fluctuations and structure across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales are frequently studied in the solar wind. The properties of the low-frequency fluctuations are of relevance to turbulent energy injection into the plasma and the transport of high-energy cosmic rays. Correlation analysis of decade-long intervals of interplanetary data permits study of fluctuations at time scales much longer than suitably defined correlation times, and therefore at frequencies well below those associated with the Kolmogorov inertial range of {\it in situ} turbulence. At the frequencies of interest, we study the familiar occurrence of the $1/f$ spectral signature. We also study point spectral features due to solar rotation and their relation with the $1/f$ signal. We report novel properties at timescales ranging from minutes up to years, using data selected by wind speed, phase of solar cycle, and cartesian components of the magnetic field. A surprising finding is that the power in solar rotation harmonics is consistent with an extension of the $1/f$ spectrum, down to frequencies as low as around $\unit[5 \times 10^{-7}]{Hz}$. The presence of a broadband $1/f$ spectrum across different wind types supports the interpretation that $1/f$ signals may be related to or even originate from the solar dynamo.</description>

      <title>Properties of Carbon-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars in the LMC and the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00397v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comparative study of carbon-rich asymptotic giant branch (CAGB) stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; 7347 stars) and the Milky Way (7163 stars) using infrared color-magnitude diagrams, spectral energy distributions (SEDs), two-color diagrams, and variability data. Observed SEDs are compared with theoretical models to characterize the central stars and their circumstellar dust envelopes and to estimate distances. For the LMC, a set of best-fitting CAGB models is derived by fitting observed SEDs with radiative transfer models, utilizing the galaxy's well-established distance. For Galactic CAGB stars, where Gaia DR3 parallaxes are uncertain, we estimate distances by fitting observed SEDs with the CAGB models validated against LMC stars, and for Mira variables, from the period-magnitude relation calibrated with LMC Miras. A comparison of these approaches demonstrates that the SED-based distances are both reliable and practical for a large sample of Galactic CAGB stars. We find that CAGB stars in both galaxies show broadly similar infrared properties, although the LMC sample lacks stars with extremely thick dust envelopes.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-driven atmospheric parameter prediction for hot subdwarf stars with synthetic and observed spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design a convolutional neural network (CNN) incorporating channel attention and spatial attention mechanisms to predict atmospheric parameters of hot subdwarfs. The experimental dataset comprises spectra at nine distinct signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels, with each SNR level containing 11 396 synthetic spectra and 945 observed spectra. The trained deep learning models achieves mean absolute errors (AME) in predicting hot subdwarf atmospheric parameters of 730 K for effective temperature (Teff ), 0.09 dex for surface gravity (log g), and 0.03 dex for helium abundance (log(nHe/nH)), respectively, which reaches the accuracy of traditional spectral fitting methods. Utilizing the trained deep learning models and low-resolution spectra from LAMOST DR12, we confirm 1512 hot subdwarfs from the catalog of hot subdwarf candidates, of which 291 are newly identified. Our results demonstrate that the deep learning model not only achieves accuracy comparable to traditional methods in obtaining hot subdwarf atmospheric parameters, but also far exceeds them in speed and efficiency, making it particularly suitable for the analysis of large datasets of hot subdwarf spectra.</description>

      <title>Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients as very massive star core-collapse events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) are rare extragalactic events of unknown origin. Tidal disruptions of white dwarfs by intermediate mass black holes (BHs), mergers of BHs and Wolf-Rayet stars, and failed supernovae are among the suggestions. We explore the viability of very massive star core-collapse events as the origin of LFBOTs. The appeal of such a model is that the formation of massive BHs via core collapse may yield observational signatures that can match the disparate lines of evidence that point towards both core-collapse and tidal disruption origins. We explore the formation rate of massive BH in population synthesis models, and compare the metallicities of their progenitors with the observed metallicities of LFBOT host galaxies. We further examine the composition, mass loss rates and fallback masses of these stars, placing them in the context of LFBOT observations. The formation rate of BHs with mass greater than ~30-40Msol is similar to the observed LFBOT rate. The stars producing these BHs are biased to low metallicity (Z&lt;0.3Zsol), are H and He-poor and have dense circumstellar media. However, some LFBOTs have host galaxies with higher metallicities than predicted, and others have denser environments (plausibly due to late mass loss not captured in the models). We find that long-lived emission from an accretion disc (as implicated in the LFBOT AT 2018cow) can only be produce in these events under maximal disc mass and angular momentum conditions. We conclude that (very) massive star core-collapse is a plausible explanation for at least some LFBOTs, but faces challenges. The preferred progenitors for LFBOTs in the failed supernova interpretation overlap with those predicted to produce super-kilonovae. We therefore suggest that LFBOTs are promising targets to search for super-kilonovae, and that they may contribute to the r-process enrichment of galaxies.</description>

      <title>ESO Expanding Horizon White Paper: Revealing the properties of matter at supranuclear densities with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding dense matter under extreme conditions is one of the most fundamental puzzles in modern physics. Complex interactions give rise to emergent, collective phenomena. While nuclear experiments and Earth - based colliders provide valuable insights, much of the quantum chromodynamics phase diagram at high density and low temperature remains accessible only through astrophysical observations of neutron stars, neutron star mergers, and stellar collapse. Astronomical observations thus offer a direct window to the physics on subatomic scales with gravitational waves presenting an especially clean channel. Next-generation gravitational - wave observatories, such as the Einstein Telescope, would serve as unparalleled instruments to transform our understanding of neutron star matter. They will enable the detection of up to tens of thousands of binary neutron star and neutron star - black hole mergers per year, a dramatic increase over the few events accessible with current detectors. They will provide an unprecedented precision in probing cold, dense matter during the binary inspiral, exceeding by at least an order of magnitude what current facilities can achieve. Moreover, these observatories will allow us to explore uncharted regimes of dense matter at finite temperatures produced in a subset of neutron star mergers, areas that remain entirely inaccessible to current instruments. Together with multimessenger observations, these measurements will significantly deepen our knowledge of dense nuclear matter.</description>
