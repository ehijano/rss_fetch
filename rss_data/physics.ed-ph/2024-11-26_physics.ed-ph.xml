      <title>Decoding physics identity: A Spanish-language adaptation on an instrument and its correlation with STEM achievement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The representation of Spanish-speaking students in STEM identity literature, particularly in physics identity, is conspicuously minimal. This study addresses this gap with a two-pronged approach. First, a physics identity instrument was adapted for Spanish-speaking STEM students to promote inclusivity in educational research. Data from 334 Mexican STEM students was collected and analysed for validation through factor analyses and Cronbach's alpha, confirming the structural integrity and reliability of the adapted instrument. Second, the instrument was employed to examine the correlation between physics identity and academic performance in a separate dataset from 200 engineering students, using multivariate linear and logistic regressions.
  The findings underscore gender's impact on physics course grades. Notably, variations in physics identity among engineering students indicated a potential link with their chosen field. Despite the importance of physics in engineering, physics identity was lower than expected, and performance in physics courses did not consistently correlate with a strong physics identity. However, the `interest in physics topics` subconstruct did correlate with physics course grades.
  This research fills a critical void by providing an adapted instrument for assessing physics identity in Spanish-speaking students and underscores the need for pedagogical shifts to enhance physics identity and STEM outcomes for Latino students.</description>

      <title>Teaching Magnetism with Bivectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic field is traditionally presented as a (pseudo)vector quantity, tied closely to the cross product. Though familiar to experts, many students find these ideas challenging and full of subtleties. Building on earlier work in rotational physics, we present an alternative pedagogical approach that describes magnetic fields using bivectors. These objects can be visualized as oriented tiles whose components form an antisymmetric matrix. Historically, bivectors have been mostly used in specialized contexts like spacetime classification or geometric algebra, but they are not necessarily more complicated to understand than cross products. Teaching magnetism in this language addresses common student difficulties, generalizes directly to relativity (and extra dimensions), and brings fresh insight to familiar ideas.</description>

      <title>Understanding student challenges with circulation and Amp\`ere-Maxwell law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated how students apply the concept of circulation when faced with problems related to the Ampere-Maxwell law. For this purpose, we designed a metacognitive pencil-and-paper question, presented it to 65 students, and analysed their responses using phenomenography. We complemented our research by conducting interviews with 12 students. The results show that students tend to think that they can only use the magnetic field circulation to calculate magnetic fields if the curve used is symmetric, and that they do not take into account the shape of the magnetic field lines when applying it. We also find that some students believe that a variable electric field must cross the entire Amperian curve in order to apply Amp\'ere-Maxwell's law and find the magnetic field.</description>
