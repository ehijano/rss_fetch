      <title>Counting representations of quivers with multiplicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we study counts of quiver representations over finite rings of truncated power series. We prove a plethystic formula relating counts of quiver representations over these rings and counts of jets on fibres of quiver moment maps. This solves a conjecture of Wyss and allows us to compute both counts on additional examples, using local zeta functions. The relation between counts of representations and counts of jets generalises the relation between Kac polynomials and counts of points on preprojective stacks. Pursuing this analogy, we establish further properties of our counts. We show that, for totally negative quivers, counts of jets converge to p-adic integrals on fibres of quiver moment maps. One expects a relation between these p-adic integrals and BPS invariants of preprojective algebras i.e. Kac polynomials. For small rank vectors, we also prove that the polynomials counting indecomposable quiver representations over finite rings have non-negative coefficients. Moreover, we show that jet schemes of fibres of quiver moment maps are cohomologically pure in that setting, so that their Poincar\'e polynomials are given by the former counts. This is reminiscent of the structure of cohomological Hall algebras, which are built from the cohomology of preprojective stacks. Finally, we compute the cohomology of jet spaces of preprojective stacks explicitly for the A2 quiver. Building on the structure of the preprojective cohomological Hall algebra of A2, we propose a candidate analogue of the BPS Lie algebra and conjecture the existence of a Hall product on the cohomology of these jet spaces.</description>

      <title>Cluster expansion formulas and perfect matchings for type B and C</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbf{P}_{2n+2}$ be the regular polygon with $2n+2$ vertices, and let $\theta$ be the rotation of 180$^\circ$. Fomin and Zelevinsky showed that $\theta$-invariant triangulations of $\mathbf{P}_{2n+2}$ are in bijection with the clusters of cluster algebras of type $B_n$ or $C_n$. Moreover, cluster variables correspond to the orbits of the action of $\theta$ on the diagonals of $\mathbf{P}_{2n+2}$. In this paper, we associate a labeled modified snake graph $\mathcal{G}_{ab}$ to each $\theta$-orbit $[a,b]$, and we get the cluster variables of type $B_n$ and $C_n$ which correspond to $[a,b]$ as perfect matching Laurent polynomials of $\mathcal{G}_{ab}$. This extends the work of Musiker for cluster algebras of type B and C to every seed.</description>

      <title>Representation theory of the group of automorphisms of a finite rooted tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the ordinary irreducible representations of the group of automorphisms of a finite, rooted tree may be obtained following one of the classical method used for the irreducible representations of the symmetric group, namely the approach in Chapter 2 of the classical book by James and Kerber. To reach this goal, we introduce and study the combinatorics of tree compositions, a natural generalization of set compositions but with new features and more complexity due to the tree structure. This leads to a natural parametrization of the conjugacy classes and of the irreducible representations by means of the same combinatorial objects. Our trees are not necessarily spherically homogeneous and our approach is coordinate free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{g}$ be a complex semisimple Lie algebra and let $\mathbf{U}_q(\mathfrak{g})$ denote the associated Drinfel'd Jimbo quantized enveloping algebra. In this paper we study spherical functions of $\mathbf{U}_q(\mathfrak{g})$ related to characters. We show invariance under the Wang-Zhang braid group operators and show relative Weyl group invariance, when restricted to the quantum torus.</description>

      <title>Skew-group $A_{\infty}$-categories as Fukaya categories of orbifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the partially wrapped Fukaya category of a surface with boundary with an action of a group of order two. Inspired by skew-group algebras and categories, we define the notion of a skew-group $A_\infty$-category and let it play the role of the partially wrapped Fukaya category of an orbifold surface. We classify indecomposable objects in terms of graded curves with signs, or taggings, at orbifold points. We compute morphisms between a class of objects, and we use this to describe tilting objects and find algebras derived-equivalent to skew-gentle algebras.</description>

      <title>A unified approach to some rigidity and stability problems in algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we use give some algebraic applications of a previous result by the author which compares the deformations parameterized by the Maurer-Cartan elements of a differential graded Lie algebra, and a differential graded Lie subalgebra: It gives a criterion for the map on the space of Maurer-Cartan elements up to gauge equivalence, induced by the inclusion of the subalgebra, to be locally surjective. By making appropriate choices for the differential graded Lie algebra and a differential graded Lie subalgebra, we recover some classical results in the deformation theory of finite-dimensional Lie and associative algebras. We consider rigidity of Lie and associative algebras, Lie algebra morphisms, and give a quick proof of the fact that the deformation theories of a unital associative algebra as a unital associative algebra and as an associative algebra are equivalent. We then turn to stability of Lie subalgebras and their morphisms under deformations of the ambient Lie algebra structure, and study when the compatibility with a geometric structure of a representation of a Lie algebra on a vector space is stable under deformations of the representation.</description>

      <title>A skew Specht perspective of RoCK blocks and cuspidal systems for KLR algebras in affine type A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cuspidal systems parameterize KLR algebra representations via root partitions $\pi$, where simple modules $L(\pi)$ arise as heads of proper standard modules. Working in affine type A with an arbitrary convex preorder, we construct explicit skew diagrams $\zeta(\pi)$ such that the skew Specht module $S^{\zeta(\pi)}$ has simple head $L(\pi)$ and a filtration by proper standard modules. This result arises from an in-depth study of the combinatorial interplay between cuspidal systems and RoCK cyclotomic KLR algebras.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Robust Orbit Problems for Torus Actions and the abc-conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a group acts on a set, it naturally partitions it into orbits, giving rise to orbit problems. These are natural algorithmic problems, as symmetries are central in numerous questions and structures in physics, mathematics, computer science, optimization, and more. Accordingly, it is of high interest to understand their computational complexity. Recently, B\"urgisser et al. gave the first polynomial-time algorithms for orbit problems of torus actions, that is, actions of commutative continuous groups on Euclidean space. In this work, motivated by theoretical and practical applications, we study the computational complexity of robust generalizations of these orbit problems, which amount to approximating the distance of orbits in $\mathbb{C}^n$ up to a factor $\gamma&gt;1$. In particular, this allows deciding whether two inputs are approximately in the same orbit or far from being so. On the one hand, we prove the NP-hardness of this problem for $\gamma = n^{\Omega(1/\log\log n)}$ by reducing the closest vector problem for lattices to it. On the other hand, we describe algorithms for solving this problem for an approximation factor $\gamma = \exp(\mathrm{poly}(n))$. Our algorithms combine tools from invariant theory and algorithmic lattice theory, and they also provide group elements witnessing the proximity of the given orbits (in contrast to the algebraic algorithms of prior work). We prove that they run in polynomial time if and only if a version of the famous number-theoretic $abc$-conjecture holds -- establishing a new and surprising connection between computational complexity and number theory.</description>

      <title>On the Picard group of the stable module category for infinite groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the stable module $\infty$-category for groups of type $\Phi$ as an enhancement of the stable category defined by N. Mazza and P. Symonds. For groups of type $\Phi$ which act on a tree, we show that the stable module $\infty$-category decomposes in terms of the associated graph of groups. For groups which admit a finite-dimensional cocompact model for the classifying space for proper actions, we exhibit a decomposition in terms of the stable module $\infty$-categories of their finite subgroups. We use these decompositions to provide methods to compute the Picard group of the stable module category. In particular, we provide a description of the Picard group for countable locally finite $p$-groups.</description>

      <title>The refined solution to the Capelli eigenvalue problem for $\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)\oplus\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)$ and $\mathfrak{gl}(m|2n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak g$ be either the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{gl}(V)\oplus\mathfrak{gl}(V)$ where $V:=\mathbb C^{m|n}$ or the Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{gl}(V)$ where $V:=\mathbb C^{m|2n}$. Furthermore, let $W$ be the $\mathfrak g$-module defined by $W:=V\otimes V^*$ in the former case and $W:=\mathcal S^2(V)$ in the latter case. Associated to $(\mathfrak g,W)$ there exists a distinguished basis of Capelli operators $\left\{D^\lambda\right\}_{\lambda\in\Omega}$, naturally indexed by a set of hook partitions $\Omega$, for the subalgebra of $\mathfrak g$-invariants in the superalgebra $\mathcal{PD}(W)$ of superdifferential operators on $W$.
  Let $\mathfrak b$ be a Borel subalgebra of $\mathfrak g$. We compute eigenvalues of the $D^\lambda$ on the irreducible $\mathfrak g$-submodules of $\mathcal{P}(W)$ and obtain them explicitly as the evaluation of the interpolation super Jack polynomials of Sergeev--Veselov at suitable affine functions of the $\mathfrak b$-highest weight. While the former case is straightforward, the latter is significantly more complex. This generalizes a result by Sahi, Salmasian and Serganova for these cases, where such formulas were given for a fixed choice of Borel subalgebra.</description>

Abstract: Let $D$ be a quaternion division algebra over a non-archimedean local field $K$ of characteristic zero, and let $Sp_n(D)$ be the unique non-split inner form of the symplectic group $Sp_{2n}(K)$. This paper classifies the irreducible admissible representations of $GL_{n}(D)$ with a symplectic period for $n = 3$ and $4$, i.e., those irreducible admissible representations $(\pi, V)$ of $GL_{n}(D)$ which have a linear functional $l$ on $V$ such that $l(\pi(h)v) = l(v)$ for all $v \in V$ and $h \in Sp_n(D)$. Our results also contain all unitary representations having a symplectic period, as stated in Prasad's conjecture.</description>

Abstract: We give an explicit description of a diagonal map on the Bardzell resolution for any monomial algebra, and we use this diagonal map to describe the cup product on Hochschild cohomology. Then, we prove that the cup product is zero in positive degrees for triangular monomial algebras. Our proof uses the graded-commutativity of the cup product on Hochschild cohomology and does not rely on explicit computation of the Hochschild cohomology modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(\tau, V_{\tau})$ be a finite dimensional representation of $K$, a maximal compact subgroup of a connected non-compact semisimple Lie group $G$ and let $\Gamma_i (i=1,2)$ be uniform torsion free lattices in $G$. We prove that if all but finitely many irreducible unitary $\tau$-spherical representations of $G$ occur with equal multiplicities in $L^2(\Gamma_1 \backslash G)$ and $L^2(\Gamma_2 \backslash G)$, then $L^2(\Gamma_1 \backslash G) \cong L^2(\Gamma_2 \backslash G)$ as representations of $G$.
  We introduce a notion of infinitesimally $\tau$-isospectrality and obtain a generalisation of the celebrated Matsushima-Murakami formula relating dimension of space of automorphic forms associated to $\tau$ and multiplicities of irreducible $\tau^\vee$-spherical representations in $L^2(\Gamma \backslash G)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal P:=\mathcal P_{m\times n}$ denote the quantized coordinate ring of the space of $m\times n$ matrices, equipped with natural actions of the quantized enveloping algebras $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_m)$ and $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$. Let $\mathcal L$ and $\mathcal R$ denote the images of $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_m)$ and $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$ in $\mathrm{End}(\mathcal P)$, respectively. We define a $q$-analogue of the algebra of polynomial-coefficient differential operators inside $\mathrm{End}(\mathcal P)$, henceforth denoted by $\mathcal{PD}$, and we prove that $\mathcal L\cap \mathcal{PD}$ and $\mathcal{R}\cap \mathcal{PD}$ are mutual centralizers inside $\mathcal{PD}$. Using this, we establish a new First Fundamental Theorem of invariant theory for $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$. We also compute explicit formulas in terms of $q$-determinants for generators of the intersections with $\mathcal{PD}$ of the images of the Cartan subalgebras of $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_m)$ and $U_q(\mathfrak{gl}_n)$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and study quantum Capelli operators inside newly constructed quantum Weyl algebras associated to three families of symmetric pairs. Both the center of a particular quantized enveloping algebra and the Capelli operators act semisimply on the polynomial part of these quantum Weyl algebras. We show how to transfer well-known properties of the center arising from the theory of quantum symmetric pairs to the Capelli operators. Using this information, we provide a natural realization of Knop-Sahi interpolation polynomials as functions that produce eigenvalues for quantum Capelli operators.</description>

      <title>Generalized double affine Hecke algebras, their representations, and higher Teichm\"uller theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06803v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized double affine Hecke algebras (GDAHA) are flat deformations of the group algebras of $2$-dimensional crystallographic groups associated to star-shaped simply laced affine Dynkin diagrams. In this paper, we first construct a functor that sends representations of the $\tilde D_4$-type GDAHA to representations of the $\tilde E_6$-type one for specialised parameters. Then, under no restrictions on the parameters, we construct embeddings of both GDAHAs of type $\tilde D_4$ and $\tilde E_6$ into matrix algebras over quantum cluster $\mathcal{X}$-varieties, thus linking to the theory of higher Teichm\"uller spaces. For $\tilde E_6$, the two explicit representations we provide over distinct quantum tori are shown to be related by quiver reductions and mutations.</description>

      <title>The $D$-module mirror conjecture for flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15523v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rietsch constructed a candidate $T$-equivariant mirror LG model for any flag variety $G/P$. In this paper, we prove the following mirror symmetry prediction: the small $T\times\mathbb{G}_m$-equivariant quantum cohomology of $G/P$ equipped with quantum connection is isomorphic as $D$-modules to the Brieskorn lattice associated to the LG model equipped with Gauss-Manin connection.</description>
