      <title>A non-homogeneous, non-stationary and path-dependent Markov anomalous diffusion model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel probabilistic framework for modelling anomalous diffusion is presented. The resulting process is Markovian, non-homogeneous, non-stationary, non-ergodic, and state-dependent. The fundamental law governing this process is driven by two opposing forces: one proportional to the current state, representing the intensity of autocorrelation or contagion, and another inversely proportional to the elapsed time, acting as a damping function. The interplay between these forces determines the diffusion regime, characterized by the ratio of their proportionality coefficients. This framework encompasses various regimes, including subdiffusion, Brownian non-Gaussian, superdiffusion, ballistic, and hyperballistic behaviours. The hyperballistic regime emerges when the correlation force dominates over damping, whereas a balance between these mechanisms results in a ballistic regime, which is also stationary. Crucially, non-stationarity is shown to be necessary for regimes other than ballistic. The model's ability to describe hyperballistic phenomena has been demonstrated in applications such as epidemics, software reliability, and network traffic. Furthermore, deviations from Gaussianity are explored and violations of the Central Limit Theorem are highlighted, supported by theoretical analysis and simulations. It will also be shown that the model exhibits a strong autocorrelation structure due to a position dependent jump probability.</description>

      <title>Polynomial algebra from the Lie algebra reduction chain $\mathfrak{su}(4) \supset \mathfrak{su}(2) \times \mathfrak{su}(2)$: The supermultiplet model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supermultiplet model, based on the reduction chain $\mathfrak{su}(4) \supset \mathfrak{su}(2) \times \mathfrak{su}(2)$, is revisited through the lens of commutants within universal enveloping algebras of Lie algebras. From this analysis, a collection of twenty polynomials up to degree nine emerges from the commutant associated with the $\mathfrak{su}(2) \times \mathfrak{su}(2)$ subalgebra. This study is conducted in the Poisson (commutative) framework using the Lie-Poisson bracket associated with the dual of the Lie algebra under consideration. As the main result, we obtain the polynomial Poisson algebra generated by these twenty linearly independent and indecomposable polynomials, with five elements being central. This incorporates polynomial expansions up to degree seventeen in the Lie algebra generators. We further discuss additional algebraic relations among these polynomials, explicitly detailing some of the lower-order ones. As a byproduct of these results, we also show that the recently introduced 'grading method' turns out to be essential for deriving the Poisson bracket relations when the degree of the expansions becomes so high that standard approaches are no longer applicable, due to computational limitations. These findings represent a further step toward the systematic exploration of polynomial algebras relevant to nuclear models.</description>

      <title>Generalized toric codes on twisted tori for quantum error correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kitaev toric code is widely considered one of the leading candidates for error correction in fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, direct methods to increase its logical dimensions, such as lattice surgery or introducing punctures, often incur prohibitive overheads. In this work, we introduce a ring-theoretic approach for efficiently analyzing topological CSS codes in two dimensions, enabling the exploration of generalized toric codes with larger logical dimensions on twisted tori. Using Gr\"obner bases, we simplify stabilizer syndromes to efficiently identify anyon excitations and their geometric periodicities, even under twisted periodic boundary conditions. Since the properties of the codes are determined by the anyons, this approach allows us to directly compute the logical dimensions without constructing large parity-check matrices. Our approach provides a unified method for finding new quantum error-correcting codes and exhibiting their underlying topological orders via the Laurent polynomial ring. This framework naturally applies to bivariate bicycle codes. For example, we construct optimal weight-6 generalized toric codes on twisted tori with parameters $[[ n, k, d ]]$ for $n \leq 400$, yielding novel codes such as $[[120,8,12]]$, $[[186,10,14]]$, $[[210,10,16]]$, $[[248, 10, 18]]$, $[[254, 14, 16]]$, $[[294, 10, 20]]$, $[[310, 10, 22]]$, and $[[340, 16, 18]]$. Moreover, we present a new realization of the $[[360,12,24]]$ quantum code using the $(3,3)$-bivariate bicycle code on a twisted torus defined by the basis vectors $(0,30)$ and $(6,6)$, improving stabilizer locality relative to the previous construction. These results highlight the power of the topological order perspective in advancing the design and theoretical understanding of quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes.</description>

      <title>The Large-Scale Structure of Entanglement in Quantum Many-body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the thermodynamic limit of a many-body system can reveal entanglement properties that are hard to detect in finite-size systems -- similar to how phase transitions only sharply emerge in the thermodynamic limit. The resulting operational entanglement properties are in one-to-one correspondence with abstract properties of the local observable algebras that emerge in the thermodynamic limit. These properties are insensitive to finite perturbations and hence describe the \emph{large-scale structure of entanglement} of many-body systems. We formulate and discuss the emerging structures and open questions, both for gapped and gapless many-body systems. In particular, we show that every gapped phase of matter, even the trivial one, in $D\geq 2$ dimensions contains models with the strongest possible bipartite large-scale entanglement. Conversely, we conjecture the existence of topological phases of matter, where all representatives have the strongest form of entanglement.</description>

      <title>Classification of Fragile Topology Enabled by Matrix Homotopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The moire flat bands in twisted bilayer graphene have attracted considerable attention not only because of the emergence of correlated phases but also due to their nontrivial topology. Specifically, they exhibit a new class of topology that can be nullified by the addition of trivial bands, termed fragile topology, which suggests the need for an expansion of existing classification schemes. Here, we develop a Z2 energy-resolved topological marker for classifying fragile phases using a system's position-space description, enabling the direct classification of finite, disordered, and aperiodic materials. By translating the physical symmetries protecting the system's fragile topological phase into matrix symmetries of the system's Hamiltonian and position operators, we use matrix homotopy to construct our topological marker while simultaneously yielding a quantitative measure of topological robustness. We show our framework's effectiveness using a C2T-symmetric twisted bilayer graphene model and photonic crystal as a continuum example. We have found that fragile topology can persist both under strong disorder and in heterostructures lacking a bulk spectral gap, and even an example of disorder-induced re-entrant topology. Overall, the proposed scheme serves as an effective tool for elucidating aspects of fragile topology, offering guidance for potential applications across a variety of experimental platforms from topological photonics to correlated phases in materials.</description>

      <title>Deformed Schur indices and Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schur index in four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory with $U(N)$ gauge group has a natural two-parameter deformation. We find that a matrix integral in such a deformed Schur index can be exactly evaluated by using Macdonald polynomials. The resulting expression is a simple combinatorial summation over partitions. An extension to line operator indices is straightforward. In particular, for an anti-symmetric representation, the line operator index has a relatively simple form. We further discuss infinite $N$ analysis and finite $N$ giant graviton expansions.</description>

      <title>Uniform Boundedness of Homogeneous Incompressible Flows in $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03991v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the extendability of local solutions for incompressible 3D Navier-Stokes and 3D Euler problems, with initial data $\mathbf{u}_0$ in the Sobolev space $H^s (\mathbb{R}^3)$, where $s$ ensures the existence and uniqueness of classical solutions. A geometric decomposition of the configuration space, identified by the orthogonality between the solution $\mathbf{u}$ and the pressure forces $\nabla p$, splits the problem into two simpler subproblems, which enable the uniform boundedness of the solution in each component of the partition, thereby ensuring the extendability of the solution.</description>

      <title>Geometric properties and offset surface construction for slant timelike-ruled surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates slant timelike-ruled surfaces and their evolute offsets in Minkowski 3-space $\mathbb{E}_{1}^{3}$. Using the symmetry of evolute curves, we derive a parametric formulation for skew timelike-ruled surfaces and establish conditions ensuring the coaxial alignment of the central normal with the ruling direction of the corresponding offset surface. The geometric properties are examined through the Blaschke and Darboux frames, leading to curvature characteristics and fundamental invariants. Special cases, such as timelike-developable and timelike-binormal surfaces, are analyzed with illustrative examples. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the differential geometry of timelike-ruled surfaces and their evolute offsets in Lorentzian space.</description>

      <title>Gradient-enhanced PINN with residual unit for studying forward-inverse problems of variable coefficient equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed neural network (PINN) is a powerful emerging method for studying forward-inverse problems of partial differential equations (PDEs), even from limited sample data. Variable coefficient PDEs, which model real-world phenomena, are of considerable physical significance and research value. This study proposes a gradient-enhanced PINN with residual unit (R-gPINN) method to solve the data-driven solution and function discovery for variable coefficient PDEs. On the one hand, the proposed method incorporates residual units into the neural networks to mitigate gradient vanishing and network degradation, unify linear and nonlinear coefficient problem. We present two types of residual unit structures in this work to offer more flexible solutions in problem-solving. On the other hand, by including gradient terms of variable coefficients, the method penalizes collocation points that fail to satisfy physical properties. This enhancement improves the network's adherence to physical constraints and aligns the prediction function more closely with the objective function. Numerical experiments including solve the forward-inverse problems of variable coefficient Burgers equation, variable coefficient KdV equation, variable coefficient Sine-Gordon equation, and high-dimensional variable coefficient Kadomtsev-Petviashvili equation. The results show that using R-gPINN method can greatly improve the accuracy of predict solution and predict variable coefficient in solving variable coefficient equations.</description>

      <title>A new Lagrangian approach to optimal control of second-order systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose and study a new approach to formulate the optimal control problem of second-order differential equations, with a particular interest in those derived from force-controlled Lagrangian systems. The formulation results in a new hyperregular control Langrangian and, thus, a new control Hamiltonian whose equations of motion provide necessary optimality conditions. We compare this approach to Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP) in this setting, providing geometric insight into their relation. This leads us to define an extended Tulczyjew's triple with controls. Moreover, we study the relationship between Noether symmetries of this new formulation and those of the PMP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this note is twofold: first, we explain the relation between the isomorphism theorems in the context of vertex reinforced jump process discovered in [BHS19, BHS21] and the standard Markovian isomorphism theorems for Markovian jump processes; second, we introduce the vertex reinforced counterpart of the standard Poissonian loop soup developed by Le Jan [LJ10]. To this end, we propose an algorithm that can be viewed as a variant of Wilson's algorithm with reinforcement. We establish the isomorphism theorems for the erased loops and the random walk from this algorithm, and in particular provide a concrete construction of the reinforced loop soup via a random process with a reinforcement mechanism.</description>

      <title>Presymplectic BV-AKSZ for $N=1$ $D=4$ Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We elaborate on the presymplectic BV-AKSZ approach to supersymmetric systems. In particular, we construct such a formulation for the $N=1$, $D=4$ supergravity by taking as a target space the Chevalley-Eilenberg complex of the super-Poincar\'e algebra which, as we demonstrate, admits an invariant presymplectic structure of degree $3$. In particular, this data encodes a full-scale Batalin-Vilkovisky formulation of the system. The important feature of (presymplectic) AKSZ models is that, at least at the level of equations of motion, they can be equivalently reformulated in the spacetime obtained by adding or eliminating contractible dimensions. For instance, the presymplectic AKSZ formulation of gravity can be lifted to the respective ``group manifold'', endowing it with the structure of a principle bundle and the Cartan connection therein, at least locally. In particular, the so-called rheonomy conditions emerge as a part of the presymplectic AKSZ equations of motion. The analogous considerations apply to supergravity and its uplift to superspace. We also study general presymplectic BV-AKSZ models related by adding or removing contractible spacetime dimensions in order to systematically relate the spacetime and superspace formulations of the same system within the AKSZ-like framework. These relations are then illustrated using the supersymmetric particle as a toy model.</description>

Abstract: The algebra of invariants for both the relativistic and nonrelativistic multispecies Vlasov-Maxwell system is examined, including the case with a fixed ion background. Invariants and their associated fluxes are obtained directly from the Vlasov-Maxwell system. The invariants are shown to Poisson commute with the Hamiltonian and the rest of the Poisson bracket algebra of invariants is identified. Special attention is given to the role played by the monopole condition, $\nabla\cdot \mathbf{B}$.</description>

It allows bypassing the analytic continuation arguments of a previous proof by Ceyhan and Faulkner and can be used e.g., for defining entropy current fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Coarse graining and reduced order models for plume ejection dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monitoring the atmospheric dispersion of pollutants is increasingly critical for environmental impact assessments. High-fidelity computational models are often employed to simulate plume dynamics, guiding decision-making and prioritizing resource deployment. However, such models can be prohibitively expensive to simulate, as they require resolving turbulent flows at fine spatial and temporal resolutions. Moreover, there are at least two distinct dynamical regimes of interest in the plume: (i) the initial ejection of the plume where turbulent mixing is generated by the shear-driven Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, and (ii) the ensuing turbulent diffusion and advection which is often modeled by the Gaussian plume model. We address the challenge of modeling the initial plume generation. Specifically, we propose a data-driven framework that identifies a reduced-order analytical model for plume dynamics -- directly from video data. We extract a time series of plume center and edge points from video snapshots and evaluate different regressions based to their extrapolation performance to generate a time series of coefficients that characterize the plume's overall direction and spread. We regress to a sinusoidal model inspired by the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability for the edge points in order to identify the plume's dispersion and vorticity. Overall, this reduced-order modeling framework provides a data-driven and lightweight approach to capture the dominant features of the initial nonlinear point-source plume dynamics, agnostic to plume type and starting only from video. The resulting model is a pre-cursor to standard models such as the Gaussian plume model and has the potential to enable rapid assessment and evaluation of critical environmental hazards, such as methane leaks, chemical spills, and pollutant dispersal from smokestacks.</description>

Abstract: We consider the bounded linear operators with domain in the Hilbert space $L^2(S^n)$, $n=2,3,5$ and describe its symbolic calculus defined by the Berezin quantization. In particular, we derive an explicit formula for the composition of Berezin's symbols and thus a noncommutative invariant star product, which in turn is invariant under the action of the group $SU(2)$, $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ and $SU(4)$ on $\mathbb C^2$ , $\mathbb C^4$ and $\mathbb C^8$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Landscapes of integrable long-range spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We clarify how the elliptic integrable spin chain recently found by Matushko and Zotov (MZ) relates to various other known long-range spin chains.
  The limit $q\to1$ gives the elliptic spin chain of Sechin and Zotov (SZ), whose trigonometric case is due to Fukui and Kawakami. At finite size, only the latter is U(1)-symmetric.
  We compare the resulting (vertex-type) landscape of the MZ chain with the (face-type) landscape containing the Heisenberg XXX and Haldane--Shastry (HS) chains, as well as the Inozemtsev chain and its recent q-deformation. We find that the two landscapes only share a single point: the rational HS chain. Using wrapping we show that the SZ chain is the anti-periodic version of the Inozemtsev chain in a precise sense, and expand both chains around their nearest-neighbour limits to facilitate their interpretations as long-range deformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periods of rational integrals appear in quantum mechanics through asymptotic expansions of traces computed with the semiclassical symbol calculus. We develop a novel formal series expansion for the trace of the Dirac delta of a differential operator. Restricting to operators which arise as the quantizations of polynomials, we are able to apply the Griffiths-Dwork reduction to the integrals. By developing this perspective, we find the reduction of all integrals in the asymptotic series to normal form through a finite calculation. In the case of one degree of freedom, the two dimensional residue formula relates the rational integrals to the quantum actions in the exact WKB formalism.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Associated Quantum Vector Bundles and the Quantum Gauge Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.01550v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well--known that if one is given a principal $G$--bundle with a principal connection, then for every unitary finite--dimensional linear representation of $G$ one can induce a linear connection and a Hermitian structure on the associated vector bundles which are compatible. Furthermore, the gauge group acts on the space of principal connections and on the space of linear connections defined on the associated vector bundles. This paper aims to present the {\it non--commutative geometrical} counterpart of all of these {\it classical} facts in the theory of quantum bundles and quantum connections.</description>

      <title>Genus-zero Permutation-twisted Conformal Blocks for Tensor Product Vertex Operator Algebras: The Tensor-factorizable Case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2111.04662v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a vertex operator algebra $V$, we construct an explicit isomorphism between the space of genus-0 conformal blocks associated to permutation-twisted $V^{\otimes n}$-modules and the space of conformal blocks associated to untwisted $V$-modules and a branched covering C of the Riemann sphere. As a consequence, when V is CFT-type, rational, and C2 cofinite, the fusion rules for permutation-twisted modules are determined. We also relate the sewing and factorization of permutation-twisted $V^{\otimes n}$-conformal blocks and untwisted $V$-conformal blocks. Various applications are discussed.
  Note the differences in theorem and equation numbering between the arXiv version and the published version. Some terminology also varies: See Def. 2.2.1 (Def. 2.20 of the published version) for a slight difference in the meanings of $\mathbb U$. The term "Analytic Jacobi identity" in the arXiv version is called the "duality property" in the published version.</description>

      <title>Loewner traces driven by Levy processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Loewner chains with Levy drivers have been proposed as models for random dendritic growth in two dimensions, and as candidates for finding extremal multifractal spectra in problems in classical function theory. These processes are not scale-invariant in general, but they do enjoy a natural domain Markov property thanks to the stationary independent increments of Levy processes. The associated Loewner hulls feature remarkably intricate topological properties, of which very little is known rigorously.
  We prove that a chordal Loewner chain driven by a Levy process $W$ satisfying mild regularity conditions (including stable processes) is a.s. generated by a cadlag curve. Specifically, if the diffusivity parameter of the driving process $W$ is $\kappa \in [0,8)$, then the jump measure of $W$ is required to be locally (upper) Ahlfors regular near the origin, while if $\kappa &gt; 8$, no constraints are imposed. In particular, we show that the associated Loewner hulls are a.s. locally connected and path-connected. We also show that, the complements of the hulls are a.s. Holder domains when $\kappa \neq 4$ (which is not expected to hold when $\kappa=4$), without any regularity assumptions. The proofs of these results mainly rely on careful derivative estimates for both the forward and backward Loewner maps obtained using delicate but robust enough supermartingale domination arguments. As one cannot control the jump accumulation of general Levy processes, we must circumvent all reasoning that would use continuity. To prove the local connectedness, we use an extension of part of the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz theorem: hulls generated by cadlag curves are locally connected even when jumps would occur at infinite intensity.</description>

      <title>Correlation between residual entropy and spanning tree entropy of ice-type models on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The logarithm of the number of Eulerian orientations, normalised by the number of vertices, is known as the residual entropy in studies of ice-type models on graphs. The spanning tree entropy depends similarly on the number of spanning trees. We demonstrate and investigate a remarkably strong, though non-deterministic, correlation between these two entropies. This leads us to propose a new heuristic estimate for the residual entropy of regular graphs that performs much better than previous heuristics. We also study the expansion properties and residual entropy of random graphs with given degrees.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the compressible Euler equations from the dynamics of interacting Bose gas in the hard-core limit regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of short-range interacting Bose gases with varying degrees of diluteness and interaction strength. By applying a combined mean-field and semiclassical space-time rescaling to the dynamics in both the Gross--Pitaevskii and hard-core limit regimes, we prove that the local one-particle mass, momentum, and energy densities of the many-body system can be quantitatively approximated by solutions to the compressible Euler system in the strong sense, up to the first blow-up time of the fluid description, as the number of particles tends to infinity. In the hard-core limit regime, two novel results are presented. First, we rigorously prove, for the first time, that the internal energy of the fluid takes the form $4\pi \mathfrak{c}_{0}\rho^{2}$ (equivalently, pressure $P=2\pi \mathfrak{c}_{0}\rho^{2}$), arising solely from the kinetic energy density of the many-body system, rather than the interaction energy density, marking a fundamental difference from the Gross--Pitaevskii and other mean-field regimes. Second, the newly discovered coupling constant $\mathfrak{c}_{0}$ is the electrostatic capacity of the interaction potential, corresponding to the scattering length of the hard-core potential. Furthermore, in other limiting regimes, including those beyond the Gross--Pitaevskii regime, we find that the limiting equation is described by an eikonal system, offering a rigorous first-principle justification for using the ``geometric optics approximation'' to describe the dynamics of ultracold Bose gases.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Categorical Construction of Instanton Density in Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since the inception of lattice QCD, a natural definition for the Yang-Mills instanton on lattice has been long sought for. In a recent work, one of authors showed the natural solution has to be organized in terms of bundle gerbes in higher homotopy theory / higher category theory, and introduced the principles for such a categorical construction. To pave the way towards actual numerical implementation in the near future, nonetheless, an explicit construction is necessary. In this paper we provide such an explicit construction for $SU(2)$ gauge theory, with technical aspects inspired by L\"{u}scher's 1982 geometrical construction. We will see how the latter is in a suitable sense a saddle point approximation to the full categorical construction. The generalization to $SU(N)$ will be discussed. The construction also allows for a natural definition of lattice Chern-Simons-Yang-Mills theory in three spacetime dimensions.</description>
