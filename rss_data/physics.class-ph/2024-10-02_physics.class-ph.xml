      <title>Internal acoustic resonances: small scattering center compared with the wavelength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In fields such as acoustics, electromagnetism, and quantum physics, the scattering of waves by localized objects is a fundamental phenomenon. Building on this, the present study investigates the energy distribution within a spherical scattering center during its interaction with an incident acoustic wave. The analysis reveals unexpected resonance effects driven by impedance mismatches between the scattering center and the surrounding ideal fluid. These resonance phenomena occur even when the magnitude order of the incident wavelength is significantly larger compared to the size of the scattering center. Such resonance behavior, observed in the small-particle regime, has potential applications in ultrasound imaging, targeted drug delivery, and metamaterial design.</description>

      <title>Contribution of soundscape appropriateness to soundscape quality assessment in space: a mediating variable affecting acoustic comfort</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Soundscape appropriateness (SA) provides supplemental information on the matching degree between auditory information and the surrounding scene in soundscape perception. This indicator has been integrated into the standard ISO process for collecting soundscape data, forming a component of the sound quality assessment questionnaire. However, its role in soundscape quality assessment has not been fully understood. Herein, we present the findings from soundscape data collected from Beiling Park in Shenyang, China. A method was developed that integrates mediation effect models with multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) models to explore the mediating role of SA in the impact of sound source types on soundscape quality, as well as the spatial heterogeneity of this mediation effect. The results confirm that SA does mediates the influence of sound source types on acoustics comfort (AC). Specifically, natural sounds (indirect effect / total effect = 0.19 / 0.19), traffic sounds (indirect effect / total effect = -0.46 / -0.65), and commercial sounds (indirect effect / total effect = -0.25 / -0.12) impact the perception of AC by either enhancing or reducing SA. Moreover, the relationships among variables depicted in this model demonstrate spatial heterogeneity, demonstrating that in urban open spaces with complex constructures, local spatial models may be needed for soundscape assessment. The research reaffirms the significance of SA in urban open spaces. In terms of practical implications for urban and landscape planners, when sound sources cannot be controlled or altered, coordinating between the sound and the surrounding environment through landscape optimisation could also improve the quality of the soundscape through enhancing SA and help achieve the goal of creating healthy urban open spaces.</description>

      <title>The implications of collisions on the spatial profile of electric potential and the space-charge limited current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The space-charge limited current (SCLC) in a vacuum diode is given by the Child-Langmuir law (CLL), whose electric potential $\varphi(x) = (\it{x/D})^{4/3}$, where x is the spatial coordinate across the gap and D is the gap separation distance. For a collisional diode, SCLC is given by the Mott-Gurney law (MGL) and $\varphi(x) = (x/D)^{3/2}$. This Letter applies a capacitance argument for SCLC and uses the transit time from a recent exact solution for collisional SCLC to show that $\varphi(x) = (x/D)^{\xi}$ for a general collisional gap, where $4/3 \leqslant \xi \leqslant 3/2$. Furthermore, $\xi$ is strictly a function of $\nu T$, where $\nu$ is the collision frequency and T is the electron transit time. Using this definition of $\xi$, we estimate the spatial dependence of the electron velocity and use the capacitance to derive an analytic equation for collisional SCLC that agrees within $\sim5-6\%$ of the exact solution that requires solving parametrically through T. We derive equations in the limits of $\nu \longrightarrow 0$ and $\nu\longrightarrow \infty$ for general $\xi$ that asymptotically recover the CLL as $\nu \longrightarrow 0$ and the MGL as $\nu \longrightarrow \infty$. Matching these limits shows that $\xi \simeq 1.40$ and $V \propto D^2\nu^2$ at the transition from a vacuum to collisional diode for any device condition.</description>

      <title>On Laplace equation solution in orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Orthogonal coordinate systems enable expressing the boundary conditions of differential equations in accord with the physical boundaries of the problem. It can significantly simplify calculations. The orthogonal similar oblate spheroidal (SOS) coordinate system can be particularly useful for a physical processes description inside or in the vicinity of the bodies or particles with the geometry of an oblate spheroid. The interior solution of the Laplace equation in the SOS coordinates was recently found; however, the exterior solution was missing. The exterior solution of the azimuthally symmetric Laplace equation in the SOS coordinates is derived. In the steps leading to this solution, important formulas of the SOS algebra are found. Various forms of the Laplace operator in the SOS coordinates in azimuthally symmetric case are shown. General transformation between two different SOS coordinate systems is derived. It is determined that the SOS harmonics are physically the same as the solid harmonics. Further, a formula expressing any generalized Legendre polynomial as a finite sum of monomials is found. The reported relations have potential application in geophysics, astrophysics, electrostatics and solid state physics (e.g. ferroic inclusions).</description>

      <title>Unusual Properties of Adiabatic Invariance in a Billiard Model Related to the Adiabatic Piston Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07458v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the motion of two massive particles along a straight line. A lighter particle bounces back and forth between a heavier particle and a stationary wall, with all collisions being ideally elastic. It is known that if the lighter particle moves much faster than the heavier one, and the kinetic energies of the particles are of the same order, then the product of the speed of the lighter particle and the distance between the heavier particle and the wall is an adiabatic invariant: its value remains approximately constant over a long period. We show that the value of this adiabatic invariant, calculated at the collisions of the lighter particle with the wall, is a constant of motion (i.e., {an exact adiabatic invariant}). On the other hand, the value of this adiabatic invariant at the collisions between the particles slowly linearly in time decays with each collision.
  The model we consider is a highly simplified version of the classical adiabatic piston problem, where the lighter particle represents a gas particle, and the heavier particle represents the piston.</description>

      <title>Acceleration deforms exponential decays into power laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An exponentially decaying accelerated system looks as if its decay was of a generalized power-law type, provided relativistic time dilation in the detector and retardation of the emitted signal are taken into account. The same mathematical formula is found in generalizations of the Zipf-Mandelbrot law in quantitative linguistics, and in dynamics of re-association of folded proteins.</description>

      <title>Through-Thickness Modelling of Metal Rolling using Multiple-Scale Asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01347v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new semi-analytic model of the metal rolling process is presented and validated against finite element simulations. The model generalises the classical slab method of modelling cold rolling, and for the first time, is able to predict the through-thickness stress and strain oscillations present in long thin roll gaps. The model is based on the asymptotic method of multiple scales, with the systematic assumptions of a long thin roll gap and a comparably small Coulomb friction coefficient. The leading-order solution varies only on a long length scale corresponding to the roll-gap length and matches with slab methods. The next-order correction varies on both this long length scale and a short length scale associated with the workpiece thickness, and reveals rapid stress and strain oscillation both in the rolling direction and through the thickness. For this initial derivation, the model assumes a rigid perfectly-plastic material behaviour. Despite these strong assumptions, this model compares well with finite element simulations that employ more realistic material behaviour (including elasticity and strain hardening). These assumptions facilitate the simplest possible model to provide a foundational understanding of the complex through-thickness behaviour observed in the finite element simulations, while requiring an order of only seconds to compute. Matlab code for evaluating the model is provided in the supplementary material.</description>
