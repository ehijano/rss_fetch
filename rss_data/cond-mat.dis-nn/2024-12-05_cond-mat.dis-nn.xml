      <title>Mapping delocalization of impurity bands across archetypal Mott-Anderson transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tailoring charge transport in solids on demand is the overarching goal of condensed-matter research as it is crucial for electronic applications. Yet, often the proper tuning knob is missing and extrinsic factors such as impurities and disorder impede coherent conduction. Here we control the very buildup of an electronic band from impurity states within the pseudogap of ternary Fe$_{2-x}$V$_{1+x}$Al Heusler compounds via reducing the Fe content. Our density functional theory calculations combined with specific heat and electrical resistivity experiments reveal that, initially, these states are Andersonlocalized at low V concentrations $0 &lt; x &lt; 0.1$. As x increases, we monitor the formation of mobility edges upon the archetypal Mott-Anderson transition and map the increasing bandwidth of conducting states by thermoelectric measurements. Ultimately, delocalization of charge carriers in fully disordered V$_3$Al results in a resistivity exactly at the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit that is perfectly temperature-independent up to 700 K - more constant than constantan.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study of Disordered Noninteracting Chains Coupled to a Local Lindblad Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disorder can prevent many-body quantum systems from reaching thermal equilibrium, leading to a many-body localized phase. Recent works suggest that nonperturbative effects caused by rare regions of low disorder may destabilize the localized phase. However, numerical simulations of interacting systems are generically possible only for small system sizes, where finite-size effects might dominate. Here we perform a numerical investigation of noninteracting disordered spin chains coupled to a local Lindblad bath at the boundary. Our results reveal strong finite-size effects in the Lindbladian gap in both bath-coupled Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e-Harper models, leading to a non-monotonic behavior with the system size. We discuss the relaxation properties of a simple toy model coupled to local Lindblad baths, connecting its features to those of noninteracting localized chains. We comment on the implications of our findings for many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Specific heat at low temperatures in quasiplanar molecular crystals: Where do glassy anomalies in minimally disordered crystals come from?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present low-temperature specific heat (Cp) measurements of a monoclinic P2_{1}/c crystal formed by quasiplanar molecules of tetrachloro-m-xylene. The dynamic disorder frozen at low-temperature of the asymmetric unit (formed by a half molecule) consists of reorientation around a three-fold-like axis perpendicular to the benzene ring. Such a minimal disorder gives rise to typical glassy anomalies, as a linear in contribution in Cp ascribed to two-level systems and a broad maximum around 6.6 K in Cp/T^3 (the boson peak). We discuss these results in the framework of other quasiplanar molecular crystals with different accountable number of in-plane molecular orientations We find that the density of two-level systems does not correlate with the degree of orientational disorder. Rather, it is the molecular asymmetry that seems to play a relevant role in the thermal anomalies. Furthermore, we discuss the suggested correlation between the boson peak and Debye temperatures. We find that a linear correlation between the boson peak and Debye temperatures holds for many -- but not all -- structural glasses and strikingly holds even better for some disordered crystals, including our studied quasiplanar molecular crystals.</description>

      <title>Near-optimal shattering in the Ising pure p-spin and rarity of solutions returned by stable algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in the Ising pure $p$-spin model of spin glasses, shattering takes place at all inverse temperatures $\beta \in (\sqrt{(2 \log p)/p}, \sqrt{2\log 2})$ when $p$ is sufficiently large as a function of $\beta$. Of special interest is the lower boundary of this interval which matches the large $p$ asymptotics of the inverse temperature marking the hypothetical dynamical transition predicted in statistical physics. We show this as a consequence of a `soft' version of the overlap gap property which asserts the existence of a distance gap of points of typical energy from a typical sample from the Gibbs measure. We further show that this latter property implies that stable algorithms seeking to return a point of at least typical energy are confined to an exponentially rare subset of that super-level set, provided that their success probability is not vanishingly small.</description>

      <title>Simplified derivations for high-dimensional convex learning problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical physics provides tools for analyzing high-dimensional problems in machine learning and theoretical neuroscience. These calculations, particularly those using the replica method, often involve lengthy derivations that can obscure physical interpretation. We give concise, non-replica derivations of several key results and highlight their underlying similarities. Specifically, we introduce a cavity approach to analyzing high-dimensional learning problems and apply it to three cases: perceptron classification of points, perceptron classification of manifolds, and kernel ridge regression. These problems share a common structure -- a bipartite system of interacting feature and datum variables -- enabling a unified analysis. For perceptron-capacity problems, we identify a symmetry that allows derivation of correct capacities through a na\"ive method. These results match those obtained through the replica method.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization: A disorder-induced quantum bound state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrons at the Fermi energy lose their ability to propagate to long distances in disordered media when undergoing the Anderson localization transition. We use Green functions in an analytically solvable model to describe the vanishing of diffusion at this transition. We find that the low-energy asymptotics of the electron-hole correlation function undergoes a crossover with a disorder-dependent time scale separating the two regimes. This scale determines how long the propagating particle remains captured within a finite volume. It is critical and diverges at the localization transition. According to our analysis, the diffusionless phase consists of quantum bound states that cannot be described in the space of Bloch waves and with the diffusion equation. We identify the necessary amendments to the existing approaches to reach a consistent microscopic picture of the emergence of Anderson localization.</description>

      <title>Nonlocality of Deep Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the role of global system topology in governing deep thermalization, the relaxation of a local subsystem towards a maximally-entropic, uniform distribution of post-measurement states, upon observing the complementary subsystem in a local basis. Concretely, we focus on a class of (1+1)d systems exhibiting 'maximally-chaotic' dynamics, and consider how the rate of the formation of such a universal wavefunction distribution depends on boundary conditions of the system. We find that deep thermalization is achieved exponentially quickly in the presence of either periodic or open boundary conditions; however, the rate at which this occurs is twice as fast for the former than for the latter. These results are attained analytically using the calculus of integration over unitary groups, and supported by extensive numerical simulations. Our findings highlight the nonlocal nature of deep thermalization, and clearly illustrates that the physics underlying this phenomenon goes beyond that of standard quantum thermalization, which only depends on the net build-up of entanglement between a subsystem and its complement.</description>

      <title>Quantized electrical, thermal, and spin transports of non-Hermitian clean and dirty two-dimensional topological insulators and superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00763v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From lattice-regularized models, devoid of any non-Hermitian (NH) skin effects, here we compute the electrical ($\sigma_{xy}$), thermal ($\kappa_{xy}$), and spin ($\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$) Hall, and the electrical ($G_{xx}$) and thermal ($G^{th}_{xx}$) longitudinal conductivities for appropriate NH planar topological insulators and superconductors related to all five non-trivial Altland-Zirbauer symmetry classes in their Hermitian limits. These models feature real eigenvalues over an extended NH parameter regime, only where the associated topological invariants remain quantized. In this regime, the NH quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators show quantized $\sigma_{xy}$ and $G_{xx}$, respectively, the NH $p+ip$ ($p \pm ip$) pairing shows half-quantized $\kappa_{xy}$ ($G^{th}_{xx}$), while the NH $d+id$ pairing shows quantized $\kappa_{xy}$ and $\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$ in the clean and weak disorder (due to random pointlike charge impurities) regimes. We compute these quantities in experimentally realizable suitable six-terminal setups using the Kwant software package. But, in the strong disorder regime, all these topological responses vanish and with the increasing non-Hermiticity in the system this generic phenomenon occurs at weaker disorder.</description>

      <title>Characterising the slow dynamics of the swap Monte Carlo algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The swap Monte Carlo algorithm introduces non-physical dynamic rules to accelerate the exploration of the configuration space of supercooled liquids. Its success raises deep questions regarding the nature and physical origin of the slow dynamics of dense liquids, and how it is affected by swap moves. We provide a detailed analysis of the slow dynamics generated by the swap Monte Carlo algorithm at very low temperatures in two glass-forming models. We find that the slowing down of the swap dynamics is qualitatively distinct from its local Monte Carlo counterpart, with considerably suppressed dynamic heterogeneity both at single-particle and collective levels. Our results suggest that local kinetic constraints are drastically reduced by swap moves, leading to nearly Gaussian and diffusive dynamics and weakly growing dynamic correlation lengthscales. The comparison between static and dynamic fluctuations shows that swap Monte Carlo is a nearly optimal local equilibrium algorithm, suggesting that further progress should necessarily involve collective or driven algorithms.</description>
