      <title>Pressure-tuning topological phase transitions in Kagome superconductor CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the Kagome metal CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ has exhibited several novel quantum properties similar to CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, such as nontrivial topology, double-dome superconductivity, and flat band features. However, CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ lacks the charge-density wave (CDW) present in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, making the study of its emergence of double-dome superconductivity a focus of research. In this work, we have identified an order parameter, the three-band Z$_2$ topological index, that can describe the superconducting phase diagram of CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ under pressure. Its evolution with pressure follows the expected behavior for superconductivity. Furthermore, the results of the Fermi surface under pressure reveal the potential presence of a Lifshitz transition in the vicinity of the vanishing point of the superconducting temperature change with pressure in CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$. These results indicate that the superconducting behavior of CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ under pressure is caused by changes in the electronic structure leading to alterations in the topological properties, provide new insights and approaches for understanding the superconducting phenomenon in Kagome metals.</description>

      <title>The nontrivial effects of annealing on superconducting properties of Nb single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of annealing on the superconducting properties of niobium single crystals cut from the same master boule was studied by local and global magnetic measurements, as well as scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The formation of large hydride precipitates was observed in unannealed samples. The variation in structural and magnetic properties was studied after annealing under high vacuum at 800 C, 1400 C, and near the melting point of niobium (2477 C) for a few seconds. The initial samples had a high hydrogen content. Polarized optics and magneto-optical studies show that the formation of large niobium hydride precipitates is suppressed already by 800 C annealing. However, the overall superconducting properties in the annealed samples did not improve after annealing, and in fact, worsened. The superconducting transition temperature decreased, the upper critical field increased, and the pinning strength increased. Parallel studies were conducted using STM, where the sample was annealed initially at 400 C, measured, annealed again at 1700 C, and measured again. These studies revealed a ``dirty'' superconducting gap with a significant spatial variation of tunneling conductance after annealing at 400 C. The clean gap was recovered after annealing at 1700 C. It is likely that these results are due to oxygen redistribution near the surface, which is always covered by oxide layers in as-grown crystals. Overall, the results indicate that vacuum annealing at least up to 1400 C, while expected to remove a large amount of hydrogen, introduces additional nanosized defects, perhaps hydride precipitates, that act as efficient pair-breaking and pinning centers.</description>

      <title>Evidence for a finite-momentum Cooper pair in tricolor $d$-wave superconducting superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fermionic superfluidity with a nontrivial Cooper-pairing, beyond the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer state, is a captivating field of study in quantum many-body systems. In particular, the search for superconducting states with finite-momentum pairs has long been a challenge, but establishing its existence has long suffered from the lack of an appropriate probe to reveal its momentum. Recently, it has been proposed that the nonreciprocal {\cred electron} transport is the most {\cred powerful} probe for the finite-momentum pairs, {\cred because it directly couples} to the supercurrents. Here we reveal such a pairing state by the non-reciprocal transport on tricolor superlattices with strong spin-orbit coupling combined with broken inversion-symmetry consisting of atomically thin $d$-wave superconductor CeCoIn$_5$. We find that while the second-harmonic resistance exhibits a distinct dip anomaly at the low-temperature ($T$)/high-magnetic field ($H$) corner in the $HT$-plane for ${\bm H}$ applied to the antinodal direction of the $d$-wave gap, such an anomaly is absent for ${\bm H}$ along the nodal direction. By meticulously isolating extrinsic effects due to vortex dynamics, we reveal the presence of a non-reciprocal response originating from intrinsic superconducting properties characterized by finite-momentum pairs. We attribute the high-field state to the helical superconducting state, wherein the phase of the order parameter is spontaneously spatially modulated.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic-Field-Based Circuit Theory and Charge-Flux-Flow Diagrams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conventional circuit diagrams and graph-based circuit theory are used for the phase-independent circuits such as resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) circuits and semiconductor transistor circuits, rather than the phase-dependent circuits such as Josephson junction circuits and quantum-phase-slip (QPS) junction circuits. in the age of artificial intelligence (AI), we present an electromagnetic-field-based circuit theory to unify the phase-independent and phase-dependent electric circuits. This theory drives two general system models for all electric circuits, and visualizes the dynamics of circuit devices with electric-charge-flow (ECF) diagrams and the magnetic-flux-flow (MFF) diagrams. ECF and MFF diagrams enable electric circuits to be designed and analyzed like the molecules composed of two kinds of atoms; they are promising for the language to train AI-aided electronic-design-automation (EDA) tools.</description>

      <title>Signatures of canted antiferromagnetism in infinite-layer nickelates studied by x-ray magnetic dichroism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an experimental study of the magnetic properties of infinite-layer Nd1-xSrxNiO2 thin films by x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at Ni L3,2 and Nd M5,4 edges. We show that at low temperatures the out-of-plane component of the Ni1+ spin-moment is characterized by a rapid increase for magnetic fields below 1T , followed by a slower linear increase reaching a spin-moment value of 0.25uB/Ni at 9T in the case of superconducting Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2. On the other hand, the Nd M5,4 XMCD shows a clear paramagnetic behaviour, which make both Ni- and Nd-spin-sublattices fully uncorrelated.The magnetic field and temperature dependencies of the Ni L3,2 XMCD data can be explained by assuming an out-of-plane canting of the strongly in-plane anti-ferromagnetic ordered Ni1+ spins. A symmetry lowering of the NiO2 planes observed via four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy, triggering a DMI, can be responsible of the proposed Ni1+ spin-canting at zero-field. The resulting out-of-plane weak-ferromagnetic coupling under magnetic field explains the relatively large spin-moment and its magnetic field and temperature dependence.</description>

      <title>Equal contribution of even and odd frequency pairing to transport across normal metal-superconductor junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05623v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Odd-frequency pairing is an unconventional type of Cooper pairing in superconductors related to the frequency dependence of the corresponding anomalous Green function. We show by a combination of analytical and numerical methods that odd-frequency pairing is ubiquitously present in the current of Andreev-scattered particles across a junction formed by a normal metal (N) and a superconductor (S), even if the superconducting pairing is of conventional $s$-wave, spin singlet type. We carefully analyze the conductance of NS junctions with different pairing symmetries ($s$-wave, $p$-wave, $d$-wave). In all cases, we identify a generic equal balance of even and odd frequency pairing to the contributions related to Andreev reflection. This analysis shows in retrospect that the presence of odd-frequency pairing in electric currents across NS junctions is rather the rule, not the exception. This insight stems from an alternative approach of analyzing the transport problem of hybrid structures. It is based on the Kubo-Greenwood formula with direct access to symmetries of the anomalous Green functions characterizing the superconducting pairing. We expect that our predictions substantially enrich the interpretation of transport data across NS junctions in many material combinations.</description>

      <title>Strong electron-phonon coupling in Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$As$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03649v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The charge density wave (CDW) or nematicity has been found to coexist with superconductivity in many systems. It is thus interesting that the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in the doped BaNi$_2$As$_2$ system can be enhanced up to six times as the CDW or nematicity in the undoped compound is suppressed. Here we show that the transverse acoustic phonons of Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$As$_2$ are strongly damped in a wide doping range and over the whole $Q$ range, which excludes its origin from either CDW or nematicity. The damping of TA phonons can be understood as large electron-phonon coupling and possible strong hybridization between acoustic and optical phonons as shown by the first-principle calculations. The superconductivity can be quantitatively reproduced by the change of electron-phonon coupling constant calculated by the McMillan equation in the BCS framework, which suggests that no quantum fluctuations of any order is needed to promote the superconductivity. On the contrary, the change of $T_c$ in this system should be understood as the six-fold suppression of superconductivity in undoped compounds.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Structural Order in a Hidden Phase of Ruddlesden-Popper Bilayer Nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>

Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate, specifically La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, has generated significant interest in the exploration of high-temperature superconductivity within this material family. In this study, we present the crystallographic and electrical resistivity properties of two distinct Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates: the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (referred to as 2222-phase) and a previously uncharacterized phase, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-phase). The 2222-phase is characterized by a pseudo $F$-centered orthorhombic lattice, featuring bilayer perovskite [LaNiO$_3$] layers interspaced by rock salt [LaO] layers, forming a repeated ...2222... sequence. Intriguingly, the 1313-phase, which displays semiconducting properties, crystallizes in the $Cmmm$ space group and exhibits a pronounced predilection for a $C$-centered orthorhombic lattice. Within this structure, the perovskite [LaNiO$_3$] layers exhibit a distinctive long-range ordered arrangement, alternating between single- and trilayer configurations, resulting in a ...1313... sequence. This report contributes to novel insights into the crystallography and the structure-property relationship of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates, paving the way for further investigations into their unique physical properties.</description>

      <title>NbTi: a nontrivial puzzle for the conventional theory of superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first $ab$-$initio$ study of superconductivity in NbTi, the workhorse for many applications. Despite its apparent simplicity, NbTi turns out to be a major challenge for computational superconductivity. In fact, anharmonic effects are crucial to obtain dynamically stable phonons for the ordered bcc phase, unstable at the harmonic level, and beyond-Morel Anderson effects in the Coulomb interaction reduce the Tc by more than 20%. Lattice disorder causes an additional large discrepancy in $T_c$ compared to experiment. Our results imply that a quantitative description of technologically-relevant superconductors requires methodological developments beyond the current standards.</description>

      <title>Majorana bound state parity exchanges in planar Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.02221v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a scheme to exchange fermion parity between two pairs of Majorana bound states mediated by coupling with a centralized quantum dot. We specifically formulate such a scheme for Majorana bound states nucleated in the Josephson vortices formed in a four-fold crossroads junction of planar topological superconductors in the presence of a perpendicular magnetic field. This platform yields several advantages to the execution of our scheme as compared to similar ideas proposed in wire geometries, including control over the positions of the MBS and hence, a tunable coupling with the quantum dot. We show that moving the MBS along the junctions through voltage pulses can facilitate parity exchange via a two-step process, with intermediate projective measurements of the quantum dot charge. Thus, we formulate a way to achieve single qubit operations for MBS in extended Josephson junctions through projective measurements of quantum dot charge. We also discuss the physical viability of our scheme with a particular focus on changes in quantum dot energy levels as a measurable indicator of the success of the scheme.</description>

      <title>Nature of the mixed-parity pairing of attractive fermions with spin-orbit coupling in optical lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The admixture of spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing states in superconductors can be typically induced by breaking spatial inversion symmetry. Employing the {\it numerically exact} auxiliary-field Quantum Monte Carlo method, we study such mixed-parity pairing phenomena of attractive fermions with Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in two-dimensional optical lattice at finite temperature. We systematically demystify the evolution of the essential pairing structure in both singlet and triplet channels versus the temperature, fermion filling, SOC and interaction strengths, via computing the condensate fraction and pair wave function. Our numerical results reveal that the singlet channel dominates in the fermion pairing and the triplet pairing has relatively small contribution to the superfluidity for physically relevant parameters. In contrast to the singlet channel mainly consisted of the on-site Cooper pairs, the triplet pairing has plentiful patterns in real space with the largest contributions from several nearest neighbors. As the SOC strengh increases, the pairing correlation is firstly enhanced and then suppressed for triplet pairing while it's simply weakened in singlet channel. We have also obtained the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperatures through the finite-size analysis of condensate fraction. Our results can serve as quantitative guide for future optical lattice experiments as well as accurate benchmarks for theories and other numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Pairing dome from an emergent Feshbach resonance in a strongly repulsive bilayer model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13040v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A key to understanding unconventional superconductivity lies in unraveling the pairing mechanism of mobile charge carriers in doped antiferromagnets, yielding an effective attraction between charges even in the presence of strong repulsive Coulomb interactions. Here, we study pairing in a mixed-dimensional (mixD) $t-J$ model, featuring robust binding energies -- despite dominant repulsive interactions -- that are strongly enhanced in the finite doping regime. The single and coupled mixD ladders we study, corresponding to bilayers of width $w\leq 2$, feature a crossover from tightly bound pairs of holes (closed channel) at small repulsion, to more spatially extended, correlated pairs of individual holes (open channel) at large repulsion. We derive an effective model for the latter, in which the attraction is mediated by the closed channel, in analogy to atomic Feshbach resonances. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations we reveal a dome of large binding energies at around $30\%$ doping, accompanied by a change of the Fermi surface volume and a crossover from extended to tightly bound hole pairs. Our work provides a microscopic theory of pairing in the doped mixD system with dominant repulsion, closely related to bilayer, Ni-based superconductors, and our predictions can be tested in state-of-the-art quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Pairing from repulsion in a two-dimensional Fermi gas with soft-core interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17362v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a model many-body system of spinless Fermi gas in two dimensions, where the bare two-body interaction is repulsive and takes the form of a soft-core disk potential. We obtain the zero temperature phase diagram of this model by numerical functional renormalization group (FRG), which retains the effective interaction vertices in all channels to provide a detailed picture of how Cooper pairing emerges under the renormalization flow. The repulsion drives the system to a series of superfluid states with higher angular momentum paring, for example in the $f$- and $h$-wave channels instead of the $p$-wave channel. This is in sharp contrast to the original Kohn-Luttinger mechanism where pairing of very large angular momenta and exponentially small transition temperature was predicted. We trace the stabilization and enhancement of $f$- and $h$-wave pairing back to the momentum dependence of the bare interaction. A perturbative calculation is carried out to show that while the second order Kohn-Luttinger diagrams provide a qualitative understanding of the onsets of the various superfluid phases, they are unable to accurately capture the phase boundaries predicted by FRG. Our findings suggest that tuning the shape of the interaction potential offers a promising route to achieve stronger ``pairing glue" and to realize nontrivial superfluid phases in repulsive Fermi gases beyond the scope of the original Kohn-Luttinger analysis.</description>

Abstract: We construct a model which exhibits resistivity going as a power law in temperature $T$, as $T^\alpha$ down to the lowest temperature. There is no residual resistivity because we assume the absence of disorder and momentum relaxation is due to umklapp scattering. Our model consists of a quantum spin liquid state with spinon Fermi surface and a hole Fermi surface made out of doped holes. The key ingredient is a set of singular $2k_F$ modes living on a ring in momentum space. Depending on parameters, $\alpha$ may be unity (strange metal) or even smaller. The model may be applicable to a doped organic compound, which has been found to exhibit linear T resistivity. We conclude that it is possible to obtain strange metal behavior starting with a model which is not so strange.</description>
