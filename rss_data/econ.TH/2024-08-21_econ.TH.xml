      <title>Establishing incorruptible institutions by social contract and taxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indirect reciprocity is a plausible mechanism for sustaining cooperation: people cooperate with those who have a good reputation, which can be acquired by helping others. However, this mechanism requires the population to agree on who has good or bad moral standing. Consensus can be provided by a central institution that monitors and broadcasts reputations. But how might such an institution be maintained, and how can a population ensure that it is effective and incorruptible? Here we explore a simple mechanism to sustain an institution of reputational judgment: a compulsory contribution from each member of the population, i.e., a tax. We analyze the maximum possible tax rate that individuals will rationally pay to sustain an institution of judgment, which provides a public good in the form of information, and we derive necessary conditions for individuals to resist the temptation to evade their tax payment. We also consider the possibility that institution members may be corrupt and subject to bribery, and we analyze how often an institution must be audited to prevent bribery. Our analysis has implications for the establishment of robust public institutions that provide social information to support cooperation in large populations -- and the potential negative consequences associated with wealth or income inequality.</description>

      <title>Swim till You Sink: Computing the Limit of a Game</title>

Abstract: During 2023, two interesting results were proven about the limit behavior of game dynamics: First, it was shown that there is a game for which no dynamics converges to the Nash equilibria. Second, it was shown that the sink equilibria of a game adequately capture the limit behavior of natural game dynamics. These two results have created a need and opportunity to articulate a principled computational theory of the meaning of the game that is based on game dynamics. Given any game in normal form, and any prior distribution of play, we study the problem of computing the asymptotic behavior of a class of natural dynamics called the noisy replicator dynamics as a limit distribution over the sink equilibria of the game. When the prior distribution has pure strategy support, we prove this distribution can be computed efficiently, in near-linear time to the size of the best-response graph. When the distribution can be sampled -- for example, if it is the uniform distribution over all mixed strategy profiles -- we show through experiments that the limit distribution of reasonably large games can be estimated quite accurately through sampling and simulation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Guarantees for Online Selection Over Time</title>

Abstract: Prophet inequalities are a cornerstone in optimal stopping and online decision-making. Traditionally, they involve the sequential observation of $n$ non-negative independent random variables and face irrevocable accept-or-reject choices. The goal is to provide policies that provide a good approximation ratio against the optimal offline solution that can access all the values upfront -- the so-called prophet value. In the prophet inequality over time problem (POT), the decision-maker can commit to an accepted value for $\tau$ units of time, during which no new values can be accepted. This creates a trade-off between the duration of commitment and the opportunity to capture potentially higher future values.
  In this work, we provide best possible worst-case approximation ratios in the IID setting of POT for single-threshold algorithms and the optimal dynamic programming policy. We show a single-threshold algorithm that achieves an approximation ratio of $(1+e^{-2})/2\approx 0.567$, and we prove that no single-threshold algorithm can surpass this guarantee. With our techniques, we can analyze simple algorithms using $k$ thresholds and show that with $k=3$ it is possible to get an approximation ratio larger than $\approx 0.602$. Then, for each $n$, we prove it is possible to compute the tight worst-case approximation ratio of the optimal dynamic programming policy for instances with $n$ values by solving a convex optimization program. A limit analysis of the first-order optimality conditions yields a nonlinear differential equation showing that the optimal dynamic programming policy's asymptotic worst-case approximation ratio is $\approx 0.618$. Finally, we extend the discussion to adversarial settings and show an optimal worst-case approximation ratio of $\approx 0.162$ when the values are streamed in random order.</description>

      <title>Verifying Approximate Equilibrium in Auctions</title>

Abstract: In practice, most auction mechanisms are not strategy-proof, so equilibrium analysis is required to predict bidding behavior. In many auctions, though, an exact equilibrium is not known and one would like to understand whether -- manually or computationally generated -- bidding strategies constitute an approximate equilibrium. We develop a framework and methods for estimating the distance of a strategy profile from equilibrium, based on samples from the prior and either bidding strategies or sample bids. We estimate an agent's utility gain from deviating to strategies from a constructed finite subset of the strategy space. We use PAC-learning to give error bounds, both for independent and interdependent prior distributions. The primary challenge is that one may miss large utility gains by considering only a finite subset of the strategy space. Our work differs from prior research in two critical ways. First, we explore the impact of bidding strategies on altering opponents' perceived prior distributions -- instead of assuming the other agents to bid truthfully. Second, we delve into reasoning with interdependent priors, where the type of one agent may imply a distinct distribution for other agents. Our main contribution lies in establishing sufficient conditions for strategy profiles and a closeness criterion for conditional distributions to ensure that utility gains estimated through our finite subset closely approximate the maximum gains. To our knowledge, ours is the first method to verify approximate equilibrium in any auctions beyond single-item ones. Also, ours is the first sample-based method for approximate equilibrium verification.</description>

      <title>$\alpha$-Rank-Collections: Analyzing Expected Strategic Behavior with Uncertain Utilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10317v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Game theory relies heavily on the availability of cardinal utility functions, but in fields such as matching markets, only ordinal preferences are typically elicited. The literature focuses on mechanisms with simple dominant strategies, but many real-world applications lack dominant strategies, making the intensity of preferences between outcomes important for determining strategies. Even though precise information about cardinal utilities is not available, some data about the likelihood of utility functions is often accessible. We propose to use Bayesian games to formalize uncertainty about the decision-makers' utilities by viewing them as a collection of normal-form games. Instead of searching for the Bayes-Nash equilibrium, we study how uncertainty in utilities is reflected in uncertainty of strategic play. To do this, we introduce a novel solution concept called $\alpha$-Rank-collections, which extends $\alpha$-Rank to Bayesian games. This allows us to analyze strategic play in, for example, non-strategyproof matching markets, for which appropriate solution concepts are currently lacking. $\alpha$-Rank-collections characterize the expected probability of encountering a certain strategy profile under replicator dynamics in the long run, rather than predicting a specific equilibrium strategy profile. We experimentally evaluate $\alpha$-Rank-collections using instances of the Boston mechanism, finding that our solution concept provides more nuanced predictions compared to Bayes-Nash equilibria. Additionally, we prove that $\alpha$-Rank-collections are invariant to positive affine transformations, a standard property for a solution concept, and are efficient to approximate.</description>
