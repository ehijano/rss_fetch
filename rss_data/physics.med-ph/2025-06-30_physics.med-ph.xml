      <title>Transcutaneous Interference Spinal Cord Stimulation: Leadfield-Based Pareto Optimization of Electrode Montages for Improved Focality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: This study investigates the feasibility of transcutaneous interferential spinal cord stimulation (tISCS), a novel non-invasive neuromodulation method, using temporal interference to enhance focality and comfort in spinal cord stimulation. The central research question is whether tISCS can achieve targeted activation of spinal cord circuits while reducing unwanted stimulation of skin and muscle tissues, which are common limitations of conventional transcutaneous spinal cord stimulation (tSCS). Methods: A finite element model of the lower thorax was developed to simulate electric field distributions for various skin electrode montages. To address the computational bottleneck associated with high-resolution modeling and montage optimization, we implemented a leadfield-based Pareto optimization strategy to identify the electrode configuration that maximizes the electric field in the spinal cord and minimizes it in off-target tissues. tISCS montages were compared with tSCS montages in terms of focality and stimulation efficiency. Results: Optimized tISCS configurations significantly reduced electric field intensity in the skin by over 20-fold compared to tSCS. The ratio of spinal cord to skin electric fields increased by at least 10-fold, indicating enhanced focality. The injection current efficiency in tISCS can be leveraged to increase spinal cord electric fields by at least 5-fold while keeping skin exposure below the levels observed with tSCS. Conclusion: tISCS enables deeper and more selective spinal cord stimulation compared to tSCS, with substantially reduced off-target effects. This is the first computational demonstration of tISCS feasibility. Leadfield-guided Pareto optimization enables efficient montage selection, providing a foundation for future experimental applications.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based digital twinning of activation and repolarisation sequences from the ECG across healthy and diseased hearts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abnormal patterns of ventricular repolarisation contribute to lethal arrhythmias in various cardiac conditions, including inherited and acquired channelopathies, cardiomyopathies, and ischaemic heart disease. However, methods to detect these repolarisation abnormalities are limited.
  In this study, we introduce and assess a novel simulation-based method to infer ventricular activation and repolarisation times from the 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and magnetic resonance-derived ventricular anatomical reconstruction, applicable for the first time to both healthy controls and cases with abnormal repolarisation.
  First, ventricular activation times were reconstructed through iterative refinement of early activation sites and conduction velocities, until the model and target QRS complexes matched. Then, ventricular repolarisation times were reconstructed through iterative refinement of ventricular action potential durations and an action potential shape parameter until the model and target T waves matched, including regularisation. Repolarisation inference was evaluated against 18 benchmark simulations with known repolarisation times, including both control and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) cases with abnormal repolarisation.
  Inferred repolarisation times showed good agreement with the ground truth in control and HCM (Spearman r=0.63+/-0.11 and 0.65+/-0.19, respectively), with inferred model T waves closely matching the target T waves (r=0.81+/-0.05 and 0.78+/-0.08, respectively). The method further demonstrated flexibility in reconstructing the macroscopic patterns of delayed repolarisation across a range of abnormal ventricular repolarisation sequences, demonstrating applicability to a range of pathological cases.
  Simulation-based inference can accurately reconstruct repolarisation times from the 12-lead ECG in cases with both normal and abnormal repolarisation patterns.</description>

      <title>Derivation of Tissue Properties from Basis-Vector Model Weights for Dual-Energy CT-Based Monte Carlo Proton Beam Dose Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method, basis vector model material indexing (BVM-MI), for predicting atomic composition and mass density from two independent basis vector model weights derived from dual-energy CT (DECT) for Monte Carlo (MC) dose planning. BVM-MI employs multiple linear regression on BVM weights and their quotient to predict elemental composition and mass density for 70 representative tissues. Predicted values were imported into the TOPAS MC code to simulate proton dose deposition to a uniform cylinder phantom composed of each tissue type. The performance of BVM-MI was compared to the conventional Hounsfield Unit material indexing method (HU-MI), which estimates elemental composition and density based on CT numbers (HU). Evaluation metrics included absolute errors in predicted elemental compositions and relative percent errors in calculated mass density and mean excitation energy. Dose distributions were assessed by quantifying absolute error in the depth of 80% maximum scored dose (R80) and relative percent errors in stopping power (SP) between MC simulations using HU-MI, BVM-MI, and benchmark compositions. Lateral dose profiles were analyzed at R80 and Bragg Peak (RBP) depths for three tissues showing the largest discrepancies in R80 depth. BVM-MI outperformed HU-MI in elemental composition predictions, with mean RMSEs of 1.30% (soft tissue) and 0.1% (bony tissue), compared to 4.20% and 1.9% for HU-MI. R80 depth RMSEs were 0.2 mm (soft) and 0.1 mm (bony) for BVM-MI, vs. 1.8 mm and 0.7 mm for HU-MI. Lateral dose profile analysis showed overall smaller dose errors for BVM-MI across core, halo, and proximal aura regions. In conclusion, fully utilizing the two-parameter BVM space for material indexing led to significantly improved TOPAS MC dose calculations over the conventional HU-MI method, demonstrating BVM-MI's potential to enhance proton therapy planning.</description>

      <title>Characterization Of Diseases In Temporal Comorbidity Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comorbidity networks, which capture disease-disease co-occurrence usually based on electronic health records, reveal structured patterns in how diseases cluster and progress across individuals. However, how these networks evolve across different age groups and how this evolution relates to properties like disease prevalence and mortality remains understudied. To address these issues, we used publicly available comorbidity networks extracted from a comprehensive dataset of 45 million Austrian hospital stays from 1997 to 2014, covering 8.9 million patients. These networks grow and become denser with age. We identified groups of diseases that exhibit similar patterns of structural centrality throughout the lifespan, revealing three dominant age-related components with peaks in early childhood, midlife, and late life. To uncover the drivers of this structural change, we examined the relationship between prevalence and degree. This allowed us to identify conditions that were disproportionately connected to other diseases. Using betweenness centrality in combination with mortality data, we further identified high-mortality bridging diseases. Several diseases show high connectivity relative to their prevalence, such as iron deficiency anemia (D50) in children, nicotine dependence (F17), and lipoprotein metabolism disorders (E78) in adults. We also highlight structurally central diseases with high mortality that emerge at different life stages, including cancers (C group), liver cirrhosis (K74), subarachnoid hemorrhage (I60), and chronic kidney disease (N18). These findings underscore the importance of targeting age-specific, network-central conditions with high mortality for prevention and integrated care.</description>

      <title>An analytical model for gold nanoparticle radiosensitisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06671v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a variance-driven Local-Effect-Model ($\sigma$-LEM) to predict radiosensitization due to gold nanoparticles (AuNP). Assuming that the number of Au photo-ionisations scales strictly with particle volume $V_{\mathrm{NP}}\propto R^{3}$, a linear relation between dose-enhancement ratio and concentration is achieved ($DER = 1 + K_c,c$), in which $K_c$ is a beam-quality and nucleus-size-specific term, and $c$ is the concentration in mM. Furthermore, assuming that the cascade energy deposition is log-normally distributed, the enhanced dose in each target voxel can be written as $D_{\text{enh}} = D_{0}\exp(\sigma Z)$ with $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and width $\sigma = \sqrt{2\ln(1+Kc)}$.
  Assuming a linear-quadratic (LQ) dose response, a relation between cell survival and dose can be derived. Despite no closed form for the log-normal distribution, averaging over the entire domain using first- and second-order moments leads to three possible closed forms: variance-only, mixed-term, and second-order. These three variants adapt well to low-concentration, mid-concentration, and high-concentration regimes.
  The model was tested for Bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) results taken from a Local Effect Model (LEM) and experimental values. The model agrees within $\le 2.5%$ with the experimental and LEM data, but presents significant changes to the conceptual results obtained with the LEM, in particular indicating that AuNP dose enhancement is mostly $\alpha$-driven, as posited previously by other authors. These findings are further developed in the manuscript.
  The theoretical framework presented here collapses radiobiological outcomes to three experimentally controllable variables -- beam quality, nucleus size, and intracellular concentration $c$ -- while retaining mechanistic fidelity. Additional tests should be made to further confirm the validity of the model.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of Coincidence Time Resolution in a liquid xenon detector with silicon photomultipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores the combination of liquid xenon as a scintillating medium and silicon photomultipliers as a readout in Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for enhanced Time-Of-Flight resolution. We present the results of our first prototype optimized to maximize light collection using high-PDE, VUV-sensitive sensors and to minimize time fluctuations. We report a coincidence time resolution of 281 $\pm$ 2 ps FWHM, obtained using a $^{22}$Na calibration source. This result is competitive with the current state-of-the-art PET scanners and represents a significant step forward in the development of liquid xenon as a viable alternative to conventional scintillators in PET technology.</description>
