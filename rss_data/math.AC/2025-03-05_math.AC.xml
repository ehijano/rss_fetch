      <title>The Likelihood Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An arrangement of hypersurfaces in projective space is SNC if and only if its Euler discriminant is nonzero. We study the critical loci of all Laurent monomials in the equations of the smooth hypersurfaces. These loci form an irreducible variety in the product of two projective spaces, known in algebraic statistics as the likelihood correspondence and in particle physics as the scattering correspondence. We establish an explicit determinantal representation for the bihomogeneous prime ideal of this variety.</description>

      <title>Generic Local Duality and Purity Exponents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a form of generic local duality that generalizes a result of Karen E. Smith. Specifically, let $R$ be a Noetherian ring, let $P$ be a prime ideal of $R$ of height $h$, let $A:=R/P$, and $W$ be a subset of $R$ that maps onto $A\setminus \{0\}$. Suppose that $R_P$ is Cohen-Macaulay, and that $\omega$ is a finitely generated $R$-module such that $\omega_P$ is a canonical module for $R_P$. Let $E:=H^h_P(\omega)$. We show that for every finitely generated $R$-module $M$ there exists $g \in W$ such that for all $j\geq 0$, $H_P^j(M)_g \cong \mathrm{Hom}_R(\mathrm{Ext}_R^{h-j}(M,\, \omega),\, E)_g$, and that, moreover, every $H_P^j(M)_g$ has an ascending filtration by a countable sequence of finitely generated submodules such that the factors are finitely generated free $A_g$-modules. In fact, this sequence may be taken to be $\{\mathrm{Ann}_{H_P^j(M)_g}P^n\}_n$. We use this result to study the purity exponent for a nonzerodivisor $c$ in a reduced excellent Noetherian ring $R$ of prime characteristic $p$, which is the least $e \in \mathbb{N}$ such that the map $R \to R^{1/p^e}$ with $1 \mapsto c^{1/p^e}$ is pure. In particular, in the case where $R$ is a homomorphic image of an excellent Cohen-Macaulay ring and is S$_2$, we establish an upper semicontinuity result for the function $\mathfrak{e}_c:\mathrm{Spec}(R) \to \mathbb{N}$, where $\mathfrak{e}_c(P)$ is the purity exponent for the image of $c$ in $R_P$. This result enables us to prove that excellent strongly F-regular rings are very strongly F-regular (also called F-pure regular). Another consequence is that the F-pure locus is open in an S$_2$ ring that is a homomorphic image of an excellent Cohen-Macxaulay ring.</description>

      <title>Betti numbers of normal edge rings (\bf{I})</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10672v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of square-free Gr{\"o}bner degenerations conducted by Conca and Varbaro in their 2020 paper \cite{CV}, we embark on an investigation of Betti numbers of toric ideals associated with normal edge rings by introducing a novel method. We utilize this method to prove that, for two classes of graphs satisfying the odd-cycle condition, all the Betti numbers (not merely the extremal ones) of the toric ideals of their edge rings, as well as those of certain square-free initial ideals derived from these toric ideals, are identical. As a result, we can completely determine their multi-graded Betti numbers. These classes consist of compact graphs, i.e., the graphs devoid of even cycles and satisfying the odd-cycle condition, and the graphs -- as introduced in \cite{HHKO} -- that possess both even and odd cycles. We speculate this method can be applicable to every normal edge ring.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional module factorizations and complete intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07483v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce higher-dimensional module factorizations associated to a regular sequence. They include higher-dimensional matrix factorizations, which are commutative cubes consisting of free modules with edges being classical matrix factorizations. We characterize the stable category of maximal Cohen-Macaulay modules over a complete intersection via higher-dimensional matrix factorizations over the corresponding regular local ring. The result generalizes to noncommutative rings, including quantum complete intersections.</description>
