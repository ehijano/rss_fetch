      <title>Part 1: Disruption of Water-Carbon Cycle under Wet Climate Extremes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern climate change presents unprecedented challenges, posing critical crises that threaten sustainable development, human well-being, and planetary health. A significant concern is the potential for global warming to cause irreversible disruptions to the water-carbon cycle, a topic that remains underexplored. This study seeks to address a crucial knowledge gap by examining how increasing wet extremes impact ecosystem productivity. The research agenda focuses on three primary questions: 1) How do the intensity and duration of various wet extremes affect evapotranspiration across different watersheds and terrestrial biomes? 2) How do immediate and lagged responses to wet extremes vary across different biomes, and what insights do these temporal patterns provide about the causal and predictive relationships between wet extreme and evapotranspiration? 3) To what extent do watershed characteristics (such as soil properties, hydrological conditions, and vegetation factors) modulate the relationship between wet extremes and ecosystem productivity? As climate change alters precipitation patterns, understanding these complex ecosystem responses becomes crucial for developing adaptive strategies and improving food and water resource management.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal imaging of rock fractures by incorporating single borehole radar and optical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single borehole radar detection suffers from azimuthal ambiguity, while borehole optical tests only provide information about the borehole wall. These limitations prevent either detection method from revealing the complete spatial patterns of rock fractures on their own. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing a joint imaging method that combines the advantages of both borehole detection methods. Geological azimuthal parameters are extracted from optical images by fitting the fracture curves to sinusoidal functions. A 2D Kirchhoff time migration is then implemented using radar common offset gather. Up-dip and down-dip events are separated by the f-k transform or z-s transform, depending on their geometric relation. The complete fracture planes, including trend, dip angle, gap width, and extension length, are finally reconstructed in 3D space by mapping the migration profile using azimuthal information from optical images. The method is proven reliable and high-resolution through both numerical tests and real field data.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Forward and Inverse Problems in Subsurface Imaging using Latent Space Translations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In subsurface imaging, learning the mapping from velocity maps to seismic waveforms (forward problem) and waveforms to velocity (inverse problem) is important for several applications. While traditional techniques for solving forward and inverse problems are computationally prohibitive, there is a growing interest in leveraging recent advances in deep learning to learn the mapping between velocity maps and seismic waveform images directly from data. Despite the variety of architectures explored in previous works, several open questions still remain unanswered such as the effect of latent space sizes, the importance of manifold learning, the complexity of translation models, and the value of jointly solving forward and inverse problems. We propose a unified framework to systematically characterize prior research in this area termed the Generalized Forward-Inverse (GFI) framework, building on the assumption of manifolds and latent space translations. We show that GFI encompasses previous works in deep learning for subsurface imaging, which can be viewed as specific instantiations of GFI. We also propose two new model architectures within the framework of GFI: Latent U-Net and Invertible X-Net, leveraging the power of U-Nets for domain translation and the ability of IU-Nets to simultaneously learn forward and inverse translations, respectively. We show that our proposed models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance for forward and inverse problems on a wide range of synthetic datasets, and also investigate their zero-shot effectiveness on two real-world-like datasets.</description>

      <title>Latent diffusion models for parameterization and data assimilation of facies-based geomodels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14815v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Geological parameterization entails the representation of a geomodel using a small set of latent variables and a mapping from these variables to grid-block properties such as porosity and permeability. Parameterization is useful for data assimilation (history matching), as it maintains geological realism while reducing the number of variables to be determined. Diffusion models are a new class of generative deep-learning procedures that have been shown to outperform previous methods, such as generative adversarial networks, for image generation tasks. Diffusion models are trained to "denoise", which enables them to generate new geological realizations from input fields characterized by random noise. Latent diffusion models, which are the specific variant considered in this study, provide dimension reduction through use of a low-dimensional latent variable. The model developed in this work includes a variational autoencoder for dimension reduction and a U-net for the denoising process. Our application involves conditional 2D three-facies (channel-levee-mud) systems. The latent diffusion model is shown to provide realizations that are visually consistent with samples from geomodeling software. Quantitative metrics involving spatial and flow-response statistics are evaluated, and general agreement between the diffusion-generated models and reference realizations is observed. Stability tests are performed to assess the smoothness of the parameterization method. The latent diffusion model is then used for ensemble-based data assimilation. Two synthetic "true" models are considered. Significant uncertainty reduction, posterior P$_{10}$-P$_{90}$ forecasts that generally bracket observed data, and consistent posterior geomodels, are achieved in both cases.</description>

      <title>Analysis and Optimization of Seismic Monitoring Networks with Bayesian Optimal Experiment Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07215v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Monitoring networks increasingly aim to assimilate data from a large number of diverse sensors covering many sensing modalities. Bayesian optimal experimental design (OED) seeks to identify data, sensor configurations, or experiments which can optimally reduce uncertainty and hence increase the performance of a monitoring network. Information theory guides OED by formulating the choice of experiment or sensor placement as an optimization problem that maximizes the expected information gain (EIG) about quantities of interest given prior knowledge and models of expected observation data. Therefore, within the context of seismo-acoustic monitoring, we can use Bayesian OED to configure sensor networks by choosing sensor locations, types, and fidelity in order to improve our ability to identify and locate seismic sources. In this work, we develop the framework necessary to use Bayesian OED to optimize a sensor network's ability to locate seismic events from arrival time data of detected seismic phases at the regional-scale. Bayesian OED requires four elements:
  1) A likelihood function that describes the distribution of detection and travel time data from the sensor network,
  2) A Bayesian solver that uses a prior and likelihood to identify the posterior distribution of seismic events given the data,
  3) An algorithm to compute EIG about seismic events over a dataset of hypothetical prior events,
  4) An optimizer that finds a sensor network which maximizes EIG.
  Once we have developed this framework, we explore many relevant questions to monitoring such as: how to trade off sensor fidelity and earth model uncertainty; how sensor types, number, and locations influence uncertainty; and how prior models and constraints influence sensor placement.</description>
