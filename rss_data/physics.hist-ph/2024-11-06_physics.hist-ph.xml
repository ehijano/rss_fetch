      <title>A Bayesian Model of Credence in Low Energy Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We carry out a quantitative Bayesian analysis of the evolution of credences in low energy supersymmetry (SUSY) in light of the most relevant empirical data. The analysis is based on the assumption that observers apply principles of optimism or pessimism about theory building in a coherent way. On this basis, we provide a rough assessment of the current range of plausible credences in low energy SUSY and determine in which way LHC data changes those credences. For observers who had been optimistic about low energy SUSY before the LHC, the method reports that LHC data does lead to decreased credences in accordance with intuition. The decrease is moderate, however, and keeps posteriors at very substantial levels. The analysis further establishes that a very high but not yet indefensible degree of pessimism regarding the success chances of theory building still results in quite significant credences in GUT and low energy SUSY for the time right before the start of the LHC. The pessimist's credence in low energy SUSY remains nearly unchanged once LHC data is taken into account.</description>

      <title>Generally covariant evolution equations from a cognitive treatment of time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The treatment of time in relativity does not conform to that in quantum theory. To resolve the discrepancy, a formalization of time is introduced in an accompanying paper, starting from the assumption that the treatment of time in physics must agree with our cognition. The formalization has two components: sequential time $n$ and relational time $t$. The evolution of physical states is described in terms of $n$. The role of $t$ is to quantify distances between events in space-time. There is a space-time associated with each $n$, in which $t$ represents the knowledge at time $n$ about temporal distances between present and past events. This approach leads to quantum evolution equations expressed in terms of a continuous evolution parameter $\sigma$, which interpolates between discrete sequential times $n$. Rather than describing the evolution of the world at large, these evolution equations provide probabilites of a set of predefined outcomes in well-defined experimental contexts. When the context is designed to measure spatio-temporal position $(x,t)$, time $t$ becomes an observable with Heisenberg uncertainty $\Delta t$ on the same footing as $x$. The corresponding evolution equation attains the same symmetric form as that suggested by Stueckelberg in 1941. When the context is such that the metric of space-time is measured, the corresponding evolution equation may be seen as an expression of quantum gravity. In short, the aim of this paper is to propose a coherent conceptual basis for the treatment of time in evolution equations, in so doing clarifying their meaning and domain of validity.</description>
