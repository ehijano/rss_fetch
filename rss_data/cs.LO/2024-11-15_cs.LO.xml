      <title>AutoQ 2.0: From Verification of Quantum Circuits to Verification of Quantum Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a verifier of quantum programs called AutoQ 2.0. Quantum programs extend quantum circuits (the domain of AutoQ 1.0) by classical control flow constructs, which enable users to describe advanced quantum algorithms in a formal and precise manner. The extension is highly non-trivial, as we needed to tackle both theoretical challenges (such as the treatment of measurement, the normalization problem, and lifting techniques for verification of classical programs with loops to the quantum world), and engineering issues (such as extending the input format with a~support for specifying loop invariants). We have successfully used AutoQ 2.0 to verify two types of advanced quantum programs that cannot be expressed using only quantum circuits: the \emph{repeat-until-success} (RUS) algorithm and the weak-measurement-based version of Grover's search algorithm. AutoQ 2.0 can efficiently verify all our benchmarks: all RUS algorithms were verified instantly and, for the weak-measurement-based version of Grover's search, we were able to handle the case of 100 qubits in $\sim$20 minutes.</description>

      <title>LTLf+ and PPLTL+: Extending LTLf and PPLTL to Infinite Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce LTLf+ and PPLTL+, two logics to express properties of infinite traces, that are based on the linear-time temporal logics LTLf and PPLTL on finite traces. LTLf+/PPLTL+ use levels of Manna and Pnueli's LTL safety-progress hierarchy, and thus have the same expressive power as LTL. However, they also retain a crucial characteristic of the reactive synthesis problem for the base logics: the game arena for strategy extraction can be derived from deterministic finite automata (DFA). Consequently, these logics circumvent the notorious difficulties associated with determinizing infinite trace automata, typical of LTL reactive synthesis. We present DFA-based synthesis techniques for LTLf+/PPLTL+, and show that synthesis is 2EXPTIME-complete for LTLf+ (matching LTLf) and EXPTIME-complete for PPLTL+ (matching PPLTL). Notably, while PPLTL+ retains the full expressive power of LTL, reactive synthesis is EXPTIME-complete instead of 2EXPTIME-complete. The techniques are also adapted to optimally solve satisfiability, validity, and model-checking, to get EXPSPACE-complete for LTLf+ (extending a recent result for the guarantee level using LTLf), and PSPACE-complete for PPLTL+.</description>

      <title>Positive Focusing is Directly Useful</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Miller and Wu introduced the positive $\lambda$-calculus, a call-by-value $\lambda$-calculus with sharing obtained by assigning proof terms to the positively polarized focused proofs for minimal intuitionistic logic. The positive $\lambda$-calculus stands out among $\lambda$-calculi with sharing for a compactness property related to the sharing of variables. We show that -- thanks to compactness -- the positive calculus neatly captures the core of useful sharing, a technique for the study of reasonable time cost models.</description>

      <title>The Denotational Semantics of SSA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Static single assignment form, or SSA, has been the dominant compiler intermediate representation for decades. In this paper, we give a type theory for a variant of SSA, including its equational theory, which are strong enough to validate a variety of control and data flow transformations. We also give a categorical semantics for SSA, and show that the type theory is sound and complete with respect to the categorical axiomatization. We demonstrate the utility of our model by exhibiting a variety of concrete models satisfying our axioms, including in particular a model of TSO weak memory. The correctness of the syntactic metatheory, as well as the completeness proof has been mechanized in the Lean proof assistant.</description>

      <title>Minimalistic System Modelling: Behaviours, Interfaces, and Local Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16109v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The infrastructure upon which the functioning of society depends is composed of complex ecosystems of systems. Consequently, we must reason about the properties of such ecosystems, which requires that we construct models of them. There are very many approaches to systems modelling, typically building on complex structural and dynamic frameworks. Our purpose here is to explore a modelling framework based on minimal assumptions, starting from a primitive notion of behaviour, and to show that such an approach allows the recovery of the key ideas, including a generalized CAP theorem, required for effective modelling of and reasoning about ecosystems of systems. We establish a logic of behaviours and use it to express local reasoning principles for the compositional structure of systems.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Kripke Semantics II: Stability and Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the duality between Kripke and algebraic semantics of intuitionistic and intuitionistic modal logic. We find that there is a certain mismatch between the two semantics, which means that not all algebraic models can be embedded into a Kripke model. This leads to an alternative proposal for a relational semantics, the stable semantics. Instead of an arbitrary partial order, the stable semantics requires a distributive lattice of worlds. We constructively show that the stable semantics is exactly as complete as the algebraic semantics. Categorifying these results leads to a 2-duality between two-dimensional stable semantics and categories of product-preserving presheaves, i.e. models of algebraic theories in the style of Lawvere.</description>

      <title>Lifted Inference beyond First-Order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.11738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Weighted First Order Model Counting (WFOMC) is fundamental to probabilistic inference in statistical relational learning models. As WFOMC is known to be intractable in general ($\#$P-complete), logical fragments that admit polynomial time WFOMC are of significant interest. Such fragments are called domain liftable. Recent works have shown that the two-variable fragment of first order logic extended with counting quantifiers ($\mathrm{C^2}$) is domain-liftable. However, many properties of real-world data, like acyclicity in citation networks and connectivity in social networks, cannot be modeled in $\mathrm{C^2}$, or first order logic in general. In this work, we expand the domain liftability of $\mathrm{C^2}$ with multiple such properties. We show that any $\mathrm{C^2}$ sentence remains domain liftable when one of its relations is restricted to represent a directed acyclic graph, a connected graph, a tree (resp. a directed tree) or a forest (resp. a directed forest). All our results rely on a novel and general methodology of "counting by splitting". Besides their application to probabilistic inference, our results provide a general framework for counting combinatorial structures. We expand a vast array of previous results in discrete mathematics literature on directed acyclic graphs, phylogenetic networks, etc.</description>

      <title>$\Pi_{2}$-Rule Systems and Inductive Classes of G\"{o}del Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07189v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a general theory of $\Pi_{2}$-rules for systems of intuitionistic and modal logic. We introduce the notions of $\Pi_{2}$-rule system and of an Inductive Class, and provide model-theoretic and algebraic completeness theorems, which serve as our basic tools. As an illustration of the general theory, we analyse the structure of inductive classes of G\"{o}del algebras, from a structure theoretic and logical point of view. We show that unlike other well-studied settings (such as logics, or single-conclusion rule systems), there are continuum many $\Pi_{2}$-rule systems extending $\mathsf{LC}=\mathsf{IPC}+(p\rightarrow q)\vee (q\rightarrow p)$, and show how our methods allow easy proofs of the admissibility of the well-known Takeuti-Titani rule. Our final results concern general questions admissibility in $\mathsf{LC}$: (1) we present a full classification of those inductive classes which are inductively complete, i.e., where all $\Pi_{2}$-rules which are admissible are derivable, and (2) show that the problem of admissibility of $\Pi_{2}$-rules over $\mathsf{LC}$ is decidable.</description>

      <title>The categorical contours of the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger representation theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop fibrational perspectives on context-free grammars and on nondeterministic finite-state automata over categories and operads. A generalized CFG is a functor from a free colored operad (aka multicategory) generated by a pointed finite species into an arbitrary base operad: this encompasses classical CFGs by taking the base to be a certain operad constructed from a free monoid, as an instance of a more general construction of an \emph{operad of spliced arrows} $\mathcal{W}\,\mathcal{C}$ for any category $\mathcal{C}$. A generalized NFA is a functor from an arbitrary bipointed category or pointed operad satisfying the unique lifting of factorizations and finite fiber properties: this encompasses classical word automata and tree automata without $\epsilon$-transitions, but also automata over non-free categories and operads. We show that generalized context-free and regular languages satisfy suitable generalizations of many of the usual closure properties, and in particular we give a simple conceptual proof that context-free languages are closed under intersection with regular languages. Finally, we observe that the splicing functor $\mathcal{W} : Cat \to Oper$ admits a left adjoint $\mathcal{C}: Oper \to Cat$, which we call the \emph{contour category} construction since the arrows of $\mathcal{C}\,\mathcal{O}$ have a geometric interpretation as oriented contours of operations of $\mathcal{O}$. A direct consequence of the contour / splicing adjunction is that every pointed finite species induces a universal CFG generating a language of \emph{tree contour words.} This leads us to a generalization of the Chomsky-Sch\"utzenberger Representation Theorem, establishing that a subset of a homset $L \subseteq \mathcal{C}(A,B)$ is a CFL of arrows if and only if it is a functorial image of the intersection of a $\mathcal{C}$-chromatic tree contour language with a regular language.</description>
