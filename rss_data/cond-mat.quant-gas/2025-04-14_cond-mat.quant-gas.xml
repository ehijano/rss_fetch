      <title>Tunable Molecular Interactions Near an Atomic Feshbach Resonance: Stability and Collapse of a Molecular Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling interactions of ultracold molecules has been a central goal in quantum chemistry research. Recent experiments on atoms near a Feshbach resonance offer the key to prepare and investigate molecules in the quantum many-body regime. Just as Feshbach resonances allow tuning of the scattering length of bosonic atoms, we show that they also modify the scattering length of Feshbach molecules which are constituted from these atoms. Based on calculations of the compressibility, we determine the stability phase diagrams of molecular condensates and show that their instability can be associated with a sign change of the inter-molecular interactions. We derive universal expressions for the molecular scattering lengths, presented in terms of experimentally measurable quantities. These will enable control of interactions between Feshbach molecules as well as further studies of few- and many-body reactions involving Feshbach molecules in the quantum regime.</description>

      <title>Vortices in Tunable Dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates with Attractive Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the formation of vortices in quasi-two-dimensional dipolar Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) through the interplay between two-body contact and long-ranged dipole-dipole interactions (DDIs), as both interactions can be tuned from repulsive to attractive. By solving the associated Gross-Pitaevskii equation for a rotating system, our initial approach concentrates on stabilizing a collapsing condensate with attractive s-wave two-body interactions by employing sufficiently large repulsive DDIs. Subsequently, the same procedure was applied after reversing the signs of both interactions to evaluate the sensitivity of vortex formation to such an interchange of interactions. As a reference to guide our investigation, valid for generic dipolar atomic species, we have assumed a condensate with the strong dipolar dysprosium isotope, 164Dy. The correlation of the results with other dipolar BEC systems was exemplified by considering rotating BECs with two other isotopes, namely 168Er and 52Cr. For a purely dipolar condensate (with zero contact interactions) under fixed rotation, we demonstrate how the number of visible vortices increases as the DDI becomes more repulsive, accomplished by tuning the orientation of the dipoles through a characteristic angle parameter.</description>

      <title>Evolution of a single spin in ideal Bose gas at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the finite-temperature dynamics of non-interacting bosons with a single static spinful impurity immersed. A non-zero contact boson-impurity pairwise interaction is assumed only for the spin-up impurity state. By tracing out bosonic degrees of freedom, the exact time evolution of the impurity spin is calculated for pure and mixed initial ensembles of states. The time-dependent momentum distribution of bosons initially created in the Bose condensed state and driven by the interaction with spin is analyzed.</description>

      <title>Exact mobility line and mobility ring in the complex energy plane of a flat band lattice with a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the problem of Anderson localization in a one-dimensional flat band lattice with a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic on-site potential. First of all, we discuss the influences of non-Hermitian potentials on the existence of critical states. Our findings show that, unlike in Hermitian cases, the non-Hermiticity of the potential leads to the disappearance of critical states and critical regions. Furthermore, we are able to accurately determine the Lyapunov exponents and the mobility edges. Our results reveal that the mobility edges form mobility lines and mobility rings in the complex energy plane. Within the mobility rings, the eigenstates are extended, while the localized states are located outside the mobility rings. For mobility line cases, only when the eigenenergies lie on the mobility lines, their corresponding eigenstates are extended states.Finally, as the energy approaches the mobility edges, we observe that, differently from Hermitian cases, here the critical index of the localization length is not a constant, but rather varies depending on the positions of the mobility edges.</description>

      <title>Effective-Field Theories of Analogue Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel method for building a gravitational analog model for a flowing Bose-Einstein condensate. The analogue metric is obtained using effective field theory methods, integrating out the heavy radial fluctuations. In this way, we also obtain interaction terms up to the quartic order in the fields. The microscopic Lagrangian describes a complex massive scalar field, with a global U(1) symmetry, that is spontaneously broken. From the quadratic effective Lagrangian, we obtain a dispersion law for phonons in presence of an acoustic horizon generated by the background flow. We observe that the phonon dispersion relation may exhibit a non-monotonic behavior determined by the Lagrangian's parameters. In this case, a non-trivial minimum appears associated with a characteristic length scale, indicating the breaking of translation symmetry. Then, we determine the constraints on the Lagrangian's parameters to make this happen. Finally, we design an original procedure to calculate the correlation functions through field theory tools. We apply this method to the density-density correlation function, reproducing known results. Moreover, we study the case of a non-monotonic phonon dispersion law, finding the existence of long range order.</description>

      <title>Dissipation induced localization-delocalization transition in a flat band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay between dissipation and localization in quantum systems has garnered significant attention due to its potential to manipulate transport properties and induce phase transitions. In this work, we explore the dissipation-induced extended-localized transition in a flat band model, where the system's asymptotic state can be controlled by tailored dissipative operators. By analyzing the steady-state density matrix and dissipative dynamics, we demonstrate that dissipation is able to drive the system to states dominated by either extended or localized modes, irrespective of the initial conditions. The control mechanism relies on the phase properties of the dissipative operators, which selectively favor specific eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Our findings reveal that dissipation can be harnessed to induce transitions between extended and localized phases, offering a novel approach to manipulate quantum transport in flat band systems. This work not only deepens our understanding of dissipation-induced phenomena in flat band systems but also provides a new avenue for controlling quantum states in open systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical spatial light modulation in the ultraviolet spectral range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial light modulators enable arbitrary control of the intensity of optical light fields and facilitate a variety of applications in biology, astronomy and atomic, molecular and optical physics. For coherent light fields, holography, implemented through arbitrary phase modulation, represents a highly power-efficient technique to shape the intensity of light patterns. Here, we introduce and benchmark a novel spatial light modulator based on a piston micro-mirror array. In particular, we utilize the reflection-based device to demonstrate arbitrary beam shaping in the ultraviolet regime at a wavelength of 322 nm. We correct aberrations of the reflected wavefront and show that the modulator does not add detectable excess phase noise to the reflected light field. We utilize the intrinsically low latency of the architecture to demonstrate fast switching of arbitrary light patterns synchronized with short laser pulses at an update rate of 1 kHz. Finally, we outline how the modulator can act as an important component of a zone-based architecture for a neutral-atom quantum computer or simulator, including ultraviolet wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Multiphoton-Multiatom Processes in Atomic Gases and Their Application in Enhancing Ultraweak Atomic Absorption Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate simultaneous multiphoton-multiatom (MPMA) processes in atomic gases subjected to laser fields. Our study reveals that the composite factor governing the transition rate of these processes can reach extraordinarily high magnitudes, with an intrinsic regulation mechanism causing the rate to exhibit near-saturation behavior. By integrating an MPMA process into an ultraweak atomic absorption transition, a substantial enhancement of the overall transition rate can be achieved. This enhancement enables the detection of transitions that would otherwise remain undetectable, thereby opening new avenues for exploring ultraweak quantum phenomena in atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Collective Superradiance: Estimating the Peak Emission Rate and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the peak photon emission time and rate for an ensemble of $N$ quantum systems undergoing collective superradiant decay typically requires tracking the time evolution of the density operator, a process with computational costs scaling exponentially with $N$. We present compact, analytic formulas for evaluating the peak emission rate and time for initially fully excited quantum emitter ensembles, valid for any geometric configuration and emitter type. These formulas rely solely on the variance of the eigenvalues of a real symmetric $N \times N$ matrix, which describes collective dissipation. We demonstrate the versatility of these results across various environments, including free space, solid-state, and waveguide reservoirs. For large $N$ the formulas simplify further to depend on just two parameters: average nearest-neighbor spacing and emitter number. Finally, we present scaling laws and bounds on the spatial size of emitter ensembles, such that superradiance is maintained, independent of emitter number or density.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a Nonequilibrium Discontinuous Quantum Phase Transition in a Spinor Bose-Einstein Condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking quantum phase transitions lead to the production of topological defects or domain walls in a wide range of physical systems. In second-order transitions, these exhibit universal scaling laws described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, but for first-order transitions a similarly universal approach is still lacking. Here we propose a spinor Bose-Einstein condensate as a testbed system where critical scaling behavior in a first-order quantum phase transition can be understood from generic properties. We demonstrate the applicability of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for this transition to determine the critical exponents for: (1) the onset of the decay of the metastable state on short times scales, and (2) the number of resulting phase-separated ferromagnetic domains at longer times, as a one-dimensional spin-1 condensate is ramped across a first-order quantum phase transition. The predictions are in excellent agreement with mean-field numerical simulations and provide a paradigm for studying the decay of metastable states in experimentally accessible systems.</description>

      <title>Condensation of Composite Bosonic Trions in Interacting Bose-Fermi Mixtures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06854v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reveal a quantum coherent state characterized by composite bosonic trions, wherein paired fermions further bind with bosons, in one-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures. This phase emerges in two distinct models, featuring onsite boson-fermion attraction that induces negative binding energy for the composite trions. The first is the Bose-Fermi pair-hopping model, in which spinless fermions undergo pair hopping to form preformed pairs. The second is the extended Bose-Fermi Hubbard model, which describes dipolar bosons and fermions with density-density interactions. Notably, the formation of composite trions is independent of the specific pairing interactions of fermions. Extensive density matrix renormalization group calculations demonstrate the quasi-condensation of the composite trions, evidenced by algebraically decaying correlations of trions, gapped single particle excitations, and suppressed fermion pair correlations. Our findings provide novel insights into a general three-body pairing mechanism among particles with distinct quantum statistics.</description>

      <title>Out-of-equilibrium quantum thermochemical engine with one-dimensional Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically explore the finite-time performance of a quantum thermochemical engine using a harmonically trapped 1D Bose gas in the quasicondensate regime as the working fluid. Operating on an Otto cycle, the engine's unitary work strokes involve quenches of interatomic interactions, treating the fluid as a closed many-body quantum system evolving dynamically from an initial thermal state. During thermalization strokes, the fluid is an open system in diffusive contact with a reservoir, enabling both heat and particle exchange. Using a c--field approach, we demonstrate that the engine operates via chemical work, driven by particle flow from the hot reservoir. The engine's performance is analyzed in two regimes: (i) the out-of-equilibrium regime, maximizing power at reduced efficiency, and (ii) the quasistatic limit, achieving maximum efficiency but zero power due to slow driving. Remarkably, chemical work enables maximum efficiency even in sudden quench regime, offering a favorable trade-off between power and efficiency. Finally, we connect this work to prior research, showing that a zero-temperature adiabatic cycle provides an upper bound for efficiency and work at finite temperatures.</description>

Abstract: In understanding strongly correlated quantum systems, quantifying the non-Gaussian nature of interparticle correlations is invaluable. We show that, for a uniform quantum gas, there exists a natural connection between non-Gaussian correlations and the generation of momentum-space entanglement. Furthermore, this entanglement can be directly measured in an experiment using time-of-flight techniques. To prototype our method, we numerically study entanglement generation in a degenerate Bose gas following a quench to the unitary regime, where Gaussian and non-Gaussian correlations are generated sequentially in time.</description>

Abstract: The study of quantum vortices provides critical insights into non-equilibrium dynamics across diverse physical systems. While previous research has focused on point-like vortices in two dimensions and line-like vortices in three dimensions, quantum vortices in four spatial dimensions are expected to take the form of extended vortex surfaces, thereby fundamentally enriching dynamics. Here, we conduct a comprehensive numerical study of 4D quantum vortices and turbulence. Using a special visualization method, we discovered the decay of topological numbers that does not exist in low dimensions, as well as the high-dimensional counterpart of the vortex reconnection process. We further explore quench dynamics across phase transitions in four dimensions and verify the applicability of the higher-dimensional Kibble-Zurek mechanism. Our simulations provide numerical evidence of 4D quantum turbulence, characterized by universal power-law behavior. These findings reveal universal principles governing topological defects in higher dimensions, offering insights for future experimental realizations using synthetic dimensions.</description>

      <title>Mott transition in excitonic Bose polarons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.07227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a neutral system of positive and negative charges, such as atoms in a crystal, increasing the density causes the Mott transition from bound electrons to free electrons. The density of optically generated electron-hole systems can be controlled in situ by the power of optical excitation that enables the Mott transition from excitons, the bound pairs of electrons and holes, to free electrons and holes with increasing density. These Mott transitions occur in systems of pairs of the same kind, such as atoms or excitons. However, a different type of the Mott transition can occur for Bose polarons. A Bose polaron is a mobile particle of one kind in a Bose gas of particles of another kind. For the Mott transition in polarons, the polaron states vanish with increasing density of the surrounding gas. In this paper, we present the observation of this type of the Mott transition and the measurement of the Mott transition parameter $n_{\rm M}^{1/2} a_{\rm B}$ in 2D excitonic Bose polarons.</description>

      <title>Galilei covariance of the theory of Thouless pumps</title>

Abstract: The Thouless theory of quantum pumps establishes the conditions for quantized particle transport per cycle, and determines its value. When describing the pump from a moving reference frame, transported and existing charges transform, though not independently. This transformation is inherent to Galilean space and time, but it is underpinned by a transformation of vector bundles. Different formalisms can be used to describe this transformation, including one based on Bloch theory. Depending on the chosen formalism, the two types of charges will be realized as indices of either the same or different kinds. Finally, we apply the bulk-edge correspondence principle, so as to implement the transformation law within B\"uttiker's scattering theory of quantum pumps.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Spectrum Dynamics as a Probe for Non-Hermitian Bulk-Boundary Correspondence in Systems with Periodic Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has recently been established that open quantum systems may exhibit a strong spectral sensitivity to boundary conditions, known as the non-Hermitian/Liouvillian skin effect (NHSE/LSE), making the topological properties of the system boundary-condition sensitive. In this Letter, we ask the query: Can topological phase transitions of open quantum systems, captured by open boundary conditioned invariants, be observed in the dynamics of a system in a periodic boundary condition, even in the presence of NHSE/LSE? We affirmatively respond to this question, by considering the quench dynamics of entanglement spectrum in a periodic open quantum fermionic system. We demonstrate that the entanglement spectrum exhibits zero-crossings only when this periodic system is quenched from a topologically trivial to non-trivial phase, defined from the spectrum in open boundary conditions, even in systems featuring LSE. Our results reveal that non-Hermitian topological phases leave a distinctive imprint on the unconditional dynamics within a subsystem of fermionic systems.</description>

      <title>Application of Madelung Hydrodynamics to Plasmonics and Nonlinear Optics in Two-Dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the application of Madelung hydrodynamic models to study two-dimensional electron gases, with a focus on nonlocal plasmonics and nonlinear optics. We begin by reviewing the derivation of the Madelung equations. Using the Madelung equations in conjunction with Poisson's equation, we calculate the spectrum of magnetoplasmons and the magneto-optical conductivity in the electrostatic regime, incorporating nonlocal corrections due to the Fermi pressure. In the absence of a magnetic field, we analyze nonlinear and nonlocal second-harmonic generation, demonstrating how plasmon excitation enhances this process. We further discuss the emergence of self-modulation phenomena driven by nonlinearity, leading to the renormalization of the plasmon dispersion. Notably, we show that nonlinearity amplifies nonlocal effects and, leveraging the hydrodynamic formalism, derive a simple analytic expression for the renormalized spectra.</description>
