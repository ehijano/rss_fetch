      <title>Design Studies Of A Pulsed Quasimonoenergetic 2-keV Neutron Source For Calibration Of Low Threshold Dark Matter Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe design studies for a pulsed quasi-monoenergetic 2-keV neutron source for calibration of sub-keV nuclear recoils. Such a calibration is required for detectors sensitive to sub-GeV dark matter and also the coherent elastic scattering of reactor neutrinos. In our design, neutrons from a commercial deuterium-tritium generator are moderated to the keV scale and then filtered to the monoenergetic spectrum using a feature in the neutron cross section of scandium. In this approach, unmoderated high-energy neutrons form a challenging background, along with gammas from neutron capture in the moderator materials. We describe the optimization of the moderator+filter and shielding geometry, and find a geometry that in simulation achieves both the target neutron flux at 2 keV and subdominant rates of background interactions. Lastly, we describe a future path to lower-energy (few eV scale) calibrations using time-of-flight and sub-keV neutrons.</description>

      <title>Characterizing seismic isolation using convolutional neural networks and Wiener filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate seismic motion propagation through a passively isolated mechanical system, using Wiener filters and convolutional neural networks with time-dilation layers. The goal of this study was to explore the capabilities of neural networks and Wiener filters in characterizing a mechanical system from the measurements. The mechanical system used is a testbed facility for technology development for current and future gravitational wave detectors, "VATIGrav", currently being commissioned at University of Hamburg. It consists of a large vacuum chamber mounted on four active vibration isolators with an optical table inside, mounted on four passive vibration isolators. In this paper we have used seismic data recorded on the ground and on the optical table inside the chamber. The data were divided in 6 hours for training and another 6 hours for validation, focusing on inferring 150-second stretches of time series of table motion from the ground motion in the frequency range from $0.1~\mathrm{Hz}$ to about $50~\mathrm{Hz}$. We compare the performance of a neural network with FTT-based loss function and with Huber loss function to single-input, single-output (SISO) and multiple-input, single-output (MISO) Wiener filters. To be able to compute very large MISO Wiener filters (with 15,000 taps) we have optimized the calculations exploiting block-Toeplitz structure of the matrix in Wiener-Hopf equations. We find that for the given task SISO Wiener filters outperform MISO Wiener filters, mostly due to low coherence between different motion axes. Neural network trained with Huber loss performs slightly worse than Wiener filters. Neural network with FFT-based loss outperforms Wiener filters in some frequency regions, particularly with low amplitudes and reduced coherence, while it tends to slightly underestimate the peaks, where Wiener filters perform better.</description>

      <title>Electronics design and testing of the CMS Fast Beam Condition Monitor for HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC) brings unprecedented requirements for precision bunch-by-bunch luminosity measurement and beam-induced background monitoring in real time. A key component of the CMS Beam Radiation Instrumentation and Luminosity detector system is a stand-alone luminometer, the Fast Beam Condition Monitor (FBCM), which is able to operate independently at all times with a triggerless asynchronous readout. FBCM utilizes a dedicated front-end ASIC to amplify the signals from CO$_2$-cooled silicon-pad sensors with 1 ns timing resolution. Front-end (FE) electronics are subject to high-radiation conditions, thus all components are radiation hardened: sensors, ASICs, transceivers, etc. The FBCM ASIC contains 6 channels, each outputting a high-speed binary signal carrying the time-of-arrival and time-over-threshold information. This signal is sent via a gigabit optical link to the back-end electronics for analysis. A dedicated test system is designed for the FBCM FE electronics with a modular setup for all testing needs of the project from initial ASIC validation test to system-level testing with the full read-out chain. The paper reports on the design, read-out architecture, and testing program for the FBCM electronics.</description>

      <title>Measurement of gas properties for the ion-TPC of N$\nu$DEx experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the N$\nu$DEx collaboration, a high-pressure gas TPC is being developed to search for the neutrinoless double beta decay. The use of electronegative $\mathrm{^{82}SeF_{6}}$ gas mandates an ion-TPC. The reconstruction of $z$ coordinate is to be realized exploiting the feature of multiple species of charge carriers. As the initial stage of the development, we studied the properties of the $\mathrm{SF_{6}}$ gas, which is non-toxic and has similar molecular structure to $\mathrm{SeF_{6}}$. In the paper we present the measurement of drift velocities and mobilities of the majority and minority negative charge carriers found in $\mathrm{SF_{6}}$ at a pressure of 750 Torr, slightly higher than the local atmospheric pressure. The reduced fields range between 3.0 and 5.5 Td. It was performed using a laser beam to ionize the gas inside a small TPC, with a drift length of 3.7 cm. A customized charge sensitive amplifier was developed to read out the anode signals induced by the slowly drifting ions. The reconstruction of $z$ coordinate using the difference in the velocities of the two carriers was also demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Experiment demonstration of tilt-to-length coupling suppression by beam-alignment-mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tilt-to-length (TTL) noise, caused by angular jitter and misalignment, is a major noise source in the inter-satellite interferometer for gravitational wave detection. However, the required level of axis alignment of the optical components is beyond the current state of the art. A set of optical parallel plates, called beam alignment mechanism (BAM), is proposed by LISA to compensate for the alignment error. In this paper, we show a prototype design of the BAM and demonstrate its performance in a ground-based optical system. We derive the BAM theoretical model, which agrees well with the numerical simulation. Experimental results reveal that the BAM can achieve lateral displacement compensation of the optical axis with a resolution of \SI{1}{\micro\meter} across a dynamic range of about \SI{0.5}{\milli\meter}. Furthermore, the TTL coefficient is reduced from about \SI{0.3}{\milli\meter/\radian} to about \SI{5}{\micro\meter/\radian}, satisfying the preliminary requirements for LISA and TianQin. These findings confirm the efficacy of the BAM in suppressing TTL noise, offering a promising solution for space-based gravitational wave detection.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Powered Data Cleaning for LEGEND</title>

Abstract: Neutrinoless double-beta decay ($0\nu\beta\beta$) is a rare nuclear process that, if observed, will provide insight into the nature of neutrinos and help explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. The Large Enriched Germanium Experiment for Neutrinoless Double-Beta Decay (LEGEND) will operate in two phases to search for $0\nu\beta\beta$. The first (second) stage will employ 200 (1000) kg of High-Purity Germanium (HPGe) enriched in $^{76}$Ge to achieve a half-life sensitivity of 10$^{27}$ (10$^{28}$) years. In this study, we present a semi-supervised data-driven approach to remove non-physical events captured by HPGe detectors powered by a novel artificial intelligence model. We utilize Affinity Propagation to cluster waveform signals based on their shape and a Support Vector Machine to classify them into different categories. We train, optimize, test our model on data taken from a natural abundance HPGe detector installed in the Full Chain Test experimental stand at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. We demonstrate that our model yields a maximum physics event sacrifice of $0.024 ^{+0.004}_{-0.003} \%$ when performing data cleaning cuts. Our model is being used to accelerate data cleaning development for LEGEND-200.</description>

      <title>BEACON -- Automated Aberration Correction for Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy using Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aberration correction is an important aspect of modern high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Most methods of aligning aberration correctors require specialized sample regions and are unsuitable for fine-tuning aberrations without interrupting on-going experiments. Here, we present an automated method of correcting first- and second-order aberrations called BEACON which uses Bayesian optimization of the normalized image variance to efficiently determine the optimal corrector settings. We demonstrate its use on gold nanoparticles and a hafnium dioxide thin film showing its versatility in nano- and atomic-scale experiments. BEACON can correct all first- and second-order aberrations simultaneously to achieve an initial alignment and first- and second-order aberrations independently for fine alignment. Ptychographic reconstructions are used to demonstrate an improvement in probe shape and a reduction in the target aberration.</description>

      <title>Directional eddy current probe configuration for in-line detection of out-of-plane wrinkles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15368v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-time monitoring of carbon fibre composites during Automated Fibre Placement (AFP) manufacturing remains a challenge for non-destructive evaluation (NDE) techniques. An directional eddy-current (EC) probe with asymmetric transmit and differential receive (Tx-dRx) coils is designed, constructed and characterized to evaluate the detectability of out-of-plane wrinkles. Initial studies were conducted to determine suitable excitation frequencies and to analyse the impact of relative orientations of driver and pickup coils on wrinkle detectability. The probe configurations are evaluated experimentally and employ a new finite element modelling approach to better understand the relationship between eddy-current density and defect detection. The findings indicate that a probe configuration with an asymmetric driver coil normal to the material surface and aligned with the fibre directions, and with differential pickup coils 90 degrees to the scanning direction, shows the best capability for out-of-plane wrinkle detection, with SNR &gt;20 for wrinkles over 1.3 mm in amplitude.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network-Based Track Finding in the LHCb Vertex Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12119v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next decade will see an order of magnitude increase in data collected by high-energy physics experiments, driven by the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). The reconstruction of charged particle trajectories (tracks) has always been a critical part of offline data processing pipelines. The complexity of HL-LHC data will however increasingly mandate track finding in all stages of an experiment's real-time processing. This paper presents a GNN-based track-finding pipeline tailored for the Run 3 LHCb experiment's vertex detector and benchmarks its physics performance and computational cost against existing classical algorithms on GPU architectures. A novelty of our work compared to existing GNN tracking pipelines is batched execution, in which the GPU evaluates the pipeline on hundreds of events in parallel. We evaluate the impact of neural-network quantisation on physics and computational performance, and comment on the outlook for GNN tracking algorithms for other parts of the LHCb track-finding pipeline.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The latest update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics stimulated the preparation of the European Detector Roadmap document in 2021 by the European Committee for Future Accelerators ECFA. This roadmap, defined during a bottom-up process by the community, outlines nine technology domains for HEP instrumentation and pinpoints urgent R&amp;D topics, known as Detector R&amp;D Themes (DRDTs). Task forces were set for each domain, leading to Detector R&amp;D Collaborations (DRDs), now hosted at CERN. After an intensive period over the last months, seven DRD collaborations have been established, which are now starting to set up their collaboration structures and begin to work. One is still in the preparation phase. In this publication, I will give an overview of the set-up process and the current status of all DRD collaborations covering detector developments in the field of gaseous detectors, noble liquid detectors for rare event searches, semiconductor detectors, photodetectors and concepts for particle ID, quantum sensors, calorimetry, electronics for HEP instrumentation and mechanical and integration aspects.</description>

      <title>Wide-field microwave magnetic field imaging with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16528v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-invasive imaging of microwave (MW) magnetic fields with microscale lateral resolution is pivotal for various applications, such as MW technologies and integrated circuit failure analysis. Diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetometry has emerged as an ideal tool, offering $\mu$m-scale resolution, millimeter-scale field of view, high sensitivity, and non-invasive imaging compatible with diverse samples. However, up until now, it has been predominantly used for imaging of static or low-frequency magnetic fields or, concerning MW field imaging, to directly characterize the same microwave device used to drive the NV spin transitions. In this work we leverage an NV center ensemble in diamond for wide-field imaging of MW magnetic fields generated by a test device employing a differential measurement protocol. The microscope is equipped with a MW loop to induce Rabi oscillations between NV spin states, and the MW field from the device-under-test is measured through local deviations in the Rabi frequency. This differential protocol yields magnetic field maps of a 2.57 GHz MW field with a sensitivity of $\sim$ 9 $\mu$T Hz$^{-1/2}$ for a total measurement duration of $T = 357$ s, covering a $340\times340$ $\mu$m$^2$ field of view with a $\mu$m-scale spatial resolution and a DUT input power dynamic range of 30 dB. This work demonstrates a novel NV magnetometry protocol, based on differential Rabi frequency measurement, that extends NV wide-field imaging capabilities to imaging of weak MW magnetic fields that would be difficult to measure directly through standard NV Rabi magnetometry.</description>

      <title>Magnon spectroscopy in the electron microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The miniaturisation of transistors is approaching its limits due to challenges in heat management and information transfer speed. To overcome these obstacles, emerging technologies such as spintronics are being developed, which leverage the electron's spin in addition to its charge. Local phenomena at interfaces or structural defects will greatly influence the efficiency of spin-based devices, making the ability to study and control spin wave propagation at the nano- and atomic scales a key challenge. The development of high-spatial-resolution tools to probe spin waves, also called magnons, at relevant lengthscales is thus essential to understand how their properties are affected by such local features. Here, we show the first experimental detection of bulk magnons at the nanoscale using scanning transmission electron microscopy. By employing high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy with hybrid-pixel direct electron detectors optimized for low acceleration voltages, we successfully overcome the challenges posed by weak signals and identify magnon excitations in a thin NiO nanocrystal. Advanced inelastic electron scattering simulations corroborate our findings. These results open new avenues for detecting magnons, exploring their dispersions and their modifications arising from nanoscale structural or chemical defects. This marks an important milestone in magnonics and presents exciting opportunities for the future development of spintronic devices.</description>
