      <title>Bitcoin ETF: Opportunities and risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The year 2024 witnessed a major development in the cryptocurrency industry with the long-awaited approval of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs). This innovation provides investors with a new, regulated path to gain exposure to Bitcoin through a familiar investment vehicle (Kumar et al., 2024). However, unlike traditional ETFs that directly hold underlying assets, Bitcoin ETFs rely on a creation and redemption process managed by authorized participants (APs). This unique structure introduces distinct characteristics in terms of premium/discount behavior compared to traditional ETFs. This paper investigates the premium and discount patterns observed in Bitcoin ETFs during first four-month period (January 11th, 2024, to May 17th, 2024). Our analysis reveals that these patterns differ significantly from those observed in traditional index ETFs, potentially exposing investors to additional risk factors. By identifying and analyzing these risk factors associated with Bitcoin ETF premiums/discounts, this paper aims to achieve two key objectives: Enhance market understanding: Equip and market and investors with a deeper comprehension of the unique liquidity risks inherent in Bitcoin ETFs. Provide a clearer risk management frameworks: Offer a clearer perspective on the risk-return profile of digital asset ETFs, specifically focusing on Bitcoin ETFs. Through a thorough analysis of premium/discount behavior and the underlying factors contributing to it, this paper strives to contribute valuable insights for investors navigating the evolving landscape of digital asset investments</description>

      <title>Simulation of Social Media-Driven Bubble Formation in Financial Markets using an Agent-Based Model with Hierarchical Influence Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that a tree-like hierarchical structure represents a simple and effective way to model the emergent behaviour of financial markets, especially markets where there exists a pronounced intersection between social media influences and investor behaviour. To explore this hypothesis, we introduce an agent-based model of financial markets, where trading agents are embedded in a hierarchical network of communities, and communities influence the strategies and opinions of traders. Empirical analysis of the model shows that its behaviour conforms to several stylized facts observed in real financial markets; and the model is able to realistically simulate the effects that social media-driven phenomena, such as echo chambers and pump-and-dump schemes, have on financial markets.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic regret in the ergodic Avellaneda-Stoikov market making model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse the regret arising from learning the price sensitivity parameter $\kappa$ of liquidity takers in the ergodic version of the Avellaneda-Stoikov market making model. We show that a learning algorithm based on a regularised maximum-likelihood estimator for the parameter achieves the regret upper bound of order $\ln^2 T$ in expectation. To obtain the result we need two key ingredients. The first are tight upper bounds on the derivative of the ergodic constant in the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation with respect to $\kappa$. The second is the learning rate of the maximum-likelihood estimator which is obtained from concentration inequalities for Bernoulli signals. Numerical experiment confirms the convergence and the robustness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Controllable Financial Market Generation with Diffusion Guided Meta Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Order flow modeling stands as the most fundamental and essential financial task, as orders embody the minimal unit within a financial market. However, current approaches often result in unsatisfactory fidelity in generating order flow, and their generation lacks controllability, thereby limiting their application scenario. In this paper, we advocate incorporating controllability into the market generation process, and propose a Diffusion Guided meta Agent(DiGA) model to address the problem. Specifically, we utilize a diffusion model to capture dynamics of market state represented by time-evolving distribution parameters about mid-price return rate and order arrival rate, and define a meta agent with financial economic priors to generate orders from the corresponding distributions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method exhibits outstanding controllability and fidelity in generation. Furthermore, we validate DiGA's effectiveness as generative environment for downstream financial applications.</description>
