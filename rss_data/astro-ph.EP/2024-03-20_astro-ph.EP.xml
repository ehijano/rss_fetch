      <title>Sites of Planet Formation in Binary Systems. I. Evidence for Disk-Orbit Alignment in the Close Binary FO Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close binary systems present challenges to planet formation. As binary separations decrease, so too do the occurrence rates of protoplanetary disks in young systems and planets in mature systems. For systems that do retain disks, their disk masses and sizes are altered by the presence of the binary companion. Through the study of protoplanetary disks in binary systems with known orbital parameters, we seek to determine the properties that promote disk retention and, therefore, planet formation. In this work, we characterize the young binary-disk system, FO Tau. We determine the first full orbital solution for the system, finding masses of $0.35^{+0.06}_{-0.05}\ M_\odot$ and $0.34\pm0.05\ M_\odot$ for the stellar components, a semi-major axis of $22(^{+2}_{-1})$ AU, and an eccentricity of $0.21(^{+0.04}_{-0.03})$. With long-baseline ALMA interferometry, we detect 1.3mm continuum and $^{12}{\mathrm{CO}} \ (J=2-1)$ line emission toward each of the binary components; no circumbinary emission is detected. The protoplanetary disks are compact, consistent with being truncated by the binary orbit. The dust disks are unresolved in the image plane and the more extended gas disks are only marginally resolved. Fitting the continuum and CO visibilities, we determine the inclination of each disk, finding evidence for alignment of the disk and binary orbital planes. This study is the first of its kind linking the properties of circumstellar protoplanetary disks to a precisely known binary orbit. In the case of FO Tau, we find a dynamically placid environment (coplanar, low eccentricity), which may foster its potential for planet formation.</description>

      <title>Combining Gaia and GRAVITY: Characterising Five New Directly Detected Substellar Companions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise mass constraints are vital for the characterisation of brown dwarfs and exoplanets. Here, we present how the combination of data obtained by Gaia and GRAVITY can help enlarge the sample of substellar companions with measured dynamical masses. We show how the Non-Single-Star (NSS) two-body orbit catalogue contained in Gaia DR3 can be used to inform high angular resolution follow-up observations with GRAVITY. Applying the method presented in this work for eight Gaia candidate systems, we detect all eight predicted companions, seven of which being previously unknown and five of substellar nature. Among the sample is Gaia DR3 2728129004119806464 B, which - detected at a angular separation of (34.01 $\pm$ 0.15) mas from the host - is the closest substellar companion ever imaged. In combination with the system's distance this translates to a physical separation of (1.054 $\pm$ 0.002) AU. The GRAVITY data are then used to break the host-companion mass degeneracy inherent to the Gaia NSS orbit solutions as well as to constrain the orbital solutions of the respective target systems. Knowledge of the companion masses enables us to further characterise them in terms of their age, effective temperature and radius by the application of evolutionary models. The results serve as an independent validation of the orbital solutions published in the NSS two-body orbit catalogue and show that the combination of astrometric survey missions and high-angular resolution direct imaging hold great promise for efficiently increasing the sample of directly-imaged companions in the future, especially in the light of the Gaia's upcoming DR4 and the advent of GRAVITY+.</description>

      <title>LHS 1140 b is a potentially habitable water world</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LHS 1140 b is a small planet orbiting in the habitable zone of its M4.5V dwarf host. Recent mass and radius constraints have indicated that it has either a thick H$_2$-rich atmosphere or substantial water by mass. Here we present a transmission spectrum of LHS 1140 b between 1.7 and 5.2 $\mu$m, obtained using the NIRSpec instrument on JWST. By combining spectral retrievals and self-consistent atmospheric models, we show that the transmission spectrum is inconsistent with H$_2$-rich atmospheres with varied size and metallicity, leaving a water world as the remaining scenario to explain the planet's low density. Specifically, a H$_2$-rich atmosphere would result in prominent spectral features of CH$_4$ or CO$_2$ on this planet, but they are not seen in the transmission spectrum. Instead, the data favors a high-mean-molecular-weight atmosphere (possibly N$_2$-dominated with H$_2$O and CO$_2$) with a modest confidence. Forming the planet by accreting C- and N-bearing ices could naturally give rise to a CO$_2$- or N$_2$-dominated atmosphere, and if the planet evolves to or has the climate-stabilizing mechanism to maintain a moderate-size CO$_2$/N$_2$-dominated atmosphere, the planet could have liquid-water oceans. Our models suggest CO$_2$ absorption features with an expected signal of 20 ppm at 4.2 $\mu$m. As the existence of an atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1 planets is uncertain, LHS 1140 b may well present the best current opportunity to detect and characterize a habitable world.</description>

      <title>Radiative-convective models of the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune: heating sources and seasonal effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observations made during the Voyager 2 flyby have shown that the stratosphere of Uranus and Neptune are warmer than expected by previous models. In addition, no seasonal variability of the thermal structure has been observed on Uranus since Voyager 2 era and significant subseasonal variations have been revealed on Neptune. In this paper, we evaluate different realistic heat sources that can induce sufficient heating to warm the atmosphere of these planets and we estimate the seasonal effects on the thermal structure. The seasonal radiative-convective model developed by the Laboratoire de M\'et\'eorologie Dynamique is used to reproduce the thermal structure of these planets. Three hypotheses for the heating sources are explored separately: aerosol layers, a higher methane mole fraction, and thermospheric conduction. Our modelling indicates that aerosols with plausible scattering properties can produce the requisite heating for Uranus, but not for Neptune. Alternatively, greater stratospheric methane abundances can provide the missing heating on both planets, but the large values needed are inconsistent with current observational constraints. In contrast, adding thermospheric conduction cannot warm alone the stratosphere of both planets. The combination of these heat sources is also investigated. In the upper troposphere of both planets, the meridional thermal structures produced by our model are found inconsistent with those retrieved from Voyager 2/IRIS data. Furthermore, our models predict seasonal variations should exist within the stratospheres of both planets while observations showed that Uranus seems to be invariant to meridional contrasts and only subseasonal temperature trends are visible on Neptune. However, a warm south pole is seen in our simulations of Neptune as observed since 2003.</description>

      <title>MINDS. The DR Tau disk I: combining JWST-MIRI data with high-resolution CO spectra to characterise the hot gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The MRS mode of the JWST-MIRI instrument has been shown to be a powerful tool to characterise the molecular gas emission of the inner region of planet-forming disks. Here, we analyse the spectrum of the compact T-Tauri disk DR Tau, which is complemented by high spectral resolution (R~60000-90000) CO ro-vibrational observations. Various molecular species, including CO, CO$_2$, HCN, and C$_2$H$_2$ are detected in the JWST-MIRI spectrum, for which excitation temperatures of T~325-900 K are retrieved using LTE slab models. The high-resolution CO observations allow for a full treatment of the line profiles, which show evidence for two components of the main isotopologue, $^{12}$CO: a broad component tracing the Keplerian disk and a narrow component tracing a slow disk wind. Rotational diagrams yield excitation temperatures of T&gt;725 K for CO, with consistently lower temperatures found for the narrow components, suggesting that the disk wind is launched from a larger distance. The inferred excitation temperatures for all molecules suggest that CO originates from the highest atmospheric layers close to the host star, followed by HCN and C$_2$H$_2$, which emit, together with $^{13}$CO, from slightly deeper layers, whereas the CO$_2$ originates from even deeper inside or further out in the disk. Additional analysis of the $^{12}$CO line wings hint at a misalignment between the inner (i~20 degrees) and outer disk (i~5 degrees). Finally, we emphasise the need for complementary high-resolution CO observations, as in combination with the JWST-MIRI observations they can be used to characterise the CO kinematics and the physical and chemical conditions of the other observed molecules with respect to CO.</description>

      <title>At least one in a dozen stars exhibits evidence of planetary ingestion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar chemical compositions can be altered by ingestion of planetary material and/or planet formation which removes refractory material from the proto-stellar disc. These "planet signatures" appear as correlations between elemental abundance differences and the dust condensation temperature. Detecting these planet signatures, however, is challenging due to unknown occurrence rates, small amplitudes, and heterogeneous star samples with large differences in stellar ages, and therefore stars born together (i.e., co-natal) with identical compositions can facilitate such detections. While previous spectroscopic studies were limited to small number of binary stars, the Gaia satellite provides new opportunities for detecting stellar chemical signatures of planets among co-moving pairs of stars confirmed to be co-natal. Here we report high-precision chemical abundances for a homogeneous sample of 91 co-natal pairs of stars with a well-defined selection function and identify at least seven new instances of planetary ingestion, corresponding to an occurrence rate of 8%. An independent Bayesian indicator is deployed, which can effectively disentangle the planet signatures from other factors, such as random abundance variation and atomic diffusion. Our study provides new evidence of planet signatures and facilitates a deeper understanding of the star-planet-chemistry connection by providing new observational constraints on the mechanisms of planet engulfment, formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>The Brown Dwarf Kinematics Project (BDKP). VI. Ultracool Dwarf Radial and Rotational Velocities from SDSS/APOGEE High-resolution Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present precise measurements of radial (RV) and projected rotational ($v\sin{i}$) velocities, effective temperatures, and surface gravities of a sample of 258 M6 to L2 dwarfs with multi-epoch, high-resolution ($\lambda/\Delta\lambda$ = 22500), near-infrared (1.514-1.696 $\mu$m) spectroscopic observations reported in the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) Data Release 17. The spectra were modeled using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo forward-modeling method which achieved median precisions of $\sigma_\text{RV}$ = 0.4 km s$^{-1}$ and $\sigma_{v\sin{i}}$ = 1.1 km s$^{-1}$. One-half of our sample (138 sources) are previously known members of nearby young clusters and moving groups, and we identified three new kinematic members of the Argus or Carina Near moving groups, 2MASS J05402570+2448090, 2MASS J14093200+4138080, and 2MASS J21272531+5553150. Excluding these sources, we find that the majority of our sample has kinematics consistent with the Galactic thin disk, and eleven sources are associated with the intermediate thin/thick disk. The field sample has a velocity dispersion of 38.2$\pm$0.3 km s$^{-1}$, equivalent to an age of 3.30$\pm$0.19 Gyr based on empirical age-velocity dispersion relations; and a median $v\sin{i}$ of 17 km s$^{-1}$. For 172 sources with multi-epoch observations, we identified 37 as having significant radial velocity variations, and determined preliminary orbit parameters for 26 sources with four or more epochs. For 40 sources with photometric variability periods from the literature less than 5 days and $v\sin{i}$ $&gt;$ 20 km s$^{-1}$, we find a decline in projected radii $R\sin{i}$ with age congruent with evolutionary models. Finally, we also present multi-epoch RV and vsini measurements for additional 444 candidate ultracool dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The effect of ultra-violet photon pumping of H$_2$ in dust-deficient protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.02804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform radiation hydrodynamics simulations to study the structure and evolution of a photoevaporating protoplanetary disk. Ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from the host star heats the disk surface, where H$_2$ pumping also operates efficiently. We run a set of simulations with varying the amount of dust grains, or the dust-to-gas mass ratio, which determines the relative importance between photoelectric heating and H$_2$ pumping. We show that H$_2$ pumping and X-ray heating contribute stronger to the mass-loss of the disk if the dust-to-gas mass ratio is $\mathcal{D}\leq10^{-3}$.The disk mass loss rate decreases with a lower dust amount, but remains around $10^{-10-11} M_{\odot} {\rm yr}^{-1}$. In such dust-deficient disks, H$_2$ pumping enhances photoevaporation from the inner disk region and shapes the disk mass-loss profile. We thus argue that the late-stage disk evolution is affected by the ultra-violet H$_2$ pumping effect. The mass-loss rates derived from our simulations can be used in the study of long-term disk evolution.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Primer on Classical Period-Finding Techniques in Astronomy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.10417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of our paper is to investigate the properties of the classical phase-dispersion minimization (PDM), analysis of variance (AOV), string-length (SL), and Lomb-Scargle (LS) power statistics from a statistician's perspective. We confirm that when the data are perturbations of a constant function, i.e. under the null hypothesis of no period in the data, a scaled version of the PDM statistic follows a beta distribution, the AOV statistic follows an F distribution, and the LS power follows a chi-squared distribution with two degrees of freedom. However, the SL statistic does not have a closed-form distribution. We further verify these theoretical distributions through simulations and demonstrate that the extreme values of these statistics (over a range of trial periods), often used for period estimation and determination of the false alarm probability (FAP), follow different distributions than those derived for a single period. We emphasize that multiple-testing considerations are needed to correctly derive FAP bounds. Though, in fact, multiple-testing controls are built into the FAP bound for these extreme-value statistics, e.g. the FAP bound derived specifically for the maximum LS power statistic over a range of trial periods. Additionally, we find that all of these methods are robust to heteroscedastic noise aimed to mimic the degradation or miscalibration of an instrument over time. Finally, we examine the ability of these statistics to detect a non-constant periodic function via simulating data that mimics a well-detached binary system, and we find that the AOV statistic has the most power to detect the correct period, which agrees with what has been observed in practice.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Helium and Hydrogen Accretion Indicators at TWA 27B: Weak Mass Flow at Near-Freefall Velocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04763v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: TWA 27B (2M1207b) is the first directly-imaged planetary-mass (MP ~ 5 MJ) companion (Chauvin et al. 2004) and was observed at 0.9--5.3 micron with JWST/NIRSpec (Luhman et al. 2023). To understand the accretion properties of TWA 27B, we search for continuum-subtracted near-infrared helium and hydrogen emission lines and measure their widths and luminosities. We detect the He I triplet at 4.3 sigma and all Paschen-series lines covered by NIRSpec (Pa alpha, Pa beta, Pa gamma, Pa delta) at 4--5 sigma. The three brightest Brackett-series lines (Br alpha, Br beta, Br gamma) as well as Pf gamma and Pf delta are tentative detections at 2--3 sigma. We provide upper limits on the other hydrogen lines, including on H alpha through Hubble Space Telescope archival data. Three lines can be reliably deconvolved to reveal an intrinsic width Delta v = 67+-9 km/s, which is 60% of the surface freefall velocity. The line luminosities seem significantly too high to be due to chromospheric activity. Converting line luminosities to an accretion rate yields Mdot ~ 5e-9 MJ/yr when using scaling relationships for planetary masses, and Mdot ~ 0.1e-9 MJ/yr with extrapolated stellar scalings. Several of these lines represent first detections at an accretor of such low mass. The weak accretion rate implies that formation is likely over. This analysis shows that JWST can be used to measure low line-emitting mass accretion rates onto planetary-mass objects, motivates deeper searches for the mass reservoir feeding TWA 27B, and hints that other young directly-imaged objects might -- hitherto unbeknownst -- also be accreting.</description>

      <title>ExoCubed: A Riemann-Solver based Cubed-Sphere Dynamic Core for Planetary Atmospheres</title>

Abstract: The computational fluid dynamics on a sphere is relevant to global simulations of geophysical fluid dynamics. Using the conventional spherical-polar (or lat-lon) grid results in a singularity at the poles, with orders of magnitude smaller cell sizes at the poles in comparison to the equator. To address this problem, we developed a general circulation model (dynamic core) with a gnomonic equiangular cubed-sphere configuration. This model is developed based on the Simulating Nonhydrostatic Atmospheres on Planets (SNAP) model, using a finite volume numerical scheme with a Riemann-solver-based dynamic core and the vertical implicit correction (VIC) scheme. This change of the horizontal configuration gives a 20-time acceleration of global simulations compared to the lat-lon grid with a similar number of cells at medium resolution. We presented standard tests ranging from 2D shallow-water models to 3D general circulation tests, including earth-like planets and shallow hot Jupiters, to validate the accuracy of the model. The method described in this article is generic to transform any existing finite-volume hydrodynamic model in the Cartesian geometry to the spherical geometry.</description>

      <title>White Dwarf Pollution: One Star or Two?</title>

Abstract: The accretion of tidally disrupted planetary bodies is the current consensus model for the presence of photospheric metals commonly detected in white dwarfs. While most dynamical studies have considered a single star and associated planetary instabilities, several investigations have instead considered the influence of widely-bound stellar companions as potential drivers of white dwarf pollution. This study examines the prevalence of wide binaries among polluted white dwarfs using Gaia Data Release 3 astrometry, where three samples are investigated: 71 DAZ stars with metals detected in the ultraviolet using the Hubble Space Telescope, and two groups of DZ stars identified via Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectroscopy, comprised of 116 warmer and 101 cooler sources. Each sample was searched for spatially-resolved, co-moving companions, and compared to the same analysis of thousands of field white dwarfs within overlapping regions of the Gaia Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The wide binary fraction of the DAZ sample is $10.6_{-3.2}^{+3.9}$ per cent, and within $1 \sigma$ of the corresponding field. However, the search yields wide binary fractions of less than 1.8 per cent for the two independent DZ star catalogues, which are each distinct from their fields by more than $3 \sigma$. Both sets of results support that pollution in white dwarfs is not the result of stellar companions, and the delivery of metals to white dwarf surfaces is caused by major planets. The discrepancy between the DAZ and DZ star wide binary fractions cannot be caused by white dwarf spectral evolution, suggesting these two populations may have distinct planetary architectures.</description>

      <title>The Mass Dependence of H{\alpha} Emission and Stellar Spindown for Fully Convective M Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10167v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fully convective M dwarfs typically remain rapidly rotating and magnetically active for billions of years, followed by an abrupt and mass-dependent transition to slow rotation and quiescence. A robust understanding of this process is complicated by difficulties in estimating M-dwarf ages and potential dependencies on other variables such as birth environment or metallicity. To isolate the effect of mass, we consider M dwarfs in wide binaries. We identify 67 widely separated, fully convective (0.08-0.35M$_\odot$) M-dwarf binary systems using Gaia and measure the H$\alpha$ feature for each component. We classify the pairs into three categories: systems where both components are active, systems where both are inactive, and candidate transition systems, where one component is active and the other inactive. We gather higher-resolution spectra of the candidate transition systems to verify that their behavior does not result from an unresolved third component, yielding one new triple with surprising activity levels. Neglecting this triple, we find 22 active, 36 inactive, and 8 transition pairs. Our results are consistent with the epoch of spindown for these binaries being primarily determined by mass, with mild second-order effects; we place a 1$\sigma$ upper limit of 0.5Gyr or 25% on the dispersion in the mass-dependent spindown relation. Our findings suggest that the large dispersion in spindown epoch previously observed for field stars of a given mass may stem from differences in birth environment, in addition to modest intrinsic stochasticity. We also see evidence that the wide binary population is dispersed over time due to dynamical processing.</description>
