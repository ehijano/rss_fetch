      <title>An uncertainty-aware Digital Shadow for underground multimodal CO2 storage monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geological Carbon Storage GCS is arguably the only scalable net-negative CO2 emission technology available While promising subsurface complexities and heterogeneity of reservoir properties demand a systematic approach to quantify uncertainty when optimizing production and mitigating storage risks which include assurances of Containment and Conformance of injected supercritical CO2 As a first step towards the design and implementation of a Digital Twin for monitoring underground storage operations a machine learning based data-assimilation framework is introduced and validated on carefully designed realistic numerical simulations As our implementation is based on Bayesian inference but does not yet support control and decision-making we coin our approach an uncertainty-aware Digital Shadow To characterize the posterior distribution for the state of CO2 plumes conditioned on multi-modal time-lapse data the envisioned Shadow combines techniques from Simulation-Based Inference SBI and Ensemble Bayesian Filtering to establish probabilistic baselines and assimilate multi-modal data for GCS problems that are challenged by large degrees of freedom nonlinear multi-physics non-Gaussianity and computationally expensive to evaluate fluid flow and seismic simulations To enable SBI for dynamic systems a recursive scheme is proposed where the Digital Shadows neural networks are trained on simulated ensembles for their state and observed data well and/or seismic Once training is completed the systems state is inferred when time-lapse field data becomes available In this computational study we observe that a lack of knowledge on the permeability field can be factored into the Digital Shadows uncertainty quantification To our knowledge this work represents the first proof of concept of an uncertainty-aware in-principle scalable Digital Shadow.</description>

      <title>Sea Foam contains Hemoglycin from Cosmic Dust</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In-falling cosmic dust has left evidence of meteoritic polymer amide in stromatolites, both fossil and modern. In search of evidence for continued present day in-fall sea foam was collected from two beaches in Rhode Island and subjected to Folch extraction to concentrate amphiphilic components in a chloroform water-methanol interphase layer. Hemoglycin polymer amide molecules previously characterized by MALDI mass spectrometry in meteorites and stromatolites were identified in sea foam either directly, or via their fragmentation patterns. Residual isotope enrichment pointed to an extra-terrestrial origin. The unique resiliency of sea foam may be due to the formation of extended hemoglycin lattices that stabilize its closed-cell structure and its lightness can potentially be explained by photolytic hydrogen production.</description>

      <title>QESM: A Leap Towards Quantum-Enhanced ML Emulation Framework for Earth and Climate Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current climate models often struggle with accuracy because they lack sufficient resolution, a limitation caused by computational constraints. This reduces the precision of weather forecasts and long-term climate predictions. To address this issue, we explored the use of quantum computing to enhance traditional machine learning (ML) models. We replaced conventional models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP), and Encoder-Decoder frameworks with their quantum versions: Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN), Quantum Multilayer Perceptrons (QMLP), and Quantum Encoder-Decoders (QED). These quantum models proved to be more accurate in predicting climate-related outcomes compared to their classical counterparts. Using the ClimSim dataset, a large collection of climate data created specifically for ML-based climate prediction, we trained and tested these quantum models. Individually, the quantum models performed better, but their performance was further improved when we combined them using a meta-ensemble approach, which merged the strengths of each model to achieve the highest accuracy overall. This study demonstrates that quantum machine learning can significantly improve the resolution and accuracy of climate simulations. The results offer new possibilities for better predicting climate trends and weather events, which could have important implications for both scientific understanding and policy-making in the face of global climate challenges.</description>

      <title>Multiple-Input Fourier Neural Operator (MIFNO) for source-dependent 3D elastodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations are essential tools to evaluate the solution of the wave equation in complex settings, such as three-dimensional (3D) domains with heterogeneous properties. However, their application is limited by high computational costs and existing surrogate models lack the flexibility of numerical solvers. This work introduces the Multiple-Input Fourier Neural Operator (MIFNO) to deal with structured 3D fields representing material properties as well as vectors describing the source characteristics. The MIFNO is applied to the problem of elastic wave propagation in the Earth's crust. It is trained on the HEMEW^S-3D database containing 30000 earthquake simulations in different heterogeneous domains with random source positions and orientations. Outputs are time- and space-dependent surface wavefields. The MIFNO predictions are assessed as good to excellent based on Goodness-Of-Fit (GOF) criteria. Wave arrival times and wave fronts' propagation are very accurate since 80% of the predictions have an excellent phase GOF. The fluctuations amplitudes are good for 87% of the predictions. The envelope score is hindered by the small-scale fluctuations that are challenging to capture due to the complex physical phenomena associated with high-frequency features. Nevertheless, the MIFNO can generalize to sources located outside the training domain and it shows good generalization ability to a real complex overthrust geology. When focusing on a region of interest, transfer learning improves the accuracy with limited additional costs, since GOF scores improved by more than 1 GOF unit with only 500 additional specific samples. The MIFNO is the first surrogate model offering the flexibility of an earthquake simulator with varying sources and material properties. Its good accuracy and massive speed-up offer new perspectives to replace numerical simulations in many-query problems.</description>
