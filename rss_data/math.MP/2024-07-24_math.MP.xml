      <title>Asymptotic-preserving neural networks for the semiconductor Boltzmann equation and its application on inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the Asymptotic-Preserving Neural Networks (APNNs) approach to study the forward and inverse problem for the semiconductor Boltzmann equation. The goal of the neural network is to resolve the computational challenges of conventional numerical methods and multiple scales of the model. To guarantee the network can operate uniformly in different regimes, it is desirable to carry the Asymptotic-Preservation (AP) property in the learning process. In a micro-macro decomposition framework, we design such an AP formulation of loss function. The convergence analysis of both the loss function and its neural network is shown, based on the Universal Approximation Theorem and hypocoercivity theory of the model equation. We show a series of numerical tests for forward and inverse problems of both the semiconductor Boltzmann and the Boltzmann-Poisson system to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, which addresses the significance of the AP property when dealing with inverse problems of multiscale Boltzmann equations especially when only sparse or partially observed data are available.</description>

      <title>Inverse scattering transform for the discrete nonlocal PT symmetric nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonzero boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the inverse scattering transform for the integrable discrete nonlocal PT symmetric nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with nonzero boundary conditions is presented. According to the two different signs of symmetry reduction and two different values of the phase difference between plus and minus infinity, we discuss four cases with significant differences about analytical regions, symmetry, asymptotic behavior and the presence or absence of discrete eigenvalues, namely, the existence or absence of soliton solutions. Therefore, in all cases, we study the direct scattering and inverse scattering problem, separately. The Riemann-Hilbert problem is constructed and solved as well as the reconstruction formula of potential is derived, respectively. Finally, combining the time evolution, we provide the dark, bright, dark-bright soliton solutions on the nonzero background in difference cases under the reflectionless condition.</description>

      <title>Transparent scatterers and transmission eigenvalues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {We give a short review of old and recent results on scatterers with transmission eigenvalues of infinite multiplicity, including transparent scatterers. Historically, these studies go back to the publications: Regge (Nuovo Cimento 14, 1959), Newton (J. Math. Phys. 3, 1962) and Sabatier (J. Math. Phys. 7, 1966). Our review is based on the works: Grinevich, Novikov (Commun. Math. Phys. 174, 1995; Eurasian Journal of Mathematical and Computer Applications 9(4), 2021; Russian Math. Surveys, 77(6), 2022). Results of the first of these works include examples of transparent at fixed energy potentials from the Schwartz class in two dimensions. The two others works include the result that, for compactly supported multipoint potentials of Bethe - Peierls - Thomas type in two and three dimensions, any positive energy is a transmission eigenvalue of infinite multiplicity.</description>

      <title>Eventually entanglement breaking quantum dynamics and eventual EB-divisibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new concept of eventually entanglement breaking divisible (eEB-divisible) dynamics is introduced. A dynamical map is eEB-divisible if any propagator becomes entanglement breaking in finite time. It turns out that any completely positive dynamical semigroup with a unique faithful stationary state enjoys this property. Interestingly, it is shown that eEB-divisibility is quite general and holds for a pretty large class of quantum evolutions.</description>

      <title>Weyl Calculus and Exactly Solvable Schr\"{o}dinger Bridges with Quadratic State Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Schr\"{o}dinger bridge--a stochastic dynamical generalization of optimal mass transport--exhibits a learning-control duality. Viewed as a stochastic control problem, the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge finds an optimal control policy that steers a given joint state statistics to another while minimizing the total control effort subject to controlled diffusion and deadline constraints. Viewed as a stochastic learning problem, the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge finds the most-likely distribution-valued trajectory connecting endpoint distributional observations, i.e., solves the two point boundary-constrained maximum likelihood problem over the manifold of probability distributions. Recent works have shown that solving the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem with state cost requires finding the Markov kernel associated with a reaction-diffusion PDE where the state cost appears as a state-dependent reaction rate. We explain how ideas from Weyl calculus in quantum mechanics, specifically the Weyl operator and the Weyl symbol, can help determine such Markov kernels. We illustrate these ideas by explicitly finding the Markov kernel for the case of quadratic state cost via Weyl calculus, recovering our earlier results but avoiding tedious computation with Hermite polynomials.</description>

      <title>Miura operators as R-matrices from M-brane intersections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15990v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose that Miura operators are R-matrices of certain infinite-dimensional quantum algebras. We test our proposal by realizing Miura operators of $q$-deformed $W$- and $Y$-algebras in terms of R-matrices of the quantum toroidal algebra of $\mathfrak{gl}(1)$. Physically, the representations of this toroidal algebra arise from the algebra of local operators on M2-branes and M5-branes, in M-theory subject to an $\Omega$-background. We associate an R-matrix to each M2-M5 brane crossing, by studying its description as a gauge-invariant intersection of a topological line defect and a holomorphic surface defect in 5-dimensional non-commutative Chern-Simons theory. The Miura transformation is engineered using multiple M2-M5 intersections, relying crucially on the properties of the underlying R-matrices. We thereby identify each R-matrix with a Miura operator. In a dual Type IIB frame, the components of the Miura transformation are shown to coincide with the half-index of a 3d supersymmetric gauge theory on a Hanany-Witten system of D3-NS5 branes. As a further application, we demonstrate that $qq$-characters can be algebraically constructed from the Miura transformation.</description>

      <title>Exact Expressions For Infinitely Many Weil-Petersson Volumes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weil-Petersson volumes are the volumes of the moduli spaces of bordered Riemann surfaces and have played an important role in the relationship between two-dimensional quantum gravity and algebraic geometry. In the last couple years progress has been made to understand their role in the context of matrix models, where it is possible to define a generalization of the volumes in terms of an infinite set of coupling constants $t_k$. Using a recent open string matrix model construction we calculate the generalized Weil-Petersson volumes for fixed genus $g = 0,1$ and an arbitrary number of boundaries $n$. Both results are expressed in terms of the perturbative expansion of the solution to the string equation of the matrix model in the closed string sector. The formalism has the added benefit of applying to type 0A superstring matrix models with nonzero Ramond-Ramond flux.</description>

      <title>Quantum Detection of Recurrent Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum dynamics that explores an unexpectedly small fraction of Hilbert space is inherently interesting. Integrable systems, quantum scars, MBL, hidden tensor structures, and systems with gauge symmetries are examples. Beyond dimension and volume, spectral features such as an $O(1)$-density of periodic eigenvalues can also imply observable recurrence. Low volume dynamics will recur near its initial state $| \psi_0\rangle$ more rapidly, i.e. $\lVert\mathrm{U}^k | \psi_0\rangle - | \psi_0\rangle \rVert &lt; \epsilon$ is more likely to occur for modest values of $k$, when the (forward) orbit $\operatorname{closure}(\{\mathrm{U}^k\}_{k=1,2,\dots})$ is of relatively low dimension $d$ and relatively small $d$-volume. We describe simple quantum algorithms to detect such approximate recurrence. Applications include detection of certain cases of hidden tensor factorizations $\mathrm{U} \cong V^\dagger(\mathrm{U}_1\otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{U}_n)V$. "Hidden" refers to an unknown conjugation, e.g. $\mathrm{U}_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{U}_v \rightarrow V^\dagger(\mathrm{U}_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathrm{U}_n)V$, which will obscure the low-volume nature of the dynamics. Hidden tensor structures have been observed to emerge both in a high energy context of operator-level spontaneous symmetry breaking [FSZ21a, FSZ21b, FSZ21c, SZBF23], and at the opposite end of the intellectual world in linguistics [Smo09, MLDS19]. We collect some observations on the computational difficulty of locating these structures and detecting related spectral information. A technical result, Appendix A, is that the language describing unitary circuits with no spectral gap (NUSG) around 1 is QMA-complete. Appendix B connects the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem to hidden tensor structures.</description>

      <title>Coplanarity of rooted spanning-tree vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Employing a recent technology of tree surgery we prove a ``deletion-constriction'' formula for products of rooted spanning trees on weighted directed graphs that generalizes deletion-contraction on undirected graphs. The formula implies that, letting $\tau_x^\varnothing$, $\tau_x^+$, and $\tau_x^-$ be the rooted spanning tree polynomials obtained respectively by removing an edge in both directions or by forcing the tree to pass through either direction of that edge, the vectors $(\tau_x^\varnothing, \tau_x^+, \tau_x^-)$ are coplanar for all roots $x$. We deploy the result to give an alternative derivation of a recently found mutual linearity of stationary currents of Markov chains. We generalize deletion-constriction and current linearity among two edges, and conjecture that similar results may hold for arbitrary subsets of edges.</description>

      <title>Feigenbaum universality in subcritical Taylor-Couette flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16097v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Feigenbaum universality is shown to occur in subcritical shear flows. Our testing ground is the counter-rotation regime of the Taylor-Couette flow, where numerical calculations are performed within a small periodic domain. The accurate computation of up to the seventh period doubling bifurcation, assisted by a purposely defined Poincar\'e section, has enabled the estimation of the two Feigenbaum universal constants with unprecedented accuracy in a fluid flow problem. We have further devised a method to predict the bifurcation diagram up to the accumulation point of the cascade based on the detailed inspection of just the first few period doubling bifurcations. Remarkably, the method is applicable beyond the accumulation point, with predictions remaining valid, in a statistical sense, for the chaotic dynamics that follows.</description>

      <title>Trickle-Down in Localization Schemes and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trickle-down is a phenomenon in high-dimensional expanders with many important applications -- for example, it is a key ingredient in various constructions of high-dimensional expanders or the proof of rapid mixing for the basis exchange walk on matroids and in the analysis of log-concave polynomials. We formulate a generalized trickle-down equation in the abstract context of linear-tilt localization schemes. Building on this generalization, we improve the best-known results for several Markov chain mixing or sampling problems -- for example, we improve the threshold up to which Glauber dynamics is known to mix rapidly in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass model. Other applications of our framework include improved mixing results for the Langevin dynamics in the $O(N)$ model, and near-linear time sampling algorithms for the antiferromagnetic and fixed-magnetization Ising models on expanders. For the latter application, we use a new dynamics inspired by polarization, a technique from the theory of stable polynomials.</description>

      <title>Integrable Higher-Spin Deformations of Sigma Models from Auxiliary Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a new infinite family of integrable deformations of the principal chiral model (PCM) parameterized by an interaction function of several variables, which extends the formalism of arXiv:2405.05899, and includes deformations of the PCM by functions of both the stress tensor and higher-spin conserved currents. We show in detail that every model in this class admits a Lax representation for its equations of motion, and that the Poisson bracket of the Lax connection takes the Maillet form, establishing the existence of an infinite set of Poisson-commuting conserved charges. We argue that the non-Abelian T-dual of any model in this family is classically integrable, and that T-duality "commutes" with a general deformation in this class, in a sense which we make precise. Finally, we demonstrate that these higher-spin auxiliary field deformations can be extended to accommodate the addition of a Wess-Zumino term, and we exhibit the Lax connection in this case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study time-periodic solutions for the cubic wave equation on an interval with Dirichlet boundary conditions. We begin by following the perturbative construction of Vernov and Khrustalev and provide a rigorous derivation of the fourth-order expansion in small amplitude, which we use to verify the Galerkin scheme. In the main part, we focus on exploring large solutions numerically. We find an intricate bifurcation structure of time-periodic solutions forming a fractal-like pattern and explore it for the first time. Our results suggest that time-periodic solutions exist for arbitrary frequencies, with appearance of fine bifurcation structure likely related to the Cantor set families of solutions described in previous rigorous works.</description>

Abstract: We investigate a Hamiltonian with radial potential wells and an Aharonov-Bohm vector potential with two poles. Assuming that the potential wells are symmetric, we derive the semi-classical asymptotics of the splitting between the ground and second state energies. The flux effects due to the Aharonov-Bohm vector potential are of lower order compared to the contributions coming from the potential wells.</description>

      <title>Energy cascade and "Burgulence" in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of initial long-wavelength excitations of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain has been the subject of intense investigations since the pioneering work of Fermi and collaborators. We have recently found a new regime where the spectrum of the Fourier modes decays with a power-law and we have interpreted this regime as a transient turbulence associated with the Burgers equation. In this paper we present the full derivation of the latter equation from the lattice dynamics using a newly developed infinite dimensional Hamiltonian perturbation theory. This theory allows us to relate the time evolution of the Fourier spectrum $E_k$ of the Burgers equation to the one of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chain. As a consequence, we derive analytically both the shock time and the power-law $-8/3$ of the spectrum at this time. Using the shock time as a unit, we follow numerically the time-evolution of the spectrum and observe the persistence of the power $-2$ over an extensive time window. The exponent $-2$ has been widely discussed in the literature on the Burgers equation. The analysis of the Burgers equation in Fourier space also gives information on the time evolution of the energy of each single mode which, at short time, is also a power-law depending on the $k$-th wavenumber $E_k \sim t^{2k-2}$. This approach to the FPUT dynamics opens the way to a wider study of scaling regimes arising from more general initial conditions.</description>

      <title>$2D$ vorticity Euler equations: Superposition solutions and nonlinear Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we contribute two results to the theory of the $2D$ Euler equations in vorticity form on the full plane. First, we establish a generalized Lagrangian representation of weak (in general measure-valued) solutions, which includes and extends classical results on the Lagrangianity of weak solutions. Second, we construct nonlinear Markov processes which are uniquely determined by a selection of weak solutions from initial data in $L^1\cap L^p$, $p \geq 2$, and related spaces such as the classical and uniformly localized Yudovich space. It is well-known that for $p &lt;\infty$ weak solutions are in general not unique, which renders a suitable selection nontrivial.</description>

      <title>Lieb-Robinson bounds in the continuum via localized frames</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15670v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of interacting fermions in the continuum. Our approach uses the concept of lattice-localized frames, which we introduce here. We first prove a Lieb-Robinson bound that is valid for a general class of local interactions, which implies the existence of the dynamics at the level of the CAR algebra. We then turn to the physical situation relevant to the (fractional) quantum Hall effect, namely the quasi-free second quantized Landau Hamiltonian to which electron-electron interactions can be added.</description>

      <title>A Proof of Onsager's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.08301</link>
      <description>arXiv:1608.08301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any $\alpha &lt; 1/3$, we construct weak solutions to the $3D$ incompressible Euler equations in the class $C_tC_x^\alpha$ that have nonempty, compact support in time on ${\mathbb R} \times {\mathbb T}^3$ and therefore fail to conserve the total kinetic energy. This result, together with the proof of energy conservation for $\alpha &gt; 1/3$ due to [Eyink] and [Constantin, E, Titi], solves Onsager's conjecture that the exponent $\alpha = 1/3$ marks the threshold for conservation of energy for weak solutions in the class $L_t^\infty C_x^\alpha$. The previous best results were solutions in the class $C_tC_x^\alpha$ for $\alpha &lt; 1/5$, due to the author, and in the class $L_t^1 C_x^\alpha$ for $\alpha &lt; 1/3$ due to Buckmaster, De Lellis and Sz\'{e}kelyhidi, both based on the method of convex integration developed for the incompressible Euler equations by De Lellis and Sz\'ekelyhidi. The present proof combines the method of convex integration and a new "gluing approximation" technique. The convex integration part of the proof relies on the "Mikado flows" introduced by [Daneri, Sz\'ekelyhidi] and the framework of estimates developed in the author's previous work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1908.00832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the first article in a series of two papers in which we study the Temperleyan dimer model on an arbitrary bounded Riemann surface of finite topolgical type. The end goal of both papers is to prove the convergence of height fluctuations to a universal and conformally invariant scaling limit. In this part we show that the dimer model on the Temperleyan superposition of a graph embedded on the surface and its dual is well posed, provided that we remove an appropriate number of punctures. We further show that the resulting dimer configuration is in bijection with an object which we call Temperleyan forest, whose law is characterised in terms of a certain topological condition. Finally we discuss the relation between height differences and Temperleyan forest, and give a criterion guaranteeing the convergence of the height fluctuations in terms of the Temperleyan forest.</description>

      <title>Quantum estimation bound of Gaussian matrix permanent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.01328v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exact calculation and even multiplicative error estimation of matrix permanent are challenging for both classical and quantum computers. Regarding the permanents of random Gaussian matrices, the additive error estimation is closely linked to boson sampling, and achieving multiplicative error estimation requires exponentially many samplings. Our newly developed formula for matrix permanents and its corresponding quantum expression have enabled better estimation of the average additive error for random Gaussian matrices compared to Gurvits' classical sampling algorithm. The well-known Ryser formula has been converted into a quantum permanent estimator. When dealing with real random Gaussian square matrices of size $N$, the quantum estimator can approximate the matrix permanent with an additive error smaller than $\epsilon(\sqrt{\mathrm{e}N})^{N}$, where $\epsilon$ is the estimation precision. In contrast, Gurvits' classical sampling algorithm has an estimation error of $\epsilon(2\sqrt{N})^{N}$, which is exponentially larger ($1.2^{N}$) than the quantum method. As expected, the quantum additive error bound fails to reach the multiplicative error bound of $(2\pi N)^{1/4}\epsilon(\sqrt{N/\mathrm{e}})^{N}$. Additionally, the quantum permanent estimator can be up to quadratically faster than the classical estimator when using quantum phase estimation-based amplitude estimation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.09875v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a bounded Riemann surface $M$ of finite topological type, we show the existence of a universal and conformally invariant scaling limit for the Temperleyan cycle-rooted spanning forest on any sequence of graphs which approximate $M$ in a reasonable sense (essentially, the invariance principle holds and the walks satisfy a crossing assumption). In combination with the companion paper arxiv:1908.00832, this proves the existence of a universal, conformally invariant scaling limit for the height function of the Temperleyan dimer model on such graphs. Along the way, we describe the relationship between Temperleyan CRSFs and loop measures, and develop tools of independent interest to study the latter using only rough control on the random walk</description>

      <title>Non--adiabatic effects lead to the breakdown of the semi-classical phonon concept</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.09869v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phonon properties of realistic materials are routinely calculated within the Density Functional Perturbation Theory\,(DFPT). This is a semi--classical approach where the atoms are assumed to oscillate along classical trajectories immersed in the electronic Kohn--Sham density, treated quantistically. In this work I demonstrate that, in metals, non--adiabatic effects induce a gap between the DFTP phonon frequencies and the fully quantistic solution of the phonon Dyson equation. A gap that increases with the phonon energy width reflecting the breakdown of the semi--classical DFPT description. The final message is that non--adiabatic phonon effects can be included only by using a fully quantistic approach.</description>

      <title>Numerical Validation for a Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard System in a Porous Medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Having a finite interfacial thickness, the phase-field models supply a way to model the fluid interfaces, which allows the calculations of the interface movements and deformations on the fixed grids. Such modeling is applied to the computation of two-phase incompressible Stokes flows in this paper, leading to a system of Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard equations. The Stokes equation is modified by adding the continuum force $ - c \nabla w $, where $ c $ is the order parameter and $ w $ is the chemical potential of $ c $. Similarly, the advection effects are modeled by addition of the term $ \vec{u} \cdot \nabla c $ in the Cahn-Hilliard equation. We hereby discuss how the solutions to the above equations approach the original sharp interface Stokes equation as the interfacial thickness $ \varepsilon$ tends to zero. We start with a microscopic model and then the homogenized or upscaled version to the same from author's previous work, cf. \cite{lakhmara2022}, where the analysis and homogenization of the system have been performed in detail. Further, we perform the numerical computations to compare the outcome of the effective model with the original heterogeneous microscale model.</description>

      <title>A micro-scale diffused interface model with Flory-Huggins logarithmic potential in a porous medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.01527v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A diffused interface model describing the evolution of two conterminous incompressible fluids in a porous medium is discussed. The system consists of the Cahn-Hilliard equation with Flory-Huggins logarithmic potential, coupled via surface tension term with the evolutionary Stokes equation at the pore scale. An evolving diffused interface of finite thickness, depending on the scale parameter $\varepsilon$ separates the fluids. The model is studied in a bounded domain $\Omega$ with a sufficiently smooth boundary $\partial \Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for $ d = 2 $, $3$. At first, we investigate the existence of the system at the micro-scale and derive the essential \textit{a-priori} estimates. Then, using the two-scale convergence approach and unfolding operator technique, we obtain the homogenized model for the microscopic one.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05763v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a mathematical description, based on d-wave Eliashberg theory, of the strong correlation between the experimentally observed softening of Raman modes associated with in-plane oxygen motions and the corresponding superconducting critical temperature $T_c$, as a function of oxygen doping $x$, in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_x$. The theoretical model provides a direct link between physical trends of soft optical $A_g$ (in-plane) oxygen modes, the level of oxygen doping $x$, and the superconducting $T_c$. Different regimes observed in the trend of $T_c$ vs doping can be related to corresponding regimes of optical phonon softening in the Raman spectra. These results provide further evidence related to the physical origin of high-temperature superconductivity in rare-earth cuprate oxides and to the significant role of electron-phonon coupling therein.</description>

Abstract: The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations are considered. We find that there exist infinite non-trivial solutions of static Euler equations. Moreover there exist random solutions of static Euler equations. Provided Reynolds number is large enough and time variable $t$ goes to infinity, these random solutions of static Euler equations are the path limits of corresponding Navier-Stokes flows. But the double limit of these Navier-Stokes flows do not exist. Therefore these solutions are called turbulent solutions.</description>

Abstract: Partially motivated by the fact that the grand partition function of the ABJM theory or its generalization is expressed by a spectral operator enjoying symmetries of the Weyl group, it was found that the grand partition function satisfies the q-Painleve equation, which is constructed from the affine Weyl group. In this paper we clarify the affine symmetries of the grand partition function. With the affine symmetries, we find that the grand partition function extends naturally outside the fundamental domain of duality cascades and once the Painleve equation holds in the fundamental domain, so does it outside.</description>

      <title>A discontinuous Galerkin / cohesive zone model approach for the computational modeling of fracture in geometrically exact slender beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Slender beams are often employed as constituents in engineering materials and structures. Prior experiments on lattices of slender beams have highlighted their complex failure response, where the interplay between buckling and fracture plays a critical role. In this paper, we introduce a novel computational approach for modeling fracture in slender beams subjected to large deformations. We adopt a state-of-the-art geometrically exact Kirchhoff beam formulation to describe the finite deformations of beams in three-dimensions. We develop a discontinuous Galerkin finite element discretization of the beam governing equations, incorporating discontinuities in the position and tangent degrees of freedom at the inter-element boundaries of the finite elements. Before fracture initiation, we enforce compatibility of nodal positions and tangents weakly, via the exchange of variationally-consistent forces and moments at the interfaces between adjacent elements. At the onset of fracture, these forces and moments transition to cohesive laws modeling interface failure. We conduct a series of numerical tests to verify our computational framework against a set of benchmarks and we demonstrate its ability to capture the tensile and bending fracture modes in beams exhibiting large deformations. Finally, we present the validation of our framework against fracture experiments of dry spaghetti rods subjected to sudden relaxation of curvature.</description>

      <title>Clustering of negative topological charge precedes plastic failure in 3D glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15359v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deformation mechanism in amorphous solids subjected to external shear remains poorly understood because of the absence of well-defined topological defects mediating the plastic deformation. The notion of soft spots has emerged as a useful tool to characterize the onset of irreversible rearrangements and plastic flow, but these entities are not clearly defined in terms of geometry and topology. In this study, we unveil the phenomenology of recently discovered, precisely defined topological defects governing the microscopic mechanical and yielding behavior of a model 3D glass under shear deformation. We identify the existence of vortex-like and anti-vortex-like topological defects within the 3D non-affine displacement field. The number density of these defects exhibits a significant anti-correlation with the plastic events, with defect proliferation-annihilation cycles matching the alternation of elastic-like segments and catastrophic plastic drops, respectively. Furthermore, we observe collective annihilation of these point-like defects via plastic events, with large local topological charge fluctuations in the vicinity of regions that feature strong non-affine displacements. We reveal that plastic yielding is driven by several large sized clusters of net negative topological charge, the massive annihilation of which triggers the onset of plastic flow. These findings suggest a geometric and topological characterization of soft spots and pave the way for the mechanistic understanding of topological defects as mediators of plastic deformation in glassy materials.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we examine the electron interaction within tilted anisotropic Dirac materials when subjected to external electric and magnetic fields possessing translational symmetry. Specifically, we focus on a distinct non-zero electric field magnitude, enabling the decoupling of the differential equation system inherent in the eigenvalue problem. Subsequently, employing supersymmetric quantum mechanics facilitates the determination of eigenstates and eigenvalues corresponding to the Hamiltonian operator. To delve into a semi-classical analysis of the system, we identify a set of coherent states. Finally, we assess the characteristics of these states using fidelity and the phase-space representation through the Wigner function.</description>
