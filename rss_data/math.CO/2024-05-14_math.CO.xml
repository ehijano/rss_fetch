      <title>On the affine permutation group of certain decreasing Cartesian codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A decreasing Cartesian code is defined by evaluating a monomial set closed under divisibility on a Cartesian set. Some well-known examples are the Reed-Solomon, Reed-Muller, and (some) toric codes. The affine permutations consist of the permutations of the code that depend on an affine transformation. In this work, we study the affine permutations of some decreasing Cartesian codes, including the case when the Cartesian set has copies of multiplicative or additive subgroups.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics of bivariate algebraico-logarithmic generating functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive asymptotic formulae for the coefficients of bivariate generating functions with algebraic and logarithmic factors. Logarithms appear when encoding cycles of combinatorial objects, and also implicitly when objects can be broken into indecomposable parts. Asymptotics are quickly computable and can verify combinatorial properties of sequences and assist in randomly generating objects. While multiple approaches for algebraic asymptotics have recently emerged, we find that the contour manipulation approach can be extended to these D-finite generating functions.</description>

      <title>Generalized planar Tur\'an numbers related to short cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two graphs $H$ and $F$, the generalized planar Tur\'an number $\mathrm{ex}_\mathcal{P}(n,H,F)$ is the maximum number of copies of $H$ that an $n$-vertex $F$-free planar graph can have. We investigate this function when $H$ and $F$ are short cycles. Namely, for large $n$, we find the exact value of $\mathrm{ex}_\mathcal{P}(n, C_l,C_3)$, where $C_l$ is a cycle of length $l$, for $4\leq l\leq 6$, and determine the extremal graphs in each case. Also, considering the converse of these problems, we determine sharp upper bounds for $\mathrm{ex}_\mathcal{P}(n,C_3,C_l)$, for $4\leq l\leq 6$.</description>

      <title>Tree walks and the spectrum of random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a classic result in spectral theory that the limit distribution of the spectral measure of random graphs G(n, p) converges to the semicircle law in case np tends to infinity with n. The spectral measure for random graphs G(n, c/n) however is less understood. In this work, we combine and extend two combinatorial approaches by Bauer and Golinelli (2001) and Enriquez and Menard (2016) and approximate the moments of the spectral measure by counting walks that span trees.</description>

      <title>From linear programming to colliding particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although simplices are trivial from a linear optimization standpoint, the simplex algorithm can exhibit quite complex behavior. In this paper we study the behavior of max-slope pivot rules on (products of) simplices and describe the associated pivot rule polytopes. For simplices, the pivot rule polytopes are combinatorially isomorphic to associahedra. To prove this correspondence, we interpret max-slope pivot rules in terms of the combinatorics of colliding particles on a line. For prisms over simplices, we recover Stasheff's multiplihedra. For products of two simplices we get new realizations of constrainahedra, that capture the combinatorics of certain particle systems in the plane.</description>

      <title>On the Paley RIP and Paley graph extractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing explicit RIP matrices is an open problem in compressed sensing theory. In particular, it is quite challenging to construct explicit RIP matrices that break the square-root bottleneck. On the other hand, providing explicit $2$-source extractors is a fundamental problem in theoretical computer science, cryptography and combinatorics. Nowadays, there are only a few known constructions for explicit $2$-source extractors (with negligible errors) that break the half barrier for min-entropy.
  In this paper, we establish a new connection between RIP matrices breaking the square-root bottleneck and $2$-source extractors breaking the half barrier for min-entropy. Here we focus on an RIP matrix (called the Paley ETF) and a $2$-source extractor (called the Paley graph extractor), where both are defined from quadratic residues over the finite field of odd prime order $p\equiv 1 \pmod{4}$. As a main result, we prove that if the Paley ETF breaks the square-root bottleneck, then the Paley graph extractor breaks the half barrier for min-entropy as well. Since it is widely believed that the Paley ETF breaks the square-root bottleneck, our result accordingly provides a new affirmative intuition on the conjecture for the Paley graph extractor by Benny Chor and Oded Goldreich.</description>

      <title>Partial order on involutive permutations and double Schubert cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As shown by A. Melnikov, the orbits of a Borel subgroup acting by conjugation on upper-triangular matrices with square zero are indexed by involutions in the symmetric group. The inclusion relation among the orbit closures defines a partial order on involutions. We observe that the same order on involutive permutations also arises while describing the inclusion order on B-orbit closures in the direct product of two Grassmannians. We establish a geometric relation between these two settings.</description>

      <title>The Connectedness Homomorphism between Discrete Morse Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given two discrete Morse functions on a simplicial complex, we introduce the {\em connectedness homomorphism} between the corresponding discrete Morse complexes. This concept leads to a novel framework for studying the connectedness in discrete Morse theory at the chain complex level. In particular, we apply it to describe a discrete analogy to `cusp-degeneration' of Morse complexes. A precise comparison between smooth case and our discrete cases is also given.</description>

Abstract: Consider a graph on the non-singular matrices over a finite field, in which two distinct non-singular matrices are joined by an edge whenever their sum is singular. We prove an upper bound for the independence number of this graph. As a consequence, we obtain a lower bound for its chromatic number that significantly improves a previous result of Tomon.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A totally efficient coloring of a regular graph with color set formed by one unit more than its degree is a total coloring in which each vertex color class is an efficient dominating set, that is a perfect code. We find that the 3-cube graph has a totally efficient coloring and conjecture that this is the only existing case of a totally effective color We also deal with a related problem exemplified by star transposition graphs and related graphs, leading to edge-girth colorings on their prism graphs.</description>

      <title>Two questions on Kneser colorings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate two questions on Kneser graphs $KG_{n,k}$. First, we prove that the union of $s$ non-trivial intersecting families in ${[n]\choose k}$ has size at most ${n\choose k}-{n-s\choose k}$ for all sufficiently large $n$ that satisfy $n&gt;(2+\epsilon)k^2$ with $\epsilon&gt;0$. We provide an example that shows that this result is essentially tight for the number of colors close to $\chi(KG_{n,k})=n-2k+2$. We also improve the result of Bulankina and Kupavskii on the choice chromatic number, showing that it is at least $\frac 1{16} n\log n$ for all $k&lt;\sqrt n$ and $n$ sufficiently large.</description>

      <title>Homogeneous spaces of semidirect products and finite Gelfand pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $K\leq H$ be two finite groups and let $C\leq A$ be two finite abelian groups, with $H$ acting on $A$ as a group of isomorphisms admitting $C$ as a $K$-invariant subgroup. We study the homogeneous space $X\coloneqq\left(H\ltimes A\right)/\left(K\ltimes C\right)$ and determine the decomposition of the permutation representation of $H\ltimes A$ acting on $X$. We then characterize when this is multiplicity-free, that is, when $\left(H\ltimes A,K\ltimes C\right)$ is a Gelfand pair. If this is the case, we explicitly calculate the corresponding spherical functions. From our general construction and related analysis, we recover Dunkl's results on the $q$-analog of the nonbinary Johnson scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the story of the Rogers-Ramanujan identities; being known for 85 years and having about 130 pure mathematics proofs, suddenly entering physics when Rodney Baxter solved the Hard Hexagon Model in Statistical Mechanics in 1980. We next cover the accompanying proofs by George E Andrews of other related Baxter identities arisen of Rogers-Ramanujan type, leading into a new flourishing partnership of Physics and Mathematics. Our narrative goes into the subsequent 44 years, explaining the progress in physics and mathematical analysis. Finally we show some related crossovers with regard to the Elliptic q-gamma function and some Vector Partition generating functional equations; the latter of which may be new. The present paper is essentially chapter 11 of a 32 chapter book to appear in June 2024.</description>

      <title>On Maximal Families of Binary Polynomials with Pairwise Linear Common Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the construction of maximal families of polynomials over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, all having the same degree $n$ and a nonzero constant term, where the degree of the GCD of any two polynomials is $d$ with $1 \le d\le n$. The motivation for this problem lies in a recent construction for subspace codes based on cellular automata. More precisely, the minimum distance of such subspace codes relates to the maximum degree $d$ of the pairwise GCD in this family of polynomials. Hence, characterizing the maximal families of such polynomials is equivalent to determining the maximum cardinality of the corresponding subspace codes for a given minimum distance. We first show a lower bound on the cardinality of such families, and then focus on the specific case where $d=1$. There, we characterize the maximal families of polynomials over the binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$. Our findings prompt several more open questions, which we plan to address in an extended version of this work.</description>

      <title>Explicit Orthogonal Arrays and Universal Hashing with Arbitrary Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orthogonal arrays are a type of combinatorial design that were developed in the 1940s in the design of statistical experiments. In 1947, Rao proved a lower bound on the size of any orthogonal array, and raised the problem of constructing arrays of minimum size. Kuperberg, Lovett and Peled (2017) gave a non-constructive existence proof of orthogonal arrays whose size is near-optimal (i.e., within a polynomial of Rao's lower bound), leaving open the question of an algorithmic construction. We give the first explicit, deterministic, algorithmic construction of orthogonal arrays achieving near-optimal size for all parameters. Our construction uses algebraic geometry codes.
  In pseudorandomness, the notions of $t$-independent generators or $t$-independent hash functions are equivalent to orthogonal arrays. Classical constructions of $t$-independent hash functions are known when the size of the codomain is a prime power, but very few constructions are known for an arbitrary codomain. Our construction yields algorithmically efficient $t$-independent hash functions for arbitrary domain and codomain.</description>

      <title>Generalized Tuza's conjecture for random hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.04568v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A celebrated conjecture of Tuza states that in any finite graph the minimum size of a cover of triangles by edges is at most twice the maximum size of a set of edge-disjoint triangles. For an $r$-uniform hypergraph ($r$-graph) $G$, let $\tau(G)$ be the minimum size of a cover of edges by $(r-1)$-sets of vertices, and let $\nu(G)$ be the maximum size of a set of edges pairwise intersecting in fewer than $r-1$ vertices. Aharoni and Zerbib proposed the following generalization of Tuza's conjecture: $$ \text{For any $r$-graph $G$, $\tau(G)/\nu(G) \leq \lceil(r+1)/2\rceil$.} $$
  Let $H_r(n,p)$ be the uniformly random $r$-graph on $n$ vertices. We show that, for $r \in \{3, 4, 5\}$ and any $p = p(n)$, $H_r(n,p)$ satisfies the Aharoni-Zerbib conjecture with high probability (i.e., with probability approaching 1 as $n \rightarrow \infty$). We also show that there is a $C &lt; 1$ such that, for any $r \geq 6$ and any $p = p(n)$, $\tau(H_r(n, p))/\nu(H_r(n, p)) \leq C r$ with high probability. Furthermore, we may take $C &lt; 1/2 + \varepsilon$, for any $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, by restricting to sufficiently large $r$ (depending on $\varepsilon$).</description>

      <title>Bounded-Degree Planar Graphs Do Not Have Bounded-Degree Product Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.02388v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Product structure theorems are a collection of recent results that have been used to resolve a number of longstanding open problems on planar graphs and related graph classes. One particularly useful version states that every planar graph $G$ is contained in the strong product of a $3$-tree $H$, a path $P$, and a $3$-cycle $K_3$; written as $G\subseteq H\boxtimes P\boxtimes K_3$. A number of researchers have asked if this theorem can be strengthened so that the maximum degree in $H$ can be bounded by a function of the maximum degree in $G$. We show that no such strengthening is possible. Specifically, we describe an infinite family $\mathcal{G}$ of planar graphs of maximum degree $5$ such that, if an $n$-vertex member $G$ of $\mathcal{G}$ is isomorphic to a subgraph of $H\boxtimes P\boxtimes K_c$ where $P$ is a path and $H$ is a graph of maximum degree $\Delta$ and treewidth $t$, then $t\Delta c \ge 2^{\Omega(\sqrt{\log\log n})}$.</description>

      <title>Generalized Ramsey-Tur\'an Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Ramsey-Tur\'an problem for $K_p$ asks for the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex $K_p$-free graph with independence number $o(n)$. In a natural generalization of the problem, cliques larger than the edge $K_2$ are counted. Let {\bf RT}$(n,\#K_q,K_p,o(n))$ denote the maximum number of copies of $K_q$ in an $n$-vertex $K_p$-free graph with independence number $o(n)$. Balogh, Liu and Sharifzadeh determined the asymptotics of {\bf RT}$(n,\# K_3,K_p,o(n))$. In this paper we will establish the asymptotics for counting copies of $K_4$, $K_5$, and for the case $p \geq 5q$. We also provide a family of counterexamples to a conjecture of Balogh, Liu and Sharifzadeh.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2001.01108v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study various analogues of theorems from PL topology for cubical complexes. In particular, we characterize when two PL homeomorphic cubulations are equivalent by Pachner moves by showing the question to be equivalent to the existence of cobordisms between generic immersions of hypersurfaces. This solves a question and conjecture of Habegger and Funar.</description>

      <title>Tangles: a structural approach to artificial intelligence in the empirical sciences (Part I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.01830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional clustering identifies groups of objects that share certain qualities. Tangles do the converse: they identify groups of qualities that often occur together. They can thereby discover, relate, and structure types: of behaviour, political views, texts, or viruses.
  If desired, tangles can also be used as a new method for traditional clustering. They offer a precise, quantitative paradigm suited particularly to fuzzy clusters, since they do not require any assignment of objects to the clusters which these collectively form.
  This is the first of four parts of a book with the above title. The book explores applications outside mathematics of the notion and theory of tangles generalised from the graph tangles know from graph minor theory.</description>

      <title>A New Temporal Interpretation of Cluster Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.01103v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The NP-complete graph problem Cluster Editing seeks to transform a static graph into a disjoint union of cliques by making the fewest possible edits to the edges. We introduce a natural interpretation of this problem in temporal graphs, whose edge sets change over time. This problem is NP-complete even when restricted to temporal graphs whose underlying graph is a path, but we obtain two polynomial-time algorithms for restricted cases. In the static setting, it is well-known that a graph is a disjoint union of cliques if and only if it contains no induced copy of $P_3$; we demonstrate that no general characterisation involving sets of at most four vertices can exist in the temporal setting, but obtain a complete characterisation involving forbidden configurations on at most five vertices. This characterisation gives rise to an FPT algorithm parameterised simultaneously by the permitted number of modifications and the lifetime of the temporal graph.</description>

      <title>Watson-Crick conjugates of words and languages</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the concept of Watson-Crick conjugates, also known as $\theta$-conjugates, of words and languages. This concept extends the classical idea of conjugates by incorporating the Watson-Crick complementarity of DNA sequences, from the perspective of DNA computing. Our investigation initially focuses on the properties of $\theta$-conjugates of words. We then define $\theta$-conjugates of a language and study closure properties of certain families of languages under the $\theta$-conjugate operation. Furthermore, we analyze the iterated $\theta$-conjugate of both words and languages. Finally, we delve into the idea of $\theta$-conjugate-free languages and examine the decidability problems surrounding $\theta$-conjugate-freeness for different classes of languages</description>

      <title>Expanded-clique graphs and the domination problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ such that each vertex $v_i$ has a value $f(v_i)$, the expanded-clique graph $H$ is the graph where each vertex $v_i$ of $G$ becomes a clique $V_i$ of size $f(v_i)$ and for each edge $v_iv_j \in E(G)$, there is a vertex of $V_i$ adjacent to an exclusive vertex of $V_j$. In this work, among the results, we present two characterizations of the expanded-clique graphs, one of them leads to a linear-time recognition algorithm. Regarding the domination number, we show that this problem is \NP-complete for planar bipartite $3$-expanded-clique graphs and for cubic line graphs of bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Growth in products of matrices: fastest, average, and generic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let A and B be 2x2 matrices (over reals). Let w(A, B) be a word of length n. After evaluating w(A, B) as a product of matrices, we get a 2x2 matrix, call it W. What is the largest (by the absolute value) possible entry of W, over all w(A, B) of length n, as a function of n? What is the expected absolute value of the largest (by the absolute value) entry in a random product of n matrices, where each matrix is A or B with probability 0.5? What is the Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give partial answer to the first of these questions and an essentially complete answer to the second question. For the third question (the most difficult of the three), we offer a very simple method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent in the case where all entries of the matrices A and B are nonnegative.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for polylogarithmic graph distances in scale-free percolation and related models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study graph distances in the geometric random graph models scale-free percolation SFP, geometric inhomogeneous random graphs GIRG, and hyperbolic random graphs HRG. Despite the wide success of the models, the parameter regime in which graph distances are polylogarithmic is poorly understood. We provide new and improved lower bounds. In a certain portion of the parameter regime, those match the known upper bounds.
  Compared to the best previous lower bounds by Hao and Heydenreich, our result has several advantages: it gives matching bounds for a larger range of parameters, thus settling the question for a larger portion of the parameter space. It strictly improves the lower bounds by Hao and Heydenreich for all parameters settings in which those bounds were not tight. It gives tail bounds on the probability of having short paths, which imply shape theorems for the $k$-neighbourhood of a vertex whenever our lower bounds are tight, and tight bounds for the size of this $k$-neighbourhood. And last but not least, our proof is much simpler and not much longer than two pages, and we demonstrate that it generalizes well by showing that the same technique also works for first passage percolation.</description>
