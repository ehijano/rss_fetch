      <title>On sharp stable recovery from clipped and folded measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of vector recovery from random linear measurements which have been either clipped or folded. This is motivated by applications where measurement devices detect inputs outside of their effective range.
  As examples of our main results, we prove sharp lower bounds on the recovery constant for both the declipping and unfolding problems whenever samples are taken according to a uniform distribution on the sphere. Moreover, we show such estimates under (almost) the best possible conditions on both the number of samples and the distribution of the data. We then prove that all of the above results have suitable (effectively) sparse counterparts. In the special case that one restricts the stability analysis to vectors which belong to the unit sphere of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we show that the problem of declipping directly extends the one-bit compressed sensing results of Oymak-Recht and Plan-Vershynin.</description>

      <title>Efficient Channel Estimation for Rotatable Antenna-Enabled Wireless Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotatable antenna (RA) is a promising antenna architecture that exploits additional spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) to enhance the communication performance. To fully obtain the performance gain provided by RAs, accurate channel state information (CSI) is essential for adjusting the orientation/boresight of each antenna. In this letter, we propose an efficient channel estimation scheme for RA communication systems, where the base station (BS) can sequentially and adaptively adjust the orientations of RAs to enrich the environmental observations from diverse angular perspectives, thereby enhancing the channel estimation accuracy. The proposed scheme includes two main procedures that are conducted alternately during each channel training period. Specifically, the first procedure is to estimate the CSI with given RAs' orientations, involving the angle-of-arrivals (AoAs) information and path gains. Then, based on the estimated CSI, the second procedure adjusts the RAs' orientations to maximize the effective channel gain. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimation method outperforms other benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Exploration-Exploitation Tradeoff in Universal Lossy Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal compression can learn the source and adapt to it either in a batch mode (forward adaptation), or in a sequential mode (backward adaptation). We recast the sequential mode as a multi-armed bandit problem, a fundamental model in reinforcement-learning, and study the trade-off between exploration and exploitation in the lossy compression case. We show that a previously proposed "natural type selection" scheme can be cast as a reconstruction-directed MAB algorithm, for sequential lossy compression, and explain its limitations in terms of robustness and short-block performance. We then derive and analyze robust cost-directed MAB algorithms, which work at any block length.</description>

      <title>Efficient Feedback Design for Unsourced Random Access with Integrated Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an unsourced random access (URA) system enhanced with a feedback mechanism that serves both communication and sensing tasks. While traditional URA systems do not incorporate feedback, we propose a novel feedback signal design that announces the decoding status of users and simultaneously enables target sensing. To design this dual-purpose feedback, we introduce a modified projected gradient descent algorithm that minimizes a weighted combination of communication and sensing errors. Simulation results show that the proposed feedback design outperforms the state-of-the-art feedback design in the URA literature. Furthermore, we illustrate the trade-off between communication and sensing capabilities, offering valuable insight into balancing these two tasks.</description>

      <title>Finite-Time Information-Theoretic Bounds in Queueing Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the first finite-time information-theoretic lower bounds-and derive new policies that achieve them-for the total queue length in scheduling problems over stochastic processing networks with both adversarial and stochastic arrivals. Prior analyses of MaxWeight guarantee only stability and asymptotic optimality in heavy traffic; we prove that, at finite horizons, MaxWeight can incur strictly larger backlog by problem-dependent factors which we identify. Our main innovations are 1) a minimax framework that pinpoints the precise problem parameters governing any policy's finite-time performance; 2) an information-theoretic lower bound on total queue length; 3) fundamental limitation of MaxWeight that it is suboptimal in finite time; and 4) a new scheduling rule that minimizes the full Lyapunov drift-including its second-order term-thereby matching the lower bound under certain conditions, up to universal constants. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation on "drift-only" methods and points the way toward principled, non-asymptotic optimality in queueing control.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Task-oriented Semantic Communications with Model Inversion Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication has emerged as a promising neural network-based system design for 6G networks. Task-oriented semantic communication is a novel paradigm whose core goal is to efficiently complete specific tasks by transmitting semantic information, optimizing communication efficiency and task performance. The key challenge lies in preserving privacy while maintaining task accuracy, as this scenario is susceptible to model inversion attacks. In such attacks, adversaries can restore or even reconstruct input data by analyzing and processing model outputs, owing to the neural network-based nature of the systems. In addition, traditional systems use image quality indicators (such as PSNR or SSIM) to assess attack severity, which may be inadequate for task-oriented semantic communication, since visual differences do not necessarily ensure semantic divergence. In this paper, we propose a diffusion-based semantic communication framework, named DiffSem, that optimizes semantic information reconstruction through a diffusion mechanism with self-referential label embedding to significantly improve task performance. Our model also compensates channel noise and adopt semantic information distortion to ensure the robustness of the system in various signal-to-noise ratio environments. To evaluate the attacker's effectiveness, we propose a new metric that better quantifies the semantic fidelity of estimations from the adversary. Experimental results based on this criterion show that on the MNIST dataset, DiffSem improves the classification accuracy by 10.03%, and maintain stable performance under dynamic channels. Our results further demonstrate that significant deviation exists between traditional image quality indicators and the leakage of task-relevant semantic information.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Wireless Split Computing with Resonate-and-Fire Neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing offers an energy-efficient alternative to conventional deep learning accelerators for real-time time-series processing. However, many edge applications, such as wireless sensing and audio recognition, generate streaming signals with rich spectral features that are not effectively captured by conventional leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) spiking neurons. This paper investigates a wireless split computing architecture that employs resonate-and-fire (RF) neurons with oscillatory dynamics to process time-domain signals directly, eliminating the need for costly spectral pre-processing. By resonating at tunable frequencies, RF neurons extract time-localized spectral features while maintaining low spiking activity. This temporal sparsity translates into significant savings in both computation and transmission energy. Assuming an OFDM-based analog wireless interface for spike transmission, we present a complete system design and evaluate its performance on audio classification and modulation classification tasks. Experimental results show that the proposed RF-SNN architecture achieves comparable accuracy to conventional LIF-SNNs and ANNs, while substantially reducing spike rates and total energy consumption during inference and communication.</description>

      <title>The Graph Structure of a Class of Permutation Maps over Ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the periodic and structural properties of permutation maps over residue rings such as $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$ is a foundational challenge in algebraic dynamics and pseudorandom sequence analysis. Despite notable progress in characterizing global periods, a critical bottleneck remains: the lack of explicit tools to analyze local cycle structures and their evolution with increasing arithmetic precision. In this work, we propose a unified analytical framework to systematically derive the distribution of cycle lengths for a class of permutation maps over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$. The approach combines techniques from generating functions, minimal polynomials, and lifting theory to track how the cycle structure adapts as the modulus $p^k$ changes. To validate the generality and effectiveness of our method, we apply it to the well-known Cat map as a canonical example, revealing the exact patterns governing its cycle formation and transition. This analysis not only provides rigorous explanations for experimentally observed regularities in fixed-point implementations of such maps but also lays a theoretical foundation for evaluating the randomness and dynamical behavior of pseudorandom number sequences generated by other nonlinear maps. The results have broad implications for secure system design, computational number theory, and symbolic dynamics.</description>

      <title>POLAR: A Pessimistic Model-based Policy Learning Algorithm for Dynamic Treatment Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic treatment regimes (DTRs) provide a principled framework for optimizing sequential decision-making in domains where decisions must adapt over time in response to individual trajectories, such as healthcare, education, and digital interventions. However, existing statistical methods often rely on strong positivity assumptions and lack robustness under partial data coverage, while offline reinforcement learning approaches typically focus on average training performance, lack statistical guarantees, and require solving complex optimization problems. To address these challenges, we propose POLAR, a novel pessimistic model-based policy learning algorithm for offline DTR optimization. POLAR estimates the transition dynamics from offline data and quantifies uncertainty for each history-action pair. A pessimistic penalty is then incorporated into the reward function to discourage actions with high uncertainty. Unlike many existing methods that focus on average training performance, POLAR directly targets the suboptimality of the final learned policy and offers theoretical guarantees, without relying on computationally intensive minimax or constrained optimization procedures. To the best of our knowledge, POLAR is the first model-based DTR method to provide both statistical and computational guarantees, including finite-sample bounds on policy suboptimality. Empirical results on both synthetic data and the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that POLAR outperforms state-of-the-art methods and yields near-optimal, history-aware treatment strategies.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Wireless Channel Statistics with Ray Tracing and Uncalibrated Digital Twin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for predicting wireless channel statistics based on digital twin (DT) and ray tracing. The DT is derived from satellite images and is uncalibrated, as it does not assume precise information on the electromagnetic properties of the materials in the environment. The uncalibrated DT is utilized to derive a geometric prior that informs a Gaussian process (GP) and thereby predict channel statistics using only a few measurements. The framework also quantifies uncertainty, offering statistical guarantees for rate selection in ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). Experimental validation demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed framework using measurement data.</description>

      <title>Distributed satellite information networks: Architecture, enabling technologies, and trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12587v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driven by the vision of ubiquitous connectivity and wireless intelligence, the evolution of ultra-dense constellation-based satellite-integrated Internet is underway, now taking preliminary shape. Nevertheless, the entrenched institutional silos and limited, nonrenewable heterogeneous network resources leave current satellite systems struggling to accommodate the escalating demands of next-generation intelligent applications. In this context, the distributed satellite information networks (DSIN), exemplified by the cohesive clustered satellites system, have emerged as an innovative architecture, bridging information gaps across diverse satellite systems, such as communication, navigation, and remote sensing, and establishing a unified, open information network paradigm to support resilient space information services. This survey first provides a profound discussion about innovative network architectures of DSIN, encompassing distributed regenerative satellite network architecture, distributed satellite computing network architecture, and reconfigurable satellite formation flying, to enable flexible and scalable communication, computing and control. The DSIN faces challenges from network heterogeneity, unpredictable channel dynamics, sparse resources, and decentralized collaboration frameworks. To address these issues, a series of enabling technologies is identified, including channel modeling and estimation, cloud-native distributed MIMO cooperation, grant-free massive access, network routing, and the proper combination of all these diversity techniques. Furthermore, to heighten the overall resource efficiency, the cross-layer optimization techniques are further developed to meet upper-layer deterministic, adaptive and secure information services requirements. In addition, emerging research directions and new opportunities are highlighted on the way to achieving the DSIN vision.</description>

Abstract: This work presents a massive SIMO scheme for wireless communications with one-shot noncoherent detection. It is based on permutational index modulation over OFDM. Its core principle is to convey information on the ordering in which a fixed collection of values is mapped onto a set of OFDM subcarriers. A spherical code is obtained which provides improved robustness against channel impairments. A simple detector based on the sorting of quadratic metrics of data is proposed. By exploiting statistical channel state information and hardening, it reaches near-ML error performance with a low-complexity implementation.</description>

      <title>Curved representational Bregman divergences and their applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By analogy to curved exponential families in statistics, we define curved Bregman divergences as Bregman divergences restricted to nonlinear parameter subspaces. We show that the barycenter of a finite weighted set of parameters under a curved Bregman divergence amounts to the right Bregman projection onto the nonlinear subspace of the barycenter with respect to the full Bregman divergence. We demonstrate the significance of curved Bregman divergences with two examples: (1) symmetrized Bregman divergences and (2) the Kullback-Leibler divergence between circular complex normal distributions. We then consider monotonic embeddings to define representational curved Bregman divergences and show that the $\alpha$-divergences are representational curved Bregman divergences with respect to $\alpha$-embeddings of the probability simplex into the positive measure cone. As an application, we report an efficient method to calculate the intersection of a finite set of $\alpha$-divergence spheres.</description>

      <title>In-Context Learning for Gradient-Free Receiver Adaptation: Principles, Applications, and Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning has facilitated the creation of wireless receivers capable of functioning effectively in conditions that challenge traditional model-based designs. Leveraging programmable hardware architectures, deep learning-based receivers offer the potential to dynamically adapt to varying channel environments. However, current adaptation strategies, including joint training, hypernetwork-based methods, and meta-learning, either demonstrate limited flexibility or necessitate explicit optimization through gradient descent. This paper presents gradient-free adaptation techniques rooted in the emerging paradigm of in-context learning (ICL). We review architectural frameworks for ICL based on Transformer models and structured state-space models (SSMs), alongside theoretical insights into how sequence models effectively learn adaptation from contextual information. Further, we explore the application of ICL to cell-free massive MIMO networks, providing both theoretical analyses and empirical evidence. Our findings indicate that ICL represents a principled and efficient approach to real-time receiver adaptation using pilot signals and auxiliary contextual information-without requiring online retraining.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of encoding information in a system of N=K+R processors that operate in a decentralized manner, i.e., without a central processor which orchestrates the operation. The system involves K source processors, each holding some data modeled as a vector over a finite field. The remaining R processors are sinks, and each of which requires a linear combination of all data vectors. These linear combinations are distinct from one sink processor to another, and are specified by a generator matrix of a systematic linear error correcting code. To capture the communication cost of decentralized encoding, we adopt a linear network model in which the process proceeds in consecutive communication rounds. In every round, every processor sends and receives one message through each one of its p ports. Moreover, inspired by linear network coding literature, we allow processors to transfer linear combinations of their own data and previously received data. We propose a framework that addresses the decentralized encoding problem on two levels. On the universal level, we provide a solution to the decentralized encoding problem for any possible linear code. On the specific level, we further optimize our solution towards systematic Reed-Solomon codes, as well as their variant, Lagrange codes, for their prevalent use in coded storage and computation systems. Our solutions are based on a newly-defined collective communication operation we call all-to-all encode.</description>

      <title>SCDM: Score-Based Channel Denoising Model for Digital Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17876</link>

Abstract: Score-based diffusion models represent a significant variant within the diffusion model family and have seen extensive application in the increasingly popular domain of generative tasks. Recent investigations have explored the denoising potential of diffusion models in semantic communications. However, in previous paradigms, noise distortion in the diffusion process does not match precisely with digital channel noise characteristics. In this work, we introduce the Score-Based Channel Denoising Model (SCDM) for Digital Semantic Communications (DSC). SCDM views the distortion of constellation symbol sequences in digital transmission as a score-based forward diffusion process. We design a tailored forward noise corruption to align digital channel noise properties in the training phase. During the inference stage, the well-trained SCDM can effectively denoise received semantic symbols under various SNR conditions, reducing the difficulty for the semantic decoder in extracting semantic information from the received noisy symbols and thereby enhancing the robustness of the reconstructed semantic information. Experimental results show that SCDM outperforms the baseline model in PSNR, SSIM, and MSE metrics, particularly at low SNR levels. Moreover, SCDM reduces storage requirements by a factor of 7.8. This efficiency in storage, combined with its robust denoising capability, makes SCDM a practical solution for DSC across diverse channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS with Spread Carrier Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zak-OTFS (orthogonal time frequency space) modulation is a communication framework that parameterizes the wireless channel in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where the parameters map directly to physical attributes of the scatterers that comprise the scattering environment. As a consequence, the channel can be efficiently acquired and equalized. The Zak-OTFS carrier is a pulse in the DD domain, and the Zak transform converts it to a pulse train modulated by a tone (pulsone) in the time domain. The pulsone waveform is localized rather than spread, and it suffers from high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). We describe how to transform the orthonormal basis of Zak-OTFS pulsones into an orthonormal basis of spread carrier waveforms with low PAPR (only $6.58$ dB) that support communication in the presence of mobility and delay spread. This transformation is realized by a unitary transform based on the discrete affine Fourier transform. Unlike other spread modulations that achieve low PAPR by spreading information across a wider bandwidth (thus reducing the spectral efficiency), the proposed spread carrier-based Zak-OTFS achieves full spectral efficiency like pulsone-based Zak-OTFS, with $5.6$ dB lower PAPR per basis element. We demonstrate uncoded bit error rate (BER) similar to pulsone-based Zak-OTFS, and improved BER performance over competing methods based on OFDM and OTFS in high mobility &amp; delay spread environments.</description>
