      <title>On zero-divisors and units in group rings of torsion-free CAT$(0)$ groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses two of Kaplansky's conjectures concerning group rings $K[G]$, where $K$ is a field and $G$ is a torsion-free group: the Zero-Divisor Conjecture, which asserts that $K[G]$ has no non-trivial zero-divisors, and the Unit Conjecture, which asserts that $K[G]$ has no non-trivial units. While the Zero-Divisor conjecture still remains open, the Unit Conjecture was disproven by Gardam in 2021. The search for more counterexamples remains an open problem.
  Let $m$ and $n$ be the length of support of two non-trivial elements $\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{F}_2[G]$, respectively. We address these conjectures by introducing a process called \text{left-alignment} and recursively constructing the combinatorial structures associated to $(m,n)$ which would yield counterexamples to both conjectures over the field $\mathbb{F}_2$ if they satisfy conditions $\mathsf{T}_1-\mathsf{T}_4$. Such combinatorial objects are called oriented product structures of type $(m,n)$. We also present a computer-search that can be utilized to search for counterexamples of a certain geometry by significantly pruning the search space. We prove that a class CAT(0) groups with certain geometry cannot be counterexamples to these conjectures. Moreover, we prove that for $ 1\le m \le 5$ and $n$ any positive integer, there are no counterexamples to the conjectures such that the associated oriented product structures are of type $(m,n)$. With the aid of computer, we prove that, in fact, there are no such counterexamples of the length combination $(m,n)$ where $1\le m,n \le 13.$</description>

      <title>Residually finite amenable groups that are not Hilbert-Schmidt stable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the first examples of residually finite amenable groups that are not Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) stable. More specifically the groups are finitely generated, class 3 nilpotent by cyclic. This also provides the first examples of amenable groups that are very flexibly HS-stable but not flexibly HS-stable. Along the way we exhibit (necessarily not-finitely-generated) class 2 nilpotent groups $G = A\rtimes \Z$ with $A$ abelian such that the periodic points of the dual action are dense but does not admit dense periodic measures. Finally we use the Tikuisis-White-Winter theorem to show the examples are not even operator-HS-stable; they admit operator norm almost homomorphisms that can not be HS-perturbed to true homomorphisms.</description>

      <title>On a conjecture of Navarro and Tiep on character fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2021, Navarro and Tiep proposed a conjecture on character fields of finite quasi-simple groups. We develop some theory on sums of roots of unity and use this theory to prove the conjecture for some infinite families of finite quasi-simple groups with known character table. We then use the classification of the irreducible complex characters of the finite general linear groups developed by Green to obtain some partial results about the conjecture for the finite general and special linear groups in arbitrary dimension.</description>

      <title>Conjugacy Class Growth in Virtually Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the conjugacy class growth function in finitely generated virtually abelian groups. That is, the number of elements in the ball of radius $n$ in the Cayley graph which intersect a fixed conjugacy class. In the class of virtually abelian groups, we prove that this function is always asymptotically equivalent to a polynomial. Furthermore, we show that in any affine Coxeter group, the degree of polynomial growth of a conjugacy class is equivalent to the reflection length of any element of that class.</description>

      <title>Advertising finite commutative semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every mathematician is familiar with the beautiful structure of finite commutative groups. What is less well known is that finite commutative semigroups also have a neat and well-described structure. We prove this in an efficient fashion. We unravel the structural details of many concrete finite commutative semigroups. Here "concrete" comes in two types. First, we examine the structure of the MULTIPLICATIVE semigroups Z/nZ (more interesting than their bland additive siblings) and show that it depends on the prime factors of $n$ in interesting ways. Second, we thoroughly treat finite commutative semigroups defined by generators and relations. Our aim is to provide a comprehensive introduction to the area, but with some enticing directions for the expert to follow.</description>

      <title>Product separability for special cube complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if a group $G$ admits a virtually special action on a locally-finite CAT(0) cube complex, then any product of convex-cocompact subgroups of $G$ is separable. Previously, this was only known for products of three subgroups, or in the case where $G$ is hyperbolic, or in some other more technical cases with additional assumptions on the subgroups (plus these previous results assume that the action of $G$ is cocompact). We also provide an application to the action of a virtually special cubulated group on its contact graph.</description>

      <title>Towards a Stallings-type theorem for finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent development in graph-minor theory is to study local separators, vertex-sets that separate graphs locally but not necessarily globally. The local separators of a graph roughly correspond to the genuine separators of its local covering: a usually infinite graph obtained by keeping all local structure of the original graph while unfolding all other structure as much as possible.
  We use local separators and local coverings to discover and prove a low-order Stallings-type result for finite nilpotent groups $\Gamma$: the $r$-local covering of some Cayley graph $G$ of $\Gamma$ has $\geq 2$ ends that are separated by $\leq 2$ vertices iff $G$ has an $r$-local separator of size $\leq 2$ and $\Gamma$ has order $&gt;r$, iff $\Gamma$ is isomorphic to $C_i\times C_j$ for some $i&gt;r$ and $j\in\{1,2\}$.</description>

      <title>The Lodha--Moore groups and their $n$-adic generalizations are not SCY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A closed 4-manifold is symplectic Calabi--Yau (SCY) if its canonical class is trivial. Friedl and Vidussi proved that Thompson's group $F$ cannot be the fundamental group of any SCY manifold. In this paper, we show that its generalizations, called the Brown--Thompson group and the $n$-adic Lodha--Moore groups, cannot be also the fundamental group of any SCY manifold by using their method. From this proof, we also show that there exist non-trivial infinitely many examples which satisfy Geoghegan's conjecture.</description>
