      <title>Well-posedness and mean-field limit estimate of a consensus-based algorithm for multiplayer games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the paper [12] introduces a derivative-free consensus-based particle method that finds the Nash equilibrium of non-convex multiplayer games, where it proves the global exponential convergence in the sense of mean-field law. This paper aims to address theoretical gaps in [12], specifically by providing a quantitative estimate of the mean-field limit with respect to the number of particles, as well as establishing the well-posedness of both the finite particle model and the corresponding mean-field dynamics.</description>

      <title>Sobolev Gradient Ascent for Optimal Transport: Barycenter Optimization and Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new constraint-free concave dual formulation for the Wasserstein barycenter. Tailoring the vanilla dual gradient ascent algorithm to the Sobolev geometry, we derive a scalable Sobolev gradient ascent (SGA) algorithm to compute the barycenter for input distributions supported on a regular grid. Despite the algorithmic simplicity, we provide a global convergence analysis that achieves the same rate as the classical subgradient descent methods for minimizing nonsmooth convex functions in the Euclidean space. A central feature of our SGA algorithm is that the computationally expensive $c$-concavity projection operator enforced on the Kantorovich dual potentials is unnecessary to guarantee convergence, leading to significant algorithmic and theoretical simplifications over all existing primal and dual methods for computing the exact barycenter. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the superior empirical performance of SGA over the existing optimal transport barycenter solvers.</description>

      <title>cuHALLaR: A GPU Accelerated Low-Rank Augmented Lagrangian Method for Large-Scale Semidefinite Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces cuHALLaR, a GPU-accelerated implementation of the HALLaR method proposed in Monteiro et al. 2024 for solving large-scale semidefinite programming (SDP) problems. We demonstrate how our Julia-based implementation efficiently uses GPU parallelism through optimization of simple, but key, operations, including linear maps, adjoints, and gradient evaluations. Extensive numerical experiments across three SDP problem classes, i.e., maximum stable set, matrix completion, and phase retrieval show significant performance improvements over both CPU implementations and existing GPU-based solvers. For the largest instances, cuHALLaR achieves speedups of 30-140x on matrix completion problems, up to 135x on maximum stable set problems for Hamming graphs with 8.4 million vertices, and 15-47x on phase retrieval problems with dimensions up to 3.2 million. Our approach efficiently handles massive problems with dimensions up to (n,m) equal to (8 million, 300 million) with high precision, solving matrix completion instances with over 8 million rows and columns in just 142 seconds. These results establish cuHALLaR as a very promising GPU-based method for solving large-scale semidefinite programs.</description>

      <title>Error estimates for a multiobjective optimal control of a pointwise tracking problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a pointwise tracking multiobjective optimal control problem subject to the Poisson problem and bilateral control constraints. To approximate Pareto optimal points and the Pareto front numerically, we consider two different finite element-based scalarization techniques, namely the weighted-sum method and the reference point method, where in both methods many scalar-constrained optimization problems have to be solved. We prove a priori error estimates for both scalarizations. The underlying subproblems of either method are solved with a Barzilai-Borwein gradient method. Numerical experiments illustrate the accuracy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Coupled Adaptable Backward-Forward-Backward Resolvent Splitting Algorithm (CABRA): A Matrix-Parametrized Resolvent Splitting Method for the Sum of Maximal Monotone and Cocoercive Operators Composed with Linear Coupling Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel matrix-parametrized frugal splitting algorithm which finds the zero of a sum of maximal monotone and cocoercive operators composed with linear selection operators. We also develop a semidefinite programming framework for selecting matrix parameters and demonstrate its use for designing matrix parameters which provide beneficial diagonal scaling, allow parallelization, and adhere to a given communication structure. We show that taking advantage of the linear selection operators in this way accelerates convergence in numeric experiments, and show that even when the selection operators are the identity, we can accelerate convergence by using the matrix parameters to provide appropriately chosen diagonal scaling. We conclude by demonstrating the applicability of this algorithm to multi-stage stochastic programming, outlining a decentralized approach to the relaxed stochastic weapon target assignment problem which splits over the source nodes and has low data transfer and memory requirements.</description>

      <title>A Quasi-Newton Method to Solve Uncertain Multiobjective Optimization Problems with Uncertainty Set of Finite Cardinality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we derive an iterative scheme through a quasi-Newton technique to capture robust weakly efficient points of uncertain multiobjective optimization problems under the upper set less relation. It is assumed that the set of uncertainty scenarios of the problems being analyzed is of finite cardinality. We also assume that corresponding to each given uncertain scenario from the uncertainty set, the objective function of the problem is twice continuously differentiable. In the proposed iterative scheme, at any iterate, by applying the \emph{partition set} concept from set-valued optimization, we formulate an iterate-wise class of vector optimization problems to determine a descent direction. To evaluate this descent direction at the current iterate, we employ one iteration of the quasi-Newton scheme for vector optimization on the formulated class of vector optimization problems. As this class of vector optimization problems differs iterate-wise, the proposed quasi-Newton scheme is not a straight extension of the quasi-Newton method for vector optimization problems. Under commonly used assumptions, any limit point of a sequence generated by the proposed quasi-Newton technique is found to be a robust weakly efficient point of the problem. We analyze the well-definedness and global convergence of the proposed iterative scheme based on a regularity assumption on stationary points. Under the uniform continuity of the Hessian approximation function, we demonstrate a local superlinear convergence of the method. Finally, numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Symbolic and Numerical Tools for $L_{\infty}$-Norm Calculation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The computation of the $L_\infty $-norm is an important issue in $H_{\infty}$ control, particularly for analyzing system stability and robustness. This paper focuses on symbolic computation methods for determining the $L_{\infty} $-norm of finite-dimensional linear systems, highlighting their advantages in achieving exact solutions where numerical methods often encounter limitations. Key techniques such as Sturm-Habicht sequences, Rational Univariate Representations (RUR), and Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD) are surveyed, with an emphasis on their theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and specific applicability to $ L_{\infty} $-norm computation. A comparative analysis is conducted between symbolic and conventional numerical approaches, underscoring scenarios in which symbolic computation provides superior accuracy, particularly in parametric cases. Benchmark evaluations reveal the strengths and limitations of both approaches, offering insights into the trade-offs involved. Finally, the discussion addresses the challenges of symbolic computation and explores future opportunities for its integration into control theory, particularly for robust and stable system analysis.</description>

      <title>The Koopmanization of controlled nonlinear It\^o stochastic differential systems and its comparison with the Carleman embedding: new results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koopmanization embeds the bilinearization via the action of the infinitesimal stochastic Koopman operator on the observables associated with the controlled nonlinear It\^o stochastic differential system without explicit linearizations. The stochastic evolutions of controlled Markov processes assume the structure of controlled nonlinear It\^o stochastic differential equations. This paper sketches a Koopman operator framework for the filtering of the controlled nonlinear It\^o stochastic differential system. The major ingredients of this paper are the construction of the eigenfunctions, action of the infinitesimal stochastic Koopman operator, multi-dimensional It\^o differential rule and filtering concerning the controlled nonlinear It\^o stochastic differential system. In this paper, we illustrate the filtering in the Koopman setting for a polynomial system and compare with the filtering in the Carleman setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze fast diagonal methods for simple bilevel programs. Guided by the analysis of the corresponding continuous-time dynamics, we provide a unified convergence analysis under general geometric conditions, including H\"olderian growth and the Attouch-Czarnecki condition. Our results yield explicit convergence rates and guarantee weak convergence to a solution of the bilevel problem. In particular, we improve and extend recent results on accelerated schemes, offering novel insights into the trade-offs between geometry, regularization decay, and algorithmic design. Numerical experiments illustrate the advantages of more flexible methods and support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Solving Unit Commitment Problems with Graph Neural Network based Initial Commitment Prediction and Large Neighborhood Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unit commitment problem (UCP) is a critical component of power market decision-making. However, its computational complexity necessitates effi-cient solution methods. In this work we propose a framework to accelerate the solving process of the UCP, and the data collecting process for two dis-tinct graph neural network (GNN) policy. We at first train a Neural Initial Commitment Prediction policy to obtain an initial commitment for UCP. Sec-ond, a heuristic process is introduced to restore the feasibility of the initial commitment. Third, get the neighborhood based on the initial prediction then neighborhood search to improve the commitment. At last, we train a Neural neighborhood Prediction policy to predict the neighborhood of the incum-bent commitment at each iteration, continuously optimizing the commitment until the stopping condition is met. This approach produces high-quality ini-tial commitments that can be iteratively refined to meet higher accuracy re-quirements. The experimental results show that the GNN policies trained on the 80-unit system outperform commercial solvers on a 1080-unit system, and LNS performs better than commercial solver on more complex instanc-es.</description>

      <title>Prox-PINNs: A Deep Learning Algorithmic Framework for Elliptic Variational Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Elliptic variational inequalities (EVIs) present significant challenges in numerical computation due to their inherent non-smoothness, nonlinearity, and inequality formulations. Traditional mesh-based methods often struggle with complex geometries and high computational costs, while existing deep learning approaches lack generality for diverse EVIs. To alleviate these issues, this paper introduces Prox-PINNs, a novel deep learning algorithmic framework that integrates proximal operators with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solve a broad class of EVIs. The Prox-PINNs reformulate EVIs as nonlinear equations using proximal operators and then approximate the solutions via neural networks that enforce boundary conditions as hard constraints. Then the neural networks are trained by minimizing physics-informed residuals. The Prox-PINNs framework advances the state-of-the-art by unifying the treatment of diverse EVIs within a mesh-free and scalable computational architecture. The framework is demonstrated on several prototypical applications, including obstacle problems, elasto-plastic torsion, Bingham visco-plastic flows, and simplified friction problems. Numerical experiments validate the method's accuracy, efficiency, robustness, and flexibility across benchmark examples.</description>

      <title>Feedback Stabilization of Polynomial Systems: From Model-based to Data-driven Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we propose new global stabilization approaches for a class of polynomial systems in both model-based and data-driven settings. The existing model-based approach guarantees global asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system only when the Lyapunov function is radially unbounded, which limits its applicability. To overcome this limitation, we develop a new global stabilization approach that allows a broader class of Lyapunov function candidates. Furthermore, we extend this approach to the data-driven setting, considering Lyapunov function candidates with the same functional structure. Using data corrupted by bounded noise, we derive conditions for constructing globally stabilizing controllers for unknown polynomial systems. Beyond handling noise, the proposed data-driven approach can be readily adapted to incorporate further prior knowledge of system parameters to reduce conservatism. In both approaches, sum-of-squares relaxation is used to ensure computational tractability of the involved conditions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Multi-Energy Modeling: The Role of Mixed-Integer Optimization Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal to decarbonize the energy sector has led to increased research in modeling and optimizing multi-energy systems. One of the most promising techniques for modeling (multi-)energy optimization problems is mixed-integer programming (MIP), valued for its ability to represent the complexities of integrated energy systems. While the literature often focuses on deriving mathematical formulations and parameter settings, less attention is given to critical post-formulation decisions. Modeling multi-energy systems as a MIP demands decisions across multiple degrees of freedom. Key steps include reducing a real-world multi-energy network into an abstract topology, defining variables, formulating the relevant (in-)equalities to represent technical requirements, setting objectives, and integrating these elements into a MIP. However, with these elements fixed, the specific transformation of the abstract topology into a graph structure and the construction of the MIP remain non-uniquely. These choices can significantly impact user-friendliness, problem size, and computational efficiency, thus affecting the feasibility and efficiency of modeling efforts. We identify and analyze the additional degrees of freedom and describe two distinct approaches to address them. The approaches are compared regarding mathematical equivalence, suitability for solution algorithms, and clarity of the underlying topology. A case study on a realistic subarea of Berlin's district heating network involving tri-objective optimization for a unit commitment problem demonstrates the practical significance of these decisions. By highlighting these critical yet often overlooked aspects, our work equips energy system modelers with insights to improve computational efficiency, scalability, and interpretability in their optimization efforts.</description>

      <title>Sequential QCQP for Bilevel Optimization with Line Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bilevel optimization involves a hierarchical structure where one problem is nested within another, leading to complex interdependencies between levels. We propose a single-loop, tuning-free algorithm that guarantees anytime feasibility, i.e., approximate satisfaction of the lower-level optimality condition, while ensuring descent of the upper-level objective. At each iteration, a convex quadratically-constrained quadratic program (QCQP) with a closed-form solution yields the search direction, followed by a backtracking line search inspired by control barrier functions to ensure safe, uniformly positive step sizes. The resulting method is scalable, requires no hyperparameter tuning, and converges under mild local regularity assumptions. We establish an O(1/k) ergodic convergence rate and demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness on representative bilevel tasks.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control for Transformer Architectures: Enhancing Generalization, Robustness and Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Transformers through the perspective of optimal control theory, using tools from continuous-time formulations to derive actionable insights into training and architecture design. This framework improves the performance of existing Transformer models while providing desirable theoretical guarantees, including generalization and robustness. Our framework is designed to be plug-and-play, enabling seamless integration with established Transformer models and requiring only slight changes to the implementation. We conduct seven extensive experiments on tasks motivated by text generation, sentiment analysis, image classification, and point cloud classification. Experimental results show that the framework improves the test performance of the baselines, while being more parameter-efficient. On character-level text generation with nanoGPT, our framework achieves a 46% reduction in final test loss while using 42% fewer parameters. On GPT-2, our framework achieves a 5.6% reduction in final test loss, demonstrating scalability to larger models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that applies optimal control theory to both the training and architecture of Transformers. It offers a new foundation for systematic, theory-driven improvements and moves beyond costly trial-and-error approaches.</description>

Abstract: Maritime Inventory Routing Problem (MIRP) plays a crucial role in the integration of global maritime commerce levels. However, there are still no well-established methodologies capable of efficiently solving large MIRP instances or their variants due to the high complexity of the problem. The adoption of exact methods, typically based on Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), for daily operations is nearly impractical due to the CPU time required, as planning must be executed multiple times while ensuring high-quality results within acceptable time limits. Non-MIP-based heuristics are less frequently applied due to the highly constrained nature of the problem, which makes even the construction of an effective initial solution challenging. Papageorgiou et al. (2014) introduced a single-product MIRP as the foundation for MIRPLib, aiming to provide a collection of publicly available benchmark instances. However, only a few studies that propose new methodologies have been published since then. To encourage the use of MIRPLib and facilitate result comparisons, this study presents a heuristic approach that does not rely on mathematical optimization techniques to solve a deterministic, finite-horizon, single-product MIRP. The proposed heuristic combines a variation of a Beam Search algorithm with an Iterated Local Search procedure. Among the 72 instances tested, the developed methodology can improve the best-known solution for ten instances within an acceptable CPU time.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Nonequilibrium Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that bootstrap methods based on the positivity of probability measures provide a systematic framework for studying both synchronous and asynchronous nonequilibrium stochastic processes on infinite lattices. First, we formulate linear programming problems that use positivity and invariance property of invariant measures to derive rigorous bounds on their expectation values. Second, for time evolution in asynchronous processes, we exploit the master equation along with positivity and initial conditions to construct linear and semidefinite programming problems that yield bounds on expectation values at both short and late times. We illustrate both approaches using two canonical examples: the contact process in 1+1 and 2+1 dimensions, and the Domany-Kinzel model in both synchronous and asynchronous forms in 1+1 dimensions. Our bounds on invariant measures yield rigorous lower bounds on critical rates, while those on time evolutions provide two-sided bounds on the half-life of the infection density and the temporal correlation length in the subcritical phase.</description>

      <title>Weakest Bidder Types and New Core-Selecting Combinatorial Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-selecting combinatorial auctions are popular auction designs that constrain prices to eliminate the incentive for any group of bidders -- with the seller -- to renegotiate for a better deal. They help overcome the low-revenue issues of classical combinatorial auctions. We introduce a new class of core-selecting combinatorial auctions that leverage bidder information available to the auction designer. We model such information through constraints on the joint type space of the bidders -- these are constraints on bidders' private valuations that are known to hold by the auction designer before bids are elicited. First, we show that type space information can overcome the well-known impossibility of incentive-compatible core-selecting combinatorial auctions. We present a revised and generalized version of that impossibility result that depends on how much information is conveyed by the type spaces. We then devise a new family of core-selecting combinatorial auctions and show that they minimize the sum of bidders' incentives to deviate from truthful bidding. We develop new constraint generation techniques -- and build upon existing quadratic programming techniques -- to compute core prices, and conduct experiments to evaluate the incentive, revenue, fairness, and computational merits of our new auctions. Our new core-selecting auctions directly improve upon existing designs that have been used in many high-stakes auctions around the world. We envision that they will be a useful addition to any auction designer's toolkit.</description>

      <title>Turbocharging Gaussian Process Inference with Approximate Sketch-and-Project</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) play an essential role in biostatistics, scientific machine learning, and Bayesian optimization for their ability to provide probabilistic predictions and model uncertainty. However, GP inference struggles to scale to large datasets (which are common in modern applications), since it requires the solution of a linear system whose size scales quadratically with the number of samples in the dataset. We propose an approximate, distributed, accelerated sketch-and-project algorithm ($\texttt{ADASAP}$) for solving these linear systems, which improves scalability. We use the theory of determinantal point processes to show that the posterior mean induced by sketch-and-project rapidly converges to the true posterior mean. In particular, this yields the first efficient, condition number-free algorithm for estimating the posterior mean along the top spectral basis functions, showing that our approach is principled for GP inference. $\texttt{ADASAP}$ outperforms state-of-the-art solvers based on conjugate gradient and coordinate descent across several benchmark datasets and a large-scale Bayesian optimization task. Moreover, $\texttt{ADASAP}$ scales to a dataset with $&gt; 3 \cdot 10^8$ samples, a feat which has not been accomplished in the literature.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of an Adaptive Nonconforming FEM for Phase-Field Dependent Topology Optimization in Stokes Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop an adaptive nonconforming finite element algorithm for the numerical approximation of phase-field parameterized topology optimization governed by the Stokes system. We employ the conforming linear finite element space to approximate the phase field, and the nonconforming linear finite elements (Crouzeix-Raviart elements) and piecewise constants to approximate the velocity field and the pressure field, respectively. We establish the convergence of the adaptive method, i.e., the sequence of minimizers contains a subsequence that converges to a solution of the first-order optimality system, and the associated subsequence of discrete pressure fields also converges. The analysis relies crucially on a new discrete compactness result of nonconforming linear finite elements over a sequence of adaptively generated meshes. We present numerical results for several examples to illustrate the performance of the algorithm, including a comparison with the uniform refinement strategy.</description>

      <title>Personalized and Resilient Distributed Learning Through Opinion Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address two practical challenges of distributed learning in multi-agent network systems, namely personalization and resilience. Personalization is the need of heterogeneous agents to learn local models tailored to their own data and tasks, while still generalizing well; on the other hand, the learning process must be resilient to cyberattacks or anomalous training data to avoid disruption. Motivated by a conceptual affinity between these two requirements, we devise a distributed learning algorithm that combines distributed gradient descent and the Friedkin-Johnsen model of opinion dynamics to fulfill both of them. We quantify its convergence speed and the neighborhood that contains the final learned models, which can be easily controlled by tuning the algorithm parameters to enforce a more personalized/resilient behavior. We numerically showcase the effectiveness of our algorithm on synthetic and real-world distributed learning tasks, where it achieves high global accuracy both for personalized models and with malicious agents compared to standard strategies.</description>

      <title>Layer-wise Quantization for Quantized Optimistic Dual Averaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14371v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern deep neural networks exhibit heterogeneity across numerous layers of various types such as residuals, multi-head attention, etc., due to varying structures (dimensions, activation functions, etc.), distinct representation characteristics, which impact predictions. We develop a general layer-wise quantization framework with tight variance and code-length bounds, adapting to the heterogeneities over the course of training. We then apply a new layer-wise quantization technique within distributed variational inequalities (VIs), proposing a novel Quantized Optimistic Dual Averaging (QODA) algorithm with adaptive learning rates, which achieves competitive convergence rates for monotone VIs. We empirically show that QODA achieves up to a $150\%$ speedup over the baselines in end-to-end training time for training Wasserstein GAN on $12+$ GPUs.</description>

      <title>Security of Distributed Gradient Descent Against Byzantine Agents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the security of Decentralized Gradient Descent (DGD) algorithms on undirected graphs. Specifically, we consider Byzantine agents that inject stealthy attacks to degrade the performance of the DGD algorithm in terms of its optimal value. To mitigate the effect of stealthy attacks, some agents are allocated to monitor the evolution of their gradient. We then propose a method to quantify the maximum deviation caused by the Byzantine agent in the optimal value of the DGD. Our approach serves as a security metric to evaluate the robustness of graph structures against Byzantine attacks. We validate our findings through numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: A set-system $S\subseteq \{0,1\}^n$ is cube-ideal if its convex hull can be described by capacity and generalized set covering inequalities. In this paper, we use combinatorics, convex geometry, and polyhedral theory to give exponential lower bounds on the size of cube-ideal set-systems, and linear lower bounds on their VC dimension. We then provide applications to graph theory and combinatorial optimization, specifically to strong orientations, perfect matchings, dijoins, and ideal clutters.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimization via Gradient-Based Hamiltonian Descent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With rapid advancements in machine learning, first-order algorithms have emerged as the backbone of modern optimization techniques, owing to their computational efficiency and low memory requirements. Recently, the connection between accelerated gradient methods and damped heavy-ball motion, particularly within the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics, has inspired the development of innovative quantum algorithms for continuous optimization. One such algorithm, Quantum Hamiltonian Descent (QHD), leverages quantum tunneling to escape saddle points and local minima, facilitating the discovery of global solutions in complex optimization landscapes. However, QHD faces several challenges, including slower convergence rates compared to classical gradient methods and limited robustness in highly non-convex problems due to the non-local nature of quantum states. Furthermore, the original QHD formulation primarily relies on function value information, which limits its effectiveness. Inspired by insights from high-resolution differential equations that have elucidated the acceleration mechanisms in classical methods, we propose an enhancement to QHD by incorporating gradient information, leading to what we call gradient-based QHD. Gradient-based QHD achieves faster convergence and significantly increases the likelihood of identifying global solutions. Numerical simulations on challenging problem instances demonstrate that gradient-based QHD outperforms existing quantum and classical methods by at least an order of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we study a class of HJB equations which solve for equilibria for general time-inconsistent deterministic linear quadratic control problems within the intra-personal game theoretic framework, where the inconsistency arises from non-exponential discount functions. We characterize the solutions to the HJB equations using a class of Riccati equations with integral terms. By studying the uniqueness of solutions to the integro-differential Riccati equations, we prove the uniqueness of solutions to the equilibrium HJB equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to learn the time-varying stochastic computational resource usage of software as a graph structured Schr\"odinger bridge problem. In general, learning the computational resource usage from data is challenging because resources such as the number of CPU instructions and the number of last level cache requests are both time-varying and statistically correlated. Our proposed method enables learning the joint time-varying stochasticity in computational resource usage from the measured profile snapshots in a nonparametric manner. The method can be used to predict the most-likely time-varying distribution of computational resource availability at a desired time. We provide detailed algorithms for stochastic learning in both single and multi-core cases, discuss the convergence guarantees, computational complexities, and demonstrate their practical use in two case studies: a single-core nonlinear model predictive controller, and a synthetic multi-core software.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18789v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a template to derive convergence rates for the following popular versions of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm on polytopes: vanilla Frank-Wolfe, Frank-Wolfe with away steps, Frank-Wolfe with blended pairwise steps, and Frank-Wolfe with in-face directions. Our template shows how the convergence rates follow from two affine-invariant properties of the problem, namely, error bound and extended curvature. These properties depend solely on the polytope and objective function but not on any affine-dependent object like norms. For each one of the above algorithms, we derive rates of convergence ranging from sublinear to linear depending on the degree of the error bound.</description>

Abstract: We consider a moving target that we seek to learn from samples. Our results extend randomized techniques developed in control and optimization for a constant target to the case where the target is changing. We derive a novel bound on the number of samples that are required to construct a probably approximately correct (PAC) estimate of the target. Furthermore, when the moving target is a convex polytope, we provide a constructive method of generating the PAC estimate using a mixed integer linear program (MILP). The proposed method is demonstrated on an application to autonomous emergency braking.</description>

      <title>Local Identifiability of Fully-Connected Feed-Forward Networks with Nonlinear Node Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08472v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the identifiability of nonlinear network systems with partial excitation and partial measurement when the network dynamics is linear on the edges and nonlinear on the nodes. We assume that the graph topology and the nonlinear functions at the node level are known, and we aim to identify the weight matrix of the graph. Our main result is to prove that fully-connected layered feed-forward networks are generically locally identifiable by exciting sources and measuring sinks in the class of analytic functions that cross the origin. This holds even when all other nodes remain unexcited and unmeasured and stands in sharp contrast to most findings on network identifiability requiring measurement and/or excitation of each node. The result applies in particular to feed-forward artificial neural networks with no offsets and generalizes previous literature by considering a broader class of functions and topologies.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Separation Theorems for Co-Radiant Sets and Optimality Conditions for Approximate and Proper Approximate Solutions in Vector Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with \(\varepsilon\)-efficient and \(\varepsilon\)-properly efficient points with respect to a co-radiant set in vector optimization problems. In the first part of the paper, we establish a new nonlinear separation theorem for co-radiant sets in normed spaces. Subsequently, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions, via scalarization, for both \(\varepsilon\)-efficient and \(\varepsilon\)-properly efficient points in a general framework, without requiring any assumptions on the co-radiant set or convexity conditions on the sets under consideration. Consequently, our results are applicable in a broader range of settings than those previously addressed in the literature.</description>

      <title>Approximation of diffeomorphisms for quantum state transfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14450v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we seek to combine two emerging standpoints in control theory. On the one hand, recent advances in infinite-dimensional geometric control have unlocked a method for controlling (with arbitrary precision and in arbitrarily small times) state transfers for bilinear Schr\"odinger PDEs posed on a Riemannian manifold $M$. In particular, these arguments rely on controllability results in the group of the diffeomorphisms of $M$. On the other hand, using tools of $\Gamma$-convergence, it has been proved that we can phrase the retrieval of a diffeomorphism of $M$ as an ensemble optimal control problem. More precisely, this is done by employing a control-affine system for \emph{simultaneously} steering a finite swarm of points towards the respective targets. Here we blend these two theoretical approaches and numerically find control laws driving state transitions (such as eigenstate transfers) in small time in a bilinear Schr\"odinger PDE posed on the torus. Such systems have experimental relevance and are currently used to model rotational dynamics of molecules, and cold atoms trapped in periodic optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Polynomial and Parallelizable Preconditioning for Block Tridiagonal Positive Definite Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The efficient solution of moderately large-scale linear systems arising from the KKT conditions in optimal control problems (OCPs) is a critical challenge in robotics. With the stagnation of Moore's law, there is growing interest in leveraging GPU-accelerated iterative methods, and corresponding parallel preconditioners, to overcome these computational challenges. To improve the performance of such solvers, we introduce a parallel-friendly, parametrized multi-splitting polynomial preconditioner framework. We first construct and prove the optimal parametrization theoretically in terms of the least amount of distinct eigenvalues and the narrowest spectrum range. We then compare the theoretical time complexity of solving the linear system directly or iteratively. We finally show through numerical experiments how much the preconditioning improves the convergence of OCP linear systems solves.</description>

      <title>A Unified Theoretic and Algorithmic Framework for Solving Multivariate Linear Model with $\ell^1$-norm Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is a challenging problem that solving the \textit{multivariate linear model} (MLM) $\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ with the $\ell_1 $-norm approximation method such that $||\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{b}||_1$, the $\ell_1$-norm of the \textit{residual error vector} (REV), is minimized. In this work, our contributions lie in two aspects: firstly, the equivalence theorem for the structure of the $\ell_1$-norm optimal solution to the MLM is proposed and proved; secondly, a unified algorithmic framework for solving the MLM with $\ell_1$-norm optimization is proposed and six novel algorithms (L1-GPRS, L1-TNIPM, L1-HP, L1-IST, L1-ADM, L1-POB) are designed. There are three significant characteristics in the algorithms discussed: they are implemented with simple matrix operations which do not depend on specific optimization solvers; they are described with algorithmic pseudo-codes and implemented with Python and Octave/MATLAB which means easy usage; and the high accuracy and efficiency of our six new algorithms can be achieved successfully in the scenarios with different levels of data redundancy. We hope that the unified theoretic and algorithmic framework with source code released on GitHub could motivate the applications of the $\ell_1$-norm optimization for parameter estimation of MLM arising in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, economics, and so on.</description>

      <title>Beyond Smoothness and Convexity: Optimization via sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work explores a novel perspective on solving nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems by leveraging sampling based methods. Instead of treating the objective function purely through traditional (often deterministic) optimization approaches, we view it as inducing a target distribution.We then draw samples from this distribution using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, particularly Langevin Dynamics (LD), to locate regions of low function values. By analyzing the convergence properties of LD in both KL divergence and total variation distance, we establish explicit bounds on how many iterations are required for the induced distribution to approximate the target. We also provide probabilistic guarantees that an appropriately drawn sample will lie within a desired neighborhood of the global minimizer, even when the objective is nonconvex or nonsmooth.</description>

      <title>Agency Problems and Adversarial Bilevel Optimization under Uncertainty and Cyber Threats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08989v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an agency problem between a holding company and its subsidiary, exposed to cyber threats that affect the overall value of the subsidiary. The holding company seeks to design an optimal incentive scheme to mitigate these losses. In response, the subsidiary selects an optimal cybersecurity investment strategy, modeled through a stochastic epidemiological SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) framework. The cyber threat landscape is captured through an L-hop risk framework with two primary sources of risk: (i) internal risk propagation via the contagion parameters in the SIR model, and (ii) external cyberattacks from a malicious external hacker. The uncertainty and adversarial nature of the hacking lead to consider a robust stochastic control approach that allows for increased volatility and ambiguity induced by cyber incidents. The agency problem is formulated as a max-min bilevel stochastic control problem with accidents. First, we derive the incentive compatibility condition by reducing the subsidiary's optimal response to the solution of a second-order backward stochastic differential equation with jumps. Next, we demonstrate that the principal's problem can be equivalently reformulated as an integro-partial Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) equation. By extending the stochastic Perron's method to our setting, we show that the value function of the problem is the unique viscosity solution to the resulting integro-partial HJBI equation.</description>

      <title>CASL-HJX: A Comprehensive Guide to Solving Deterministic and Stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CASL-HJX is a computational framework designed for solving deterministic and stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi equations in two spatial dimensions. It provides a flexible and efficient approach to modeling front propagation problems, optimal control problems, and stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi Bellman equations. The framework integrates numerical methods for hyperbolic PDEs with operator splitting techniques and implements implicit methods for second-order derivative terms, ensuring convergence to viscosity solutions while achieving global rather than local optimization. Built with a high-performance C++ core, CASL-HJX efficiently handles mixed-order derivative systems with time-varying dynamics, making it suitable for real-world applications across multiple domains. We demonstrate the solver's versatility through tutorial examples covering various PDEs and through applications in neuroscience, where it enables the design of energy-efficient controllers for regulating neural populations to mitigate pathological synchrony. While our examples focus on these applications, the mathematical foundation of the solver makes it applicable to problems in finance, engineering, and machine learning. The modular architecture allows researchers to define computational domains, configure problems, and execute simulations with high numerical accuracy. CASL-HJX bridges the gap between deterministic control methods and stochastic models, providing a robust tool for managing uncertainty in complex dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: We prove for the first time that, if a linear inverse problem exhibits a group symmetry structure, gradient-based optimizers can be designed to exploit this structure for faster convergence rates. This theoretical finding demonstrates the existence of a special class of structure-adaptive optimization algorithms which are tailored for symmetry-structured inverse problems such as CT/MRI/PET, compressed sensing, and image processing applications such as inpainting/deconvolution, etc.</description>

      <title>Transfer learning of optimal QAOA parameters in combinatorial optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.05549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solving combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) is a promising application of quantum computation, with the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) being one of the most studied quantum algorithms for solving them. However, multiple factors make the parameter search of the QAOA a hard optimization problem. In this work, we study transfer learning (TL), a methodology to reuse pre-trained QAOA parameters of one problem instance into different COP instances. This methodology can be used to alleviate the necessity of classical optimization to find good parameters for individual problems. To this end, we select small cases of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), the bin packing problem (BPP), the knapsack problem (KP), the weighted maximum cut (MaxCut) problem, the maximal independent set (MIS) problem, and portfolio optimization (PO), and find optimal $\beta$ and $\gamma$ parameters for p layers. We compare how well the parameters found for one problem adapt to the others. Among the different problems, BPP is the one that produces the best transferable parameters, maintaining the probability of finding the optimal solution above a quadratic speedup over random guessing for problem sizes up to 42 qubits and p = 10 layers. Using the BPP parameters, we perform experiments on IonQ Harmony and Aria, Rigetti Aspen-M-3, and IBM Brisbane of MIS instances for up to 18 qubits. The results indicate that IonQ Aria yields the best overlap with the ideal probability distribution. Additionally, we show that cross-platform TL is possible using the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer with the parameters found for BPP. We show an improvement in performance compared to the default protocols for MIS with up to 170 qubits. Our results suggest that there are QAOA parameters that generalize well for different COPs and annealing protocols.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Framework for Analyzing the Convergence of Adam: Bridging the Gap with SGD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.04458v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) is a cornerstone optimization algorithm in deep learning, widely recognized for its flexibility with adaptive learning rates and efficiency in handling large-scale data. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical understanding of Adam's convergence has been constrained by stringent assumptions, such as almost surely bounded stochastic gradients or uniformly bounded gradients, which are more restrictive than those typically required for analyzing stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
  In this paper, we introduce a novel and comprehensive framework for analyzing the convergence properties of Adam. This framework offers a versatile approach to establishing Adam's convergence. Specifically, we prove that Adam achieves asymptotic (last iterate sense) convergence in both the almost sure sense and the \(L_1\) sense under the relaxed assumptions typically used for SGD, namely \(L\)-smoothness and the ABC inequality. Meanwhile, under the same assumptions, we show that Adam attains non-asymptotic sample complexity bounds similar to those of SGD.</description>

      <title>Beyond inherent robustness: strong stability of MPC despite plant-model mismatch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15452v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this technical report, we establish the asymptotic stability of MPC under plant-model mismatch for problems where the origin remains a steady state despite mismatch. This class of problems includes, but is not limited to, inventory management, path-planning, and control of systems in deviation variables. Our results differ from prior results on the inherent robustness of MPC, which guarantee only convergence to a neighborhood of the origin, the size of which scales with the magnitude of the mismatch. For MPC with quadratic costs, continuous differentiability of the system dynamics is sufficient to demonstrate exponential stability of the closed-loop system despite mismatch. For MPC with general costs, a joint comparison function bound and scaling condition guarantee asymptotic stability despite mismatch. The results are illustrated in numerical simulations, including the classic upright pendulum problem. The tools developed to establish these results can address the stability of offset-free MPC, an open and interesting question in the MPC research literature.</description>

      <title>The Sample Complexity of Online Reinforcement Learning: A Multi-model Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of online reinforcement learning in the general setting of nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous state and action spaces. Our analysis accommodates a large class of dynamical systems ranging from a finite set of nonlinear candidate models to models with bounded and Lipschitz continuous dynamics, to systems that are parametrized by a compact and real-valued set of parameters. In the most general setting, our algorithm achieves a policy regret of $\mathcal{O}(N \epsilon^2 + \mathrm{ln}(m(\epsilon))/\epsilon^2)$, where $N$ is the time horizon, $\epsilon$ is a user-specified discretization width, and $m(\epsilon)$ measures the complexity of the function class under consideration via its packing number. In the special case where the dynamics are parametrized by a compact and real-valued set of parameters (such as neural networks, transformers, etc.), we prove a policy regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N p})$, where $p$ denotes the number of parameters, recovering earlier sample-complexity results that were derived for linear time-invariant dynamical systems. While this article focuses on characterizing sample complexity, the proposed algorithms are likely to be useful in practice, due to their simplicity, their ability to incorporate prior knowledge, and their benign transient behavior.</description>

      <title>Online Scheduling for LLM Inference with KV Cache Constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07115v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) inference, where a trained model generates text one word at a time in response to user prompts, is a computationally intensive process requiring efficient scheduling to optimize latency and resource utilization. A key challenge in LLM inference is the management of the Key-Value (KV) cache, which reduces redundant computations but introduces memory constraints. In this work, we model LLM inference with KV cache constraints theoretically and propose a novel batching and scheduling algorithm that minimizes inference latency while effectively managing the KV cache's memory.
  More specifically, we make the following contributions. First, to evaluate the performance of online algorithms for scheduling in LLM inference, we introduce a hindsight optimal benchmark, formulated as an integer program that computes the minimum total inference latency under full future information. Second, we prove that no deterministic online algorithm can achieve a constant competitive ratio when the arrival process is arbitrary. Third, motivated by the computational intractability of solving the integer program at scale, we propose a polynomial-time online scheduling algorithm and show that under certain conditions it can achieve a constant competitive ratio. We also demonstrate our algorithm's strong empirical performance by comparing it to the hindsight optimal in a synthetic dataset. Finally, we conduct empirical evaluations on a real-world public LLM inference dataset, simulating the Llama2-70B model on A100 GPUs, and show that our algorithm significantly outperforms the benchmark algorithms. Overall, our results offer a path toward more sustainable and cost-effective LLM deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an optimal investment-consumption problem for a utility-maximizing investor who has access to assets with different liquidity and whose consumption rate as well as terminal wealth are subject to lower-bound constraints. Assuming utility functions that satisfy standard conditions, we develop a methodology for deriving the optimal strategies in semi-closed form. Our methodology is based on the generalized martingale approach and the decomposition of the problem into subproblems. We illustrate our approach by deriving explicit formulas for agents with power-utility functions and discuss potential extensions of the proposed framework. In numerical studies, we substantiate how the parameters of our framework impact the optimal proportion of initial capital allocated to the illiquid asset, the monetary value that the investor subjectively assigns to the fixed-term asset, and the potential of the illiquid asset to increase terminal the terminal value of liabilities without loss in the investor's expected utility.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study the well-posedness and the input-to-state type stability of a one-dimensional fluid-particle interaction system. A distinctive feature, not yet considered in the ISS literature, is that our system involves a free boundary. More precisely, the fluid is described by the viscous Burgers equation, and the motion of the particle obeys Newton second law. The point mass is subject to both a feedback control and an open-loop control. We first establish the well-posedness of the system for any open-loop input in the L2(0, infinity) space. Assuming the input also belongs to the L1(0,infinity) space, we prove that the particle's position remains uniformly bounded and that the system is input-to-state type stable. The proof is based on the construction of a Lyapunov functional derived from a special test function.</description>
