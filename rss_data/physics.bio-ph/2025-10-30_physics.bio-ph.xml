      <title>Capillarity Reveals the Role of Capsid Geometry in HIV Nuclear Translocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The protective capsid encasing the genetic material of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) has been shown to traverse the nuclear pore complex (NPC) intact, despite exceeding the passive diffusion threshold by over three orders of magnitude. This remarkable feat is attributed to the properties of the capsid surface, which confer solubility within the NPC's phase-separated, condensate-like barrier. In this context, we apply the classical framework of wetting and capillarity -- integrating analytical methods with sharp- and diffuse-interface numerical simulations -- to elucidate the physical underpinnings of HIV nuclear entry. Our analysis captures several key phenomena: the reorientation of incoming capsids due to torques arising from asymmetric capillary forces; the role of confinement in limiting capsid penetration depths; the classification of translocation mechanics according to changes in topology and interfacial area; and the influence of (spontaneous) rotational symmetry-breaking on energetics. These effects are all shown to depend critically on capsid geometry, arguing for a physical basis for HIV's characteristic capsid shape.</description>

      <title>Tripeptide-Dynamics from Empirical and Machine-Learned Energy Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations for tripeptides in the gas phase and in solution using empirical and machine-learned energy functions are presented. For cationic AAA a machine-learned potential energy surface (ML-PES) trained on MP2 reference data yields quantitative agreement with measured splittings of the amide-I vibrations. Experimental spectroscopy in solution reports a splitting of 25 cm-1 which compares with 20 cm-1 from ML/MM-MD simulations of AAA in explicit solvent. For the AMA tripeptide a ML-PES describing both, the zwitterionic and neutral form is trained and used to map out the accessible conformational space. Due to cyclization and H-bonding between the termini in neutral AMA the NH- and OH-stretch spectra are strongly red-shifted below 3000 cm-1. The present work demonstrates that meaningful MD simulations on the nanosecond time scale are feasible and provides insight into experiments.</description>

      <title>Wrinkle-Induced Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nanochannels for Biomolecule Localization and Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluorescence-based single-molecule localization, transport, and sensing require spatial confinement to extend the molecule's residence time during imaging, sufficient temporal resolution to capture fast dynamics, and efficient fluorescence background suppression. Two-dimensional (2D) materials offer large-area, atomically flat surfaces suitable for massively parallel in-plane biomolecule imaging, yet achieving guided motion in one-dimensional confinements using top-down nanofabrication remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate that thermally induced wrinkles in exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) act as self-assembled nanochannels that enable biomolecule confinement and imaging under wide-field fluorescence microscopy. By controlling annealing parameters and substrate properties, we obtain scalable and reproducible wrinkle networks whose densities and morphologies can be tuned. Structural characterization using atomic force and scanning electron microscopy is complemented by fluorescence imaging and Kelvin probe force microscopy, confirming that aqueous solutions fill and remain stably retained within the nanochannels for periods exceeding 10 hours. We further achieve selective ATTO647N-DNA localization and imaging in the one-dimensional channels through the formation of a graphene/hBN vertical heterostructure. The graphene overlayer serves as a quenching mask that suppresses background fluorescence both from high-strain hBN regions and from DNA adsorbed on top of the 2D layer. Overall, these results provide a scalable, lithography-free route for creating planar nanofluidic confinements fully compatible with single-molecule imaging. This platform enables fundamental nanobiology studies as well as on-chip biomolecule transport and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Enzyme Active Bath Affects Protein Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how an active bath of enzymes influences the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of a non-interacting condensing protein. The enzyme we choose to use as the active driver is urease, an enzyme that has been shown by several groups to exhibit enhanced diffusion in the presence of its substrate. The non-interacting LLPS protein is ubiquilin-2, a protein that condenses with increasing temperature and salt. Using a microfluidic device with semipermeable membranes, we create a chemostatic environment to maintain the substrate content to feed the enzymatic bath and remove the products of the chemical reaction. Thus, we isolate the physical enhanced fluctuations from the chemical changes of the enzyme activity. We also compare the results to controls without activity or in the presence of the products of the reaction. We find that the active bath is able to enhance droplet size, density, and concentration, implying that more ubiquilin-2 is in condensed form. This result is consistent with an interpretation that the active bath acts as an effective temperature. Simulations provide an underlying interpretation for our experimental results. Together, these findings provide the first demonstration that physical enzymatic activity can act as an effective temperature to modify LLPS behavior, with implications for intracellular organization in the enzymatically active cellular environment.</description>

      <title>Protein-Based Electrical Junctions with Robust Biocompatible Carbon Electrodes Exhibit Activation-less Charge Transport down to 10 K</title>

Abstract: The integration of functional proteins into solid-state electronic devices remains a central challenge in molecular bioelectronics due to the fragile nature of protein structures and their complex charge-transport behaviour. Here, we present a robust crosswire evaporated top-contact device based on bacteriorhodopsin (bR) single bilayers (SBL), configured as Au/Cys/bR(SBL)/eC/Au (simplified as Au/bR/eC). The evaporated carbon (eC) top electrode forms a conformal, non-invasive contact that suppresses filament formation and ensures electrical integrity across the cross-wire intersecting area (about 200 micron^2). Structural and spectroscopic analyses confirm that the solid-state bR films maintain the native absorption spectrum and have functional photocycle activity after electrode deposition, implying that their native conformation is not significantly affected. Remarkably, electron transport (ETp) through the 9 nm bR-SBL junctions is temperature-independent within 300 K - 10 K, excluding thermally activated hopping, while the length is incompatible with coherent tunneling. Under green illumination, the junctions exhibit a reversible, photo-induced current enhancement (Jgreen/Jdark = 2), ascribed to light-driven conformational changes rather than direct photoexcitation. The Au/bR/eC architecture thus establishes a thermally non-activated, conformationally mediated transport mechanism via a stable, cryo-compatible solid-state protein junction. This work provides a scalable platform for integrating light-responsive biomolecules into future bio-optoelectronic and neuromorphic devices.</description>

      <title>Memory in neural activity: long-range order without criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16394v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The "criticality hypothesis", based on observed scale-free correlations in neural activity, posits that the brain operates at a critical point of transition between two phases. However, the validity of this hypothesis is still debated. Here, employing a commonly used model of cortical dynamics, we find that a phase of long-range order (LRO) in neural activity may be induced by memory (time non-locality) without invoking criticality. The cortical dynamics model contains fast and slow time scales that govern the neural and resource (memory) dynamics, respectively. When the resource dynamics are sufficiently slow, we observe an LRO phase, which manifests in avalanche size and duration probability distributions that are fit well by power laws. When the slow and fast time scales are no longer sufficiently distinct, LRO is destroyed. Since this LRO phase spans a wide range of parameters, it is robust against perturbations, unlike critical systems.</description>

      <title>Multiscale Growth Kinetics of Model Biomolecular Condensates Under Passive and Active Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Living cells exhibit a complex organization comprising numerous compartments, among which are RNA- and protein-rich membraneless, liquid-like organelles known as biomolecular condensates. Energy-consuming processes regulate their formation and dissolution, with (de-)phosphorylation by specific enzymes being among the most commonly involved reactions. By employing a model system consisting of a phosphorylatable peptide and homopolymeric RNA, we elucidate how enzymatic activity modulates the growth kinetics and alters the local structure of biomolecular condensates. Under passive condition, time-resolved ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering with synchrotron source reveals a nucleation-driven coalescence mechanism maintained over four decades in time, similar to the coarsening of simple binary fluid mixtures. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations show that peptide-decorated RNA chains assembled shortly after mixing constitute the relevant subunits. In contrast, actively-formed condensates initially display a local mass fractal structure, which gradually matures upon enzymatic activity before condensates undergo coalescence. Both types of condensate eventually reach a steady state but fluorescence recovery after photobleaching indicates a peptide diffusivity twice higher in actively-formed condensates consistent with their loosely-packed local structure. We expect multiscale, integrative approaches implemented with model systems to link effectively the functional properties of membraneless organelles to their formation and dissolution kinetics as regulated by cellular active processes.</description>

      <title>Collective epithelial migration mediated by the unbinding of hexatic defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.12956v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective cell migration in epithelia relies on cell intercalation: a local remodelling of the cellular network that allows neighbouring cells to swap their positions. Unlike foams and passive cellular fluid, in epithelial intercalation these rearrangements crucially depend on activity. During these processes, the local geometry of the network and the contractile forces generated therein conspire to produce a burst of remodelling events, which collectively give rise to a vortical flow at the mesoscopic length scale. In this article we formulate a continuum theory of the mechanism driving this process, built upon recent advances towards understanding the hexatic (i.e. $6-$fold ordered) structure of epithelial layers. Using a combination of active hydrodynamics and cell-resolved numerical simulations, we demonstrate that cell intercalation takes place via the unbinding of topological defects, naturally initiated by fluctuations and whose late-times dynamics is governed by the interplay between passive attractive forces and active self-propulsion. Our approach sheds light on the structure of the cellular forces driving collective migration in epithelia and provides an explanation of the observed extensile activity of in vitro epithelial layers.</description>

      <title>Micro-swimmer collective dynamics in Brinkman flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18035v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Suspensions of swimming micro-organisms are known to undergo intricate collective dynamics as a result of hydrodynamic and collision interactions. Micro-swimmers, such as bacteria and micro-algae, naturally live and have evolved in complex habitats that include impurities, obstacles and interfaces. To elucidate their dynamics in a heterogeneous environment, we consider a continuum theory where the the micro-swimmers are embedded in a Brinkman wet porous medium, which models viscous flow with an additional resistance or friction due to the presence of smaller stationary obstacles. The conservation equation for the swimmer configurations includes advection and rotation by the immersing fluid, and is coupled to the viscous Brinkman fluid flow with an active stress due to the swimmers' motion in it. Resistance alters individual swimmer locomotion and the way it disturbs the surrounding fluid, and thus it alters its hydrodynamic interactions with others and and such affects collective dynamics.The entropy analysis and the linear stability analysis of the system of equations both reveal that resistance delays and hinders the onset and development of the collective swimming instabilities, and can completely suppress it if sufficiently large. Simulations of the full nonlinear system confirm these. We contrast the results with previous theoretical studies on micro-swimmers in homogeneous viscous flow, and discuss relevant experimental realizations.</description>
